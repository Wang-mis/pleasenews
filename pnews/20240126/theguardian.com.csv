“Honestly, I’m a very shy person,” Blanchard said in an interview airing on a Friday evening episode of the ABC News show 20/20, a preview clip of which was provided to Rolling Stone. “[But] honestly, I don’t think that I’m doing anything that anybody else wouldn’t do.”
Blanchard, 32, also spent some of the interview defending how she has been publicly boasting about the satisfaction she has received from her intimate life with her new husband, Ryan Anderson.
“Well, I’m newlywed,” Blanchard said when 20/20 anchor Deborah Roberts asked her about some of the details she had previously shared on social media, including that Anderson’s reproductive organ was “fire”. “I’m newly married and I just came out, so I’m living my best married life with my husband. I don’t think that’s any different than any other wife would.”
Blanchard’s remarks to 20/20 – which airs Friday at 9pm ET – provide the latest chapter to one of the US criminal justice system’s stranger sagas. The case dates back to the 2015 stabbing death of Clauddine “Dee Dee” Blanchard, who had forced her daughter to pretend to be seriously ill and then endure numerous unnecessary medical procedures.
Mental health experts have said Dee Dee Blanchard had the psychological disorder Munchausen syndrome by proxy, seen in parents or guardians who exaggerate or invent their children’s medical conditions to gain sympathy and support.
Dee Dee Blanchard forced her daughter to use a wheelchair as well as a feeding tube, neither of which she needed. And she also beat her daughter and chained her to a bed, investigators have said.
Eventually, Blanchard gave a knife to her boyfriend at the time – Nicholas Godejohn – and hid in a bathroom while he killed her mother.
Blanchard told the makers of the 2017 HBO documentary Mommy Dead and Dearest that she could hear her mother scream while she was slain.
“I heard her say my name a couple of times,” a teary-eyed Blanchard recounted on the film. “And she said, ‘Help me.’ And then there was just silence.”
Authorities later found Dee Dee Blanchard’s body in her bed as her daughter and Godejohn fled. After the couple were captured, a jury found Godejohn guilty of first-degree murder, and he was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.
Blanchard, meanwhile, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder as the details of her abuse propelled her case into the national media spotlight.
She was given 10 years in prison and was paroled in late December.
In her first TV interview after her release, Blanchard told ABC’s Good Morning America that she didn’t believe her mother was a monster because “she had a lot of demons herself that she was struggling with”. Yet Blanchard said she did believe murdering her mother “was the only way out” of her abuse.
Blanchard additionally began documenting some of her early days of freedom to about 12 million Instagram and TikTok users who were following her on those social media platforms at the time of her parole.
One of Blanchard’s posts which was particularly popular showed her posing in a mirror with a long ponytail pulled over her shoulder – which she dubbed her “first selfie of freedom”. Well-wishing commenters on that post included influencers with words of support such as, “Slay my girlie!!!”, “YES!” and “QUEEN”.
A substantial number of interactions also met a picture that she shared online of her husband, Anderson, whom she married in 2022 while still imprisoned. She captioned that photo, “A New Years Eve Eve kiss with my hubby,” before sharing images of her diamond wedding ring and French manicured nails that inspired supportive responses typically seen on the accounts of more mainstream pop culture celebrities.
As Rolling Stone noted, another of Blanchard’s viral moments saw her charging into the comments of a social media selfie that Anderson posted to defend her from trolls who were insulting him.
Blanchard wrote that the couple’s mutual love was all that mattered, and she accused critics of being envious.
“They [are] jealous because you are rocking my world every night,” Blanchard wrote. Invoking colloquialisms to refer to Anderson’s member and his sexual prowess, she added: “Yeah I said it, the D is fire.”"
01GBCN1V2K_JHRTZ5TBFQKYBZJ,Computers are not as reliable as many of us believe,_,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/22/computers-are-not-as-reliable-as-many-of-us-believe,"You published several letters arguing that computers themselves are reliable (Computers rarely go wrong, but computer systems often do, 17 January). The truth is somewhat less positive. While computer hardware is more reliable than most current software, data-corrupting flaws in hardware do exist, and more are found over time.
Some, such as rowhammer, become well known as security flaws, others become famous through recalls (like the Pentium FDIV fiasco), but most pass unnoticed by the general public and are quietly fixed or mitigated in microcode.
Research papers from Google (Cores That Don’t Count) and Facebook (Silent Data Corruptions at Scale), as well as a perusal of published errata documents, show that we should question very hard whether assuming a computer is reliable is a fit assumption for a criminal conviction, unless backed up by other evidence such as logs, audit trails and good evidence of internal self-checking within the software.Alan CoxSwansea

01K0PQR2F9_7KEZXIATSIZO0C6,Disney’s Frozen musical to close in the West End – but open in UK schools,Chris Wiegand,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/jan/22/disney-frozen-musical-to-close-in-the-west-end-but-open-in-uk-schools,"Since the summer of 2021 it has drawn waves of excited theatregoers wearing Elsa dresses – alongside the occasional Anna or Olaf costume – but the West End musical Frozen is to close later this year.
On Monday, Disney Theatrical Group announced that the stage adaptation of the animated blockbuster was being extended for the final time. The show will complete its run at London’s Theatre Royal Drury Lane on 8 September, having been seen by more than 2.8 million people. Its closure comes as a surprise: the show received five-star reviews, including from the Guardian, and was hailed by critics as the perfect introduction to theatre for children. A second sequel to the 2013 film is destined for cinemas, suggesting “Frozen fever” is far from over. The North American tour of the Broadway musical has been running since 2019.
Theatre Royal Drury Lane, owned and managed by Andrew Lloyd Webber’s group LW Theatres, has one of Theatreland’s biggest capacities, with almost 2,200 seats to fill. Dozens of seats are available for performances this month, although Disney’s long-runner The Lion King has a similar level of availability and, since the Covid-19 pandemic, audiences are booking for the theatre at shorter notice.
Frozen was one of many shows to delay its opening by several months because of Covid. It started its run at the theatre, which had a two-year, £60m refurbishment, in August 2021 with Samantha Barks and Stephanie McKeon as sisters Elsa and Anna respectively. Michael Grandage’s production, which has songs by Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez, has an elaborate set and costume design by Christopher Oram and a giant LED well for the state of the art video design by Finn Ross.
Grandage said Frozen has been one of his happiest theatre experiences. “Frozen opened in the UK on the heels of the pandemic, and it was glorious to welcome back audiences, many of whom were coming to the theatre for the first time. To introduce so many to the power of theatre and hopefully cultivate a lifelong love for it, has been an immense privilege.”
In its statement, Disney Theatrical Group said a competition would soon be launched for UK secondary schools to be permitted to put on their own Frozen production. The United Kingdom of Frozen: Love is an Open Door will “give one school in every region across the UK the chance to win the stage rights and be the first to present the full-length version of the show”."
0519E6LMN7_JY3AXOSQAST55R8,YouGov ‘met its obligations’ about funding of poll showing Sunak defeat,Eleni Courea,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/jan/25/yougov-called-on-to-confirm-who-commissioned-poll-on-rishi-sunak-defeat,"The British Polling Council (BPC) has said there is “no reasonto believe that YouGov have not met their obligations” after examining controversial polling used to call for Rishi Sunak’s ousting.
The two polls, which YouGov said were commissioned by a mysterious group of Tory rebels called the Conservative Britain Alliance, with the Tory peer David Frost acting as the intermediary, caused shock waves in Westminster when they were published in the Daily Telegraph last week.
The BPC examined the polls, one of which focused on migration, on Wednesday and Thursday before issuing a statement, which said: “There is no reason at present to believe that YouGov have not met their obligations under its rules.”
The main poll projected that the Conservatives were on track for a 1997-style defeat, but that the party could win if Sunak were replaced by a hypothetical Tory leader who cut taxes and immigration.
The findings were unveiled on the front page of the Telegraph alongside a piece by Lord Frost arguing Sunak’s current strategy was leading the party to annihilation. This week, the Tory MP Simon Clarke cited the poll’s findings in an article calling for Sunak to be ousted.
There have been questions about who commissioned the survey, which would have cost tens of thousands of pounds. The Conservative Britain Alliance is said to consist of a group of Tory donors.
The BPC discussed the controversy at its regular meeting on Wednesday and asked YouGov if it had documentation showing that the Conservative Britain Alliance was its client, according to one of its committee members.
Nick Moon, secretary of the BPC, said on Thursday morning: “Under the rules of the BPC, YouGov has to publish the details of the poll, including who their client was.
“They’ve said the client was the Conservative Britain Alliance. We’re just making sure that they were formally hired by this organisation.”
In the evening, the BPC issued a statement saying it was satisfied that the Conservative Britain Alliance was the client.
It read: “The BPC have been advised that this is the organisation that was responsible for commissioning the poll, and that therefore there is no reason at present to believe that YouGov have not met their obligations under its rules.”
Requesting further information about the Conservative Britain Alliance “lies beyond its remit”, the BPC said, but it added it was “alive to identifying any lessons for its work that may be thought to arise from this incident”.
YouGov said: “Over the past week, YouGov has sought guidance from the BPC and received assurances that we have followed the rules.”
The BPC is an industry group for polling companies that promotes transparency, but does not have any formal powers. Under its guidelines, clients do not have to be registered companies or have any formal status in order to commission polling. Pollsters do not need to specify who paid for the work.
“So long as [the Conservative Britain Alliance] were actually the client they’ve met the rules,” Moon said. “If I were to form the St Albans Walrus Protection Society, that body could go out and commission polls about walruses. Any polling company would be very happy to take my money.”
The saga has caused a headache for YouGov and has triggered calls for improved transparency around who pays for polling.
YouGov issued a clarification on Wednesday after heavy criticism of the section of the survey which asked voters to choose between Labour leader Keir Starmer and an imaginary Tory leader who cut taxes, immigration and NHS waiting times.
Rob Ford, a pollster and professor of political science at the University of Manchester, called it “one of the worst polling questions I’ve ever seen”."
06DN5VBD8P_B8GY7XMS82X5I1F,Kenya high court rules against plan to deploy hundreds of police to Haiti,Caroline Kimeu,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/26/kenya-high-court-rules-against-plan-deploy-hundreds-police-haiti-un,"Kenya’s high court has ruled against a government plan to deploy hundreds of police to Haiti to lead a UN-backed multinational mission to fight escalating gang violence in the Caribbean country.
Enock Chacha Mwita, the judge who issued the ruling, said: “Any decision by any state organ or state officer to deploy police officers to Haiti … contravenes the constitution and the law and is therefore unconstitutional, illegal and invalid.”
The UN security council gave the go-ahead in early October for the Kenya-led mission, which has faced criticism at home and a legal challenge filed at the Nairobi high court in Nairobi last year by the opposition Thirdway Alliance.
Constitutional lawyers and opposition parliamentarians had been critical of the way the government secured international approval for the mission before it obtained parliament’s backing.
The court’s ruling that the deployment was “illegal” did not turn on the major issues raised in the case, which lawyers said blind-sided both sides. The judge found that parliamentary approval was only required for military, and not police deployments, and that police could be deployed abroad.
It said, however, that for officers to be deployed, there needed to be a reciprocal arrangement with the host government, which the petitioners had argued – with no contest from the government – was not currently in place.
The judgment leaves the multinational mission in limbo and is also a setback for the Kenyan government, which had hoped to have police on the ground this month, and has said it will appeal.
On Thursday, Haiti’s foreign minister, Jean Victor Généus, pleaded for the deployment to be speeded up, telling the UN security council that violence in the country was as barbaric as in a war zone.
Haiti’s descent into chaos was sparked by the assassination of the country’s president, Jovenel Moïse, by Colombian mercenaries in July 2021, but gang violence and lawlessness in the Caribbean nation reached new, more desperate heights last year.
The number of people violently targeted by gangs surged by 122% in 2023, the UN’s special representative for Haiti, María Isabel Salvador, told the UN security council on Thursday as she emphasised the urgent need for foreign intervention. At least 4,789 people were killed and 2,490 were kidnapped, many having to sell their homes to make ransom payments to their captors.
The rampant violence and egregious human rights abuses now stretch far beyond the capital, Port-au-Prince, into the countryside, where a growing number of children are vulnerable to gang recruitment and women to sexual violence.
“I cannot over-stress the severity of the situation in Haiti, where multiple protracted crises have reached a critical point,” Salvador told the assembly in New York. New gangs continue to spring up across Haiti and a growing violent vigilante movement was also concerning observers, she added.
At least 350 people are estimated to have been killed by Bwa Kale – civilians who have taken up rifles and taken matters into their own hands as the police failed to protect them.
Haiti’s security forces are increasingly outgunned by the armed bandits who control most of Port-au-Prince. The national police have lost nearly 3,300 officers in the past three years, the force’s principal trade union said on Monday.
Almost nine in 10 of those officers were sacked for abandoning their posts, the Synapoha union’s general coordinator, Lionel Lazarre, said. Underpaid, and undertrained officers are running before they are killed by better paid and better-armed gang members, unions say.
The dwindling numbers of officers make it even more important that the foreign taskforce is tactically astute and numerous, said Diego Da Rin, a Haiti expert at Crisis Group. “If the gangs see the international mission as weak and poorly trained they might want to forge a unified front to fight them,” Da Rin said.
Salvador cautioned that the mission would only be successful if Haitians themselves were involved in the process of rebuilding their country. “Long-term stability can only be achieved through a nationally owned and inclusive political process,” she said.
Given Haiti’s checkered record of foreign intervention – which includes sexual abuse by peacekeepers and the introduction of cholera into the country – several speakers told the UN that extra care must be taken to prevent history repeating itself.
The Kenyan deployment has faced pushback since it was proposed last year. Rights groups expressed concerns about the Kenyan police force’s poor human rights record, and observers questioned its suitability and preparedness to tackle security threats such as gun violence by sophisticated criminal gangs.
Kenya’s interests in leading the mission remain unclear. Observers have speculated that it is part of the current administration’s attempts to build the east African nation’s international profile, while others see its involvement as a proxy for its western ally, the US. Kenya also stands to make some financial gain from the mission, to which the US has pledged $100m (£79m) in intelligence, logistical and medical support."
07Q1ICA1M3_MFAYIAGW4URD9AL,Bank of America sends warning letters to employees not going into offices,Lauren Aratani,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/jan/24/bank-of-america-warning-letters-return-to-offices,"Bank of America is cracking down on employees who aren’t following its return-to-office mandate, sending “letters of education” warnings of disciplinary action to employees who have been staying home.
Some employees at the bank received letters that said they had failed to meet the company’s “workplace excellence guidelines” despite “requests and reminders to do so”, according to the Financial Times. The letter warned employees that failure to follow return-to-office expectations could lead to “further disciplinary action”.
The bank is the latest company to signal to employees that going into the office is mandatory. Companies from Citigroup and Meta have been tracking whether employees have been going into the office, usually with a hybrid policy of three days in the office and two days at home, with similar warnings of discipline if employees don’t show up.
It’s a major shift nearly four years after the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, when nearly all office workers worked remotely five days a week. Wall Street companies were some of the first to bring employees back into the office in 2021, and most have some sort of office requirement in place. Along with Bank of America and Citigroup, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and Barclays all have three-day office requirements.
While the push to get workers back to the office may seem aggressive after years of work flexibility, most companies are still allowing employees to work some days at home – a major shift in remote work compared to pre-pandemic times. Before the pandemic, 3% of all American workers were remote at least part of the week. Now, it’s about a quarter of workers, according to Goldman Sachs, one of the only major companies requiring its workers to work full-time in the office. Goldman Sachs has noted that the pandemic brought on key structural changes that allow for hybrid work policies, particularly better technology.
For many workers, their hybrid policies are likely to stay. A new survey of American CEOs found that only six of 158 said they will prioritize bringing workers back to the office full-time in 2024. Another survey from Deloitte in November found 65% of chief financial officers surveyed said they will keep hybrid policies in place this year.
Meanwhile, as much as managers like to think that their employees would rather stay home, some surveys have shown workers like to be in the office and would want to spend at least part of the week at their desks.
However, wanting to be back at the office is different from being forced back – the latter leads to lower job satisfaction without actually helping a company’s performance, according to new research.

Even as companies and workers tussle over return-to-office policies, work from home researchers are adamant that hybrid policies are here to stay and the five-day work week as we knew it is dead.
“Today’s new companies have nearly twice as many days worked from home as those founded 20 years ago,” wrote Stanford professor and remote work researcher Nick Bloom in November. “In 10 years, expect to see leading chief executives and entrepreneurs actively embracing hybrid work rather than begging employees to return to the office.”"
07ZLWTL7CU_PM0PXGI1CATO6FZ,UK suspends trade talks with Canada after claims ‘progress is not being made’,Jamie Grierson,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/26/uk-suspends-trade-talks-canada-no-progress-details-agriculture-markets,"The UK has halted trade talks with Canada, with discussions breaking down after a disagreement over beef and cheese.
The two countries have been negotiating for the past two years in the wake of Britain leaving the European Union, with trade continuing under the same deal brokered when the UK was a member of the bloc.
A UK government spokesperson said: “We have always said we will only negotiate trade deals that deliver for the British people. And we reserve the right to pause negotiations with any country if progress is not being made.
“We remain open to restarting talks with Canada in the future to build a stronger trading relationship that benefits businesses and consumers on both sides of the Atlantic.”
The talks, which started in March 2022, are among a number of negotiations Britain has launched around the world after its decision to leave the European Union, which excluded it from existing EU free trade deals.
The previous agreement had allowed the UK to continue to sell cars and cheese in Canada without it charging import tax. However, Canada’s government has been facing pressure from the beef industry and domestic cheesemakers.
The UK had been trading with Canada on terms that largely replicated the arrangements in place from the UK’s time in the EU.
A spokesperson for the Canadian trade minister, Mary Ng, said: “We are disappointed that negotiations with the UK are being paused. Their decision to continue to maintain market access barriers for our agriculture industry and unwillingness to reach a mutual agreement has only stalled negotiations.”
Ng has contacted the British business minister, Kemi Badenoch, to express Canada’s disappointment, the spokesperson added.
Before Britain left the EU at the end of 2020, Canada rolled over existing trade arrangements to ensure free trade could continue.
One arrangement dealing with cheese access has expired and a Canadian government official blamed Britain for the lack of an extension deal.
“Unfortunately, Britain did not act as fast as it should have in negotiations, and expects Canada to just give [it] these things,” an official told the Reuters news agency.
Both sides said they were ready to resume talks. According to official British data, total bilateral trade in goods and services was £25.9bn in the year ending 30 June 2023, when Canada was Britain’s 18th largest trading partner.
A farmers’ leader said it was essential that hormone-treated beef was not allowed into Britain.
Minette Batters, the president of the National Farmers’ Union of England and Wales, said the stopping of the trade talks was “a relief for farmers”.
She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “This has been going on for a long time and it is about enhancing the trading relationship between the UK and Canada.
“Trade on agricultural products is always the first thing to be discussed and the last thing to be agreed. I am pleased the government has stuck to its line and not given way.”
Batters told the programme: “Canada has used cheese as a sort of negotiating lever. We lost market access at the end of 2023 and then they put it into these enhanced discussions.”
She added: “The prime minister put it in writing last year that he would not be importing hormone-treated beef or chlorine washed chicken.
“Canada has played hardball for a long time. It was always going to come to a crunch point as to who was going to capitulate.”
According to Canadian data, bilateral trade with Britain in 2022 accounted for 2.7% of its total.
Jonathan Reynolds MP, Labour’s shadow business and trade secretary, said: “This is very concerning news and another significant failure from the Conservatives to honour their promises. Rather than strengthening our trading position post-Brexit, these failures have left us in a weaker position, particularly for the automotive sector.”
“This is another blow to the British economy because of Conservative incompetence. It is clear that they are unable to deliver what we need to get our economy growing.
“Labour would pursue a proper trade strategy, focusing on the UK’s strengths and working to ensure trade supports our industrial and foreign policy objectives while protecting our high standards.”"
0FLHAK5QTF_SUXEVEEZGIHCDON,Not black and white: are crossword puzzles really good for your brain?,Madeleine Aggeler,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/jan/22/are-crossword-puzzles-good-for-brain,"The first crossword puzzle – or “word-cross puzzle”, as it was called at the time – was a diamond-shaped grid designed by Arthur Wynne and published in the newspaper New York World in December 1913. Its clues ranged from simple (three-letter word for “the plural of is”) to niche (three-letter word for “the fibre of the gomuti palm”). At the top of the puzzle, to help participants along, was the word FUN.
Ever since, puzzlers and scientists have speculated about whether the mental gymnastics that go into solving a crossword puzzle count as exercise for our brains. We talked to experts about whether doing crossword puzzles actually helps brain function, and what else you can do to keep your mind in shape.
A little over a year ago, media outlets excitedly reported on a paper published in the scientific journal NEJM Evidence that looked at older adults with mild cognitive impairment – patients who experience some forgetfulness but are still functioning in their day-to-day lives – and found that those who did online crossword puzzles maintained better cognitive function than those who played online cognitive exercise games.
Does this mean that in the interest of brain health, we should all be downloading crossword apps and start racking our brains for the second-longest river in Europe?
“It’s too soon to say that,” says Dr Davangere P Devanand, the author of the NEJM Evidence study, and professor of psychiatry and neurology and director of brain ageing and mental health at Columbia University Irving Medical Center.
The study measured participants’ cognitive function using the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive Subscale (Adas-Cog) test, and Devanand noted that those who did crossword puzzles maintained their scores or improved slightly on some measurements, while those who did the brain games generally saw their scores decline.
What was especially promising, though, Devanand says, is that those who did crossword puzzles also saw some improvement in what researchers call “instrumental activities of daily living” – activities that tend to come up more in one’s day-to-day life than hyper-specific medical tests, such as managing finances and remembering to take medication.
“If your cognitive performance improves on a test but other things don’t improve, that [treatment] may not have much practical value,” he says. “But it’s all quite preliminary. We need to examine it more carefully in a bigger study.”
This is not the only study to suggest crossword puzzles can help brain function. In a 2011 study of people in preclinical stages of dementia, Dr Jagan Pillai, staff neurologist at the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health, found that doing crossword puzzles delayed the onset of accelerated memory decline by 2.54 years. Still, he added that while some studies have found an “association” between crossword puzzling and cognitive function, the sample sizes were small, and larger clinical intervention trials are needed for more conclusive findings.
One reason experts suspect that crosswords might help maintain brain function is that they require complex thinking.
“When we do a crossword puzzle, it’s a test of memory, knowledge and verbal ability,” says Devanand.
Beyond that, Pillai says, “there is a hypothesis that [doing crossword puzzles] improves working memory or one’s ability to keep multiple things in mind at the same time.” This improved memory reserve, the thinking goes, could compensate for some of the losses in cognitive function caused by the onset of dementia.
But it’s hard to say for sure whether crosswords “strengthen” the brain, because the brain isn’t a muscle and its function doesn’t improve in the same way muscle function does. Doing dumbbell curls will strengthen biceps and the muscles around them, but in the brain, “everything interacts with everything all the time,” Devanand explains. Our memory functions and verbal functions, for example, are always interacting. “Whenever we target one cognitive function, it’s almost impossible to target only that function,” he says. In other words, one repeated, isolated exercise – such as crossword puzzling – isn’t enough to make our memory bulging and strong.

If you hate crosswords, though, they won’t be much help to you in any case.
“If you don’t really enjoy doing crossword puzzles, then you’re less likely to benefit at all,” says Dr Lori Cook, director of clinical research at the Center for BrainHealth in Dallas. “Your brain needs to be actively motivated and engaged to get the most out of it.”
Luckily, there are other things you can do to keep your brain in shape.
Cook notes that in addition to being infinitely complex, the human brain is also unique and dynamic, meaning that no two people’s brains are the same, and a person’s brain doesn’t stay the same throughout their life. As such, she says, “there is no one-size-fits-all approach to preventing decline as we age.”
Generally speaking, engaging in a variety of activities that stimulate the brain in different ways is helpful. Pillai suggests reading, playing board games, playing musical instruments and dancing.
Experts add that caring for our brain involves caring for our body. “What is good for the heart is good for the brain,” says Devanand. Cook encourages a holistic approach to brain health that incorporates “quality sleep, nutrition and physical activity”, as well as “maintaining emotional balance in our daily demands”.
They also underscored the importance of community and social interactions. Devavand noted that people who are more isolated and have fewer social connections tend to have worse cognitive functioning as they age. Social interactions are not just important for our sense of belonging, he points out, but because they are complex situations for the brain to navigate. “When we socialize, many things are happening in terms of communication, brain function and just general awareness of the world around you. You learn things,” he says.
And if you want to socialize over a crossword puzzle, all the better."

But the highlight is the Hasapika pan – handmade pasta in a decadent tomato broth overloaded with crayfish, mussels and shrimp. It can serve three, but two of us fought for every last scrap, wiping the pan with warm, olive oil-soaked bread. My Italian friend declared it some of the best pasta he had ever tasted.

At Obor market, a couple of miles north-west of Bucharest’s old town, Terasa Obor is an outdoor barbecue spot famous for its mici (pronounced “meech” and also known as mititei). Literally “small ones”, these are small meat rolls made from beef or lamb, similar to koftas, and a popular street food in Romania, with variations of the dish popular across the Balkans. At the centre of a bustling market, this is a prime spot for people watching and a favourite with the locals. Mici are five lei each (just less than £1), with fresh bread one lei, and are served with mustard.Josh Rault
The food at the Crab Hut, a cabin-turned-food-stall that sits quietly in the marshes of Brancaster Staithe, is as simple as it gets – small bowls of whelks (£2), cockles (£2.50), and crayfish (£3), and generous rolls stuffed with local crab (£4.50). There’s an honesty and a brightness in each bite, and yet a certain brine that makes you feel as though you’re tasting the north Norfolk landscape. There’s no indoor seating. I recommend you either grab a nearby picnic bench or walk through the marshes and on to the sand dunes. Tiéphaine

A soft, warm Valencian evening is rounded off perfectly and inexpensively by time spent in a small Sicilian, punk-inspired bar in Cabanyal: the Officina Meccanica Work in Progress. The magic mushroom burrata might as well be hallucinogenic, as the creamy richness is perfectly accompanied by the rosemary-infused melting mushrooms. A bowl of fresh panelle (Sicilian fritters made from chickpea flour and other ingredients) adds the exact amount of crunch to balance the flavours, which are further perfected with a glass of crisp Insolia (Sicilian white wine). The meal blends with the easy ambience to induce a sense of wellbeing that will resonate for months to come.Jane
During a recent trip to Iceland, after a long drive on the icy roads, we reached the village of Vík í Mýrdal on Route 1, close to the island’s southernmost point and home to the beautiful Reynisfjara black sand basalt beach. (The village is about 120 miles east of the currently active volcano zone around Grindavík). Here we discovered the amazing Soup Company. The menu is simple: there are soups to choose from – with free refill – and bread and butter. We had the appropriately named lava soup, a spicy red soup (main ingredients beef, black beans, red wine, onion, tomatoes, bay leaves and red lentils) served in a black bread bowl, with yoghurt on the side. It was as tasty as it was photogenic. Each spoonful revealed a harmonious combination of flavours, creating a culinary experience that resonated with the imposing landscapes.Gabriel
Kraków was beautiful but austerely cold when we visited in January last year. Fugitives from the icy wind, we stole down an alley in the town’s historic heart to No Bones, a vegan restaurant three minutes’ walk from the main square. For the equivalent of £6.50, we ordered a platter of slippery pierogi, each dumpling delicate but substantial, each one a peppery umami parcel of cabbage and mushroom. Restored and warmed, we headed out again into the Polish winter to explore further. A perfect and delicious lunch should you find yourself in Kraków, particularly when the wind is blowing and the snow crunches underfoot. Phoebe

Tucked under the battlements of a medieval fort, above a rocky seashore, Santiago Beach Bar in Funchal is no place to expect “Oh my God that’s good” food … especially outside, in a storm. But, order a tuna bolo after a local beer, or three (just so you don’t feel you’re hogging the table, and the view) and what do you get? You get thinly cut, seared, tuna steak, as fresh as the wild sea you’re mesmerised by. You get a picture in your mind, a taste in your mouth, a memory you will always treasure.Simon
Spaghetti all’assassina, also known as spaghetti bruciati (burnt spaghetti), was the most amazing pasta we had in Bari; you can order it in most restaurants but we first had it off Via Massaua in the docks. It gets specially made to order. This is perhaps the most famous traditional dish in Puglia and has been featured on TV programmes such as Gino’s Italy: Secrets of the South. It also features in the Lolita Lobosco detective novels by Gabriella Genisi – the fifth book in the series was simply called Spaghetti all’Assassina – and the accompanying TV drama. The secret is in the tomato sauce and also in the preparation that simmers some of it to a crisp, partly burned spaghetti. Being very spicy, one taste explodes like a moon rocket booster to leave you gasping for air. People came up to see how we got on with it – we found the people of Bari to be so friendly!David Innes-Wilkin
On my most recent trip to Berlin, I found my favourite restaurant yet, Der blaue Fuchs (The Blue Fox), a Georgian restaurant with arty walls, patterned tablecloths and outdoor tables overlooking the green Kollwitzplatz on Knaackstraße. This vegan-friendly place serves home-cooked Georgian classics like the iconic, boat-shaped khachapuri (cheese-filled bread). We had an appetiser platter with grilled aubergine and vegetable spreads flavoured with walnuts, pomegranate and regional herbs, including blue fenugreek, so distinctive and unique to Georgian cuisine. We then enjoyed warming bean stews in earthenware pots, washed down with Georgian wine from among the oldest wine traditions in the world. Adrienne
A queue is a good sign. A queue in Rome for pizza in the rain? Worth the wait. L’Antico Forno Roscioli on Via dei Chiavari is the pizza joint to end all pizza joints. When you get in, fresh bread and pastry greet you on the left, before a counter of contorni tempts you. A wooden board filled with pizza options (thin and focaccia crusts) is your final stop. If they have porchetta (slow-roasted pork belly roll), get it. The potato and rosemary flatbread (no sauce) was exquisite, and the suppli (think svelte arancini) best in class. Be prepared to eat standing outside, whatever the weather. Caroline Glendenning"

0JD7J9IEEA_W4BX2DSVGYQQ3V4,Guz Khan review – Man Like Mobeen star relishes the outrageous,Brian Logan,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/jan/25/guz-khan-man-like-mobeen-review-eventim-apollo-london,"In a world where big-name comics prep their tours months, nay years, in advance, then perform them over just as long a period, topicality is at a premium. Props to Guz Khan, then, whose closing routine addresses the Daily Mail’s recent objection to his stance on Israel/Palestine. It’s an outlier, mind you: the Man Like Mobeen star’s set is more about his private than public life, a tale of parenthood before and after he hit the big time, and of the delinquent tendencies he just can’t suppress in his new role as a respectable father.
That role has come about because Khan has travelled a long way – economically if not geographically – from his working-class youth. The pose struck here, of boy-done-good not quite habituated to his elevated new life (his pampered kids; the Hogwarts-like school his “babygirl” attends), isn’t a novel one, but the Coventry man wears it well. His relish for the outrageous is palpable as he stares at us with those pop eyes, relating an encounter with the Kurdish “uncle” who taught his kids the laws of the urban jungle, or – in the show’s central routine – beaming with illicit pride at his daughter’s violent vanquishing of two school bullies.
This badass daughter, her gormless brother “Lispy” and Khan’s unimpressed wife are the dramatis personae of a show stronger on storytelling than finely crafted jokes, and which our host tells us is all about honesty. I’m not sure it is: nothing feels particularly close to the bone. When the 38-year-old admits to being “two per cent racist”, it’s just to cue a gag about funny accents. Khan seems blindsided, meanwhile, when a question to his audience about their own racism doesn’t elicit the response he quite expected.
The closing section on his brush with the tabloids brings the gig closer to thin ice than anything else – but Khan doesn’t develop his thinking on the incident, raising it mainly to end proceedings on a rallying cry for Palestine. Fair enough. He’s earned the right to a soapbox by then, with a boisterous and endearing hour about this ex-reprobate’s bid to become a responsible dad.

Queensland emergency services are planning to respond to two disasters: cyclonic winds, followed by flooding rain and tides, according to authorities.
Current tracking maps show it mostly likely to hit around Townsville, between Cardwell and Airlie Beach on Thursday, though it could happen as a weaker storm as early as tonight.

Bureau of Meteorology forecaster Miriam Bradbury said residents should expect a range of “widespread, severe impacts”.
“Gales with damaging wind gusts up to 120km/h may develop about the Whitsunday Islands from as early as Wednesday evening and extend to mainland communities between Townsville and St Lawrence overnight Wednesday or Thursday morning,” she said.
“We also have the risk of destructive wind gusts of up to 150km/h.
“Another risk with these systems is the flooding. So that can occur from storm tide, as well as heavy rainfall that comes with these systems.”
Bradbury said the storm’s likely intensity was downgraded overnight, but “at this stage, the most likely scenario is still a category three”.
“This could be a very widespread as well as a very long duration event.”
Another challenge will be the sheer amount of the state affected by the storm. The system is expected to continue moving as a low for several more days after making landfall, bringing flooding rains across central and south-east Queensland over the weekend.
The state disaster coordinator deputy commissioner, Shane Chelepy, said they are “effectively planning for two events” – cyclone and flooding.
Emergency services are already deploying across the state to the likely points of need, including Palm Island and Ayr.
But many of them have been working since before Christmas, after tropical cyclone Jasper inundated communities north of Cairns in December. Others worked during bushfires at Stanthorpe and Tara earlier in the year, or during a tornado at the Gold Coast in December.
The Queensland premier, Steven Miles, is heading to far north Queensland on Tuesday to tour the communities affected by previous natural disasters.
Miles said he has already alerted the federal emergency management minister, Murray Watt, that Queensland is likely to need additional support from the Commonwealth, due to the expected large size of the event.
“We’ve already initiated conversations with NEMA, so the counterpart at a federal level to see what kind of federal support could be provided,” the emergency services minister for disaster recovery, Nikki Boyd, said.
“We’re very conscious of the fact that we’ve asked a lot of our emergency services over the last few weeks, I was up in Cairns only last week, where we had rural fire volunteers who were returning from the far north.”
Ergon Energy urged north Queenslanders to be prepared to lose power even before the storm makes landfall.
Northern general manager Chris Hooper said storms surges and flooding can knock out underground power lines, and winds and debris take down above ground transmission systems.
“Think about how your household can function without power for a week or more and get your storm kit ready, especially if you rely on powered medical equipment,” he said.
He said Ergon crews would be ready to roll as soon as weather conditions allowed but flooding was likely to impede access to some sites and delay damage assessment, network repairs and power restoration."
0JRMSM46M8_HFVX0YH522J08T6,Australia sanctions Russian citizen Aleksandr Ermakov over 2022 Medibank cyber-attack,Daniel Hurst,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/23/medibank-cyber-attack-update-australia-sanctions-russian-aleksandr-gennadievich-ermakov,"Australia has used its new cyber sanctions powers for the first time against a Russian citizen, Aleksandr Ermakov, in connection with the Medibank Private data breach.
Magnitsky-style sanctions laws that were introduced in Australia in late 2021 include a world-leading measure to allow the imposition of Australian travel bans and asset freezes on those allegedly involved in “significant” cyber-attacks.
Australia, like numerous countries, have adopted sanctions laws named after the late corruption whistleblower Sergei Magnitsky. These measures generally target individuals alleged to be linked to serious corruption or violations of human rights. But Australia’s laws also allow sanctions to punish allegedly malicious cyber activity.
The Australian government announced on Tuesday that it was imposing sanctions under the new law on Russian citizen Aleksandr Gennadievich Ermakov, 33.
In a statement, the government said police and intelligence agencies had worked with international partners to link Ermakov “to the compromise of the Medibank Private network” in 2022.
It said this decision “makes it a criminal offence, punishable by up to 10 years’ imprisonment and heavy fines, to provide assets to Aleksandr Ermakov, or to use or deal with his assets, including through cryptocurrency wallets or ransomware payments”.

About 9.7 million customer records were taken in the Medibank Private data breach, including dates of birth and Medicare numbers.
The records included sensitive medical information such as procedures claimed by policyholders related to the termination of pregnancy and miscarriages. Some records were published on the dark web.
The Australian federal police commissioner, Reece Kershaw, had previously said he was in possession of intelligence that hackers in Russia were allegedly responsible for the Medibank data breach.
The sanctions decision was signed by the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, on Monday. The sanctions notice said Ermakov, born in Russia on 16 May 1990, was also known as Alexander Ermakov, GustaveDore, aiiis_ermak, blade_runner or JimJones.
“This listing demonstrates Australia’s ongoing commitment to deterring and responding robustly to malicious and significant cyber incidents,” said an explanatory statement attached to the sanctions notice.
“The listing acts in our national interest to impose costs on, influence and deter those responsible for malicious cyber activity.”
At a media conference in Canberra on Tuesday, officials responded to questions about what practical impact the cyber sanctions would have on the alleged hacker.
The head of the Australian Cyber Security Centre at the Australian Signals Directorate, Abigail Bradshaw, said: “We know a lot about Mr Ermakov through our analysis ... [Anonymity] is a selling quality, and so naming [him] and identifying [him] with the confidence that we have from our technical analysis will, most certainly, do harm to Mr Ermakov’s cyber business.”

The deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, said Australia was the first to name Ermakov globally and this would have a “very significant impact” on him.
“The Australian Signals Directorate and the Australian federal police have worked tirelessly over the past 18 months to unmask those [allegedly] responsible for the cyber-attack on Medibank Private and to ensure Australians are protected from malicious cyber activity,” Marles said.
Wong said the government expected the sanctions measure would have “financial consequences” for Ermakov.
The minister for home affairs, Clare O’Neil, also issued “strong advice” to businesses not to pay ransoms to alleged cyber criminals, saying this did not guarantee sensitive data would be recovered but “makes Australia a more attractive target for criminal groups”.
The Coalition’s home affairs spokesperson, James Paterson, who called for the cyber sanctions to be used against the Medibank hackers in late 2022, welcomed the move but said it was “not clear why it’s taken so long”.
“This is a challenging issue. We cannot just click our fingers and make this go away,” Paterson told Sky News on Tuesday.
“If countries around the world who are like-minded help shape these norms by putting a cost on this behaviour, it won’t guarantee that it stops but it does make it less likely than if we do nothing.”
Prof Nigel Phair, a cybersecurity expert from Monash University, said attribution of cyber criminals was difficult.
“While it most likely won’t result in the arrest of this individual (or probably any others), it puts sand in the gears of [alleged] cyber criminals by degrading their efforts to work with others in future criminal pursuits,” Phair said."
0KFICH1IJJ_SH6VELMUX898E6C,"‘Horrifying numbers’ of women and girls will die because of UK aid cuts, say MPs",Kaamil Ahmed,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/jan/25/horrifying-numbers-of-women-and-girls-will-die-because-of-uk-aid-cuts-say-mps,"British aid cuts have had a “devastating” effect on women and girls around the world, forcing sexual and reproductive health programmes to be cancelled, according to a new cross-party report by MPs.
The Commons international development select committee (IDC) said plummeting aid spending since 2020 had cost lives and endangered many more pregnant women, while abruptly cutting funding, often in mid-programme, had damaged relationships with partner organisations.
Nearly 300,000 women died during pregnancy and childbirth globally in 2020, according to the parliamentary committee, which said aid should be used to combat this problem, especially in sub-Saharan Africa where 70% of the deaths happened. It also said 2.4 million children died in their first year – most of them in sub-Saharan Africa or central and southern Asia.
Sarah Champion, the IDC chair, said: “A girl in South Sudan is more likely to die in childbirth than to finish secondary school. Even here in the UK maternal deaths are at their highest level in 20 years, but almost 95% of maternal deaths globally are in poorer countries.”
An analysis of the potential impact of government policy on disadvantaged groups, known as an equality impact assessment, presented to the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office in July 2023, warned that the cuts could mean nearly 200,000 more unsafe abortions were performed in Africa.
Champion, the Labour MP for Rotherham, said: “Last year’s equalities impact assessment from the FCDO showed the horrifying numbers of women and girls, thousands upon thousands, who will once again face unsafe abortions and who will die in pregnancy or childbirth as a direct result of the UK’s slashed aid spending.
“It is no good the new foreign secretary coming into parliament and declaring that the UK is still a global aid superpower when we are failing on funding commitments, failing to set or achieve meaningful targets on sexual and reproductive health and rights – failing women, girls and marginalised groups the world over,” she said.
The UK cut its official development assistance (ODA) from £11.7bn in 2019 to £7.6bn in 2022. Funding for sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) was cut by a third.
MSI Reproductive Choices, which provides contraception and safe abortion services, said it experienced a 79% cut in funding from the FCDO between 2019-20 and 2023-24 for its women’s integrated sexual health programmes.
The UN population agency, UNFPA, had its funding for contraceptives and reproductive health supplies cut by 85% in 2021.

The Commons committee called for the department to compensate for the damage that previous aid cuts had done by setting a minimum percentage spend of ODA on reproductive health. Programmes should be funded for at least five years to ensure stability, it added.
The report acknowledged that the government did increase its funding for several humanitarian crises in reaction to the equalities assessment, but did not say how much would be spent on SRHR.
On Monday, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development confirmed that an all-time high in aid spending in 2022 was mostly due to increased in-country costs to support refugees and to support the Ukraine war. The UK spent 29%, or $4.54bn (£3.64bn), of its total aid budget on refugees in 2022, more than any other OECD member.
Halima Begum, chief executive of ActionAid UK, said a rethink was needed. “[Aid spending] is being more and more aligned to national strategic priorities of Britain rather than of [recipient] countries,” she said.
“It should not be focused on the needs of our government. The money spent on ODA should be spent on the needs of other countries,” Begum said. “We need to cast the net widely and look back to spending ODA funds on global inequality and growing levels of poverty.”
The FCDO said the government’s international development white paper, published last year, reiterated the UK’s “commitment to deploy policy and investment to defend strongly and to advance sexual and reproductive health and rights, including safe abortion”.
“The UK has long been proud to defend and promote universal and comprehensive sexual and reproductive health and rights and our support for the global financing facility for women, children and adolescents has helped hundreds of millions of individuals in over 35 countries to access vital services,” said a spokesperson.
Between 2025 and 2030, the UK has pledged £80m to the financing facility, a global partnership that fights poverty by advancing the health and rights of women, children and adolescents."
0KWZHXIRPB_G4S3YZ2WX8BCC31,The ICJ ruling is a repudiation of Israel and its western backers,Kenneth Roth,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/26/icj-ruling-israel-western-backers,"The international court of justice’s (ICJ) ruling in South Africa’s genocide case was a powerful repudiation of Israel’s denialism. By an overwhelming majority, the court found a “plausible” case that provisional measures were needed to avoid “irreparable prejudice” from further Israeli acts in Gaza that could jeopardize Palestinian rights under the genocide convention.
The public posture of various Israeli officials was, in essence: how dare anyone accuse us of genocide. After all, they pointed out, Israel was founded after the Holocaust to protect the Jewish people from genocide, Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, and many of Hamas’s statements seem genocidal in intent.
Yet none of that is a defense to the charge of genocide. Regardless of Israel’s history, regardless of its claim of self-defense, the means chosen to fight Hamas can still be genocidal. The court found enough merit in that claim to recognize that Palestinian civilians need the court’s protection.
The court’s ruling was also a repudiation of Israel’s western backers. The Biden administration had called the suit “meritless”. The British government said it was “nonsense”. By a vote of 15 to 2, the ICJ judges found otherwise.
On the need to allow humanitarian aid to a starving population in Gaza and to prevent and punish the incitement of genocide, even the respected Israeli judge, Aharon Barak, joined the majority, making the vote 16 to 1 – a powerful repudiation of those who try to chalk up challenges to Israel’s conduct in Gaza as an unfair double standard or antisemitism.
In compelling detail, the court recounted the extraordinary suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza as they are bombed and besieged by Israeli forces. Transcending the contrasting visions presented by the Israeli and South African lawyers, the court relied on statements by UN officials to describe the appalling deaths, injuries, displacement, starvation, deprivation of healthcare and trauma. The suffering could get a whole lot worse, the court noted, if it did not intervene.
The court’s brief ruling did not delve too far into the factual disputes, but it implicitly rejected key elements of the Israeli defense. The Israeli lawyers had emphasized that Hamas uses human shields and fights from populated areas, but the court implicitly found those facts insufficient to justify the massive loss of civilian life caused by such practices as dropping huge 2,000lb bombs in heavily populated areas.
The Israeli lawyers had stressed that Israel is allowing humanitarian aid into Gaza, but UN officials were unequivocal in describing how the drips and drabs of aid allowed, and the bureaucratic obstacles mounted to its delivery, had left the civilian population on the brink of catastrophe.
The lawyers noted that in many instances Israeli forces have acted to protect Palestinian civilian life, but genocide can be committed against only part of a population. The Israeli government may have been causing just enough devastation to force Palestinians out of Gaza, as several ministers have suggested.
One of the most powerful parts of the South African case had been its citation of the statements of senior Israeli officials to show genocidal intent. The Israel government had tried to explain those statements away by suggesting they were made in the heat of the moment and were contradicted by formal secret orders from the Israeli cabinet that it had delivered to the court.
The court was unpersuaded, citing the statement of Defense Minister Yoav Gallant – a central figure in the chain of command – that he had “released all restraints” and that Israel was fighting “human animals”. The court also cited President Issac Herzog’s statement: “It is an entire nation out there that is responsible. It is not true this rhetoric about civilians not being aware, not involved.”
The current proceedings were not about the ultimate merits of the case. It could take years to determine whether Israel has committed genocide in Gaza. But the provisional measures ordered by the court could make an enormous difference in curbing the death and suffering of Palestinian civilians now.
The key will be enforcement. The ICJ ruling is “binding”, as the court stressed, but the ICJ has no military or police force at its disposal. For coercive measures, it would need a resolution of the UN security council, which requires contending with the US government’s veto, so often deployed to protect Israel.
But the political pressure to comply with the ruling will be enormous. Having trusted the court to send its lawyers to The Hague to present its case, Israel would look horrible to reject the court just because it lost. In calling the underlying genocide charges “outrageous” – a finding that, as mentioned, the court did not yet address – the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, notably did not say he would refuse to comply with the court’s provisional measures. Let’s hope he will.
Some were disappointed that the ICJ did not order a ceasefire, a step that was unlikely because the court addresses only disputes between states, so Hamas was not a party. A ceasefire imposed on only one side to an ongoing armed conflict is not plausible.
The court did order Israel to “take all measures within its power” to halt acts that contribute to genocide, to allow sufficient humanitarian aid into Gaza to end the suffering among Palestinian civilians, and to prevent and punish the public statements of incitement made by senior Israeli officials. Israel must report back to the court in a month on the steps it has taken.
Yet there is a lot of wiggle room in those orders. That’s where Israel’s supporters come in. Will they move past their earlier skepticism toward the case and now urge Israel to comply? Western governments backed the ICJ in similar rulings against Myanmar, Russia and Syria. It would do enormous damage to the “rules-based order” that Western governments claim to uphold if they were to make an exception for Israel.
Joe Biden holds the most powerful leverage. The US government provides $3.8bn in annual military aid to Israel and is its principal arms supplier. That support should stop if the Israeli government ignores the court’s ruling. The US president should no longer put his fear of domestic political consequences, or his personal identification with Israel, before the lives of so many Palestinian civilians.
Other pressure for compliance could come from the international criminal court. Unlike the ICJ, which resolves disputes between states, the ICC prosecutes individuals for such crimes as genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. Better behavior now is no defense for crimes already committed, but if Israel were to ignore the ICJ ruling, that would be an added spur for the ICC prosecutor, Karim Khan, to act.
Much is still unresolved, but today is a win for the rule of law. South Africa, a nation of the global south, was able to transcend power politics by invoking the world’s leading judicial institution. The court’s ruling shows that even governments with powerful friends can be held to account. That provides hope for the profoundly suffering Palestinian civilians of Gaza. It is also a small but important step toward a more lawful, rights-respecting world.

0NLZMAUWME_ZCYFX9QKJCK83V6,Just two northern white rhinos remain. The species’ first IVF pregnancy could save them from extinction,Patrick Greenfield,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/24/just-two-northern-white-rhinos-remain-an-ivf-breakthrough-could-save-them-from-extinction-aoe,"The critically endangered northern white rhino could be saved from the brink of extinction after scientists performed the first successful embryo transfer in white rhinos.
After the last male northern white rhino, Sudan, died in 2018, the disappearance of the species looked imminent. Just two infertile female northern white rhinos – Fatu and Najin – remain, and are under 24-hour armed protection at a conservation reservation in Kenya. But a new scientific advancement means the mother and daughter may not be the last of their kind.
An international team of researchers from BioRescue – a consortium, backed by the German government, which aims to halt extinctions – has performed the first successful embryo transfers in southern white rhinos, paving the way for the technique to be used for their rarer northern counterparts.
In September 2023, scientists transferred two southern white rhino embryos into surrogates at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya, resulting in a successful pregnancy. While commonly used in humans, horses and cows, the method had never been used in rhinos before.
The father and the pregnant mother died after contracting a rare, unrelated bacterial infection when the foetus was 70 days old, but researchers said the pregnancy was proof that the technique can work.
Thomas Hildebrandt, the BioRescue project head and a professor at the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research, said the technique was a key step in saving the northern white rhino.
“This little baby is the proof of everything,” he told the Guardian. “The sperm injection, the fertilisation, the liquid nitrogen, the thawing – this was never done before for rhinos. All of it could have failed.”
For the process to have worked in rhinos represented a major breakthrough, he said. In comparison: “Humans are simple! We are working with a two-and-a-half-tonne mammal.”
By May or June this year, scientists plan to implant the first northern white rhino embryo. The Northern rhino embryos were created using sperm gathered from two now-dead males, and eggs gathered from Fatu. They will be carried by a southern white rhino surrogate in Kenya. Just 30 embryos remain – stored in liquid nitrogen at -196C in Berlin, Germany and Cremona, Italy.
The surrogate rhino is injected with the embryo through its anus. If the 16-month pregnancy is successful, it would be the first northern white rhino born since 2000. It could also pave the way for the conservation of the Sumatran rhino, which number about 40 in the wild.
Researchers said they would perform more embryo transfers if the first pregnancy seemed to be going well, meaning that as many as six northern white rhino calves could be born in a short period. Scientists said it would be important for the calves to meet Fatu and Najin while the pair were still alive, to learn how to behave like a northern white rhino.
Even if several northern white rhino calves are born, however, they will not be genetically diverse enough to produce a viable population, Hildebrandt said. The 30 surviving northern white rhinos embryos are all based on eggs from Fatu and sperm from two males.
If more mammals are born, researchers said they would seek to use gene editing to improve the genetic diversity of future offspring, also taking genetic material from museum samples.
“We go to the skulls and find genetic materials,” Hildebrandt said. “Then we would use gene editing to put them into the population. We plan to go to all the museums with northern white rhino specimens. It is not just a scientific experiment, we really want to bring it back.”
Last year, it was announced that southern white rhino populations increased for the first time since 2012, rising from 15,942 at the end of 2021 to 16,803. But concerns remain about their longterm survival.
Erustus Kanga, the director general of Kenya Wildlife Service, said they were thrilled with the breakthrough to save the subspecies.
“Kenya Wildlife Service is delighted to have been part of this journey for the last 13 years, since the northern white rhinos were brought to Kenya in 2009, and for being part of the great initiative of the BioRescue consortium over the last four years,” he said.
“This is a great milestone in the preservation of the northern white rhino genetic lineage.”
Justin Heath, the CEO of Ol Pejeta Conservancy, said it was a huge breakthrough for conservationists, but was bittersweet after losing the surrogate and bull to the bacterial infection.

0QS5J8VER2_A6V1W0L644VUSPQ,"Nurse allegedly raped patient recovering from surgery at Geelong private hospital, court told",_,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/23/nurse-pen-yang-alleged-rape-patient-geelong-private-hospital-court-case-trial,"A man has alleged a nurse at a private hospital raped him during a bed bath when he was recovering from surgery to his deviated septum.
“He felt frightened and helpless at lying in a hospital bed with a drip in his arm and in pain from his surgery,” the prosecutor Richard Pirrie told a jury trial at the county court in Geelong on Tuesday.
But Peng Yang, 38, who is charged with rape and three counts of sexual assault, denies any sexual contact with the patient and claims he was giving the man a wash as part of his normal duties as a nurse.
The patient, who cannot be named for legal reasons, underwent two procedures in September 2019 at St John of God hospital in Geelong and was recovering with his wife beside him, Pirrie told the jury.
Yang, who had been a registered nurse since 2017 and was studying to become a doctor, was working the afternoon shift and walked into the hospital room to offer the man an icy pole and sandwiches.

The man’s wife asked if she could stay the night in hospital with her husband, but Yang told her that was only possible if the patient was a minor.
After she left that night, Yang walked into the patient’s room with a basin, water and a towel.
He told the man he was going to give him a bath in his hospital bed, closed the curtain and removed the patient’s gown.
Pirrie claimed Yang said to the patient “you’re feeling horny, do you have sex with your wife?” before he is accused of sexually assaulting and raping the man as he lay in bed.
The man was in a “state of shock” that evening and did not immediately report the alleged assault, the prosecutor said.
He was discharged the next day and confided in a friend later that evening, who encouraged the man to call police.
Yang told police the allegations were “ridiculous” and said he asked for consent before giving the man a bath.

His lawyer, the top criminal barrister Dermot Dann, labelled the man’s claims “extreme”.
He questioned the man’s credibility, reliability and the consistency and accuracy of his account.
“Mr Yang has done nothing wrong whatsoever, not only is he presumed to be innocent, he is innocent,” Dann told the jury.
“The only contact he made … was lawful contact that came about as this man was performing his duties as a nurse.”

0RMJHGM7DL_8T8SRIS5ZLYT52N,British Museum reveals bumper haul of treasures found by the public,Esther Addley,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/jan/23/british-museum-reveals-bumper-haul-of-treasures-found-by-the-public,"Caroline Nunneley was mudlarking along the shore of the Thames in London – inching on her hands and knees while scanning the mud for archaeological finds – when she suddenly spotted a miniature human skull looking up at her.
She picked up the small, exquisitely carved object and showed it to a friend. “We turned it over and we went: ‘Whoa.’ Because we hadn’t realised that there was a face on the other side.”
What they had found was a late medieval rosary bead, dating back possibly as far as 1450, that had been carved from bone and, thanks to the anaerobic river mud, perfectly preserved for five centuries.
Its twin designs, of a female face – possibly the Virgin Mary – on one side and a skull on the other were intended as a “memento mori” to remind the wearer of his or her mortality.
“She’s just a woman reminding us that one day we were young and beautiful and full of life, and that we have to be aware that time is passing,” says Nunneley, who is from Brighton and has held a mudlarking licence – as required by the Port of London authority – for five years.
The bead is not the largest or most valuable but is certainly one of the more intriguing archaeological finds reported to the Portable Antiquities Scheme (PAS) in 2022, the results of which were revealed at the British Museum on Tuesday.
The scheme, which the museum administers in England, records significant finds made by members of the public.
A total of 53,490 finds were recorded in 2022, of which 1,378 met the legal definition of treasure – the highest number ever reported in a single year, most of them found by metal detectorists.
The counties of Lincolnshire (5,101), Norfolk (4,265) and Suffolk (2,727) yielded the most finds, though the richest pickings in terms of treasure came from Norfolk (95), Hampshire (83) and Kent (81).
Jonathan Needham’s archaeological bonanza came on New Year’s Day in 2022, when he was metal detecting with his best friend, Malcolm Baggaley, in a sodden ploughed field near Ellastone in Staffordshire, then walked back over a grassy area “just to clean our boots”.
A faint beep prompted them to dig deeply and Needham reached in, only to pull out a very rare, solid gold dress fastener dating to about 1000BC.

The distinctive, twin-cup design of the object made them wonder at first if it was a drawer handle.
“That’s when Malc said: ‘There’s only one thing what comes out the ground looking that gold, and that’s gold,’” says Needham. They posted a picture on an archaeology Facebook page and were flooded with excited replies. “That’s when we panicked. It was like: ‘Oh, this is important.’ We didn’t realise how important it was.”
The Irish-made iron age fastener is one of only seven examples discovered in England and Wales, and one of the best preserved.
Treasure finds like the fastener are independently valued and may be acquired by a museum; the proceeds are typically split between finder and landowner. The money is not what is important, says Needham, though he admits there has been talk of a Caribbean holiday.
“It means so much to us [as detectorists]. It’s something what you never ever think is going to happen to you in your wildest dreams. It is not even one in a million, it’s a one in a billion chance to find something like that.”"
0U6EZM3FZH_14WHGM94DOGL8CA,David Cameron to return to Middle East and press for pause in fighting,Patrick Wintour,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/24/david-cameron-to-return-to-middle-east-and-press-for-pause-in-fighting,"David Cameron will return to the Middle East on Wednesday to press for an immediate humanitarian pause in the fighting.
Downing Street said Cameron was expected to raise “the importance of a two-state solution”.
The foreign secretary, who said the situation in Gaza is desperate, is due to visit Qatar, Israel, the West Bank and Turkey.
Lord Cameron, on his second visit to the region since returning to government, will continue to insist no permanent ceasefire can be agreed unless Hamas releases all the remaining hostages, is incapable of firing rockets at Israel, and an agreement exists that allows the Palestinian Authority to return to Gaza and provide services.
His visit comes as Qatar continues to try to mediate between Israel and Hamas on a plan for a two-month ceasefire that would see the release of all hostages and a large number of Palestinian political prisoners.
Some mediators believe that if such a long humanitarian pause was agreed neither side would want to return to war.
Hamas has insisted a permanent ceasefire must include the release of almost all political prisoners and the removal of the Israel Defence Forces from Gaza.
Speaking as he prepared to travel to Qatar, Cameron said a sustained ceasefire “would require Hamas to agree to the release of all hostages, Hamas to no longer be in charge of Gaza launching rocket attacks at Israel, and an agreement in place for the Palestinian Authority to return to Gaza in order to provide governance and services and, increasingly, security.”
Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has said he is opposed to the Palestinian Authority taking charge of Gaza.
Cameron will again put pressure on Israel to do more to allow aid into Gaza, but so far his requests have borne little fruit.
The Foreign Office said that in his meetings with Netanyahu and the Israeli foreign minister, Israel Katz, Cameron will call for more to be done, more quickly to increase the flow of life-saving aid into Gaza. He is also expected to raise UK concerns over the high number of civilian casualties.
Most aid agencies say only an end to the fighting will allow extra aid into the country, and technical fixes will not mean a major change.
The foreign secretary will reiterate that more crossing points need to be open for longer for aid deliveries, including the port at Ashdod and the Kerem Shalom crossing, and that water, fuel and electricity must be restored.
Cameron has met families of British hostages in London who told him they regard an end to the fighting as the top priority and believe their relatives are unlikely to survive much longer in the tunnels."
0WG80T5FNQ_ZH4NXVSDWTZ4HYJ,Spectre of irrelevance hangs over John Pesutto as backflip on treaty blind-sides Victorian Coalition MPs,Benita Kolovos,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/23/john-pesutto-treaty-victoria-coalition-mp-press-conference-indigenous-australians,"For half an hour on Monday, Victoria’s opposition leader, John Pesutto, tied himself in knots attempting to explain why the Coalition was walking back its support for a state treaty with First Nations people.
With a pained expression on his face, Pesutto began the press conference with hand-wringing about the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Victorians.
He said Indigenous incarceration rates increased by 5.5% in Victoria in the last year alone, while the rate at which young Indigenous Victorians were in out-of-home care was twice the national average. One-third of young Indigenous Victorians don’t finish year 12, he said.

Pesutto then raised vague concerns about government “secrecy” and the state’s cultural heritage laws, which he claims have delayed the roll-out of new housing stock. (No mention of the soaring costs for materials or labour shortages).
He also had another concern – the divisive nature of the debate during last year’s Indigenous voice to parliament referendum.
“I don’t want Victorians to have to go through that again,” Pesutto said, adding that Victoria must find a way to close the gap “in a way which unifies us as a people”.
All this before he said outright that the opposition would no longer be supporting treaty.
“I respect the views of others who think that treaty is the best way to go but I just want to be upfront with the Victorian people that I don’t believe that’s the right way to go,” Pesutto eventually said.
But by the end of it, he had failed to provide an alternative solution to any of the issues he raised, beyond “investing” in education, child protection and criminal justice.
“Isn’t that what governments – Liberal and Labor – have been doing for the last 30, 40, 50 years?” a reporter asked.
Monday’s press conference was a far cry from the comments made by the opposition’s spokesperson for Aboriginal affairs, Peter Walsh, in parliament in 2022, when he spoke in support of a bill establishing a Treaty Authority.
But on Sunday, he told Sky News “things have changed”. On Monday, he questioned the need for a treaty during an interview on ABC Radio Melbourne.
“Lots of people would say ‘How can you have a treaty with yourself?’ Because we are all Australians,” Walsh said.
In the same interview, he said the decision had been made in spring, after the referendum result.
So why was the policy change revealed during a Sky News interview less than a week away from Australia Day, which is also referred to as Invasion Day and considered a day of mourning by many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people?
Pesutto provided the excuse that he and Walsh wanted to speak with “key stakeholders” before announcing the new position. But several Indigenous leaders and members of Victoria’s First Peoples’ Assembly said on Monday they had been blind-sided.

Two sources close to the assembly said that at a meeting in November, Walsh raised cultural heritage concerns but never suggested the issue would mean a change in position on treaty.
In a statement issued on Sunday, the assembly said the Coalition’s decision was “disappointing, but not surprising”.
In the wake of the referendum, the Liberal National party in Queensland withdrew bipartisan support for a treaty process and the New South Wales Labor government said it was assessing its next steps.
Several Liberal MPs told Guardian Australia they were also “completely blind-sided” by the announcement and disappointed by Pesutto’s press conference performance.
“Why on earth would you get the leader of another political party to make the announcement, months after we’ve made the decision, and then seek to make it out like it’s about culture heritage issues when it isn’t,” one Liberal MP said.
“Somehow you’ve managed to offend absolutely every one with a decision that should have been a no-brainer. It was an abject failure of leadership on every front.”
One MP described the attempt to conflate the new position on treaty with cultural heritage issues as “messy”.
“It just confuses our message,” they said. “A key problem is people don’t know what we stand for. We could’ve made a stand on this front but now no one has any idea why we don’t support treaty.”
The MP said it was their understanding the decision was based on the referendum result and the recommendations from the Yoorrook Justice Commissionwhich called for an overhaul of the state’s criminal justice and child protection systems.
They ranged from urgent issues like raising the age of criminal responsibility to 14 to huge, long-terms reforms – such as establishing a dedicated child protection system for First Nations’ children run by First Nations’ people. The latter, the commission said, could form part of treaty negotiations.
“That freaked a lot of people in our camp out,” another MP said. “Even those with a more progressive bent.”
Indeed, during Monday’s press conference, Pesutto attempted to conflate the commission’s recommendations with treaty, suggesting the premier had already “agreed” to “two systems of law”, “two child protection systems” and “reparations”. He later repeated the comments on 3AW Radio.
But Jacinta Allan has done no such thing. The government is yet to respond to the commission’s recommendations, with a spokesperson on Monday saying they are still being considered.
A senior Labor source said it was “highly unlikely” all recommendations will be adopted, noting the government had already ruled out immediately raising the age of criminal responsibility to 14.
When this was put to Pesutto at Monday’s press conference, he said the government should be “upfront about what’s on the table”.
But again – no one is at the negotiating table just yet. The only thing that has been agreed upon – and was done so with bipartisan support – is the framework for negotiations.
Some issues may take years to settle, while any major structural reform would need to pass parliament. Unless the changes require a constitutional change, the government would likely have the numbers it needs to pass treaty without the Coalition.
Perhaps Greens leader, Samantha Ratnam, put it best when she said the opposition’s decision to drop their support for treaty now – before we even know what it looks like – will render them “irrelevant”."
0XGFSTZS9X_T4HO1R68MCCE3LV,Brexit trade checks will cost £330m a year. Starmer must revisit this disastrous deal,Simon Jenkins,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/23/brexit-trade-checks-will-cost-330m-a-year-starmer-must-revisit-this-disastrous-deal,"The government is planning to increase the cost of doing business in Britain by a total of £330m a year.
From the end of this month and again in April, it will start imposing a battery of border controls on agricultural trade with the EU. Fierce protests from farming and fishing interests have delayed these controls five times. But Rishi Sunak is frantic to show himself to be macho on Brexit. It is vital that Labour’s Keir Starmer steps forward and promises to rescind the controls immediately on taking office. The question is: does he have the guts?
The controls come on top of the selective checks already imposed on British goods entering Europe. They beggar belief. Armies of (nonexistent) vets will have to certify meat and fish produce. Plants that are transported during their growing cycle will have to be inspected and tested to check for “biosecurity”. Warehouses and truck parks must be prepared, officials recruited and paperwork filed.
The horticulture industry warned this week that it faced an “existential threat”. Flowers are time-sensitive to the hour. One Dutch exporter calculates that a petunia that is part-grown in the Netherlands and in Britain will need 59 steps of bureaucracy. It will be unlikely to survive. The shell-fishing industry, which also depends on speed of transport, is going through turmoil to see if it can continue exporting to Europe at all. Estimates of the cost of the new checks are scarcely believable: the government admitted last October it would be in the order of £330m a year, which will inevitably pass to the consumer in prices.
Leaving an open continental market was always going to be high risk for an offshore island, especially when that market had spent four decades evolving specialisms and complex supply chains. Thatcher regarded Europe’s sophisticated trading zone as among her proudest achievements. Brexiters casually dismissed its benefits as being outweighed by the freedom from EU bureaucracy. Their bureaucracy is gargantuan in comparison. Leaving the single market was reckless and mendacious – and was not required by Brexit itself.
Starmer has been indecisive and spineless on this subject. This is despite the well-attested fact that public opinion has turned against Brexit, and a majority of people think leaving the EU was the wrong decision. While sheer exhaustion might postpone the question of the UK returning to the EU, that need not apply to the customs unions and treaties that form Europe’s economic area.
Labour is clearly averse to controversy and wants to keep the coming election campaign a festival of platitude. That should not prevent it from exploiting an area of policy that is now crucial to the cost of living. It certainly should not stop Starmer’s policy team preparing for what should be an early revision of Britain’s trading relations with Europe.
The proposed new border regime promises to be a disaster for British agriculture and food supply, imposing a wholly unnecessary cost on food bills. That ministers are themselves running scared is shown by their having so often postponed the new regime. Starmer should now call for a further delay until after the election, and pledge an immediate review should he take power. It is hardly a wild demand. But has he the guts?

0YRLZW44XH_O2YO2D30IP9CR4P,Where We Come From by Aniefiok Ekpoudom review – a social history of British rap,Oliver Keens,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/jan/25/where-we-come-from-by-aniefiok-ekpoudom-review-a-social-history-of-british-rap,"Perhaps because so much post-millennial music has seemed safe and blandly palatable by comparison, grime – and the distinctive forms of homegrown rap that emerged in its wake – still boasts a freshness that distracts from its actual age. Those old enough to remember its birth might flatter themselves into thinking it’s still a nascent art form, but it’s really not. Dizzee Rascal, once the boy in da corner, turns 40 this year. Hits by stars such as Wiley, Lethal Bizzle and Kano are now considered old-school throwbacks. Grime is entering middle-age and feeling a bit wistful, as evidenced in last year’s BBC documentary 8Bar: The Evolution of Grime or DJ Target’s book Grime Kids (recently adapted into a BBC drama).
Fitting this mood of reminiscence, Aniefiok Ekpoudom has crafted a singular account of the rise of the genre, focusing on a careful selection of the people and places that shaped the music.
In his words, Where We Come From is “not intended to be an exhaustive chronicling of UK Rap and Grime. Instead, this is a book about the connected realities that have birthed [them]”. “Nor is it an entry-level guide – an understanding of and respect for UK rap is expected of the reader. Terms like “bars”, “shotting” or the cultural significance of the Candy dance are assumed, not explained.
It’s also perhaps the only rap history to include a reference map of the West Midlands. East London – for so long seen as the only locale in UK rap worth celebrating – is gleefully shunned here, in favour of Birmingham, South Wales and south London. Deliberately eschewing big names, Ekpoudom’s subjects are the artists Phil Davies AKA Traxx, co-founder of Welsh metal-rap hybrid Astroid Boys, and Despa, who experiences so much death during his adolescence that he takes to chronicling the West Midlands grime scene with a Samsung flip camera before it slips away. In south London we follow the steep ups and downs of Cadet, a rapper who deploys a radical honesty and vulnerability in his lyrics as part of his quest to make it big.
Despite the laudable aim of shining a light on lesser-known figures, the fact that Ekpoudom’s protagonists are relatively minor players sometimes feels like a miss. And with no pictures of any of the subjects, it’s easy to find yourself dragged online to fill in the gaps. The book is not helped by moments of what feels like padding. When Cadet goes to work in an Apple store, we get a potted biography of Steve Jobs which – truly – nobody needs in 2023.
But it succeeds, nevertheless, as a unique and eclectic social history. Ekpoudom bridges the past and the present to explain what gave grime the legs to make its artistic leap into the mainstream. We learn how So Solid Crew and other pioneers were the first generation of British Caribbean children whose parents were born and raised in the UK, how they had been nurtured by homegrown Black British institutions, whether pirate radio stations such as PCRL in Birmingham or the Notting Hill Carnival’s Rampage sound system.
Instructive links are made between the thunderous ire of grime and the righteous anger of the Windrush generation. Witness the words – preserved by the Birmingham Museums Trust’s Black Oral History Project – of Esme Lancaster, who arrived in Birmingham from Jamaica in the 50s and was met by whispered racism from her colleagues: “I am here. We are here. We are coming, and we are increasing. One day we will be like the children of Israel in the land of Egypt, and if you don’t like it, you can go, or die.” This is not just the Black British story either: the story of Traxx’s Greek Cypriot heritage leads to a wider exploration of Welsh diversity, including the fascinating migrant history of Tiger Bay.
The book’s publisher, Faber, has used bombastic words such as “landmark” and “monumental” in its marketing, which I think is a mistake. They obscure the fact that this is a highly original, almost subversive project, full of personal stories and small-scale experiences. None of its main characters changed the world. Yet the changes they made in their own lives – spurred on by the rebel force of underground rap music – really are remarkable when studied in painstaking, loving detail.

Stefan The food was fantastic. We sat on stools looking into the open kitchen. The pickled monkfish was delicious.
Conor The idea of 15-minute cities is that they’re designed so all amenities are within a 15-minute walk or cycle. I asked what he thought of them and he said: “They’re a conspiracy theory, aren’t they? That’s what I’ve read.”
Stefan It’s not something I know much about, but I like looking into the murky corners of the far right, and it crops up a lot in those circles. They see London’s Ulez expansion as the first domino falling in what will become this dystopia, in which you’re designated to a certain area.

Conor We agreed that public transport should be improved to reduce carbon impact – we both think London’s Elizabeth line was a triumph. He said he doesn’t think government control should get in the way of freedom of choice; that we shouldn’t be stopped from driving our six-litre cars just because someone else has got climate anxiety. For him, freedom of speech and movement overrules most things, which is not how I feel.

Conor As an architect, you can’t support pulling down Grade I-listed monuments. There’s an argument for explaining them in situ – perhaps an engraving in the pavement that tells you what, say, Robert Clive did. As a designer, I’d love to get involved with that.
Stefan Obviously it’s a terrible period of human history, but he believed in giving financial reparations to help address the wrongs of slavery.

11CPDUND6D_9OOXONLPCNYPDS2,‘It beats getting stoned on the street’: how Portugal decriminalised drugs – as seen from the ‘shoot-up centre’,Oliver Balch,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/25/it-beats-getting-stoned-on-the-street-how-portugal-decriminalised-drugs-as-seen-from-the-shoot-up-centre,"Paulo picks up a lighter from the table in front of him, holds it beneath the foil-encased bowl of his thin metal pipe for a few seconds, and then inhales. For a brief moment, he falls silent, head slumped forward. Then the 47-year-old is back to his usual chatty self, conversing with the seven other drug addicts who, like him, are making the most of their 30-minute slot at Porto’s new “shoot-up” centre. “It beats getting stoned on the street, where, you know, anyone can come along, kids or whatever,” he says. “Here, we can just do our thing and no one hassles us.” Lack of interference is not the only reason that Paulo and 400 or so other regulars visit the centre. The government-funded service also provides them with clean needles, strips of aluminium foil, and other materials to facilitate their drug-taking and prevent infections. The overarching ethos of the centre revolves around harm prevention. A list of rules by the entrance contains no strict injunctions; it simply invites users to be courteous and preferably not leave litter on the floor. Even the free sachets of citric acid, which addicts use to dissolve heroin or crack cocaine for injection, come with a health warning on the packaging: “Can damage the veins if used in excess.”
Housed in a nondescript portable cabin in Pasteleira, a low-income neighbourhood of Porto, the centre, which opened in August 2022, serves as a highly visible flagship of Portugal’s long-standing policy of drug decriminalisation. The scene is far from salubrious. Set beside the road on a patch of scrub, the temporary facility faces out to featureless blocks of social housing. Behind is a small encampment of makeshift tents – home to some of the centre’s users, 75% of whom are unhoused. Just up the hill, smartly dressed pupils file through the gates of the elite Lycée Français. Yet the centre offers a rare ray of hope in the scourge of drug addiction, locally and perhaps globally. First, its target users are alive and, if not exactly well, then at least using safely. Three decades ago, it was a different story. Heroin addiction in Portugal affected an estimated one in every 100 adults, and death by overdose or drug-related disease was commonplace. Second, most of the centre’s users still enjoy their liberty. Again, rewind a few decades and the situation looked very different. At the end of the 1990s, the number of people behind bars for drug-related offences stood at 3,863. In 2017, that figure had dropped by more than two-thirds.
Both facts link back to a radical piece of legislation passed by the Portuguese government in 1999. Motivated by a widespread belief that the war on drugs was failing, the country’s lawmakers agreed to decriminalise the acquisition, possession and private use of small amounts of drugs. Law 30/2000 applied to all narcotic and psychotropic drugs at the time, from marijuana and amphetamines through to class A drugs such as LSD and heroin, explains Dr João Goulão, a drug treatment specialist and one of the policy’s architects. While reflective of a “spirit of humanism”, the policy was also highly pragmatic, says Goulão. “All along, our national strategy has … tended towards the idea that it is better to treat them than to criminalise them.”
At the time, the Portuguese public was overwhelmingly in favour of the measure; foreign legislators and drug enforcement agencies predicted it would unleash a tide of fresh drug use and criminality. Yet Law 30/2000 is far from an “anything goes” measure, its supporters insist. The trafficking of drugs (except for marijuana, which was legalised for sale in 2018) remains a criminal offence in Portugal.
The ability to consume drugs but not buy them sounds like legal chicanery, but Portugal’s progressive drug policy has successfully rested on this technical ambiguity for more than two decades. Police resources are directed to stamping out the supply of drugs, while public health services are committed to providing addicts with therapeutic care. The theory is relatively simple: better that drug users have a place within the health system, rather than being shunted to the margins and left to their fate, as they were before.
It is this thinking that has kept the psychologist Diana Castro and her colleagues turning up to Porto’s shoot-up centre (known formally as the Centre for Assisted Consumption). “Our end goal, of course, is to eventually help them get back on their feet and reintegrate them … but this is not primarily a service to get people to stop taking drugs; it’s to provide them with healthcare,” says Castro, who serves as the centre’s coordinator. To that end, the centre has two nurses permanently in attendance: one for those who prefer to smoke their drugs; the other for those who choose to inject them. A psychosocial specialist is also on hand to welcome users as they arrive and provide a listening ear.Two sparsely furnished rooms at one end of the cabin are set aside for consuming drugs, which the users procure by their own means. Both rooms have space for half-a-dozen or so people, with half-hour slots designated on a first-come, first-served basis. Opening hours run from 10am to 7pm, bar an hour over lunch when the doors close. Some users come and then leave, but, with average use rates at eight hits a day, many mill around until the next slot becomes available. The facility has a small toilet and a basic shower room where people can get a wash as they wait. In a spartan kitchen, plastic thimbles of strong black coffee are available, as are donated pastries and other sweet snacks, while stocks last.
At the other end of the cabin is a consulting room where visiting doctors from two local hospitals offer checkups twice a week. In addition to basic health appraisals, the medics conduct blood tests for infectious diseases such as HIV and hepatitis C. “Many of these people live very complicated lives, so most wouldn’t typically go to hospital, for example, or use a conventional health centre. That’s why it’s important for us to adapt a little,” says Castro. Since its inauguration, Porto’s centre has clocked up 63,000 visits from more than 2,000 drug users – the vast majority of whom use either crack cocaine or heroin. Only two overdoses have occurred, both of which were treated successfully on the spot. Castro also points to the 1,500 or so screenings undertaken, and the 89 individuals now receiving treatment for hepatitis C as a consequence. About 10 people have also entered detox programmes of their own volition. Drug-taking is not without its sanctions. All those caught by the police with class A drugs are required to attend a government-run “integrated response” clinic, where their use levels are assessed and a treatment programme proposed. These clinics house psychotherapists, psychiatrists, social workers, pharmacologists and primary healthcare specialists, explains Dr Severiano Pinto, a psychologist at one of three such facilities in the Porto district. “The problem of drug addiction has a lot of variables – individual, familial, social and so on. So we find it’s better to work with a collection of professionals to try and address the problem,” he says. “Normally, they want to stop taking narcotics when they first come in, but it’s a long process. It’s not something we can resolve in just a couple of weeks or even months.” Ana Paula is a case in point. A long-term sex worker, the 59-year-old Porto resident got hooked on heroin through a boyfriend who later died of an overdose. When she was referred to a clinic 23 years ago, she weighed less than 40kg (6st 4lb). After being prescribed methadone, she quit injecting heroin and shifted to smoking crack cocaine in lower doses. Six months ago, she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer, which prompted her to go clean entirely. Despite breaking her crack habit, Ana Paula continues with a 5ml prescription of methadone. “I’m part of the furniture in this place,” she says, of the clinic. “But, I tell you, if it weren’t for the help I’ve received here, I’d have died years ago.”
In extreme cases, hospitalisation is also an option. Specialist units exist within the Portuguese public health system for addicts who are pregnant, suffering from some form of psychosis, or are otherwise judged to be at dangerous risk to themselves or others.Likewise, had Ana Paula decided to go cold turkey, there are government-run centres where addicts are supported to abstain from their habit. Most programmes run for a week to 10 days. They might then choose to join a longer-term residential programme where, over the course of three months to a year, they receive support to help them “reinsert” back into society.
Many credit decriminalisation with introducing a more liberal attitude towards drug-taking in Portugal. Shops selling cannabis CBD products are now commonplace in large cities, such as Lisbon and Porto, although THC – the psychoactive ingredient of cannabis – remains illegal for retail. Similarly, the use of psychedelics such as LSD, ecstasy and ketamine is now largely normalised in recreational settings such as bars and nightclubs. The health authorities even set up pill-testing facilities at major festivals and music gigs to guard against bad batches.
Portugal’s decriminalisation policy has faced criticisms, though. According to the most recent government figures, 75% of Portuguese residents perceive drug use as a problem in their community. Although drug use by the general population has crept up since 2001, from 7.8% to 12.8%, consumption rates for most drug types are far below the European average. Portugal now ranks near the bottom for cocaine and cannabis use in the EU. The real test is among problematic users. Here, the picture is less conclusive. After falling dramatically at first, for instance, drug-induced deaths have begun to climb back up. Even so, the numbers remain small. In 2021, Portugal registered 74 deaths from overdoses (compared with 37 in 2014). In Scotland, by contrast, a country with a population of about half the size, “drug misuse” deaths for 2021 stood at 1,300. On the flipside, drug users complain that low thresholds for illegal possession make it easy for them to be criminalised. Users are permitted to possess enough for 10 days – which the government sets at 1g for heroin and 2g for cocaine. Users carrying larger amounts can be designated “traffickers” and subject to jail time. In 2021, Portuguese courts issued 1,459 such guilty verdicts, marking a steady increase in criminalisation over the past decade, according to the drug support agency Sicad.These mixed results give ammunition to both sides of the decriminalisation issue, which remains hotly debated around the world. To date, more than 20 countries have removed some (if not all) drugs from their list of banned substances. Others have opted to crack down even harder – Rodrigo Duterte’s murderous “war on drugs” in the Philippines being a notorious case in point.
In few countries is the debate more polarised than in the US, where drug overdoses have cost more than 1 million lives since 1999. Recent years have seen some tentative attempts at liberalisation. Half of the US government’s $42bn drug-control budget currently goes to health or social services, for example, while recreational marijuana use is now legal in 24 states as well as the District of Columbia.Oregon is the only state to have embraced Portugal’s model fully, with residents voting 58% in favour of legal possession of small amounts of all drugs in 2020. Following an alleged surge in fentanyl use and a spike in opioid-related deaths, however, a new legislative committee on addiction recently proposed reversing the policy.Even in Portugal, the debate over decriminalisation continues. Supporters of the policy fear that opposition parties could seek to politicise the issue ahead of national elections in March. André Ventura, the leader of the far-right Chega party, issued an early salvo last year, characterising a new law decriminalising synthetic drugs as a “disaster” and “designed by the left”. He said at the time: “We do not need to be softer on drugs. We need a war.” Goulão is not blind to the imperfections of the policy he helped inspire. To treat drug addiction as a therapeutic problem is both time-consuming and resource-intensive. But as problematic drug use reduces, he notes, so too does government prioritisation. From being right at the top of public concerns in the 1990s, the issue has slipped to “13th or 14th place”, Goulão laments. With the drugs crisis of the 1990s now a distant memory, he observes social prejudices towards drug users resurfacing. “Today, the problem is mostly limited to people living in very difficult circumstances and it’s easy for certain political groups to exploit fears towards them as being different and problematic.”
Back in Pasteleira, however, the views of those shooting up under the nurses’ caring eye are broadly positive. Paulo’s only complaint is with the centre’s opening hours. “I mean, it’s not like any of us stop taking drugs just because it’s night-time.”
This article was amended on 26 January 2024. The original stated that shops selling marijuana are now commonplace in Portugal. In fact only CBD cannabis products are legal for retail. This has been corrected.

13ZI7UA738_2N5QXK4V8YGIBLI,ICJ’s Gaza decision shores up rules-based order and puts west to test,Patrick Wintour,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2024/jan/26/icj-gaza-decision-shores-up-rules-based-order-and-puts-west-to-test,"In seeking a provisional order from the international court of justice restraining Israel from committing potentially genocidal acts in Gaza, South Africa put not just Israel’s treatment of Palestinians in the dock but also the whole post-second world war rules-based order, including the authority of the ICJ itself. Never has there been such a high-profile case brought in the middle of such a bloody conflict, and rarely have so many staked so much on the outcome.
In the words of the Irish barrister Blinne Ní Ghrálaigh, who set out part of South’s Africa case to the court, “the imminent risk of death, harm and destruction that Palestinians in Gaza face today, and that they risk every day during the pendency of these proceedings, on any view justifies – indeed compels – the indication of provisional measures. Some might say that the very reputation of international law – its ability and willingness to bind and to protect all peoples equally – hangs in the balance.”
Extraordinarily, the court did not shirk from what it regarded as its responsibilities. It did not order a full ceasefire but it granted protective orders, including an end to the killing of Palestinians in Gaza, that went further than many international law experts were predicting.
The ruling is devastating for Israel and awkward for politicians such as the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, who said the case was meritless, and the UK foreign secretary, David Cameron, who urged South Africa not to bandy around words such as genocide.
The highest court in the world, the apex of the United Nations, has found there is a plausible risk that Palestinians’ right to be protected from a genocide are under threat from Israel’s actions. The irony of this is self-evident. The concepts of “crimes against humanity” and “genocide” were created by a Jewish law professor, Raphael Lemkin.
For Israel, a nation in part born in 1948 from the horrors of the Holocaust and centuries of persecution, this could be a moment for reflection. Its whole national identity is intertwined with the Holocaust, just as South’s Africa’s is indivisible from apartheid.
There will be many in Israel who dismiss the ruling as another sign of the antisemitic nature of the UN, an organisation it has loathed for decades.
But the country knows the diplomatic damage. A confidential cable from the Israeli foreign ministry, obtained by Axios a month ago, stated that the case “could have significant potential implications that are not only situated in the legal world but have practical bilateral, multilateral, economic, security ramifications”.
It also presents a test for Israel’s allies, particularly the US and the UK. The court’s findings are binding but no enforcement mechanism save peer pressure exists, and there is no more important peer than the US.
On occasion the US has taken to belittling the ICJ. Jeane Kirkpatrick, a past US envoy to the UN, described the court as far back as 1984 as “a semi-legal, semi-juridical, semi-political body that nations sometimes accept and sometimes don’t”.
But there are also many times in the more recent past when the US and the UK have urged countries such as Russia and Myanmar to implement fully what they described as the ICJ’s binding rulings.
The US has just spent millions successfully campaigning to ensure that its latest highly qualified candidate, Prof Sarah Cleveland, gained a seat on the ICJ. In endorsing her candidacy, Joe Biden said the court “remains one of humanity’s most critical institutions to advance peace around the world”. It will be hard for it to fulfil that critical role if Washington chooses to dismiss the court’s findings.
That does not mean the US is obliged to concur with the findings, but it does arguably have a duty as a signatory to the convention to support them. That would require it to urge its ally Israel to seek ways to comply with the court’s orders. The incentive for Washington to negotiate a ceasefire is also compounded.
If, as appears likely, a country such as Algeria seeks to enforce the ICJ’s order through a UN security council resolution, the US will face a dilemma. It could deploy its protective veto and point out that other countries, notably Russia, have not complied with the ICJ’s recent ruling on Ukraine – but in so doing it would hand Moscow, a master of linguistic warfare, a gift-wrapped present.
In a remarkable lecture this week, the director of the Chatham House thinktank, Bronwen Maddox, urged the west to recognise how vulnerable it was to charge of hypocrisy, and how it mattered.
She said the argument about double standards “runs like this: the west cares about democracy, but not when it wants to install leaders it likes in other countries. It respects sovereignty except when it does not, as in Iraq. It argues for self-determination in Taiwan, not in Catalonia. It supports human rights, but not in countries from which it needs oil. It defends human rights except when it gets too difficult, as in Afghanistan.
“These accusations, if unanswered, give those countries that want to undermine the west a weapon even if their own hypocrisy is luminous.” In this context, dismissal of the ICJ would compound the problem.
In Israel’s defence, aspects of the ruling contain injustices, and Hamas, not being a state actor, does not come under the court’s jurisdiction, which is only to resolve disputes between states. It was largely let off the hook.
It can also be argued that South Africa used a backdoor device – the genocide convention and the low threshold of plausibility required at the interim stage – to get inside a courtroom to hear claims that are better described as breaches of international humanitarian law.
Israel can also rightly insist that the merits of the case – the existence of Israeli intent to commit genocide – have not yet been examined and will not be for many years.
Nor did the court grant South Africa’s ultimate objective of a ceasefire, as it did against Russia in the case of Ukraine in 2022. Instead it ordered the Israel military not to commit any of the acts proscribed under the convention, including the killing of the Palestinians, serious bodily and mental harm and starvation.
Dr Henry Lovat, a lecturer in law at Glasgow University, took the absence of a ceasefire order as critical. “Israel has dodged the spectre of a ceasefire order. On balance the provisional orders will be within the range of anticipated non-worst-case outcomes for the Israeli delegation, and probably largely what was expected. The order to ‘take all measures within its power to prevent the commission of all acts within the scope of article II’ is essentially a restatement of the existing legal position. Similarly, the requirement to facilitate aid will have been anticipated and falls short of an international mechanism to require cooperation that South Africa had sought.”
Israel will doubtless find ways to interpret the orders to say it is already complying with them. Nor will it take kindly to the court restricting politicians’ freedom of speech by telling Israel to clamp down on incitement.
For the global south, and for South Africa in particular, this is a famous victory, a moment that will be remembered for decades to come. The plight of the Palestinian people in Gaza was recounted in open court and believed. African countries have long criticised transnational bodies such as the international criminal court for apparently trying only Africans, at least to a large extent, while heinous crimes have occurred in many places. Some faith in their value will have been restored.
If the court had simply turned away, on whatever sincerely held legal principle, cynicism about international law as a possible avenue to settle differences would deepen, and those that advocate violent resistance would have been bolstered."
15FP2G0GCG_3OWFY2K4U6DKFMT,Skibidi Toilet: what is this bizarre viral YouTube series – and does it deserve the moral panic?,Alex McKinnon,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/jan/22/skibidi-toilet-youtube-series-viral,"Alex, I read a headline saying Russian Cops Forced to Investigate YouTube’s Famous ‘Skibidi Toilet’ Series. As a series of words, what does that mean?
Brrr Skibidi dop dop dop yes yes, Steph. Skibidi dobidi dib dib.
I think that pretty much explains itself.
Thanks, I hate it. But it has 135m views (!) and I’m going to need more info.
Fine. Skibidi Toilet is an ongoing animated YouTube web series by Georgian content creator Alexey Gerasimov. Since it began in February, his YouTube channel, DaFuq!?Boom!, is now just outside the top 100 YouTube channels in the world by number of subscribers. There are now more than 70 episodes, with new videos uploaded every few days – although the time between new episodes has gotten longer as their length and production quality increases.
Skibidi Toilet’s popularity is mainly being driven by children under the age of 13 – it’s the first meme that members of gen Z are lamenting not understanding because they’re too old. The young age of most Skibidi Toilet fans, combined with the show’s unsettling aesthetics and violence, make it perfect fodder for a new moral panic over how the internet is poisoning children’s brains.
Parenting websites and TikTok influencers, particularly in Indonesia, are already warning about the apparent dangers of “Skibidi Toilet Syndrome” – and the Russian authorities have gotten involved.
Skibidi Toilet Syndrome???? What are the symptoms please?
Look it’s not yet recognised in the DSM-V – it’s more a catch-all term for what parents believe is concerning behaviour their children display after watching the show. Parents have documented their kids becoming “obsessed” with Skibidi Toilet, upset or angry after being restricted or banned from watching it, or sitting in baskets or boxes and acting like the Skibidi toilets, which seems more cute than terrifying but what do I know.
Police in Moscow got wind of it after a father asked authorities to investigate whether the videos “have a detrimental effect on children”. Russian lawmakers have been especially prone to looking for signs of moral decay in internet culture – in 2015, the Duma passed laws forbidding memes that mock or satirise public figures.
What’s the show actually about?
The first few episodes show a city and its inhabitants steadily being taken over by the Skibidi toilets, the terrifying animated heads that live in toilets and continually sing a mashup of the songs Give It to Me by Timbaland and Dom Dom Yes Yes by Biser King. The cameraheads – well-dressed men with CCTV cameras for heads who serve as the series’ protagonists – emerge as an underground resistance movement; it quickly becomes an all-out war between ever more powerful and destructive variants of both sides.
This is odd to admit, but I found myself pulled into the world of Skibidi Toilet. There’s a clear narrative arc developing  and there are plot twists, betrayals, humour, killer action scenes and a couple of moments where I probably felt more than I’m supposed to.
You mentioned “a new moral panic over how the internet is poisoning children’s brains”. I feel as though there’s one of these every few months?
Handwringing about the internet turning kids into psychopaths has become a recurring feature of the contemporary news cycle. In the last few years social media has been blamed for making kids and teenagers eat laundry detergent, steal items from their schools and develop symptoms of Tourette’s syndrome.
There’s a political element too. Far-right politicians in the US and elsewhere are fundraising and campaigning off ludicrous claims that TikTok is brainwashing kids into questioning their sexual and gender identities, supporting Hamas or becoming bait for child sex traffickers.
None of this is new. Millennials will remember the pearl-clutching around weird internet ephemera such as Slender Man and bigger cultural markers including the Grand Theft Auto video game series. This isn’t to say there isn’t online content that children should be protected from, such as the disturbing bootleg YouTube videos of Peppa Pig being mauled at the dentist. But if every piece of content that kicked off a moral panic merited one, the internet-using kids of the world would long since have become the Children of the Corn.
So the verdict on Skibidi Toilet?
It’s kind of fun! There are definitely parts that a small child might find frightening (a lot of the episodes end with a Skibidi toilet lunging at the camera) but once you get past the red-eyed toilet monsters it’s a lot less creepy than much of the discourse around it has made it out to be.
In any case, a lot of the best kids’ entertainment is weird and dark. Roald Dahl’s books are full of murderous school principals and kids getting mutilated in comedic ways. Hansel and Gretel had to push a witch into the oven! If you’re worried about your kid suddenly acting like a singing toilet, watch some Skibidi Toilet with them – it might even become a guilty pleasure."
1A9IKR1QQL_FE10HF0CE10ZHOZ,Orbán reaffirms backing for Swedish Nato bid as allies’ patience runs low,Lili Bayer,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/24/orban-reaffirms-backing-for-swedish-nato-bid-as-allies-patience-runs-low,"Viktor Orbán has said he will urge the Hungarian parliament to sign off on Sweden’s Nato bid “at the first possible opportunity”, as diplomats said Hungary’s allies were “exasperated” by the country’s foot-dragging.
Sweden applied to join Nato in May 2022, but its accession was delayed as Turkey and Hungary strung out the ratification process.
On Tuesday night, Turkey’s parliament voted in favour of Swedish membership, but Hungary’s parliament has yet to sign off on it, despite repeated promises from senior Hungarian officials that their country would not hold up the process alone.
Just as Turkey’s parliament prepared to vote, Orbán, the Hungarian prime minister, surprised allies by issuing a public invitation to his Swedish counterpart to visit Budapest for talks on the Nato accession process.
“Allies are exasperated,” said a senior European diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive internal matters. “That Orbán offered ‘negotiation’ while Hungary never raised objections during the accession talks is outrageous.”
A second senior European diplomat echoed the frustration. “I think allies expected Hungary to abide by their commitment not to be the last,” they said. “The recent moves sent shockwaves throughout the alliance, and a great dose of disappointment is there. After all, they had all the time in the world to consult with Sweden before.”
Hungary – which, unlike most other Nato countries, continues to maintain a friendly relationship with Russia – has, along with Turkey, dragged out Sweden’s Nato ratification process.
Although it submitted the ratification to parliament in 2022, a final vote on the matter has been repeatedly delayed, and is now the main single factor holding up Sweden’s membership.
With Tuesday’s vote in the Turkish parliament, Ankara’s portion of the process is nearly complete – though the first diplomat cautioned that it was “not a done deal” as the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, needed to sign the ratification.
On Wednesday, as pressure mounted, Orbán said he had spoken on the phone with the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg.
“I reaffirmed that the Hungarian government supports the Nato membership of Sweden. I also stressed that we will continue to urge the Hungarian national assembly to vote in favour of Sweden’s accession and conclude the ratification at the first possible opportunity,” Orbán said, without offering a concrete timeline.
The Nato friction comes at a time of growing frustration in western capitals over Hungary’s blocking of long-term EU assistance for Ukraine.
Ankara and Budapest had earlier also delayed Finland’s Nato accession, but Hungary’s parliament moved quickly to ratify the Finnish bid in March last year once it became clear that a vote in the Turkish parliament was imminent.
Officials had expected a similar scenario to unfold in the Swedish case and are confused by the Hungarian government’s signalling.
In public, Nato members have made it clear that eyes are now on Budapest. “It is now high time for Hungary to conclude the remaining steps so that we can welcome our Swedish friends to the alliance,” the German foreign office tweeted.
In private, patience is running out. There is a “very negative mood” towards Hungary, said a third senior European diplomat. There is “no understanding for extra discussions or negotiations”, they said.
Domestically, senior politicians from Orbán’s ruling Fidesz party have argued that continued delays to Swedish membership are justified because Sweden has, in their view, unfairly criticised the state of Hungarian democracy.
Asked about frustration within Nato about Hungary’s delays, Balázs Orbán, the Hungarian prime minister’s political director, said in an email on Wednesday that “we take our Nato membership and military commitments very seriously” and that “the Hungarian government supports Sweden’s accession to Nato”.
He added: “Constant political attacks on Hungary by the Swedish political, media and NGO elite raised concerns among Hungarian MPs. For this reason, we have repeatedly asked the Swedish government to engage in political consultations by visiting Hungary. Unfortunately, despite high-level Hungarian delegations visiting Stockholm, our requests have been repeatedly declined.
“Nevertheless, we remain open to dialogue if Nato membership is indeed a priority for Sweden. The ball is in their court.”
Officials familiar with talks within Nato headquarters say that unlike Turkey, Hungary never formally made any concrete demands when it came to Swedish membership.
In his invitation letter on Tuesday to the Swedish prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, for further talks, Orbán made no direct mention of any grievances or objections.
Orbán wrote: “I believe that a more intensive dialogue could contribute to reinforcing trust between our countries and institutions thus allowing to further strengthen our political and security arrangements.”
The letter was met in Stockholm with surprise and caution. A spokesperson for Kristersson declined to comment on the request, saying there would be no response from the prime minister as yet.
Sweden’s foreign minister, Tobias Billström, however, said that before responding the government would need to “think through what the letter signals”.
After Turkey’s move on Tuesday night, there was muted celebration in Stockholm. Kristersson said: “Today we are one step closer to becoming a full member of Nato.”
But there was caution over the fresh question mark over Hungary and worries over whether Erdoğan could yet demand further concessions before signing the bill into law.
Sweden’s former prime minister Magdalena Andersson, who leads the opposition Social Democrats and started Sweden’s Nato process nearly two years ago, said that during her premiership Orbán promised her that Hungary would not be the last to ratify Sweden and that he had made similar pledges to Kristersson.
She said: “I don’t see that there’s very much to discuss with Hungary.” She added: “We fulfil the criteria and they have promised to ratify us.”
While she said Hungary had “a complicated relationship with the European Union” and acknowledged that there was much to discuss outside Sweden’s Nato membership, Andersson declined to speculate on Orbán’s motivation for stalling the process.
“It’s difficult to guess why they are doing this, so I am not going to start guessing. But what I know is that it’s time for Hungary to ratify.”
She said she found the influence on the country of the Sweden Democrats, whose support Kristersson’s government depends upon, “really concerning” and claimed that the far-right party saw Hungary “as a role model for a country”.
Criticising her successor, she said: “The lack of leadership from the prime minister in this respect is truly worrying.”
Asked whether the prime minister could give concessions to Hungary, she said: “Leading Sweden Democrats have said that they think he [Kristersson] should go and take a whisky with Viktor Orbán.”"
1BYY03OEEC_NOUX2QINQHO0MX9,Fight over border intensifies as Texas governor pledges more razor wire,Erum Salam,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/26/border-fight-texas-greg-abbott-razor-wire,"The fight between Texas and the federal government over the control of the US-Mexico border has further intensified after state governor Greg Abbott announced he will defy the Biden administration and US supreme court by ordering the installation of even more razor wire to deter migration.
On Monday, the supreme court voted 5-4 in favor of the federal government’s power to remove the controversial concertina wire installed along stretches of the border in Texas, at Abbott’s direction. Despite this, Abbott, a hard-right Republican, is intensifying his plans to try and fence off parts of the US border with Mexico.
Federal agents were given further confirmation this week at the supreme court that they may remove the razor wire, as the enforcement of immigration law is under federal jurisdiction. But Abbott has argued there is nothing preventing him from ordering the Texas national guard to continue laying more razor wire down. The national guard is ultimately part of the US military, overseen by the US president as commander-in chief, but except in specific situations where the president explicitly takes federal control, the national guard in each state takes orders from its state governor.
Immigration matters, as confirmed in the 2012 supreme court case Arizona v United States, officially fall under the federal government – not individual states. Abbott has repeatedly invoked the invasion clause, essentially as a loophole, in the US and Texas constitutions, likening migrants to a public foreign enemy, which gives him the right to enforce border security and immigration matters, he argues.
Fatma Marouf, a law professor and the director of the immigrant rights clinic at Texas A&M University’s School of Law said Abbott’s decision to lay more wire down “seems to defy the purpose of the supreme court’s order”.
Marouf said the supreme court ruled in favor of “the federal government to continue its control of the border area.
“The briefing really focused on the need for US customs and border protection officers to access the bank of the river to save migrants. There were reports of people being caught in the wire and dying. So to continue laying the wire really undermines the purpose of the injunction.”
In Abbott’s statement released on Wednesday announcing his plan to continue going around the federal government, amid legal challenges, he accused Biden, the Democratic president, of using taxpayer dollars to “tear open” the border.
“The federal government has broken the compact between the United States and the states. The executive branch of the United States has a constitutional duty to enforce those laws and has even violated them,” Abbott said.
“The result is that he has smashed records for illegal immigration.”
Civil rights organizations, such as the League of United Latin American Citizens (Lulac), condemned the use of razor wire and other deterrents, such as a floating barrier of buoys with nets and barbed wire in the Rio Grande, as “inhumane”.
In response to the supreme court’s ruling, Lulac national president Domingo García said: “Lulac today supports the supreme court ruling that only the federal government has jurisdiction over all border and immigration issues. Texas Governor Abbott’s political stunts are costing millions of taxpayers’ dollars and accomplishing nothing to solve the humanitarian crisis at the border.
“Not to mention the human tragedy of deaths on barbed wire walls of innocent woman and children.”
Earlier this month, a mother and her two children, from Mexico, drowned in the river near Eagle Pass – a section of the border where state officials physically blocked federal agents from accessing part of the banks of the Rio Grande. Their deaths prompted a fierce response from US homeland security spokesperson, Luis Miranda, who said “the state of Texas should stop interfering with the US Border Patrol’s enforcement of US law”.
The use of razor wire is part of Abbott’s publicly funded Operation Lone Star program, a joint effort between the Texas department of public safety and the Texas military department that began in 2021 to curb irregular migration. It coincided with more people crossing into the US because they were unable to claim asylum at an official crossing point or by appointment. Meanwhile, tense talks continue in Washington over legislation to tighten border restrictions.
Marouf said Texas’s move is also “very concerning” because of its implications on the right to seek asylum.
“We have in our immigration laws guaranteed a right to seek asylum for people fleeing persecution. And laying down barbed wire is the opposite of what we’re meant to do,” she said."
1EKHWQYEOZ_JTMBWEXK3CEZX68,Kamala Harris kicks off abortion rights tour on 51st anniversary of Roe v Wade,Erum Salam,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/22/kamala-harris-abortion-rights-wisconsin,"Kamala Harris kicked off her much-vaunted abortion rights nationwide tour in Wisconsin on Monday as Joe Biden convened a meeting of his taskforce on reproductive healthcare access, in a tag-team effort to double down on what is likely to be a key campaign issue this year.
The vice-president chose the 51st anniversary of the Roe v Wade ruling to begin the Reproductive Freedoms Tour, announced in December, in the battleground state of Wisconsin, which the president won in the 2020 presidential election by just over 20,000 votes.
Roe v Wade, the supreme court decision that enshrined the federal right to abortion, was overturned in June 2022 after the then president Donald Trump nominated three conservative justices to the nation’s highest court.
The decision was a major blow to supporters of reproductive rights, but since the ruling seven states – including the conservative strongholds of Kentucky, Kansas and Montana – have held ballot referendums where voters chose to protect abortion rights. The issue also appeared to hurt Republicans in the 2022 midterm elections.
Wisconsin is a notable starting point for Harris’s reproductive freedoms tour. Last year, abortion rights propelled a Democratic victory in a critical election for the state supreme court.
In the first of many similar scheduled events, Harris is expected to announce support for increased access to abortion and contraceptives through the new emergency care law, Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (Emtala).
She will also denounce Trump, the runaway frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination, for his hand in overturning the federally protected right to abortion.
“Proud that women across our nation are suffering?” Harris will say, according to excerpts from her speech obtained by the Associated Press. “Proud that women have been robbed of a fundamental freedom? That doctors could be thrown in prison for caring for patients? That young women today have fewer rights than their mothers and grandmothers?”
The following day, Harris will be joined by Biden for another abortion-focused event, along with their spouses, Jill Biden and Doug Emhoff.
Biden’s re-election campaign also rolled out a new campaign ad on Sunday, titled Forced, which aims to tie Donald Trump directly to the abortion issue.
In Dobbs v Jackson, the 2022 supreme court case that overturned Roe, a Mississippi law that banned most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy with certain medical exceptions was upheld, negating the constitutional right to abortion and overruling the precedent set by Roe more than half a century ago.

In a statement on the 51st anniversary of Roe v Wade, Biden said: “Fifty-one years ago today, the supreme court recognized a woman’s constitutional right to make deeply personal decisions with her doctor – free from the interference of politicians. Then, a year and a half ago, the court made the extreme decision to overturn Roe and take away a constitutional right.
“As a result, tens of millions of women now live in states with extreme and dangerous abortion bans. Because of Republican elected officials, women’s health and lives are at risk.”
When announcing her tour in December, Harris said: “Extremists across our country continue to wage a full-on attack against hard-won, hard-fought freedoms as they push their radical policies – from banning abortion in all 50 states and criminalizing doctors, to forcing women to travel out of state in order to get the care they need.
“I will continue to fight for our fundamental freedoms while bringing together those throughout America who agree that every woman should have the right to make decisions about her own body – not the government.”"
1GHJ222Q4C_7RQB5HLR3KWF490,‘It was very scary’: Britons tell of damage and disruption from Storm Isha,Jedidajah Otte,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/22/it-was-very-scary-guardian-readers-on-how-storm-isha-affected-them,"Marina and her partner were on Spanish airline Vueling’s 7.40pm flight from Barcelona to Gatwick on Sunday evening, returning home to London after a holiday.
“After a 30-minute delay at Barcelona airport due to ‘weather conditions at the destination’, our flight finally took off for Gatwick at 8pm,” she said. “The pilot tried to land twice at Gatwick, but the conditions were too difficult. Everybody onboard was screaming and some people were having panic attacks.”
Marina, 32, was among various Britons who got in touch with the Guardian to share how they were affected by Storm Isha, which has been battering the UK and Ireland with gusts of up to 107mph since Sunday, causing widespread travel disruption and damage.
Airlines were forced to cancel, delay or reroute scores of flights across the UK on Sunday and Monday.
“We were told that they were going to wait 15 minutes and [if landing would still be impossible then] would try to land in Manchester,” Marina said. “After another hour of flying around above the storm, the pilot informed us that we were all on our way to Amsterdam,” she said.
“It was very scary. We were all very happy to land safely on the ground when we got to Amsterdam, and the pilot got a round of applause.”
But upon arrival at about 11.30pm, the passengers were told that Amsterdam airport was not giving the aircraft permission to unload and let people get off, Marina said.
“We were told that following a fuel refill we would fly back to Barcelona again. We waited for hours inside the plane, as the storm slowly approached the Netherlands. Some people without checked-in luggage managed to leave the aircraft. Eventually at 3.30am, everybody was asked to get off. At 4.30am we were told that the plane had gone back to Barcelona, without passengers but with all our checked luggage.”
As there were no planned Vueling flights to London from Amsterdam for several days, some people agreed to be put back on flights to Barcelona free of charge, Marina said, in the hope to then be dispatched to London again at the next opportunity.
Others decided to continue their journeys via train or find alternative flights.
“As it stands, we have no idea where our luggage is,” she said. “The poor ground staff in Amsterdam started their early day by needing to attend an angry crowd of 135 passengers who had been trying to get to London for over 10 hours. … A lot of people had connecting flights, which they missed, of course.”
Marina and her partner managed to book a hotel themselves, as they had to work on Monday morning.
“We slept for three hours and have been trying to work from the hotel lobby,” she said. “We bought new flight tickets for a 9pm flight tonight. We’re now getting the cost of the flights refunded, and will definitely try to claim back the other expenses. All very stressful.”
Thousands of people have also been left without power as Isha brought disruption to electricity networks across the UK and Ireland.
Michaela Saunders, who is 68 and lives in a farmhouse with her husband in the rural county of Haddingtonshire in south-east Scotland, said the storm left in its wake a real “danger to life” and a town-wide power cut since 10.30pm on Sunday.
“I think the danger is in rural areas, where you have a lot of overhead power cables, whereas in more built-up areas, they tend to be put through ducts,” she said. “So lines [in rural areas] come down on to roads. They get hit by flying debris.”

As one of several thousand properties in Scotland prone to power outages, Saunders said they had installed a generator to be prepared for situations like these, “a privilege not everyone can afford”.
“Estimated reconnection time is 10pm today, no guarantee though. The house is warm and comfortable and we have lights,” Saunders said, though she voiced concern for locals with health problems.
“Are they able to communicate with the medical services? Do they have mobile services that work? Fortunately, the weather is very mild. If a storm like this occurred during freezing, snowy conditions there would almost certainly be loss of life, as the majority of people don’t have a generator.”
Chris, a 42-year-old IT consultant from Brixton, south London, said his dog, Tonks, had saved him from getting hit by a falling piece of a tree, during a quick walk at about 7pm on Sunday evening.
“While we were out, there was a particularly strong gust of wind and a cracking noise overhead,” Chris said. “I thought nothing of it. Luckily, my dog is always alert to loud noises. She heard it, was scared and pulled me forward. When I looked back, a big tree branch, about 3 inches thick at the break, had crashed on to the pavement right where we were.
“A bit of a lucky escape. If it had cracked me on the head, it would have knocked me out.
“Despite her not being a rough collie, I’m going to have to rename my dog Lassie. She got a good handful of treats.”
A spokesperson for the Vueling airline said: “Vueling flight VY7828 to London Gatwick was diverted to Amsterdam Schiphol airport due to adverse weather conditions in London. Unfortunately, due to limitations to nighttime operations at Amsterdam airport and the lack of staff at the airport to assist flights diverted there due to the extreme weather, we were forced to disembark our passengers in Amsterdam.
“In addition, Vueling’s crew were about to exceed their maximum allowed flight duty period, which is a key element to guarantee safety on-board. This means they would not be able to operate further passenger flights at that time.
“We always prioritise our customers’ wellbeing, so we offered all of them hotel accommodation in Amsterdam and relocated them with flexible flight options on Monday and Tuesday from Barcelona, as we are unable to provide direct flights from Amsterdam to London Gatwick. We appreciate the frustration this will have caused our passengers and apologise for the inconvenience.”"
1H7TR0RC2O_8XAMCLXRRRZG6ZU,"Meta has not done enough to safeguard children, whistleblower says",Dan Milmo,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/24/meta-has-not-done-enough-to-safeguard-children-whistleblower-says,"Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta has not done enough to safeguard children after Molly Russell’s death, according to a whistleblower who said the social media company already has the infrastructure in place to shield teenagers from harmful content.
Arturo Béjar, a former senior engineer and consultant at the Instagram and Facebook owner, said if the company had learned its lessons from Molly’s death and subsequent inquest it would have created a safer experience for young users. According to research conducted by Béjar on Instagram users, 8.4% of 13- to 15-year-olds had seen someone harm themselves or threaten to harm themselves in the past week.
“If they had learned the lessons from Molly Russell, they would create a product safe for 13-15-year-olds where in the last week one in 12 don’t see someone harm themselves, or threaten to do so. And where the vast majority of them feel supported when they do come across self-harm content,” Béjar told the Guardian.
Russell, a 14-year-old girl from Harrow, north-west London, took her own life in 2017 after viewing harmful content related to suicide, self-harm, depression and anxiety on Instagram and Pinterest. In a landmark ruling in 2022, an inquest into her death found that Molly “died from an act of self-harm while suffering from depression and the negative effects of online content”.
Béjar said Zuckerberg had the tools at his disposal to make Instagram, in particular, safer for teenagers but the company has chosen not to make those changes.
“They either need a different chief executive or they need him to wake up tomorrow morning and say: ‘This kind of content is not allowed on the platform’, because they already have the infrastructure and the tools for that [content] to be impossible to find.”
Béjar’s research at Instagram, and attempts to get the company to act on it, feature in a lawsuit brought against Meta by Raúl Torrez, the New Mexico attorney general, that claims Meta fails to protect children from sexual abuse, predatory approaches and human trafficking. Unredacted documents from the lawsuit show that Meta employees warned the company was “defending the status quo” in the wake of Molly’s death when “the status quo is clearly unacceptable to media, many impacted families and … will be unacceptable to the wider public”.
Béjar’s responsibilities as an engineering director included child safety tools and helping children cope with harmful content such as bullying material. Having left the business as a senior engineer in 2015, he returned as a consultant in 2019 for a two-year period where he conducted research showing that one in eight children aged 13 to 15 on Instagram had received unwanted sexual advances, while one in five had been victims of bullying on the platform and 8% had viewed self-harm content.
The former Meta employee has called on the company to set goals around reducing harmful content. “That creates the incentive structure for them to work on these things over a long period of time,” he said.
Bejar has urged Meta to undertake a series of changes including: making it easier for users to flag unwanted content and state why they don’t want to see it; regularly survey users about their experiences on Meta platforms; and making it easier for users to submit reports about their experiences on Meta services.
Béjar continues to monitor the Instagram platform and says harmful content – including self-harm material – remains on the app as well as clear evidence of underage users. Instagram has a minimum age limit of 13.
Béjar has been meeting politicians, regulators and campaigners in the UK this week including Molly’s father, Ian Russell, whose Molly Rose Foundation facilitated his visit. Béjar testified before Congress last year detailing his experience at the company and the “awful experiences” of his teenage daughter and her friends on Instagram, including unwanted sexual advances and harassment.
It would take three months for Meta to carry out an efficient crackdown on self-harm content, Béjar added. “They have all the machinery necessary to do that. What it requires is the will and the policy decision to say, for teenagers, we’re going to create a truly safe environment that we’re going to measure and report on publicly.”
A Meta spokesperson said: “Every day countless people inside and outside of Meta are working on how to help keep young people safe online. Working with parents and experts, we have introduced over 30 tools and resources to support teens and their families in having safe, positive experiences online. All of this work continues.”
Meta points to numerous safety initiatives including automatically setting under 16-year-olds’ accounts to private mode when they join Instagram, restricting adults from sending private messages to teenagers who don’t follow them and allowing Instagram users to report bullying, harassment and sexual activity.

1HWY2NUIV6_A5I9IGRO58DCY1Y,"When we can share everything online, what counts as oversharing?",Shayla Love,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/jan/25/oversharing-social-media-privacy-anxiety,"I recently made a new friend, and we became Instagram mutuals right away. From her posts, I’m getting a sense of what she does on the weekends and what she likes to cook. It’s helping me to get to know her even though we don’t see each other very often.
As I learned about her hobbies and how many brothers she has, I also noticed how much the act of sharing personal details has evolved. The photos or thoughts I casually put online without a second thought might once have been considered too much to broadcast. Who needs to know what I’m buying at the farmer’s market or how long I waited for the subway? But none of my friends or followers bat an eye, and they share similarly – if not more – about their activities too.
It’s clear that what is considered oversharing has changed. How much of our lives do we have to share to reach that point?
Last year, a paper from Psychological Reports published the first psychological scale to measure oversharing. The researchers gave a questionnaire to teenagers that asked how much of their thoughts, emotions and personal life events they put online. They suggested that not only is oversharing still a thing, but that there might be some troubling psychological states affiliated with sharing too much. The findings raise questions about why we post about our lives at all, and how we might define oversharing in a digital age.
One definition of oversharing put forward by a 2012 psychology paper is that it’s an “excessive generosity with information about one’s private life or the private lives of others”. Of course, what’s considered “excessive” is open to interpretation. If something is considered a share versus an overshare, that’s nearly always going to be a subjective evaluation that depends on what’s considered normal in certain eras or contexts. Influencers, for example, share a lot because they’re getting paid to do so.
But with the internet, non-influencers gained more spaces to share, and overshare, in.
The ways and amount people share online can diverge from their offline lives. The sociologist Ben Agger wrote in the book Oversharing: Presentations of Self in the Internet Age that a person oversharing online is divulging “more of their inner feelings, opinions, and sexuality than they would in person, or even over the phone”.
Online, “there is almost nothing that cannot be shared,” said Reza Shabahang, a psychologist at the University of Tehran, and first author of the oversharing scale study.
To learn more about how people share online, Shabahang and his colleagues asked 352 teenagers in Iran to say how often they posted their feelings, opinions and values on social media. Then, the researchers asked if the teens enjoyed sharing this information, how much they posted about their personal lives, and if they thought there was anything “too personal” to disclose online. Teens who shared a lot online had higher levels of anxiety and attention-seeking tendencies. These teens also reported feeling higher levels of worry and an excessive attachment to social media, and many had an “intense urge to post”.
Oversharing comes in many forms, like “sadfishing”, or negative online sharing with the goal of seeking sympathy. In 2023, Shabahang and colleagues developed a Social Media Sadfishing Questionnaire and found that this behavior was also associated with anxiety, depression and attention seeking. This is in line with another study from 2018, which found people who had higher social anxiety were more likely to engage in what the authors called “toxic self-disclosure”, or online disclosures that have negative effects such as isolation or cyberbullying, or negative mental health effects.
But there’s an element to oversharing that isn’t just about frequency or content. I wouldn’t blink at a close friend posting something very personal to her private stories, for example, and we all know from experience that sharing online can bring you closer to people and communities, rather than only having negative effects. It seems like there’s something else that makes a post come across and act as an overshare.
The oversharing scale from Shabahang and his colleagues is based on a psychological concept from 1973 called social penetration theory (SPT), from Irwin Altman and Dalmas Taylor.
Altman and Taylor thought that “self-disclosure” was critical to how people develop relationships; as time goes on, people disclose more personal information with one another. In SPT, there are two ways to self-disclose: with breadth, the number of topics you share about; and with depth, how deep you go on one topic. Breadth usually comes first, then depth.
Too much – or too little – sharing can stop a relationship in its tracks. “You want your level of intimacy to be sort of the same,” said Emmelyn Croes, an assistant professor at Tilburg University who studies how people get to know each other through communication technologies. “You don’t want to share very intimate details when someone does not reciprocate.” Conversely, sharing works optimally when we reciprocally share information in similar ways and that back-and-forth inspires us to become closer.
There’s more to it than, say, an objective daily count. If a person posts more or less than you, or what you believe is appropriate, you could feel like the poster is oversharing or undersharing. But another person may not agree, depending on their own opinions and practices.

Practices also evolve with time, meaning what’s considered “too much” can change, and there’s also potentially significant cultural variation. Croes has been studying “momfluencers”, who have become less accepting about publishing information or photos of children online. This flexibility means there could be cases in which oversharing is seen as more authentic, or better for relationships, compared to a carefully understated social presence. Last year, some Instagram users called to “make Instagram casual again”, preferring less stylized “photo dumps” over single, beautifully shot photos.
Algorithms make it more complicated, said Aparajita Bhandari, a critical media researcher at the University of Waterloo, because a person cannot fully control who their content is shown to. Because of social media’s recommendation systems, your content could be shared with people that you don’t know. “Those boundaries of personal versus public are shifted in these new spaces that we’re in,” Bhandari said.
I asked my younger sister, who is 23, about her and her friends’ thoughts on oversharing online. She agreed that it’s nuanced: they all have multiple accounts on different platforms. On Instagram, it’s common to have private, public and spam accounts. It’s frowned upon to overshare on your main account – that is where carefully selected photos live. Private or spam accounts are for posting more with less judgment from others, and with that reciprocity of oversharing built in.
Oversharing can come with negative mental side effects because it can influence actual life experiences, Shabahang said. For example, at a gathering, a person “might become engrossed in taking a good picture” for social media, Shabahang said. “Then they lose the real pleasure of spending time with their friend.”
Yet disclosing information about ourselves is part of how we communicate who we are. The sociologist Erving Goffman argued in his influential book The Presentation of the Self in Everyday Life that presenting ourselves to other people is a process of impression management; sharing is a way to control what and how others think about us.
So sharing online isn’t a bad thing: when interacting in person or online, people seek to learn about each other. It’s not just nosiness: this information helps define what people can expect from one another, and what their relationship will be. Goffman called these sources of information “sign vehicles”; they include the setting where you meet someone, their appearance, how they interact with you. We can add social media accounts to that list.
I asked a friend who doesn’t have social media accounts if there are any downsides to being offline. She said she does sometimes feel left out of the loop of big life events like births and deaths. But her friend who recently had a daughter sent an email to people who weren’t on social media so that they could hear the news. “I found that very touching,” she said.
Goffman wrote that just like a play involves a stage and a backstage, social life does, too. The front is where the actor performs, and backstage is where they prepare for the role. It’s easy to apply these thoughts to the internet and social media: the internet is the stage where we present our activities and thoughts, and backstage is offline. Spend too much time in either place, and you might miss out."
1KFGSMLGVC_V8Q7N8W1IP8X403,Target workers reportedly fired for buying popular Stanley mugs,Sam Levine,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/23/target-fired-workers-buying-stanley-mugs,"Some Target workers have been fired for using their status as employees to buy highly popular limited-edition Stanley mugs, according to Business Insider.
Earlier this year, Target sold a limited-edition “pink quencher” that was a collaboration between Starbucks and Stanley. The $45 cups sold out almost immediately, causing stampedes at several stores and were resold online for hundreds of dollars. Target has since announced they are not restocking the cups.
Araceli Bernal, who had worked at Target in Delaware for a little less than two years, told Business Insider she bought one of the quenchers from a barista at the store who set them aside. Days later, Bernal was fired. She told Business Insider several other co-workers were fired as well.
Target did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Target policy prohibits employees from using their status as employees “to gain an unfair advantage over guests when it comes to purchasing merchandise”, according to a company handbook obtained by Business Insider. It also says employees cannot be working when they buy Target merchandise and cannot buy items that are promotional or in high demand.
One user on X who said they were fired by Target for purchasing a cup said they were unaware that the item was high profile.
yeah appearantly it was ""high profile"" despite not making employees selling it aware of that fact
Bernal told the outlet she did not realize the barista may have set the quenchers aside for purchase. Business Insider also quoted other social media users who said they had been fired from Target for purchasing the item.
The Stanley quenchers have soared in popularity in recent years after going viral on TikTok.
The company was projected to make $750m in 2023, according to CNBC.
Another recent news story which illustrates Stanley cups’ popularity involved police in Roseville, California, arresting a woman on accusations that she stole 65 of them from a store – a value of about $2,500.
The woman allegedly loaded the cups on to a cart, wheeled them out without paying, and drove off with them in her car, the local news outlet KABC-TV reported. Police later pulled the woman over on a nearby highway, arrested her and quipped on social media: “While Stanley quenchers are all the rage, we strongly advise against turning to crime to fulfill your hydration habits.”"
1LESLQ4YG3_D331IIGVIC049VL,Dublin riots: solace and simmering grievances at Muslim-run soup kitchen,Rory Carroll,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/23/its-a-grey-area-anti-foreigner-grievances-aired-at-muslim-run-dublin-soup-kitchen,"When Dublin erupted in a riot last November masked youths looted shops, set fires and shouted slogans against immigrants and refugees. “Ireland is full,” said one banner. “Ireland for the Irish,” said another.
Resentment at asylum seekers, demographic changes, a housing crisis, crime and the cost of living had boiled over, turning O’Connell Street, the capital’s main thoroughfare, into what looked like a war zone.
Two months later, on another cold night, a different scene unfolded: hundreds of people queued at a soup kitchen run mostly by women wearing hijabs. In place of shouts there were warm greetings, including as-salaam alaikum, Arabic for peace be upon you.
“The food here is unbelievable – falafel and chicken burgers, curry, salad, you name it, they’re one of the best groups around,” said one young man, an unemployed plasterer from Dublin. “We’d be lost without them, and they’re Muslims. So you see, the riot wasn’t a racist thing.”
The Muslim Sisters of Éire, a charity, runs the service every Friday on the corner of O’Connell Street and Prince’s Street, serving up to 550 meals to people, Irish and non-Irish, in an area associated with crime, poverty and tension.
Over seven years it has become a valued institution, offering sleeping bags, hygiene kits and food to desperate people even as desperation has worsened and fuelled a backlash against foreigners.
Some of the Irish beneficiaries queueing for a meal acknowledged a contradiction – they considered the riot a legitimate revolt against “way too many” new arrivals yet appreciated the foreigners ladling dinner into cartons.
“It’s a grey area,” said the plasterer, who like some others in the queue withheld his name, citing stigma over homelessness. Of 75 men in his hostel, 65 were foreigners, he said. “I’ve seen this city change in the past 10 years. Close your mouth here and you’ll hear how much English is spoken,” he said, alluding to the queue’s mix of Ukrainian, Romanian, Hindi, Urdu, Somali, Arabic and other languages.
New arrivals diverted accommodation and services needed for natives, he said. “We’re being taken for mugs. The government is not listening to the people.” His girlfriend, a chef who also lives in a hostel, agreed. “It’s not right that Irish people are on the streets.” She complained about a Kenyan roommate. “On the phone all the time talking gibberish, I can’t sleep.”
Another Dubliner who gave her name only as Danielle, 30, said her hostel demanded she renew identity documents while some asylum seekers destroyed their passports upon arrival at Dublin airport. “How is that supposed to be fair?”
Other grievances echoed the perception that immigration was aggravating a housing shortage and strain on public services. “You need to get things sorted out before you invite people in,” said Norman, an unemployed butcher. “This city is a powder keg.”
Others dispute that. Dublin has experienced no repeat anarchy since 23 November. And the Muslim Sisters of Éire do not sense a surge in Islamophobia.
The riot – which flared after a man with Algerian roots stabbed three children – involved thugs encouraged by far-right activists, said Lorraine O’Connor, a Dubliner who set up the charity in 2010 after converting to Islam.
The real problem was not racism but poverty, unaffordable rents and overstretched services, said O’Connor. The volunteers who are foreign and wear hijabs feel secure, she said. “The homeless see you caring, doing your little bit to combat adversity, and they respect that.”
Volunteers, who include men and non-Muslims, hope the riot was an aberration. “I think it was a once in a blue moon [event],” said Esam Adnan, 24, a medical student from Saudi Arabia who works in Dublin hospitals. “I don’t feel any hostility. The Irish are warm and welcoming.”
Mohammed Rashid, an entrepreneur who has been in Ireland since 1997 and donates meals from his food company, Safco, said extremism remained marginal. “The far right is very small. Overall I think we’re still in a good place.”
But fears endure. The government has run out of accommodation for refugees, forcing some to sleep on the streets, and protests against refugee centres have led to arson attacks.
Emeka Wosu, 49, a Nigerian who was queueing for a meal, said he slept in his car. “Living here, it’s been tough.” Last week he took in a lodger – an arrival from Ghana."
1P84SZ10JV_2QPC5J8L85V8HFR,New York man convicted of murdering woman in car that turned into his driveway,_,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/23/new-york-man-convicted-murder-driveway,"A man was convicted of second-degree murder on Tuesday for fatally shooting a young woman when the SUV she was riding in mistakenly drove up his rural driveway in upstate New York.
A jury found Kevin Monahan, 66, guilty of second-degree murder for shooting 20-year-old Kaylin Gillis on a Saturday night last April after she and her friends pulled into his long, curving driveway near the Vermont border while they were trying to find another house.
The group’s caravan of two cars and a motorcycle began leaving once they realized their mistake. Authorities said Monahan came out to his porch and fired twice from his shotgun, with the second shot hitting Gillis in the neck as she sat in the front passenger seat of an SUV driven by her boyfriend.
During the trial, Monahan and his attorney maintained the shooting in the rural town of Hebron, about 40 miles (65km) north of Albany, was an accident involving a defective gun.
Gillis was killed days after the shooting of 16-year-old Ralph Yarl in Kansas City. Yarl, who is Black, was wounded by an 84-year-old white man after he went to the wrong door while trying to pick up his brother.
Monahan testified during the trial that he felt like the house he shared with his wife was “under siege” when the revving motorcycle and the two other vehicles pulled up his driveway. He said he fired a warning shot to let the intruders know that he had a gun.
But he said the second, fatal shot was unintentional.
He said he tripped over nails sticking up from the deck, lost his balance and the shotgun struck the deck. That, he said, accidentally caused his gun to fire at the Ford Explorer carrying Gillis.
“I didn’t mean to shoot the second shot,” Monahan testified last week. “The gun went off.”
Prosecutors argued Monahan showed a depraved indifference to human life by firing at the SUV.
“He acted out of anger. That’s the only thing that can be inferred from shooting at people within 90 seconds of being on his property,” the assistant district attorney Christian Morris told jurors in his closing arguments on Tuesday. “He grabbed his shotgun and intended to make them leave as fast as possible and he didn’t care if they were hurt or killed, just so long as they left.”
Prosecutors also presented evidence that Monahan claimed to have been sound asleep when police showed up at his house later that night.
Gillis’s father, Andrew Gillis, has described his daughter as someone who loved animals and had dreams of becoming a marine biologist or a veterinarian."
1PHIQ85R5I_MYL73G5R02PKD8T,First Thing: Trump-Biden rematch increasingly inevitable after New Hampshire primary,Nicola Slawson,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/24/first-thing-trump-biden-rematch-increasingly-inevitable-after-new-hampshire-primary,"Good morning.
A sweep of the first two nominating contests on the 2024 primary season left Donald Trump in a strong position to seize the Republican party nomination and made a rematch with Joe Biden even more inevitable.
Trump’s Republican rival, Nikki Haley, vowed to fight on despite her second place finish in New Hampshire, a state where she had hoped for an upset, and her third-place finish in the Iowa caucuses. But she faces long odds. There is no precedent for a candidate winning the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary and losing their party’s nomination.
In his victory night speech, Trump previewed the crudeness of the campaign rhetoric to come if Haley does not accede to his calls for her to drop out. In his remarks, which were more angry than celebratory, Trump suggested that Haley would find herself under investigation if she became the nominee, but then declared that she had no chance of dethroning him.
“This is not your typical victory speech,” he said, surrounded by all of his vanquished Republican rivals. “But let’s not have someone take a victory when she had a very bad night.”
What did we learn in New Hampshire? The independent vote couldn’t topple Trump, but it should still make him nervous. New Hampshire is known for its independent voting bloc – which comprises 40% of the electorate. Although independent voters were not able to lift Haley to victory, their support for her could create a problem down the road for Trump. Here are some other key takeaways from the day.
Israeli forces battled Palestinian militants this morning near the main hospital in Gaza’s second-largest city of Khan Younis, where medics said hundreds of patients and thousands of displaced people were unable to leave because of the fighting, reports Associated Press (AP).
Reporting from Rafah, an AP journalist said Israel had ordered people to leave a swath of downtown Khan Younis that includes Nasser and two smaller hospitals as it pushed ahead with its offensive against Hamas. The UN humanitarian office said the area was home to 88,000 Palestinians and was hosting another 425,000 displaced by fighting elsewhere.
The aid group Doctors Without Borders said its staff were trapped inside Nasser hospital with about 850 patients and thousands of displaced people because the surrounding roads were inaccessible or too dangerous. Nasser hospital is one of only two in southern Gaza that can still treat critically ill patients, the group said. Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry also said the hospital had been isolated.
Thousands of people fled south from Khan Younis yesterday toward the town of Rafah, reports AP. The UN said about 1.5 million people – around two-thirds of Gaza’s population – are crowded into shelters and tent camps in and around Rafah, which is on the border with Egypt.
What else is happening in the Middle East? The US has carried out strikes in Iraq against three facilities linked to Iran-backed militia, the Pentagon has said, after a weekend attack on an Iraqi airbase that wounded US forces.
A Russian Ilyushin-76 military plane crashed this morning in Belgorod and Russia’s defence ministry has claimed that the flight was carrying 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war, who were about to be exchanged.
They were killed together with six Russian crew and “three accompanying persons”, the Moscow news agency Tass reported.
A video posted on the Telegram messenger app by Baza, a channel linked to Russian security services, showed a large aircraft falling towards the ground and exploding in a vast fireball.
The authorities were investigating the cause of the crash, and a special military commission was on the way to the crash site, the defense ministry said.
What has Ukraine said? According to Ukrainskaya Pravda newspaper, quoting defense sources, the plane was delivering S-300 anti-aircraft missiles used in recent devastating attacks on Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second largest city.
The Los Angeles Times said it was laying off 115 journalists, more than 20% of its newsroom, the day after members of Congress warned in a letter that sweeping media layoffs could undermine democracy in a high-stakes election year. “The LA Times laid us off in an HR zoom webinar with chat disabled, no Q&A, no chance to ask questions,” one former news editor wrote on X.
Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta has not done enough to safeguard children after Molly Russell’s death, according to a whistleblower who said the social media company already has the infrastructure in place to shield teenagers from harmful content.
North Korea has demolished a monument that symbolised hope for reconciliation with the South, days after the regime’s leader, Kim Jong-un, said the peaceful reunification of the two Koreas was no longer possible. The Arch of Reunification – built in 2000 after a landmark inter-Korean summit – has disappeared from satellite imagery.
A nose wheel fell off a Delta Air Lines Boeing 757 passenger jet and rolled away as the plane lined up for takeoff over the weekend from Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson international airport in the US, according to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
Nuclear power generation is likely to break records in 2025 as more countries invest in reactors to fuel the shift to a low-carbon global economy, while renewable energy is likely to overtake coal as a power source early next year, data has shown. China, India, Korea and Europe are likely to have new reactors come on stream, while several in Japan are also forecast to return to generation, and French output should increase, according to a report on the state of global electricity markets published by the International Energy Agency (IEA) today. Electricity demand is also expected to increase around the world, fuelled largely by the move to a low-carbon economy.
“The US writer and feminist Shere Hite was a legend of her time who landed in my small ex-council flat in London when I was in my 20s,” writes Joanna Briscoe. “When her books about women, men and the clitoris caused outrage, the bestselling writer was forced to flee the US. She was two decades older and seemed to me to be an extraordinary, exotic creature transmuted from celluloid into strange reality in my home. To those over 50, Hite – a pivotal figure in the second wave feminist movement – was a much-photographed writer and sexologist: a mix between Germaine Greer and a movie star. To those younger, the name draws a blank. Hence the title of Nicole Newnham’s superb new documentary, The Disappearance of Shere Hite.”
“ExxonMobil is ‘committed to responsibly meeting the world’s energy needs’, according to the corporate blah blah, but it is clearly not committed to allowing its shareholders to express their own opinions on the ‘responsibly’ bit of the boast,” writes Nils Pratley. “The US oil company is off to court in Texas to try to block a vote on a resolution tabled by Follow This, a Dutch green activist investor group that would like Exxon to move faster (a lot faster) on reducing emissions.
“Why is the company taking such a hard-headed approach? One suspects its real motive may be corporate America’s wider resentment of the growing number of shareholder resolutions being tabled these days.”

1RH88J2IX3_U03SI0H3KAKCU2U,"In Iceland, we got used to enjoying our ‘Disney volcanoes’. Now the threat is real",Andri Snær Magnason,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/24/iceland-volcanoes-eruptions-tourists-damage-nature,"In July 2023, I followed a parade of people to what felt like a carnival on the Reykjanes peninsula, where three eruptions have taken place in the past three years. On the hill overlooking the volcano there was a photoshoot for a skin product, on the other side someone was making a music video and next to them two Chinese women were posing in evening gowns. Another couple had set up a table with a white cloth and were enjoying a romantic dinner. The air was buzzing with drones and helicopters and a leading tourist operator hoped the eruption would last into the autumn so he could offer volcanic northern lights tours.
The eruptions were in an almost perfect spot, away from all infrastructure. It was a Disney volcano, but with hindsight this volcanic amusement park might have been a symbol for carefree days and attitudes; the high point of an era in which we seemed to have gained mastery over natural forces and turned them to our benefit, including marketing and tourism.
That era may have started with the famous eruption in Eyjafjallajökull, when the volcano stopped most air traffic in Europe for a week. It was shortly after the economic crash of 2008, and we thought for a moment this could be a final blow to our economy. But the eruption could have been described as one of the most important publicity stunts in history. Attention is expensive – a 30-second Super Bowl commercial costs about $7m. Eyjafjallajökull gave us the world’s attention while causing little damage. In 2010, Iceland welcomed fewer than 500,000 tourists. Four years later, there were almost 1 million. Now there are close to 2 million.
But maybe we deserved a good time after having been tormented by volcanic activity throughout the centuries. There were around 50,000 Icelanders not long after the time of settlement in the early 10th century, and by 1800 the population still hadn’t grown. In 1783-84, the eruption of Laki claimed the lives of about a fifth of the population and more than half of the livestock. This was one of the largest eruptions on Earth in historic times, with volcanic haze causing famine, and extreme weather events documented as far away as Egypt and Japan. Less than 100 years later, we had the eruption of Askja, in 1875. It was a major blow to communities in the eastern part of Iceland: many farms were abandoned and thousands of people moved to North America in search of a better life.
During the 20th century, we found ways to turn Iceland’s disadvantages into advantages. Since then, volcanic activity has become more of a resource: a greater benefit than a danger. Most of our homes are heated with geothermal energy – by far the largest and most important source of energy in Iceland – which is clean, cheap and renewable. We can heat greenhouses to grow crops in the winter, and on a cold January day you can take the kids for an evening swim in a local pool for very little money.
The volcanoes have become a source of awe and wonder. Painters such as Jóhannes S Kjarval helped us to appreciate the lava fields as a source of beauty, instead of cursing them for being infertile and harmful to livestock. The island has become a laboratory for science and culture. At a family dinner recently, we had a debate about everyone’s favourite geologist, seismologist or volcanologist. “Kristín is young and cool,” one said. “I would always have a beer with Magnús,” said another. “Haraldur is best,” said the third. “He speaks like the grand old man of wisdom.”
The 20th century was mostly generous, despite an eruption on average every five years, many of them under glaciers, triggering huge flash floods. In January 1973 an eruption engulfed Heimaey, in the Westman Islands. Ash and lava ruined about 400 buildings and the 5,000 inhabitants fled to the mainland. People started moving back already that August, and by November more than 2,000 people had returned to salvage their homes: a symbol of resilience and persistence against the ruthless forces of nature. We rebuild, we keep on.
But now the future of the town of Grindavík on the Reykjanes peninsula is uncertain. After a series of earthquakes late last year, some 4,000 people were evacuated from their homes. Just as they hoped to return, a 4km-long fissure opened up in a short but powerful eruption, about 3km from the town. Earlier this month, a man working to fill a crevasse in the town fell into it, and the search for him was eventually called off. Two days later, a new eruption began much closer to the town, claiming three houses before it stopped. A rescuer was filmed walking down a paved path, when suddenly he stepped through the ground with one foot. The ground is an unstable crust: in many places, the simple act of walking around is like navigating thin ice.
Heimaey was rebuilt, but Grindavík is different. This volcanic era has no clear end in sight. The next eruption could come tomorrow or next year, in the middle of the town, by the Blue Lagoon, or under the harbour, with explosive results. The whole town is unsafe, but for how long?

At a town meeting a woman stood up and said: “We have no answers from the government. I wish my house had been swallowed by the lava.” People are homeless, in limbo and have a craving for clear answers. If the house had burned, she could carry on with her life with the insurance money. There is a demand for a full buyout of all the property in Grindavík, but the process is complicated, and some estimates suggest it could cost $1bn, around 10% of Iceland’s annual budget. But you can’t put a price on the pain of dissolving a whole community.
The Reykjanes fires follow a pattern: the last phase was from 800 to 1200, so this one could last for hundreds of years. Grindavík is suffering now, but the system that has just woken up stretches all the way to newer suburbs around Reykjavík. Now we are remembering warnings from geologists in the 1980s about building on the faultlines around Reykjavík. Rightly or wrongly, we decided to build, and these places may now be in the line of fire. We are entering a new volcanic era in Iceland – one that may be more challenging than anything that has occurred in the past 800 years. But we coexist with the natural world, and eruptions are the most spectacular things to witness on this planet. If the next eruption is in a safe place, I see no reason not to join the carnival.

1S0P8J1XKG_950HST2GR300QK2,Cyclone Kirrily expected to hit north Queensland on Thursday as residents urged to stock up on supplies,Andrew Messenger,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/22/tropical-cyclone-qld-watch-north-queensland-kirrily-storm-track-map-path-tracking-mackay,"Queenslanders are being urged to stock up on 72 hours of supplies as a “severe” cyclone begins to swing towards the state’s coast.
A cyclone watch has been issued for communities across north Queensland, with the Bureau of Meteorology forecasting that tropical Cyclone Kirrily will make landfall near Townsville as a category three storm on Thursday.
In a Monday afternoon press conference, bureau response manager Lauren Boekel warned that parts of the coast could feel the first effects within 48 hours.
“Gales with damaging wind gusts of up to 120km an hour may develop about coastal and island communities between Ayr and St. Lawrence, and that’s from as early as Wednesday morning,” she said.
“Heavy rainfall, which may lead to flash flooding, is also a very likely possibility with this system.”
The system was expected to swing south as a low later in the week, creating a flood risk for much of the state, including in the south-east.
Queensland state disaster coordinator deputy commissioner Shane Chelepy said emergency authorities would make a decision about whether to release water from dams in affected areas.
He said it was time for people to plan how to wait out the storm.
“Go to our Get Ready Queensland website and take some basic preparations, such as ensuring you have sufficient food in your house, long-life food, for 72 hours post Thursday,” Chelepy said.
“Keep your car topped up with petrol. Make sure you have a power pack for your phone as when we see events like this that do cross the coast it’s up to 72 hours, sometimes, before emergency services can get out and assist you.”
There was still some uncertainty about the exact route of the storm. The bureau will update a track forecast for the storm every six hours until it hits the coast, and then every three hours.
The state is facing its third natural disaster and second cyclone in a month. Ex-tropical Cyclone Jasper caused more than a billion dollars of damage when floods hit north of Cairns in December.
The premier, Steven Miles, will convene a Queensland disaster management committee meeting on Tuesday as preparations continue.
“Our biggest concern, really, is the fatigue that our volunteers and our emergency services have been experiencing after those two big events,” he said.
On Saturday, residents celebrated the reopening of the Captain Cook Highway from Cairns to Port Douglas. The road had been closed after Jasper struck a month ago. Port Douglas was forced to turn its water supply off on Sunday due to a suspected leak.

The current low is expected to become tropical cyclone by Tuesday morning at the latest. Coastal residents can expect to see heavy rainfall and flash flooding by Wednesday.
Meanwhile, Queensland’s energy minister asked residents to act responsibly by avoiding unnecessary use of appliances during a statewide heatwave.
The state was expected to hit a new record for peak power demand on Monday – the first day of the school year in Queensland.The energy minister, Mick de Brenni, said authorities were confident there would be enough power to keep the lights on and air conditioning running, but warned the system would be pushed hard.
The grid was likely to hit peak use between 5.30pm and 7pm, and “significantly” exceed the previous record of 10,070 megawatts set in March 2023, de Brenni said.
He said the state-owned energy system was managing the situation carefully, and so far there was no reason not to use air conditioning.
“As the premier has indicated … we can assure Queenslanders that there remains adequate supply of power,” he said.
“So that means that they’re able to continue to use their air conditioners tonight and other appliance as needs be. Of course it will be very, very tight.
“For the time being, Queenslanders can rest assured that the lights will stay on [and] that we will have adequate supply to meet that demand.”
There was a heatwave warning active across most of Queensland, with the far west and parts of the north of the state under a severe heatwave warning.
Birdsville was expected to hit 44C on Monday and not fall below 33C overnight. Brisbane was forecast to hit 35C, with 55% humidity on Monday.

1SNDA85CJI_QIVT5UY254MQVQJ,The Trump revival will force Starmer to acknowledge the sheer folly of Brexit,Rafael Behr,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/24/keir-starmer-donald-trump-special-relationship,"British prime ministers do not, as a matter of protocol, express preferred outcomes in US elections. But there is no convention limiting the number of times the question can be asked. It won’t go away while Donald Trump is a contender for the White House.
A second Trump term can’t be brushed aside as the kind of hypothetical scenario on which leaders routinely withhold comment. Nor can it be cordoned off as foreign policy, which rarely influences UK general elections.
Aside from being a menace to the US’s constitutional order, Trump is an eager vandal of his country’s historic alliances. He has threatened to pull the US out of Nato, and is reported to have said that he would not come to Europe’s defence if it came under attack. He is an admirer of Vladimir Putin. In trade and diplomacy, threat is his only negotiating tool. He thinks laws make no demands of him but can be used as weapons against rivals.
Trump’s first term fractured the geopolitical settlement upheld by postwar institutions and rules-based clubs of (mostly) democratic states. A second term would shatter it. What remains of “the west” as a coherent concept would be dissolved in a sprawling transatlantic competition for the soul of European and American democracies. Parties committed to the defence of liberal constitutions would be traumatised, religious and ethnic nationalists emboldened.
It may not happen. The election is 10 months away. But the mere possibility is reason enough to legitimately probe how a British prime minister would respond. The question is uncomfortable for Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer in different ways.
Sunak is not Maga material. His taste in American politicians is old-fashioned, establishment conservative. On a recent trip to the US, he took time to meet Mitt Romney, a failed Republican presidential nominee and outspoken Trump critic. He swerved a meeting with Trump himself.
But Sunak’s party is steeped in Trumpian spirit. It has been blended and stirred into the Tories’ own Brexit home-brew since 2016, year of double ballot-box shocks on either side of the Atlantic.
The subsequent evolutions of the two phenomena don’t track each other exactly. One thing they share is ignominious failure on a scale too profound for their supporters to accept, resulting in an intensified cult of denial and zealotry. It should surprise no one that Boris Johnson and Liz Truss have endorsed the Trump revival. Sunak has neither the courage nor much incentive to repudiate that tendency.
Starmer has the opposite problem. Labour MPs, activists and supporters will be increasingly incensed by the monstrosity of Trump’s rhetoric and frustrated when their leader, invited to give a view, chooses diplomatic deflection over full-throated denunciation.
It would be imprudent for a man who intends to become prime minister around the time of the US election to go on the record as a sworn enemy of one of the candidates. British interests require functional engagement with the White House regardless of who sits in the Oval Office. But it is also wise to anticipate only dysfunction with a president who despises the values that Starmer cites as his motivation for entering politics. The vindictive despot and the former human rights lawyer are not destined to enjoy a “special relationship”.
The unavoidable consequence would be renewed focus on Britain’s relations with the rest of Europe. There would be an obvious alignment of strategic interests between an incoming Labour government and Europeans hungry for dependable allies.
But Brexit is a powerful spoiler of obvious EU-UK common interests. The most effective features of the deal that Johnson’s former Brexit minister David Frost negotiated – the gifts it keeps on giving to Eurosceptics – are the way it automatically ratchets the two sides ever further apart and its lack of any mechanism for putting that conveyor into reverse.
The trade and cooperation agreement (TCA) is the codification of the delusion that British prosperity demands regulatory divergence from the single market, coupled with a paranoid fear that any formal institutions for dialogue might be Trojan horses for reintegration. Anything that might one day facilitate cooperation in foreign policy, security, defence, energy, climate, migration – all the areas where it is rapidly becoming imperative that Britain and the EU collaborate – was ripped out of Theresa May’s Brexit model and ruled out of subsequent negotiations.
Johnson gave away Britain’s seat on the board of a trading superpower in exchange for a hill of worthless sovereignty beans. Sunak has tacitly acknowledged that most businesses prefer alignment with the giant market on their doorstep to totems of regulatory freedom. A planned bonfire of retained EU law was doused. Measures that celebrated divergence for the sake of it – the return to imperial units, for example – have been scrapped.
No leader of the current Tory party could openly question the ideological premises of the Brexit settlement and keep the job. A Labour one could, but Starmer has calculated that doing so too openly jeopardises his chances of becoming prime minister. The road to Downing Street passes through seats where even dry economic criticism of Brexit is misheard (or recast by Conservative campaigners) as a sneery disparagement of the people who voted for it.
Within those constraints, Labour’s European policy contains only hints of ambition, some more credible than others. One track involves using a scheduled review of the TCA, due by 2026, to negotiate better terms. This approach is forcefully discouraged by Brussels insiders on the grounds that a mechanism intended to lubricate existing arrangements can’t be hijacked and turned into something else.
More promising is talk of a UK-EU security pact, bringing some institutional scaffolding back to a relationship that currently consists mostly of ad hoc bilateral encounters.
One message that diplomats and trade experts have repeated to Labour’s shadow team in private – and it appears to have sunk in – is that a new government can’t expect concessions to materialise out of pure relief in Brussels that Britain is no longer run by Tories. Another is that Brexit is not a problem for the EU in the way it is for Britain. Johnson’s deal is so bad from a UK perspective that, in terms of trade, it doesn’t leave much that Brussels could want from any renegotiation.
But the calculus is somewhat different in the shadow of a Trump revival. The case for a more European Britain gets easier to make at home and the strategic promise of more Britain in Europe gains potential resonance in Brussels, Paris and Berlin.
The year 2024 feels both a long way from 2016 and disturbingly like a sequel. The Brexit referendum asked a profound question about what it means for Britain to be a major European democracy outside the EU. Once we have left, what is the actual destination? The Tories have had eight years to supply an answer and delivered nothing but fantasy, fear and failure. It won’t be explicit in the campaign but this year’s general election asks the exact same question again. It is Labour’s turn to answer.

1V3LVW4HN4_BHENY5FHKU8ZKUA,"Michigan GOP chair Kristina Karamo rightly ousted, say RNC lawyers",Alice Herman,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/25/rnc-kristina-karamo-michigan-republican,"The Republican National Committee’s top attorneys have declared they believe the Michigan Republican chair, Kristina Karamo, was legitimately ousted from her position earlier this month, ending weeks of silence from the national party on a leadership crisis that has engulfed state Republicans.
The factional split within the Michigan Republican party, over ideological differences as well as personal ones, has sown chaos with just months to go before the 2024 presidential election. In recent weeks, tensions escalated, with two feuding groups within the state party claiming to be its legitimate leaders.
RNC general counsel Michael Whatley and chief counsel Matthew Raymer wrote in a letter obtained by the Guardian that they believed that an early January vote by state party officials to remove Karamo, who made her mark peddling election conspiracies after the 2020 election, as their chair was indeed legitimate – in spite of Karamo’s insistence that it was not.
“Based upon its initial review, it appears to the counsel’s office that Ms Karamo was properly removed in accordance with the Michigan GOP bylaws on January 6,” they wrote in a letter to Karamo and Pete Hoekstra, who was elected to replace her by party members who engineered her ouster. They noted that the issue was not yet settled and that the RNC’s position was not final or binding.
The RNC attorneys’ opinion offers Michigan and national Republicans guidance as they head to their winter meeting in Las Vegas at the end of the month. But it is not a definitive resolution in the factional dispute that has festered over the last year within their state party. The letter also declared that neither Karamo nor Hoekstra would be “credentialed as Michigan GOP chair” when those meetings convene.
Until now the RNC had remained silent over the feud, especially since its current chair, Ronna McDaniel, is herself a former chair of the Michigan Republican party.
But Karamo and her allies insist that even a ruling from the RNC won’t remove them from leadership. In a 25 January email to precinct delegates, the Michigan GOP general counsel – a Karamo ally who was also removed in the 6 January vote – wrote that he acknowledged the RNC letter was “authentic”, but added: “I do not care because their opinion is irrelevant to any resolution.”
When Karamo took office nearly a year ago, she inherited an organization that was broke and divided – and in her year as chair, the party’s problems have worsened. Karamo, who embodies the GOP’s shift into stranger and more extreme political territory, made a name for herself as a vocal proponent of Trump’s false election claims, pushing election conspiracy theories as well as even wilder ideas (like claiming Jay-Z is a “satanist” and yoga is a “satanic ritual” ) during her 2022 run for secretary of state.
She was defeated in the general election but refused to concede, then beat a Trump-backed nominee for state party chair who had voiced similar campaign conspiracy theories last February after she promised to revitalize the state party’s moribund fundraising operation.
But the flow of grassroots cash Karamo promised never came. Divisions deepened in county chapters over the growth of extreme factions on the right, with physical altercations breaking out on multiple occasions. The party under her leadership got wrapped up in litigation. Even though the party was nearly broke, under Karamo’s leadership state GOP took out a loan to cover a more than $100,000 speaking fee to bring Jim Caviezel, a celebrity figure in the QAnon movement and the starring actor in The Passion of the Christ, to the Mackinac Republican Leadership Conference in September.
By the time a group of Michigan GOP committee members moved to oust Karamo on 6 January, tensions had been brewing for months.
As the RNC stayed silent, other powerful Michigan and national Republicans weighed in.
The National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), the official party organization for Republican House candidates, expressed frustrations about the party’s spending last week in a letter to the Michigan GOP general counsel under Karamo, Daniel Hartman.
“I will not deny that we are growing increasingly alarmed by reports that the Michigan GOP is in dire financial straits and grossly mismanaging their limited funds,” wrote NRCC general counsel Erin Clark, in a letter obtained by the Guardian. The Michigan GOP, Clark admonished, was not acting like a party that “adheres to conservative principles; or frankly, one that has the desire or ability to elect Republicans to office”.

Congressman John James, a Michigan Republican up for re-election in a contested district in 2024, nodded to the leadership crisis on X on Saturday.
“Congrats to Pete Hoekstra on being elected as the chair of MRP,” wrote James. “I look forward to working with you to put America First, hold our battleground #MI10 seat, and deliver victories for conservatives up and down the ballot this November.”
Karamo’s opponents say they believe a new party chair will bring unity, and, most critically in an election year, the return of major donors such as the DeVoses, a Michigan family that lavishes donations upon conservative causes, into the party’s good graces. They are betting on Hoekstra, the former ambassador to the Netherlands under the Trump administration, to bridge the divide between the party’s activist base and its more traditional donor class.
But if one goal of Karamo’s challengers is to reunify the party, they may have to assuage local dissent.
“They should have come to us and asked for our opinion,” said Mary Harp, a precinct delegate in the Oakland county Republican party, the largest Republican party chapter in the state. Harp said she did not support Karamo in her run for GOP chair last year, but expressed frustration in the way Karamo was removed, saying it lacked the input of lower ranking members of the party.
“A lot of us are going to have a hard time going forward supporting the state party,” she warned."
26DVWT3IZC_YR6HCAQANR0QJCV,Home Office U-turns on policy to restrict help for trafficking victims,Diane Taylor,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/24/home-office-u-turns-policy-help-trafficking-victims-braverman-rights,"The Home Office has performed a U-turn on a policy to deprive some modern slavery victims of protection from traffickers.
Human rights campaigners and lawyers representing trafficking victims have welcomed the government’s change of heart, which they say reinstates vital protections to vulnerable people.
A high court hearing, which began last year and has concluded, warned that trafficking victims were at risk of rights violations such as slavery, servitude and forced labour, if the policy introduced by the former home secretary Suella Braverman on 31 January continued.
The policy introduced a change stipulating that potential trafficking victims who had a criminal conviction were no longer automatically assessed for the support trafficking victims can access. This support may include accommodation, counselling and financial assistance.
Campaigners argued that this exclusion could force some victims back into the hands of their traffickers. They include people forced to cultivate cannabis and convicted in connection with this, people forced into sex work and county lines victims.
The policy is known as public order disqualification (POD). Three potential trafficking victims who had received PODs due to criminal convictions challenged the policy. There was no mention in the policy of caseworkers being expected to consider the risk of re-trafficking if they decided to disqualify victims from getting support.
Those who got involved in the first challenge to the home secretary’s policy are from Vietnam, Poland and Romania. They argued that victims of trafficking were at real risk of being re-trafficked.
In the course of the case, the Home Office disclosed that of 253 decisions made about this group of trafficking victims since the policy came into force, 252 had been rejected for support.
Lawyers representing the victims argued that the policy breached human rights laws, including the prohibition against slavery.
A hearing had been scheduled in the high court for 6-8 February but weeks before the Home Office has withdrawn the policy and issued new guidance, which requires caseworkers to assess all trafficking victims for the risk of being re-trafficked before any support is withdrawn from them as a result of having convictions.
According to the amended policy, “where it is found that there is a real and immediate risk that cannot be mitigated and prevents the issuing of the public order disqualification decision then that individual is not disqualified and will continue to be eligible for the support and protections of the national referral mechanism” (the support mechanism for trafficking victims). This amendment reinstates an important protection that Braverman’s policy had removed.
Maria Thomas, of Duncan Lewis solicitors, who challenged the Home Office policy, said: “This policy has been substantially amended and now includes a comprehensive framework for assessing risk of victims being re-trafficked before a disqualification decision is made.
“This is a big win for foreign national survivors who are being systematically punished for criminal acts committed as a result of their exploitation.”

In a previous high court challenge to another part of the trafficking policy, the home secretary performed a U-turn on the type of evidence people were expected to provide to prove they had been trafficked.
Maya Esslemont, the director of After Exploitation, also welcomed the Home Office’s U-turn, saying: “Huge numbers of modern slavery survivors are victimised in criminal industries such as marijuana cultivation, pickpocketing or gang crime.
“As with all trafficking cases, survivors of criminal exploitation are subjected to various forms of violence throughout their ordeal, and they absolutely deserve support after taking the brave step to flee abuse. The POD policy risked worsening many survivors’ chances of recovery, including those forced to commit crime by traffickers.”
A Home Office spokesperson said: “The public order disqualification is an important tool that ensures that those who commit serious criminal offences are not able to misuse the support and protections offered to modern slavery victims.
“We keep all policies and procedures under review and regularly update the modern slavery statutory guidance to ensure potential victims of modern slavery are appropriately identified and are provided with the support they need to begin rebuilding their lives.”"

Haley leaned in: “Do we really want to have two presidential candidates in their 80s?”
Biden, the 81-year-old Democratic president, is coasting to his party’s nomination and Trump, the 77-year-old former president, is marching toward the Republican one as the field narrows and he consolidates support from across the party. But Haley, who celebrated her 52nd birthday hopscotching the state on Saturday, insisted there was a different – viable – path.
Haley, the former “Tea Party governor” of South Carolina who served as Trump’s first United Nations ambassador, has staked her presidential aspirations on a strong showing in the first-in-the-nation primary.
“New Hampshire is do-or-die for Nikki Haley,” said Mike Dennehy, a veteran Republican strategist in New Hampshire who worked on John McCain’s winning presidential primary campaigns in the state in 2000 and 2008 and is unaffiliated. “She needs to go all in and speak specifically to independent voters who want change in this country.”
Trump demolished his rivals in the Iowa caucuses. Haley finished third, behind the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, who dropped out of the race on Sunday and threw his support behind Trump, the latest sign of Republicans closing ranks around the former president.
A Suffolk University/Boston Globe/NBC10 Boston daily tracking poll of New Hampshire voters on Monday had Trump ahead of Haley by double digits, 57% to 38%, with his lead ticking slightly higher in recent days.
A competitive night in the Granite state, she hopes, will deliver enough momentum to vault her campaign into her home state of South Carolina, which holds the south’s first presidential primary next month.
The secretary of state is predicting record turnout for the Republican primary. And unlike in Iowa, where arctic temperatures likely dampened turnout, Tuesday’s forecast in New Hampshire is several degrees above freezing, or, as locals joke, “shorts weather”.
High turnout is expected to favor Haley, who is relying on outsized support from the nearly 40% of registered voters who do not belong to a political party and can choose to participate in either primary. New Hampshire’s famously freethinking independents have long injected a degree of unpredictability into the state’s contest, setting it apart from socially conservative Iowa.
Haley’s best chance of wresting the nomination from Trump may depend on voters like Marie Mulroy, 76, a self-described political moderate from Manchester who despises Trump and voted for Biden in 2020.
“I’m sick of it,” Mulroy said. “Two incumbents. Two lame ducks. I’m tired of the forced choices.” On Tuesday, she’ll choose a Republican ballot and vote for the candidate she has seen on the campaign trail 12 times and believes could be the nation’s first female president.
Though Mulroy disagrees with Haley on some social issues, particularly abortion, she is impressed by Haley’s approach to foreign policy and the federal debt. Importantly, Mulroy added, she was confident that if Haley were the Republican nominee and lost the election, she would concede. “We won’t have a January 6 with her,” Mulroy said.
Haley will also need support from conservative voters like Erin Williams of Newmarket. Williams supported Trump in 2020 but says it’s time to usher in a younger generation of leaders. Drawn to Haley’s “energy and no-nonsense approach”, Williams cringed at the possibility of a Biden-Trump repeat.
“I don’t even want to think about that,” she said after Haley’s Sunday night rally at a high school in Exeter.
On Sunday, just two days before voters go to the polls, DeSantis’s departure set the stage for the one-on-one showdown with Trump in New Hampshire that Haley has been seeking.
Moments after DeSantis announced his departure Haley shared the news with the mix of patrons and supporters gathered at Brown’s Lobster Pound on New Hampshire’s seacoast.
“It’s now one fella and one lady left,” she said, sending the crowd into a frenzy of cheers and applause. “May the best woman win.”
Haley has invested heavily in New Hampshire, where Trump is potentially more vulnerable in the highly educated, less religious state. Deep-pocketed allies have helped knock doors and troll Trump on her behalf.
SFA Fund Inc, a Haley aligned Super Pac, taunted Trump with mobile billboards outside one of his rallies this week. A spokesperson for the group said the ads were targeting “Trump supporters who are tired of losing”.
Americans for Prosperity Action, the political network backed by the conservative billionaire Charles Koch, has contacted more than 210,000 voters in the state since endorsing Haley in November, said Greg Moore, the group’s New Hampshire director.
In a briefing with reporters, he said that those conversations made it clear that, true to form in a state known for “breaking late”, many voters were still making up their minds.
“Some of the narrative is that it’s all moderates for Haley and all conservatives for Trump. I know that’s not true,” Moore said. “She is pulling from both conservatives and moderates.”
A Monmouth poll released on Monday found that the number of registered independents who planned to take a Republican ballot has increased from 52% in November to 63%, suggesting a “measurable influx of Democratic-leaning independents” in Tuesday’s primary.
Haley is walking a fine line in icy New Hampshire, chasing both independent voters who despise Trump and conservatives who voted for him but are open to an alternative.
The effort has earned her the backing of New Hampshire’s popular Republican governor, Chris Sununu, who has escorted her around the state. On Sunday, Haley won the endorsement of the Union-Leader, a state newspaper which praised her as a candidate who could “run circles around the dinosaurs from the last two administrations, backwards and in heels”.
“She has the difficult task of trying to reach out to two very different parts of the electorate,” said Dante Scala, a professor of political science and international affairs at the University of New Hampshire. “There’s a real chasm.”

In stops around the state, Haley has played up her conservative credentials and hawkish foreign policy, rebutting Trump’s attacks on her, with vows to crack down on the southern border, stand up to China and never raise taxes.
Early in her 2024 campaign, Haley stepped gingerly around the topic of her former boss. But with Trump holding firmly to his lead in New Hampshire – and several of her would-be supporters in the state clamoring for more – Haley began to confront him head-on.
On the eve of Tuesday’s contest, she questioned Trump’s mental acuity, accused him of spreading “lies” about her record, berating his relationship with dictators and slamming his support from “Washington insiders”.
Yet she continues to sidestep questions about Trump’s web of legal troubles, which have only hardened the extraordinary loyalty he inspires from the Republican base. As president, she said she would pardon Trump if he’s convicted but not preemptively. Separately, she has committed to supporting the Republican nominee.
One of her campaign’s most consistent knocks on Trump is that he’s bad for Republicans. During his time in office, the party lost the House, Senate and White House during his time in office. They also repeatedly lost New Hampshire in the general election. Even then, she has left some of the sharpest attacks to her allies.
“I am tired of losing,” Sununu, his voice hoarse from days of campaigning, told a crowd in Exeter. “I’m tired of losers. And I’m sure as hell tired of Donald Trump.”
Trump hopes to extinguish Haley’s path with a decisive victory on Tuesday before the race turns to an even friendlier contest in Nevada.
“We need big margins,” Trump said at a rally in Manchester.
A memo by the Trump campaign argued that Haley “must win” in New Hampshire. If she doesn’t, it said, she had two choices: suspend her campaign and endorse Trump or prepare to be “absolutely DEMOLISHED and EMBARASSED [sic] in her home state of South Carolina”.
Haley has vowed to ride on. Her campaign scheduled a rally in South Carolina on Wednesday, 24 hours after polls close in New Hampshire.
Part of Haley’s pitch is that she is more electable than the former president. She frequently points to polling that shows her beating Biden in a hypothetical matchup. But there is a creeping sense that the race for the Republican nomination is a foregone conclusion no matter what happens in New Hampshire.
In Manchester, Carter Crumley, 60, a retired engineer and registered independent, said Haley had “a lot of great qualities” but felt she didn’t have a chance. He plans to vote for Trump.
“You don’t just want to waste a vote because you like someone,” he said. “You want them to be electable.”
Haley is embracing her status as an underdog, reminding voters that she’d been underestimated and counted out for much of her career only to prove the “fellas” wrong: besting a 30-year Republican incumbent to win a seat in the state legislature and surging past a field of more prominent Republicans when she ran for governor in 2010.
And unlike Trump’s rowdy rallies, Haley has been doing the time-honored work of retail politics that New Hampshire voters expect – and demand – of their candidates. In recent days, she has answered interrogatories at Mary Ann’s diner in Amherst, tossed back a Guinness at the Peddler’s Daughter Irish Bar in Nashua before zipping to Chick-fil-A in the governor’s red mustang.
At a seafood restaurant in Epping, Haley dropped down to sign a drawing made for her by five-year-old Cora. The girl’s mother, who gave only her first name, Jessica, said her daughter was drawn to Haley because she was the only woman in the stack of campaign literature flooding their mailbox.
As for herself, she had hoped to support the former Arkansas governor, Asa Hutchinson, who dropped out of the presidential race after his anti-Trump candidacy failed to break through. Now, she said she will follow Hutchinson’s lead and support Haley.
In a sign of the times, protesters have disrupted multiple Haley’s events in recent days. As supporters booed, Haley quieted the crowd to say that she is always “happy to see a protester” because her husband, who is deployed, and other armed service members are serving to protect their right to free speech. It is one of her strongest applause lines.
An electric crowd filled a high school gymnasium in Exeter for Haley’s final campaign stop on Sunday. Her campaign shot T-shirts into the audience. A young supporter danced on stage.
“Can you hear that sound?” Haley asked as she began her remarks. “That’s the sound of a two-person race.”
But it was Judy Sheindlin, the straight-talking television arbiter known and loved by American viewers as Judge Judy, who delivered Haley’s closing argument.
“Please, New Hampshire. Use your brains and your heart,” Sheindlin said. “Bring her home on Tuesday.”

28ULRPQATW_V7F8ISLA18HTNVH,‘It’s a no-brainer’: what voters in upcoming Dunkley byelection say about Labor’s stage-three tax cut changes,Adeshola Ore,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/25/what-voters-in-dunkley-byelection-say-about-labor-stage-three-tax-cuts-changes,"Ilene Jones’s wishlist for a tax cut is simple – more money to spend on school fees, a laptop for her son and groceries.
“It’s just the basics. It’s not extravagant,” she says.
“It’s a no-brainer that we get a tax cut, not the people who are already high-income earners.”
The 49-year-old retail worker and mother from Mount Eliza, who falls in the less than $150,000 a year income bracket, is set to reap a boosted tax cut under the Albanese government’s stage-three tax cuts overhaul alongside more than 13 million Australians.
The changes are designed to shift more of the benefit of tax cuts to low- and middle-income earners from those on higher wages, amid cost-of-living pressures.

Jones’s views were mirrored by a majority of the dozen voters in the Victorian electorate of Dunkley that Guardian Australia spoke to on Thursday, less than six weeks from a crucial federal byelection that will become the first test of the support in the community for Labor’s changes to the Morrison government scheme.
Voters across the electorate in Melbourne’s south-east, which includes Frankston, Seaford and Mount Eliza, are feeling the cost-of-living bite and residents expressed relief that tax respite could be on the way.
The small business owner and mother Holly Evans, 36, from Seaford is also set to reap an increased tax cut under the changes.
“A lot of my friends also fit into this category [earning under $150,000] and a lot of us will see it as a relief because we’re hit the hardest with the cost-of-living increases,” she said.
“For a long time, middle-income earners really haven’t earned a lot so it’s a logical solution. It helps balance out the power.
“Anything helps at the moment.”
Dunkley has a median weekly household income of $1,718 – lower than the national average of $1,746, according to the latest census data from 2021 – and a median monthly mortgage repayment of $1,898 – higher than the Australian average of $1,863, according to the 2021 census.
The artist and teacher Nic Kirkman, 49, is set to receive an increased tax cut and said it would help her invest in her business.
“Hopefully I can get in a tax bracket where you can charge me more,” she said.
Matthew Aris, 52, from Frankston said he and his partner, who both earn more than $150,000, would be about $5,000 worse off under the proposed changes.
“It won’t have a huge impact. We’re high-income earners,” he said.
But Aris, a Labor voter, said he was disappointed the Albanese government had backtracked on a pledge taken to the last election.
Anthony Albanese went to the 2022 federal election promising to keep the former Coalition government’s legislated stage-three tax cuts unchanged.

“People who were promised money aren’t getting money,” he said.
“When you don’t keep promises you lose trust.”
Aris said it was a “cross against the Albanese government” but said he would still vote Labor at the byelection.
The opposition has vowed to fight the policy change, labelling it a broken promise. Peter Dutton on Thursday demanded Albanese call an election to win a fresh mandate for the revamped income tax plan, saying the changes were significant.
Speaking at the National Press Club in Canberra, Albanese said he was being “upfront” with Australians because it was responsible to change policy when the economic landscape had changed.
“When lower- and middle-income earners are saying that they are under financial pressure … as prime minister, I have a responsibility to act and that is what we are doing,” he said.
Among the voters in Dunkley who opposed the changes was retiree Jeanette, 71, from Frankston.
She said despite voting Labor since the Hawke era, she would not back the party at the byelection, citing the stage-three tax cuts as among her reasons, although she was not personally affected.
“A promise he’s gone back on is the core point people will be upset more. If you can’t stick to one promise, you won’t stick to any,” she said.
The overhaul of the stage-three tax cuts means those earning less than $150,000 will benefit from the changes, including workers earning less than $45,000 who were slated to miss out altogether under the Morrison government’s stage-three plan. Meanwhile, people earning more than $150,000 will receive a smaller tax cut.
The byelection on 2 March was called after the death of the Labor MP Peta Murphy in December.
Labor has selected the former teacher and community leader Jodie Belyea as its candidate, while the Liberals have chosen the Frankston mayor turned candidate Nathan Conroy.
Labor currently holds Dunkley on a margin of 6.27%."
2CRHVJU7ZB_BQCID6KCD2UKIZ9,The Most Precious of Goods review – a stark fairytale set against the Holocaust,David Jays,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/jan/25/the-most-precious-of-goods-review-marylebone-theatre-london,"If writing a poem after Auschwitz is barbaric, as the philosopher Theodor Adorno famously said, how about a fairytale? Can the consoling archetypes of a simple story address the Shoah? That’s the challenge in this evening drawn from a 2019 novella by Jean-Claude Grumberg, a rapt piece of storytelling delivered by Samantha Spiro.
Spiro settles on a faded armchair, opens up a big red story book and begins: “Once upon a time.” Here is a wintry forest, a childless woodcutter and his wife, a baby separated from her twin and raised as another’s. It might all lead to happy ever after if it wasn’t for the unyielding context. A train passes the forest, speeding French Jews to a concentration camp. The baby is flung from the train by her father in a desperate bid to save her. The woodcutter’s wife must protect this most precious bundle against an antisemitic husband, snooping neighbours and callous military.
Translation and direction are by Nicolas Kent, best known for tribunal plays based on inquiries into Stephen Lawrence’s murder, Bloody Sunday and the Grenfell Tower fire. They favour stark fact and plain staging: in a different key, this piece does the same. Beside Carly Brownbridge’s stage design, strewn with dead leaves, silhouettes of bare trees are built from rows of serial numbers, like those tattooed on prisoners in the camps. The most theatrical flourish is the accompaniment by cellist Gemma Rosefield: her own music is sombre and spiky, but over-familiar melodies also stipple the piece.
Spiro, her voice crackling and confiding, her eyes beetle-dark with worry, conducts us through the tale with terrible urgency. She weaves together the naive tropes and bleak horrors of Grumberg’s tale, from the wife radiantly welcoming the baby to the father’s terrible action: “don’t choose, don’t think.”
Spiro is leaving the stage when she turns back, as if responding to a question. Is this a true story? “No, not at all.” How could this cruel parental decision and so monstrous a context be true: “no ash, no tears, nothing.” A projection appears after the curtain call, detailing what happened to France’s Jews and Grumberg’s own family. You want truth? Here it is.
At Marylebone theatre, London, until 3 February."
2DENF3IC4V_QOH5JTI786SD689,Harris attacks Trump over Roe v Wade at first campaign rally with Biden,Carter Sherman,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/23/kamala-harris-campaign-trump-roe-v-wade-abortion-rights,"Joe Biden and Kamala Harris kicked off their first joint campaign rally of 2024 in Manassas, Virginia, on Tuesday, with a focused plea for voters to send them back to the White House on one key issue: protecting abortion rights.
This fight over abortion, they said, is about freedom.
“Extremists have proposed and passed laws that criminalized doctors and punished women. Laws that make no exception even for rape or incest,” said Harris, who spoke first, before the US president.
“And let us all agree: one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do with her body.”
Virginia was a telling first stop for the 2024 campaign, where Biden and Harris were accompanied by first lady, Jill Biden, and the second gentleman Doug Emhoff. Last year, during the state’s elections, Virginia Republicans failed to take control of the state legislature after campaigning on a 15-week abortion ban. Seven other states have also voted directly on abortion-related ballot referendums since Roe fell at the hand of the right-leaning US supreme court in 2022; in each case, including in red states, abortion rights supporters won.
Now, Biden and Harris are betting that outrage over the decision to overturn Roe – the result of the Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization case out of Mississippi – will send them back to the White House.
“I don’t think this court and the Maga Republicans have any clue about the power of women in America,” Biden told the crowd, referring to the loyal base of supporters of Donald Trump and his Make America Great Again election slogan. “I don’t think they have any clue. But they’re about to find out.”
Stories of women who say they were denied medically necessary abortions have been particularly powerful in sustaining post-Roe outrage. One of those women, Amanda Zurawski, took the stage to introduce Biden. Zurawski is the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit in Texas that now involves dozens of women who say the state’s ban blocked them from getting abortions.
“What I went through was nothing short of barbaric,” Zurawski told the crowd. “And it didn’t need to happen. But it did, because of Donald Trump. Over and over again, Donald Trump brags about killing Roe v Wade. It is unthinkable to me that anyone could cheer on these abortion bans that nearly took my life.”
Although the Republican primary was still unfolding in New Hampshire on Tuesday, Trump was the clear and repeated target of the rally, as the frontrunner for the Republican nomination. Trump appointed three of the US supreme court justices who overturned Roe. While he was first running for president in 2016, he also suggested that women who get abortions should be punished in some way – a stance that he later walked back, but was repeatedly mentioned at Tuesday’s rally.
“Donald Trump and Maga Republicans, including the speaker of the House, are hellbent on going even further,” Biden said, referring to the hard-right Republican speaker, Mike Johnson. He added: “As long as I have power of the presidency, if Congress were to pass a national abortion ban, I would veto it.”

Further abortion bans are not the only threats on the table, Biden said. Because the Roe decision descends from a line of supreme court decisions that protect the right to privacy, overturning that decision also threatens access to birth control and same-sex marriage. He promised to codify the protections of Roe into law, as he has said in the past.
However, that promise is unlikely to come true anytime soon, given that Congress has shown little interest in moving substantively forward on bills that would enshrine similar protections as those that were in Roe.
Protesters interrupted Biden’s speech eight times. One man, who was carrying a Palestinian flag, shouted: “How many kids have you killed?” A woman later interrupted Biden by shouting: “Israel kills two mothers every hour.”
They were escorted out of the crowd. During each interruption, the crowd behind the speakers started to chant “Four more years!” and “Let’s go, Joe!”"
2I4P0C1R1P_X8EGDU2QDO79Q1R,Alarm as first uranium mine in years opens near Grand Canyon,Maanvi Singh,_,20230123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/23/us-uranium-mine-grand-canyon,"A uranium mine in Arizona located just 7 miles south of the Grand Canyon national park has begun operations, one of the first in the US to open in eight years.
The opening of the Pinyon Plain mine comes as the US seeks to boost domestic production of the mineral needed for nuclear energy and accelerate divesting from fossil fuels.
But the mine has faced decades of fierce opposition from the Havasupai Tribe, who fear that its operations could contaminate its sole source of drinking water and damage important cultural sites.
“It’s a very, very sad situation – it’s upsetting a lot of tribes in this region,” said Carletta Tilousi, a former Havasupai council member who has been leading the tribe’s opposition to uranium mining in the south-west. “But I think we all knew this was eventually going to happen.”
The Pinyon Plain mine lies within the new Baaj Nwaavjo I’tah Kukveni national monument that Joe Biden designated last year, and is owned and operated by Energy Fuels Inc.
Uranium mining in the region had ceased for years, amid a federal ban on new mining claims around the Grand Canyon. Permitted mines unaffected by the ban sat dormant due to low uranium prices.
But an agreement at Cop28 to triple nuclear energy production as a means to reduce greenhouse gas emissions has boosted demand. Energy Fuels Inc began operations at the Pinyon Plain mine in December and has also begun ramping up production at its Pandora and La Sal mines in Utah, near Moab.
The company cited rising uranium prices in a statement about its activities, as well as “increased buying interest from US nuclear utilities, US and global government policies supporting nuclear energy to address global climate change, and the need to reduce US reliance on Russian and Russian-controlled uranium and nuclear fuel” among their reasons to ramp-up production. The US still buys uranium from Russia, despite sanctions imposed after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, but lawmakers have been seeking to divest from the country.
Pinyon Plain is expected to be open for 28 months and produce 1.57m lbs of uranium.
Energy Fuels insists that its operations will not affect aquifers in the region, and points out that state regulators have determined that the mine will not impact local water supplies.
The Arizona department of environmental quality (ADEQ) in 2022 issued an “aquifer protection permit” to the company, after it showed it was using the latest systems to prevent discharge from filtering into groundwater reserves. “There is no science to support the contention that groundwater is at risk,” Curtis Moore, a spokesperson with Energy Fuel, told the Guardian.
Prior to issuing the permit, “ADEQ professionals spent more than one thousand hours conducting a comprehensive review of this extensive technical record” before determining that adverse impacts to groundwater were “extremely unlikely”, a spokesperson for the agency said. The agency reviewed environmental studies, permits, engineering and hydrological reports over 30 years information from the US Geological Survey, to conclude that the rock layers between the mine and the Redwall-Muav aquifer that the Havasupai Tribe relies on are “highly impermeable”.
For the Havasupai Nation, such reassurances are not enough, said Tilousi. In the four corners region of the south-west, the uranium mining in the 20th century littered the Navajo Nation with abandoned mines and tainted aquifers, leaving a generation of Diné workers and their families with lung cancer and other respiratory illness. The Havasupai and other Indigenous communities are weary, she said.
“We’re not willing to risk the livelihood of my community – of 767 tribal members – for the sake of one mining company,” she said. One mishap or misestimation could risk permanently contaminating the sole water source for the tribe, she argued, in a drought-stricken region where water supplies are already limited.

The tribe, as well as local environmental groups, argue that there’s been no extensive study of how groundwater in the region moves and that a plan to undertake long-term study of water impacts first proposed by the Obama administration had stalled.
And, they say, past incidents at the site are cause for concern. In 2016, mine-shaft drilling by Energy Fuel pierced shallow aquifers, causing a surge of contaminated water. In 2017, when the facility’s evaporation pond approached capacity, miners spayed contaminated water into the nearby Kaibab national forest.
“We encountered shallow, isolated aquifers when we drove the shaft, but this was planned and anticipated by us and the regulators,” Moore said, disputing that the 2016 incident was an issue. In 2017, he said the company swiftly responded and adapted systems to prevent such an occurrence in the future.
The mine also abuts two of the tribe’s most sacred sites – Wii’i Gdwiisa and Mat Taav Tiivjunmdva. The tribe’s creation stories centre on those sites, but fall outside their trust land borders, after they were evicted from the Grand Canyon National Park in 1919.
Biden’s national monument declaration last year prevented new mining claims within the borders of Baaj Nwaavjo I’tah Kukveni, but due to the stipulations of an 1872 mining law, mines under development prior to the federal government’s projections were exempted from the ban. The Gold Rush-era law, which still governs mining operations, allowed miners to seize public lands without regard for whether the sites had been home to Indigenous people – and environmental groups are continuing to push for its reform.
“There are so many reasons why this mine doesn’t belong where it is,” said Amber Reimondo, the energy director with the Grand Canyon Trust, an environmental group focused on protecting the region. “And the fact that it is allowed to operate is a stark example of the weaknesses in our regulatory system.”
Across the south-west, local communities and tribes have been pushing back against uranium mining proposals, including in Utah, where the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe is concerned about air pollution from a nearby Energy Fuels mill facility. Similar tensions have arisen around lithium mining in the west, as a need for the metal in clean energy components grows.
“In the rush to move away from fossil fuels, we are neglecting communities and recreating cycles of harm,” Reimondo said. “In order to have a truly just clean energy future, we have to actually work with Indigenous communities.”"
2KYBDDRUX0_SAMJ56JINTKF85A,Majority verdicts in England and Wales brought in ‘partly for racial and class reasons’,Haroon Siddique,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2024/jan/24/majority-verdicts-england-wales-brought-partly-racial-class-reasons,"The introduction of majority verdicts in criminal trials in England and Wales was partly motivated by a desire to dilute the influence of minority ethnic people and the labouring classes serving on juries, according to research.
The study, by the miscarriage of justice charity Appeal, said that while the widely accepted narrative for allowing majority verdicts – introduced by parliament in 1967 – as opposed to unanimous verdicts, was that it would prevent jury “nobbling” (corruption), there was another reason that was more disreputable.
Delving into government files and other archival materials, the authors of the report, published in the journal Race & Class, found little evidence that “nobbling” was widespread, but that “an increase in eligible jurors from different racial and class backgrounds led to a perceived decline in the ‘calibre’ of jurors – reflective of wider public anxieties about Commonwealth immigration, Black Power and white disenfranchisement”.
The report, Majority Jury Verdicts in England and Wales: A Vestige of White Supremacy?, draws parallels with the 2020 landmark case in the US, Ramos v Louisiana, that outlawed majority verdicts for serious crimes amid recognition of their racist origins, including evidence that they were introduced in Louisiana in 1898 to suppress the votes of black jurors following the abolition of slavery.
In the US, where Oregon was the only other state that allowed majority verdicts at the time of the supreme court ruling, it is argued that majority verdicts remove a safeguard against wrongful convictions, the authors said. By contrast, in the UK, it has been argued that majority verdicts could safeguard against juror bias by preventing one or two prejudiced jurors from dictating decision-making.
Appeal said wrongful convictions by majority verdicts, which allow up to two jurors out of 12 to dissent or one where there are 10 or 11 jurors, in England and Wales included the cases of Andrew Malkinson and Winston Trew, one of the Oval Four.
Nisha Waller of Appeal, who co-authored the report with Naima Sakande, said: “The references to women, racialised minority people and the working class as less capable of performing jury service are not prejudicial comments of the past – they are a relic in today’s jury system.
“While juries are hailed as the fairest component of the legal system, restrictions on doing research with real juries in real cases prevents a definitive assessment of their fairness.
“Our commitment to the good value of juries does not exempt them from rigorous scrutiny. The potential silencing of certain jurors’ voices through majority convictions should be a concern for us all. Unless we are saying that dissenting jurors are always unreasonable, their votes inherently represent reasonable doubt.”
In 1963, the Home Office set up the departmental committee on jury service (“the Morris committee”) at a time when juror eligibility depended on householder status but national property revaluations had recently qualified people from more diverse backgrounds for that status, the report says.
“Written evidence to the committee was submitted from many civil society organisations, trade unions, legal membership bodies, government departments and individuals, many of whom were concerned that an expanded juror pool, which included the ‘labouring classes’, immigrants and ‘coloureds’, would taint the ‘calibre’ of decision-making and educational aptitude necessary for jury duty,” the authors write.
In the House of Commons, MPs variously expressed support for the end of the requirement of unanimity because of the end of the “middle-class, middle-brain jury” and “a situation where everyone … good, bad or indifferent, is a possible juror”.
The report said majority verdicts accounted for about 15% of annual convictions after a crown court trial, “meaning a significant number of defendants are convicted each year where at least one juror was not sure of their guilt”.
Trew, an expert adviser to the project and who was “fitted up” by a racist police officer, said he was fascinated by its findings. “I have since wondered whether the 10-2 majority verdict was the result of the two black jurors on our jury not accepting the police’s untrue version of events,” he said. “I suppose I’ll never know for sure.”"
2PAVQ9MGUZ_EE5FUF4HWE4RS2V,"If you think it’s anti-vaxxers driving measles cases up in the UK, think again – and look to Scotland",Devi Sridhar,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/24/anti-vaxxers-measles-uk-scotland-england-wales-2023,"The UK was once so good at dealing with measles that in 2017 and 2021 the World Health Organization declared that we had successfully attained “elimination status” for the disease, meaning that not one endemic case had been detected in the prior year. But those days are over, with more than 200 children diagnosed with measles in England and Wales in the last four weeks of 2023. The UK Health Security Agency has declared a national incident not only because of the cases appearing, but also owing to overall low MMR vaccination rates, which leave a very large population of children at risk of infection.
Incredibly, about 25% of children in parts of London enter school unvaccinated. NHS England data suggests that more than 3.4 million children under 16 across the country are unvaccinated. This puts them at considerable risk, and measles is incredibly infectious. One person can infect about 12 to 18 others, and it spreads through respiratory means, such as coughing, sneezing and breathing. If about 95% of the population is vaccinated the virus stops circulating as it can’t find susceptible hosts, but it appears vaccination rates in many areas are below that number.
Just two doses of vaccine should confer lifelong sterilising immunity, meaning those fully vaccinated are not only protected from infection but are also very unlikely to transmit the virus to anyone else. So what’s the best way to get kids vaccinated? Scotland offers a lesson here. In Scotland, 95.9% of children had one dose by the time they were five years old, while 89.7% had two doses. The result? There was only one laboratory-confirmed case of measles in Scotland during all of 2023. Edinburgh University researchers suggest that Scotland’s increase in vaccination rates during the Covid-19 pandemic may have been linked to flexible working for parents (which meant they could attend vaccination appointments) and mobile vaccination centres.
This is a basic premise in global health: if you want parents to vaccinate their children, make it accessible, free and easy, so it can fit within their daily commitments and constraints. And that’s true whether it’s Uganda, Pakistan, Scotland or England. As Kirsten Watters, Camden’s council director of health and wellbeing, said: “When talking to parents, we know that most do intend to vaccinate their children, and they’ve got high levels of confidence and trust. It’s just that they’re finding it difficult to organise those appointments.” The majority of parents do end up vaccinating their children, but it only takes a few barriers – inability to make an easy appointment, faraway vaccine centres, confusing or inaccessible messaging – to drop the vaccination rate a few percentage points below the critical 95% threshold, and the virus can begin to take hold.
And yes, there are other issues, such as general hesitancy about vaccines after Covid-19 and the growing online conspiracy movement, as well as genuine concerns about whether vaccines are necessary, given potential side effects. The pandemic definitely introduced many people to the world of anti-vax theory and doubt, to say nothing of previous issues such as Andrew Wakefield’s study in 1998 falsely linking MMR vaccination to autism, the influence of which has proved stubbornly hard to dislodge despite its having been discredited. But we shouldn’t overstate “antivax sentiment”. The fact that vaccination rates are vastly different in some pockets of the UK – coverage is about 90% in the south-west, for instance – tells us the main difference is probably logistical. We need outreach to communities and better rollout of vaccines to areas of low coverage, all mediated through trusted health professionals.
Fortunately, the government has announced a vaccination campaign in England, recruiting teachers, GPs, and community leaders to promote vaccination, and rolling out pop-up vaccination centres in convenient locations such as schools. If the approach works, it needs to be built into the yearly campaign, so that vaccination rates never dip this low again.
I remember giving talks at global health meetings in 2003 and 2004, making the case for reducing the price of the measles vaccine for poor countries so that health ministries could acquire doses and save children’s lives. At that time, measles was considered a problem in low- and middle-income countries. We thought the problem had been solved in Britain and the United States.
Measles was once a common and deadly disease for children here. In 1962, Roald Dahl’s daughter Olivia died at the age of seven from measles complications. When a safe combined MMR vaccine was approved, the beloved children’s author advocated for parents to take it up. In a letter reflecting on the low uptake of measles vaccination in 1986, he wrote: “It is not yet generally accepted that measles can be a dangerous illness. Believe me, it is. In my opinion, parents who now refuse to have their children immunised are putting the lives of those children at risk.”
Eliminating most viruses is a tall order, but it’s a realistic target for measles given the MMR vaccine. Measles, mumps and rubella are all nasty diseases that should be stuck in the past. Dahl’s daughter didn’t have the choice of a vaccine, but children in Britain today don’t have to suffer the same fate. They live in 2024, not 1962.

2QF7PO2ISI_C7SVBMJF31WO0E2,UK says Emirates-backed stake in Vodafone poses national security risk,Jack Simpson,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/25/emirates-backed-stake-vodafone-security-risk-uae-uk-government,"The stake in Vodafone held by a United Arab Emirates-backed telecoms group poses a national security risk to the UK, the government said.
The Cabinet Office issued a notice late on Wednesday warning that the 14.6% stake held in Vodafone by Emirates Telecoms, which is also known as e&, amounted to a security concern given Vodafone’s strategic role in the UK’s telecommunications services.
It has now ordered a “national security committee” to be set up at Vodafone, which will oversee and monitor any sensitive work it carries out which could have an impact on national security.
The action is “necessary and proportionate” to “mitigate the risk to national security”, the government said.
The warning comes after e&, which is 60% owned by the UAE government, increased its stake in Vodafone since an initial investment of £3bn in 2022. In April, the company upped its stake to 14.6%, before entering a strategic partnership agreement under which the e& chief executive, Hatem Dowidar, joined the Vodafone board.
That move triggered the government to look into the deal under the National Security and Investment Act 2021, owing to Vodafone’s importance as strategic supplier of the UK government and being involved in the country’s cybersecurity infrastructure. However, the government had not previously made any public announcements saying it was looking into the partnership.
The Cabinet Office said the partnership would enable e& to “materially influence policy at Vodafone”.
Oliver Dowden, secretary of state at the Cabinet Office, has now made several orders, including requirements that the UK government is notified if any elements of the relationship changes. UK government requirements must also be met regarding Vodafone’s board composition and functions.
Under the terms of the strategic partnership, e& can increase its stake to just under 25%, while also having the opportunity to add another executive to the board if its ownership tops 20%.
The state-owned firm has previously said it planned to be a “long-term and supportive shareholder in Vodafone and is not seeking to exert control or influence the company’s board or management team”. The company operates in 16 countries across the Middle East, Asia and Africa and has an estimated 164 million customers globally.
A Vodafone spokesperson said: “We are pleased to have received clearance in our home market for our strategic relationship agreement with e&, and for e& to take a seat on our board.” The Guardian contacted e& for comment.
The Vodafone agreement is one of several deals in recent years made by UAE-based companies and investment vehicles seeking to invest and grow their stakes in UK companies.
Regulators have been looking into the prospective transfer of control over the Telegraph and Spectator from the Barclay family to the Abu Dhabi-backed investment group RedBird IMI on public interest grounds.

Ofcom and the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) had been due to report on Friday, but are now likely to be asked to look again at the deal and report in mid-March if, as expected, a second investigation is launched after the culture secretary said she was “minded to” issue a new public interest intervention notice.
Lucy Frazer made the announcement on Wednesday after a last-minute corporate structure change by RedBird raised fresh concerns.
There has been outrage from some politicians – as well as former and current Telegraph journalists – about the deal, which would allow an overseas government to control a significant stake in a UK national newspaper.
Vodafone also faces separate regulatory scrutiny over its proposed £15bn merger deal with a fellow telecoms company, Three.
An investigation was launched by the CMA in October to look into whether the tie-up could affect consumer options and prices. The union Unite has claimed the deal could add £300 a year to some phone bills."
2T3IJHJL2J_678VPFOPCC7K4PC,Supreme court declines to halt first US nitrogen-gas execution in Alabama case,Ed Pilkington,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/24/supreme-court-nitrogen-gas-execution-case,"The US supreme court on Wednesday rejected a bid to halt Alabama from proceeding with the nation’s first execution using nitrogen gas to carry out the death penalty on the convicted murderer Kenneth Smith, who survived a botched lethal injection in 2022 that helped prompt a review of the state’s death penalty procedures.
The justices denied Smith’s request to stay his execution, which is scheduled for Thursday. They also declined to hear his legal challenge contending that a second execution attempt by Alabama – after the first failed attempt caused him severe trauma – would violate the US constitution’s eighth amendment’s protections against cruel and unusual punishment.
The supreme court’s decision marks the clearing away of one of the final hurdles to one of the more contentious planned executions in recent years. Barring an 11th-hour move from another court or from state authorities, Alabama will have a 30-hour window starting on Thursday within which to put Smith to death.
The nation’s highest court gave no reason for its decision. In recent years, under the six-to-three far-right supermajority secured through Donald Trump’s three appointments, the court has become increasingly unwilling to intervene to stop pending executions.
That in turn has removed the final hope of many death row inmates as their last hours tick away.
In a phone call to the Guardian this week from his cell in the Holman correctional facility, where the execution is set to take place, Smith said he was not ready for a return to the death chamber. The state has already tried to execute him once, in November 2022 when he was strapped to a gurney for four hours in a failed attempt to inject him with lethal drugs.
“They haven’t given me a chance to heal,” said Smith, who has been diagnosed with PTSD after the botched attempt. “I’m still suffering from the first execution and now we’re doing this again. They won’t let me even have post-traumatic stress disorder – you know, this is ongoing stress disorder.”
The department of corrections is now proposing to use a method that has never been tested in the US. It involves Smith, 58, being made to breathe pure nitrogen through a gas mask in a process known as “nitrogen hypoxia” to cause fatal oxygen deprivation.
Veterinarians in the US and across Europe have ruled out nitrogen as a euthanasia method for most animals other than pigs. Laboratory studies have shown it can cause distress in many species and scientists largely recommend against it on ethical grounds.
The intention to use nitrogen for the first time has aroused fierce opposition, both within the US and internationally. Hundreds of Jewish clergy and community leaders across the US have written to the Republican governor of Alabama, Kay Ivey, demanding a halt to the execution.
“Just the idea of using gas for executions is an affront to our community,” said Mike Zoosman, the co-founder of L’chaim! Jews Against the Death Penalty, who organised the letter. He added: “The Nazi legacy of experimentation to find the most expeditious way to rid our community of undesirable prisoners is … a history that should not be repeated in Alabama, or anywhere.”
United Nations experts have also stepped into the fray, accusing of Alabama of preparing a human experiment on Smith that would be a violation of international law.
There has also been criticism of the secretive way in which Alabama is going about preparing to judicially kill Smith. The state’s protocol for using nitrogen as an execution method is heavily redacted, making it impossible for the public to review what is likely to happen within the death chamber.
“Alabama is once more seeking to hide the reality of what goes on in the execution chamber,” said Maya Foa, the joint executive director of the international human rights group Reprieve. “Witnesses will not be able to tell how much Kenneth Smith is suffering as the nitrogen kills him – like the lethal injection protocol before it, the nitrogen protocol is specifically designed to hide pain.”
Smith was sentenced to death for the 1988 murder of Elizabeth Sennett. Prosecutors alleged that her husband, the pastor Charles Sennett, had paid Smith and another man $1,000 each through an intermediary to carry out the killing.
The pastor later killed himself when suspicions began to fall on him. According to prosecutors, he had taken out a life insurance policy on his wife, having fallen into serious debt.
The jury at Smith’s trial initially voted to sentence him to life in prison. But the judge overruled them, sending him to death row and to his present appointment with the death chamber."
2TB6S7YSRQ_66DHUSWBBAYODJ4,OpenAI bans bot impersonating US presidential candidate Dean Phillips,Dan Milmo,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/22/openai-bans-bot-impersonating-us-presidential-candidate-dean-phillips,"OpenAI has removed the account of the developer behind an artificial intelligence-powered bot impersonating the US presidential candidate Dean Phillips, saying it violated company policy.
Phillips, who is challenging Joe Biden for the Democratic party candidacy, was impersonated by a ChatGPT-powered bot on the dean.bot site.
The bot was backed by Silicon Valley entrepreneurs Matt Krisiloff and Jed Somers, who have started a Super Pac – a body that funds and supports political candidates – named We Deserve Better, supporting Phillips.
San Francisco-based OpenAI said it had removed a developer account that violated its policies on political campaigning and impersonation.
“We recently removed a developer account that was knowingly violating our API usage policies which disallow political campaigning, or impersonating an individual without consent,” said the company.
The Phillips bot, created by AI firm Delphi, is now disabled. Delphi has been contacted for comment.
OpenAI’s usage policies state that developers who use its technology to build unique applications must not engage in “political campaigning or lobbying”. It also prohibits “impersonating another individual or organization without consent or legal right” although it was not clear whether Phillips, a Minnesota congressman, had given his consent to the bot.
A pop-up notice on the dean.bot website describes the “AI voice bot” as a “fun educational tool, and it’s not perfec”. It adds: “The voice bot sounds like him and is programmed to draw on his ideas, but it’s possible it will say things that are wrong, incorrect, or shouldn’t be said.”
The Washington Post, which first reported the ban, reported that Krisiloff had asked Delphi to remove ChatGPT from the bot and rely on freely available open source technology instead. Krisiloff, a former OpenAI employee, has been contacted for comment.
We Deserve Better has received $1m in funding from the billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, who called it “by far the largest investment I have ever made in someone running for office” in a post on X.
Phillips, 55, announced his bid for the presidency in October, referring to Biden’s age and saying a younger generation should be given the opportunity to lead. Campaigning in New Hampshire on Saturday, Phillips described Biden as “unelectable and weak”.
There are concerns that deepfakes and AI-generated disinformation could disrupt elections around the world this year, with the US, EU, UK and India all due to hold polls. On Sunday, the Observer reported that 70% of British MPs fear AI will increase the spread of misinformation and disinformation."
2TBH23F7LE_P0U2PDDL323Z5Z6,Happy Kending: why righteous anger might be the role that wins Ryan Gosling an Oscar,Stuart Heritage,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/jan/24/barbie-ryan-gosling-margot-robbie-greta-gerwig-oscars-snub,"Snubs are not exactly uncommon during awards season – not least because it’s the only time of year when anyone actually uses the word “snub” – but on Tuesday the Oscar nominations pulled off what can only be described as a turbosnub. By failing to recognise Greta Gerwig or Margot Robbie, the director and lead actress of Barbie, the Academy managed to create a historic firestorm. Social media is furious about the snubs, and everyone knows how hard it is to make social media angry.
Luckily for us all, a white knight has come to save us all. Ryan Gosling, who did receive a nomination for his performance as Ken, released a statement that bristled with righteous fury at the snubs. “There is no Ken without Barbie, and there is no Barbie movie without Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie, the two people most responsible for this history-making, globally celebrated film,” he wrote. “No recognition would be possible for anyone on the film without their talent, grit and genius. To say that I’m disappointed that they are not nominated in their respective categories would be an understatement.”
While it’s fine to question the complete validity of his statement – the Oscars always nominates five people for best director and 10 movies for best picture, which makes this sort of snub statistically quite likely – you can’t argue with the fact that Gosling has his finger right on the pulse here. The world was lost and confused when Gerwig and Robbie weren’t nominated, but in one fell swoop Ryan Gosling was able to give voice to all the frustration.
It was a canny move because there is a universe in which Gosling’s nomination made him the villain of the story. As the meme shared by your more basic friends on Instagram yesterday explained, a man getting the credit for a woman’s work is sort of the entire point of Barbie, and so it wouldn’t be hard for public opinion to turn on him for precisely this reason. But by defending Gerwig and Robbie so trenchantly, that isn’t going to happen now.
It also marks another step in an awards season where he’s barely managed to put a foot wrong. During Jo Koy’s flaming crater of a jokeless and weirdly defensive Golden Globes monologue (during which he made a crack about Barbie’s “plastic boobies”), the defining reaction was Gosling’s. As the camera cut away to him, perhaps hoping for a smile, the world saw him scowling at Koy in exactly the same way that they were probably scowling at Koy. And when his song I’m Just Ken won a Critics’ Choice award, his reaction – best described as blankly stunned incomprehension – also managed to reflect the public mood.
If you’re looking for the exact opposite of this, of course, then seek out Oliver Stone’s recent criticism of Gosling. Earlier this week Stone said that Gosling was “wasting his time” by appearing in films such as Barbie, which he said “contribute to the infantilisation of Hollywood”. The backlash to his comments was so overwhelming that Stone was forced to tweet out a screengrabbed Notes app apology, in the traditional manner of the publicly shamed.
You could read Gosling’s Oscar statement as a reaction to this, too. Ever since Barbie was released, Gosling has been extremely all-in on the film, promoting it with such sincere fervour that you might have been forgiven for thinking that he single-handedly financed it. Ryan Gosling has always completely believed in Barbie, and his place within it, so his statement also works as a shot against any detractors who simply saw it as a heavily marketed bubblegum film based on an extremely popular toy IP.

As such, expect all eyes to be on Gosling when the Oscars roll around in March. He has so far demonstrated a perfect eye for the public mood, and as such has become the figure through whom we will experience the ceremony. There will be cutaways to him when Barbie wins anything, and even more pointed cutaways when it doesn’t. He still isn’t likely to win his award, because at this point Robert Downey Jr is such a lock that the other nominees don’t even need to show up. But that doesn’t matter, because Ryan Gosling is now more than that. He is the people’s best supporting actor nominee.
Also, it’s worth pointing out that America Ferrera was also nominated for Barbie, and she also voiced her scorn over the Gerwig and Robbie snubs. But everyone decided to focus on Ryan Gosling instead of her because, again, that’s sort of the point of Barbie."
2W9QQP0SBP_N1SKV0B8PLRSHYT,UK regulator launches investigation into Vodafone-Three merger,Mark Sweney,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/26/uk-regulator-launches-investigation-into-vodafone-three-merger,"The UK competition regulator has launched an investigation into the proposed merger of Vodafone and Three to create the UK’s largest mobile phone operator.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) now has up to 40 days to examine the deal and decide whether it warrants being subjected to a full, in-depth investigation on competition grounds.
Sarah Cardell, the chief executive of the CMA, said: “This deal would bring together two of the major players in the UK telecommunications market, which is critical to millions of everyday customers, businesses and the wider economy.”
In a separate move this week, the government said the stake in Vodafone held by a United Arab Emirates-backed telecoms group posed a national security risk to the UK.
The Cabinet Office issued a notice late on Wednesday warning that the 14.6% stake held by Emirates Telecoms, which is also known as e&, amounted to a security concern given Vodafone’s strategic role in UK telecoms services.
The government has now ordered a “national security committee” to be set up at Vodafone that will oversee and monitor any sensitive work the telecoms firm carries out that could have an impact on national security.
In 2016, the CMA and the European Commission blocked Three’s attempted takeover of O2, arguing that it would have risked higher prices.
However, in 2022 the UK telecoms regulator changed its long-held stance, saying it was now more open to consolidation in the sector. Ofcom had previously argued that dropping to only three networks in a country could harm consumers.
Vodafone UK has a number of government contracts, and Three UK is owned by the Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison, which may raise concerns about foreign joint-ownership of a key national asset, particularly given the city’s status as part of China.
Vodafone UK has public sector contracts with the Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of Justice, NHS 111 and local police forces.

Ahmed Essam, the chief executive of Vodafone UK, said: “We strongly believe that the proposed merger of Vodafone and Three will significantly enhance competition by creating a combined business with more resources to invest in infrastructure to better compete with the two larger converged players.”
The two companies are the UK’s third and fourth biggest operators respectively. The newly combined company will, if the merger is completed, have more than 27 million subscribers, leapfrogging EE, which is owned by BT, and Virgin Media O2, which is owned by Spain’s Telefónica and the US-listed company Liberty Global.
Robert Finnegan, the chief executive of Three UK, said: “We are confident that this transaction will deliver significant benefits to our customers, the country and competition, and we look forward to working closely with the CMA as they review our notification.”"
2WTTUODK7R_X2I83F2XPT3LZ99,Housing ombudsman in England calls to re-establish link between housing and health,Robert Booth,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/jan/22/richard-blakeway-ombudsman-england-social-housing-health,"The housing ombudsman in England is calling for an independent royal commission “to reimagine the future of social housing” and re-establish the link between housing and health.
Richard Blakeway, who handles thousands of tenants’ complaints about mistreatment, disrepair, discrimination and squalor, said that parts of the social housing sector had reached breaking point, with residents desperate and neglected.
“The system in some areas is really close to being overwhelmed,” he told the Guardian. “The scale of the challenge hasn’t been grasped.”
About 4 million households live in social housing in England, but 380,000 households are in homes classed as “non decent” by the government. About 88,000 households are believed by the regulator of social housing to be living with serious damp and mould problems, which can, at worst, cause serious illness and death.
Blakeway, a former Conservative deputy mayor of London under Boris Johnson, has been in post for more than four years, during which time public outrage erupted over the death from mould of two-year-old Awwab Ishak in social housing in Rochdale.
He said a dramatic growth in casework had “turned the ombudsman into something like an emergency service”.
Blakeway said there had been “neglect in policy [and] in the way some residents have been treated, marginalised and stigmatised by the people that are there to help them”. In a 70-page report, he called for a royal commission to present “a single view of welfare, health and housing spend”.
His intervention came as social housing tenants brace for rent rises of up to 7.7% in April, after they were capped at 7% in 2023. The Social Housing Action Campaign (Shac) group said it was forcing some families “in despair” and cutting back on heating and food.
Some tenants were even quitting their properties and sofa-surfing instead, said Suzanne Muna, the secretary of Shac.
“We agree with what he is saying that the whole system needs to be looked at,” she said, citing in particular the “power imbalance between tenants and landlords … that needs to be addressed”.
On Monday, Mansfield district council announced it had launched inspections of 64 council homes after the death of one of its tenants, Jane Bennett, 52, from lung disease that may have been caused by mould.
Bennett was diagnosed with interstitial pneumonitis in April 2023 and was twice admitted to intensive care, but died in June despite treatment with high-flow nasal oxygen, intravenous steroids, and antifungals. A pathologist and respiratory consultant were “clear that the mould may be causal or contributory to her death”, found Neena Sharma, the coroner. She warned of a risk of future deaths unless Mansfield council took action. It confirmed on Monday it had found mould in Bennett’s bedroom drawers and wardrobes but said it made repairs, took “a zero-tolerance approach” to the fungus and maintained the home to a “good standard”.
The last royal commission on “housing of the working classes” was set up in 1884, in which a panel of politicians, trade unionists, business people, bishops and Charles, the then prince of Wales, investigated urban and rural slums. It paved the way for mass social housing in Britain and laws making landlords personally liable for tenants’ health.
Blakeway wants a new royal commission “independent of government and unimpeded by politics” to “re-establish housing policy as a health intervention” and create a new long-term plan.
“It’s not one policy, one landlord or one government [that is to blame for the sector’s problems],” he said. “It’s a cumulative impact of poor choices.”
His intervention is likely to be seen as an implicit criticism of the Conservatives’ record on social housing over close to 14 years in office. His officials have made 14,000 orders and recommendations to social landlords to make things right for tenants since April 2023.
“The effect of a combined cost of living and housing crisis has put parts of the sector at breaking point, compounded by a narrow vision of what social housing is for; one which is far removed from its conception,” Blakeway said.

Royal commissions were common in the decades after the second world war, but have had a mixed impact, according to the Institute for Government thinktank. The 1977 royal commission on criminal procedures influenced the creation of an independent Crown Prosecution Service, but the 1999 commission on House of Lords reform did not deliver change.
Social housing tenants are still waiting for the government to deliver on a promise to enforce the so-called Awaab’s law. The two-year-old died in December 2020 but an eight-week consultation was launched only recently.
Housing associations say 63% was cut from their government funding in 2010 and since then construction of new homes has fallen while rising demand has been fuelled by record private rent increases.
According to the latest English housing survey, 380,000 households live in social housing that is rated non-decent. Blakeway said the figures were “probably a gross underestimate”.
He said there was “an emphatic case for government action and resources to support social landlords” as the status quo was not sustainable.
Kate Henderson, the chief executive of the National Housing Federation, which represents social landlords, said it was pleased Blakeway had added his voice to growing calls on the government to invest in social housing.
“The system is under immense pressure,” she said. “We are calling for a long-term plan which delivers more social homes and provides funding for regeneration.”
The government said it was taking action to improve the quality of social housing and give tenants a proper voice, including through the Social Housing (Regulation) Act 2023.
A spokesperson for the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said: “Tragic cases such as that of Awaab Ishak must never happen again. That’s why we’ve introduced Awaab’s law to force social landlords to address hazards such as damp and mould within strict time frames. Landlords must consider the ombudsman’s report carefully and ensure they are taking the needs of vulnerable residents into account.”
This article was amended on 24 January 2024. An earlier version said that the death of Jane Bennett from lung disease was “likely to” have been caused by mould; that should have said it may have have been caused by mould."
2XYSM9RJC6_V4JPVIUZS7EEY8Z,"Born from the Same Stranger review – lovely, warm … and an ethical minefield",Rebecca Nicholson,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/jan/22/born-from-the-same-stranger-review-lovely-warm-and-an-ethical-minefield,"Doctor Who viewers will be relieved to learn that after her ordeal on Christmas Day, Davina McCall has safely returned to her DNA-documentary beat. The makers of Long Lost Family now bring us Born from the Same Stranger, an unwieldy title for a sweet and sensitive four-part series that is about seeking, and sometimes finding, connections with blood relatives.
The first episode follows children who were conceived using donor sperm in the 1990s, when donors were promised complete anonymity. The law changed in 2005, so that those conceived by donor since then can access the donor’s details. However, for those conceived before that point, tracking down their biological parent – the term used to describe the donor is personal and varies according to preference – is a lot more difficult. We follow Liam and Sarah, who have very different stories, as they attempt to find their sperm donors, with the help of the internet and new technology.
Liam grew up in Jersey with his mum, Julie, who was single but always wanted children, and so conceived him and raised him alone. Julie did a few newspaper interviews about her experience as a single mum in the 90s, and there is a brilliant bit in which Liam looks over old press clippings at the kitchen table; headlines include “My darling sperm bank baby” and “I’ll never know my dad – Mum got him from a catalogue”. Liam sings the praises of his mum, who sounds fabulous, but he is frank, too, about the sense of curiosity he felt. He says that, as a child, he would write Father’s Day cards to an imaginary dad. Julie is supportive of the search but admits that she does worry about her son. There is a difference, she says, between looking for a biological father and looking for a dad.
Sarah, meanwhile, grew up in Singapore, another only child, but unlike Liam, she did not know that she was donor-conceived until her mother told her four years ago, after the death of her father. She, too, speaks of a low-key alienation and the sense of mystery that she feels. “I look in the mirror and I’m like, who am I looking at?” she says.
For Liam and Sarah, technology has changed everything. The proliferation of commercial DNA testing websites means that previously untraceable blood relatives may now be much easier to find, if not through their own profile on the site, then through the profiles of their parents or siblings. Before they send off their DNA, Liam and Sarah have access only to scraps of information about their donor: their height, eye and hair colour and hobbies. Both have strong reactions to these disembodied snippets. For Liam, it makes his donor into a real person, but for Sarah, it leaves her feeling: “It could be literally anyone.”
After they send off their DNA, however, they find much more than they had dared to hope. There is a device running through this hour, of text chat groups, which pop up on screen. Liam has one for the DNA matches he finds, while Sarah has the support of a group of people who have been through the same experience as her, and offer help, advice and sympathy. As a storytelling tool, I wasn’t sure if it would work, but it is surprisingly effective, not least because that is how most people communicate now. The speed at which half-siblings can be brought together is astonishing. As Liam puts it, it has been “a rollercoaster of a week”.
You can imagine another channel, or a streaming site, taking these stories and turning them into something much more exploitative and salacious, but Born from the Same Stranger is a very ITV-type documentary. Long Lost Family fans will know exactly what to expect, tone-wise. It is tactful, gentle, lovely and warm. The thorny subject of ethics comes up towards the end, mostly to acknowledge that, yes, this is an ethical minefield, and it can be very complicated, but also to explore the notion that this is not a simple or straightforward process for anyone. There are tough decisions that must be taken with so many complicated considerations in mind, and Liam and Sarah are courageous in being so open about how they are thinking it all through. This is not a case of fairytale endings but the programme allows for nuance and complexity, which is important and fair. Later in the series, we will meet sperm and egg donors who are looking for their recipients, which should offer yet another side to the story.

2ZP3PS65BD_KDIDTQUCZ2J2V3C,‘The world is changing too fast for us’: organic farmers on urgency of French protests,Angelique Chrisafis,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/26/world-changing-too-fast-organic-farmers-french-protests,"Pierre Bretagne woke at 4am to feed the cows on his organic farm near the coastal town of Pornic in western France, then did something he had never dared to before.
He made a cardboard protest banner about the nightmare of French bureaucracy and went to cheer on a go-slow convoy of tractors warning that French farming and the rural way of life was facing collapse. Effigies of dead farmers dangled from nooses on tractor trailers as the convoy drove into the centre of the Brittany city of Rennes, beeping horns and waving banners. “Quality has a price,” read one.
“We’re fed up and exasperated,” says Bretagne, 38. “I love my job – I farm organically because it’s what I believe in and it’s the right thing ethically and in terms of health. In nine years of farming, I’ve never been on a protest; I’d rather be with my animals. But things are getting so difficult – we need decent prices that reflect not just the quality of our produce but the love we put into this job and into the countryside. This is a passion, a vocation, but we don’t get the recognition for it.”
The French government has been taken by surprise by the scale and fury of grassroots farmer demonstrations that have spread from the south-west across the whole country this week.
Bales of hay and tractors have been used to block main highways; manure has been sprayed on public buildings and supermarkets in the south-west. Crates of tomatoes, cabbages and cauliflowers that farmers said had been cheaply imported were dumped across roads. Although the protests follow other demonstrations by European farmers in countries including Germany and Romania, the French protests have a particularly urgent and local political flavour. France, the EU’s biggest agricultural producer, has thousands of independent producers of meat, dairy, fruit and vegetables and wine, who have a reputation for staging disruptive protests.
For several months, angry farmers had been turning street signs upside-down in villages across France in protest, while Marine Le Pen’s far-right party travelled the country to court rural voters.
But in Paris, Emmanuel Macron’s appointment earlier this month as the new prime minister, Gabriel Attal, instead focused on issues such as law and order and introducing trials of school uniform. Now the farming protests are Attal’s first significant headache, only five months before European parliament elections where the far right in France could make gains.
On Thursday, Breton fishers joined in; other trade union workers could follow if a social protest movement grows. After the  gilets jaunes (yellow vests) citizen protest movement of 2018 and 2019, the government is so sensitive that it has directed riot police to act in moderation, rather than dismantle roadblocks. The demonstrators have many demands: including ensuring fairer prices for produce, continuing diesel tax-breaks for agricultural vehicles, an end to the extra French red tape layered on top of EU rules and immediate aid for struggling organic farmers.
Attal told farmers in the south-west on Friday: “We must tell all French citizens, if they can, to buy French produce.” He also promised to simplify red-tape, speed up the payment of subsidies for agricultural tractor fuel and drop plans to reduce tax breaks on agricultural diesel, as well as make access to water easier for farmers.
Polls show massive public support for the farmers’ protest – up to 90% – but farmers say that French consumers, struggling to make ends meet and bamboozled by supermarkets, do not always choose French produce in shops.
As organic farming faces an acute crisis in France, with sales dropping sharply, Bretagne says it has taken an emotional toll. “In human terms, it’s a catastrophe,” he says of the loneliness and isolation that some farmers have faced. From a farming family, his own father died “exhausted” at 60, having been unable to adapt to the changing industry. Bretagne earned only €600–€700 (£512-£597) a month, and sold much of his organic produce – beef, free-range chicken and sunflower products – as conventional rather than organic produce because the market was so hard.
“People see organic food as too expensive, but organic farmers are not getting the big margins on shop prices,” he says. “Where are those profits going? Who is lining their pockets?”
Bretagne’s wife’s salary as a support worker for adults with disabilities kept him and their two children afloat. But for him, farming was about being present in the countryside, keeping rural communities alive. He says: “The world is changing too fast for us. We don’t know where we are.”
The farming union, Coordination Rurale, which organised protests in Rennes on Thursday, gave its demonstrators yellow hats, an echo of the gilets jaunes.

Natacha Guillemet, 50, from Vouvant in the Vendée, says she farmed grass-fed Parthenais cattle for high-quality “red label” beef sold in top Paris butchers’ shops. “But at the end of the month, I line up the bills on the mantlepiece and decide which ones to pay because I can’t pay all of them,” she says.
“I’m counting stamps on envelopes, I’m counting euros. We are not in dairy, but we milk some cows to provide some milk for our children. The prices paid by intermediaries for our produce are too low and yet our costs are exploding: diesel, insurance. Consumers are getting charged a lot but we’re not seeing that deferential. There’s a lack of dignity.”
Sometimes, she says, it felt like working in a feudal system: “It’s as if we get the crumbs … We’re being taken for fools.”
Olivier Chemin, 54, an organic dairy farmer at Saint-Fraimbault-de-Prières in Mayenne, says: “This anger has been on slow-burn for years in France – there has been a distortion of competition, prices are low. I’ve been farming for 22 years. Organic dairy costs more to produce, yet prices are dropping.
“The demonstrations are about the future of French farming and rural life. It’s about how we feed ourselves, the quality of our food. It’s very seriously under threat from imports that don’t respect European or French rules. If the government doesn’t act, farming will collapse.”
Chemin says suicide rates are up among smaller farmers, some of whom earn just €500 a month. He says small-scale French farmers, who work more than 60 hours a week, spend hours each week filling out paperwork and dealing with red tape.
Alexis, 28, a cabbage farmer from Finistère in Brittany, says that like most, he stays up late after dinner each night, filling out forms. “It’s a question of survival: you need to be able to earn from your job.”
Mickaël, a fisher from Concarneau, joined the protests to stand up for “the rural world against the city”. He says that in France, protesting is the only way to be heard by politicians: “Sometimes you have to burn and break things to be understood.”"
30B3HGIZ7W_MXSENF9Q7WFAZEL,Virgin Media is most complained about UK broadband provider,Kalyeena Makortoff,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/jan/25/virgin-media-most-complained-about-uk-broadband-provider,"Virgin Media is the UK’s most complained about broadband provider according to the latest figures, compounding woes for the firm, which is already under investigation by the communications regulator.
Figures released by Ofcom on Thursday showed that the number of complaints made about Virgin’s internet services between July and September were nearly double that of the next-most complained about provider, with Virgin attracting about 32 complaints per 100,000 customers compared with 18 for Now Broadband.
There was a general rise across the board, with a “significant” increase in complaints to Virgin across all of its broadband, landline and pay-TV services compared with the previous three months, Ofcom said.
A Virgin spokesperson blamed the latest rise in complaints on the fact that Ofcom had launched a formal investigation into the company in July, saying it had “generated a higher number of complaints than would ordinarily be expected”.
Ofcom launched the investigation after customers said they were having difficulties cancelling contracts and were unhappy with how the firm handled complaints.
“It should be noted that overall complaints about Virgin Media and O2 products still represent a very small proportion of our customer base,” Virgin said.
Fergal Farragher, Ofcom’s consumer protection director, said the regulator acknowledged the impact the investigation had had on complaints, but were “also aware that our investigation was in part based on complaints that customers had already made about Virgin Media’s services. We may publish updates on the investigation on our enforcement bulletin as the investigation progresses.”
O2, meanwhile, emerged as the most complained about pay-monthly mobile provider, with customers concerned about how their complaints had been handled.
It contributed to an overall rise in complaints across the sector, which Ofcom said showed that “providers must continue to focus on improving customer service”.

Sky generated the fewest complaints from both its broadband and landline customers.
Virgin Media said: “Our number-one priority is to provide an excellent service to our customers, and we accept that the rise in complaints in the third quarter falls far short of our expectations.
“As well as engaging fully with Ofcom’s ongoing investigation, we are investing in every area of our business to give our customers the best possible experience, with a real focus on resolving any issues at the first time of getting in touch and making it easier for them to get support when they need it.”"
3170C020JA_5YHTXVUXIPY2RR9,"Lloyds to cut 1,600 jobs across branches in shift to online banking",Kalyeena Makortoff,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/25/lloyds-cut-jobs-branches-online-banking,"Lloyds Banking Group is planning to cut 1,600 staff from its branch network as it tries to reduce costs and push customers towards digital services as part of a corporate overhaul.
The UK company said it was adapting to a shift in behaviour, with more than 21 million of its 26 million customers choosing to use its services online.
But the job cuts are likely to raise concerns for the 8% of Lloyds customers – about 2 million – who exclusively rely on going into branches to manage their accounts.
The bank will simultaneously create 830 jobs in its relationship growth team – amounting to an overall reduction of about 769 jobs – to provide a hybrid service of in-branch, video or phone appointments for customers. However, there is no guarantee that those new roles will be given to staff whose jobs are being cut.
Lloyds is closing about 114 branches this year, leaving a network of 1,061 sites. The staff cuts will be aimed at senior branch workers, with Lloyds maintaining its most junior roles.
The staff union, Accord, hopes most of the cuts will be on a voluntary redundancy basis, where workers ask to leave and receive some compensation, though it is likely to be offered only in some cases.
In November, Lloyds confirmed plans to slash nearly 3,000 roles from the wider business – excluding its branches – focusing on middle-management roles including analyst and product management posts. Again, the bank said it was creating thousands of positions that would ultimately result in a net 120 roles being added to its workforce.
The job cuts are part of a £3bn overhaul announced under the chief executive, Charlie Nunn, in early 2022 in an attempt to push further into digital banking, bulk up the corporate bank and wealth division, and strengthen Lloyds’ position as a UK landowner.
Commenting on the latest round of job losses, a Lloyds spokesperson said: “As more customers choose to manage their day-to-day banking online, it is important our people are available when it matters most. We are introducing a number of new roles and making changes to our branch teams so our customers can see us how and when they want to.”

Accord said: “LBG announced significant changes to its branch network structure and ways of working, which it says are necessary because of changes in customer behaviour. The move represents a significant change to the branch networks and our members.”"
31ZUKULOJ1_EK66WJ2IX524S6P,Carriers sneak life-saving drugs over border as Mexico battles opioid deaths,Thomas Graham,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/jan/23/mexico-us-overdose-drug-naloxone-fentanyl-opioid,"Every day, people cross the US-Mexico border with drugs – but not all of them are going north. Some head in the opposite direction with a hidden cargo of naloxone, a life-saving medicine that can reverse an opioid overdose but is so restricted as to be practically inaccessible in Mexico.
This humanitarian contraband is necessary because Mexico’s border cities have their own problems with opioid use – problems that activists and researchers say are being made more deadly by government policy.
“Mexico has long seen itself as a production and transit country, but not a place of consumption,” said Cecilia Farfán Méndez, a researcher at the University of California at San Diego. “And a lot of the conversation is still around that being a US problem – not a Mexican one.”
There are no accurate estimates of the number of opioid users in Mexico. A national survey in 2016 suggested that roughly 23,000 had used heroin in the previous year, but this is likely a gross underestimate of the true number.
Opioid use is concentrated in tourist spots like Cancún and cities along the US-Mexico border, and perhaps especially in Tijuana, the key node in fentanyl trafficking to the US.
Fentanyl, a potent synthetic opioid, has largely replaced heroin, causing a surge in overdoses – and more than 70,000 deaths in the US in 2022.
The number in Tijuana is unknown, because Mexico’s forensic service does not always test cadavers for fentanyl. And even when it does, it does not quantify the the amount of drugs in a body, meaning that the cause of death cannot be established as an overdose.
But Jaime Arredondo, a researcher associated with PrevenCasa, an NGO that helps drug users in Tijuana, estimates hundreds a year are dying from fentanyl overdoses in the city.
The situation has been exacerbated by a government policy that, aside from cutting budgets for harm reduction services like PrevenCasa, has also created shortages of life-saving medicines for opioid users.
In response to the fentanyl crisis, authorities in the US made naloxone available without a prescription. Naloxone vending machines have proliferated across the country.
But in Mexico naloxone remains strictly controlled – despite the efforts of some senators from Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s own party, Morena, who proposed a law to declassify it.
The president, popularly known as Amlo, has criticised naloxone, asking whether it did any more than “prolong the agony” of addicts, and questioning who stood to profit from its sale.
Olga Sánchez Cordero, one of the senators pushing to declassify naloxone, admitted there is resistance from those who view it as enabling addiction. But she thinks such concerns are far outweighed by the upside: “What is at stake is life itself.”
The restrictions in Mexico have been partly offset by people bringing small amounts of naloxone from the US, at the risk of being arrested and extorted by border officials.
The Guardian spoke to several people involved in this, all of whom asked to remain anonymous. They described the absurdity of handing contraband naloxone to Mexican police, firefighters and emergency responders, none of whom can readily access it themselves.
“There’s no doubt in my mind that most of the naloxone being used in Tijuana is being brought in from the US,” said one of them. “And beyond Tijuana, too.”
The lack of naloxone in Mexico has been made all the more dangerous by the ongoing shortage of methadone, another opioid provided to those who are trying to control or kick an addiction.
The shortage began after the government suspended production at Psicofarma, the only company that made methadone in Mexico, in February 2023, citing irregularities at the plant.
This caused the public methadone clinic in Tijuana to close, while private clinics went bust.
According to Steffanie Strathdee, a researcher studying the fallout, perhaps 1,000 people were receiving treatment at these clinics. Many relapsed, and went to buy what they could on the street. Today, that’s fentanyl – something far stronger than anything before.
Andrea, a 40-year-old woman who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said she started taking methadone when she got her first formal employment.
“I never thought I would be able to hold down a job,” said Andrea. “To have a life like normal people.”
She used to go to the clinic every morning and pay a few dollars for an oral dose that held the symptoms of withdrawal at bay.
One day, without warning, the clinic didn’t have any. And so she started buying on the street again. Her boyfriend injects it into her feet, so no one at work can see the marks.
It is unclear what happened to the many others who lost their treatment.
“There was no plan B: they simply cut the supply,” said Alfonso Chávez, PrevenCasa’s coordinator in Tijuana. “We’ve seen people coming to [PrevenCasa] who had been on methadone for 15 years.”
The suspension on Psicofarma was lifted in August, but there is still a shortage of methadone in Tijuana. Psicofarma did not respond to written questions.
The lack of naloxone and methadone are emblematic of the government’s turn away from a public health approach to drug use, and towards renewed criminalisation.
Public funds for health and harm reduction have stagnated or fallen, leaving PrevenCasa as the only organisation of its kind in Tijuana. Meanwhile media campaigns stigmatise drug use and soldiers fill the streets of the city.
“I voted for [López Obrador]. His discourse on drugs was completely different back then,” said Alfonso Chávez, PrevenCasa’s coordinator in Tijuana. “Instead, we’ve gone back 15 years.”
But with the national election in June 2024, there is potential for a change in policy.
Morena seems likely to retain the presidency through Claudia Sheinbaum, the former mayor of Mexico City who presents herself as a continuity candidate. Yet there are divergent voices within the party regarding drug policy – voices that may assert themselves once López Obrador leaves power.
One such voice is Senator Sánchez Cordero, who insists she still wants to see progress on laws to regulate marijuana and declassify naloxone, which stalled during the current government.
“I think we need to bet on prevention and rehabilitation – not on law enforcement,” said Sánchez. “On a society that can build peace and harmony – not threat and repression.”"
35ABRN9AI5_XPTNAPM22M1I4NA,"Handling the Undead review – sad, slow-burn zombie drama is less gore, more grief",Benjamin Lee,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/jan/24/handling-undead-movie-review-sundance,"The dead are returning in the chilly Norwegian drama Handling the Undead, a sad, somber attempt to guide the zombie genre from midnight movie to arthouse. It works in parts, as a study of the ache and irrationality of grief, asking its characters how much they’re willing to accept and deny in order to see their loved ones again. But the first-time director Thea Hvistendahl’s patience-insisting slow burn can be testing, like watching a block of ice slowly melt, a story told in the smallest of drips, some of which sink in deeper than others.
On a summer’s day in Oslo, three different dynamics are upended by this confounding re-emergence. A single mother (The Worst Person in the World’s Renate Reinsve) is stopped from a suicide attempt by her father (Bjørn Sundquist), who has brought with him her once-dead son, suddenly alive. An elderly woman (Bente Børsum) attends the funeral of her partner (Olga Damani) only to find her back at their home that night. And the death of a mother (Bahar Pars) rocks the life of her family only for her husband (Reinsve’s Worst Person co-star Anders Danielsen Lie) to find her breathing once again.
Based on the book by John Ajvide Lindqvist, whose debut novel Let the Right One In and its multiple adaptations handle similarly subdued, if more plot-heavy, genre ground, Handling the Undead operates most effectively as a haunting “what if?”. The return of the dead is briefly referenced as a wider epidemic but Hvistendahl’s narrow focus is less interested in how the world is responding and more in individual people. Grief is a strange, selfish thing that can warp and destroy you, and your desperation for it to go away or at least be somewhat tempered can take you to dark, illogical places.
The zombies in the film – the word is never used but the story is set in a universe in which zombies are part of pop culture, something we briefly see in a video game – are not particularly animated; they exist for the most part as breathing corpses with eyes open. Their loved ones are then forced to ask themselves how much is enough? What is it that they are truly grieving? And is this hollow, unresponsive version of the person they miss going to make them feel better or worse? The script, a collaboration between Hvistendahl and Lindqvist, keeps these questions unsaid, worked through in the eyes of the characters, an effectively muted showcase for a well-measured Reinsve, doing double-duty at Sundance with this and the grating psychodrama A Different Man. Her story makes an impression, along with that of the queer older couple, although plotting of the third family is a little scattershot, with too many characters not afforded enough of a look-in.
The lugubrious pace can be a little too sluggish at times but Hvistendahl handles the last act’s descent into slightly more expected horror well, still focusing on the emotional impact, prioritising character over chaos (a horrifying scene of animal cruelty is unbearable to watch for obvious visceral reasons but the response of those watching is what really hurts). The final, crushing endnotes of Handling the Undead are nothing we didn’t expect but they’re haunting more because of the pain that we don’t see, the pain that may never go away, no matter how hard we try.
Handling the Undead is showing at the Sundance film festival and will be released later this year"
39PEGZ1PNO_4SR9SKFGJ8FKYJO,Bodies of six people found at remote crossroads in Mojave desert in California,_,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/24/bodies-found-mojave-desert-california,"Deputies found the bodies of six people at a remote dirt crossroads in the Mojave desert in southern California, in a scene described as so grisly that TV stations blurred some of the images captured by their helicopter overhead.
San Bernardino county sheriff’s deputies responding to a request for a wellness check reached the remote area off Highway 395 outside the community of El Mirage around 8.15pm and found five of the bodies. The sixth was found on Wednesday morning, a sheriff’s spokesperson, Mara Rodriguez, said.
Authorities were still gathering evidence to determine what happened, and Rodriguez said they could not say even how the people died or whether they had been shot. The area, about 50 miles (80km) north-east of Los Angeles and about 20 miles north-west of Victorville, is so remote that the San Bernardino sheriff’s department called in help from the California highway patrol’s aviation division to find the scene, Rodriguez said.
“It’ll be several hours still before we are ready for any body to be removed from the scene,” she said, adding that the coroner’s investigators will be called in then.
TV crews arriving at the scene on Tuesday night reported seeing two vehicles there. Overhead footage from TV stations showed a dark blue SUV with a passenger window blown out and another door open, with part of the image blurred.
The footage showed several yellow markers near the dirt crossroads, in scrubby desert land that stretched for miles. Yellow tape blocked access from the nearest paved road.
Members of the department’s specialized investigations division were brought in to conduct a homicide investigation, according to an email from a sheriff’s spokesperson, Gloria Huerta."
39Q57O69PK_OLNR8P0P52NV7QO,"In 2024, there is one 80-year-old leader we need more than ever: Angela Davis",Rokhaya Diallo,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/25/angela-davis-leader-activist-palestine,"Angela Davis, the veteran American philosopher, writer, activist, feminist icon and symbol of Black liberation struggles, made the French headlines briefly last year. The council for the greater Paris region, the Île-de-France, took the decision to rename a high school in Saint-Denis, a Paris banlieue, which had been named the Lycée Angela Davis since shortly after it opened in 2017.
Why the sudden downgrading of Davis six years after being honoured as an important figure who had contributed exceptional service to humanity? It turned out that in 2021, Davis had cosigned an open letter that condemned the “colonial mentality” of “France’s governance structures”, quoting measures such as “the law against wearing the headscarf”. This, according to Valérie Pécresse, the rightwing politician who runs the Paris region – and who noticed the letter two years later – was “against the laws of our republic”.
The figure ultimately chosen to be honoured by the renamed school was Rosa Parks, which says a lot about how France is unable to celebrate its own Black figures. To many in France, Parks was a passive Black woman who remained seated in her place in a bus. Very few know that she was an activist who intentionally started a major anti-segregationist social movement.
Asked about the matter in an interview on French radio in November, Davis said she did not subscribe to the simplistic opposition between the kind and inoffensive Black lady versus the dangerous activist. In a response that contrasted her stature and dignity with the French right’s small-mindedness and ignorance, she recalled that Parks had herself taken part in the “Free Angela” campaign after Davis was jailed in 1970 for crimes she didn’t commit.
The controversy is a great reminder of how effectively Davis still speaks truth to power and how she has retained her ability to get up the nose of conservative governments. Davis turns 80 on 26 January, and although she became a symbol of civil rights activism more than 60 years ago, she remains, for me, the global figure whose ideas are still among the most radical and relevant for our time.
Davis was already a brilliant young scholar and author in the US when she gained international prominence in 1970 after being falsely accused of criminal conspiracy and going on the run. She was charged with the murder of a judge and five counts of kidnapping and became one of the FBI’s 10 most-wanted fugitives. Davis never stopped insisting on her innocence, arguing that she had been targeted for her political beliefs. She was eventually acquitted in 1972, but her trial drew global attention and support. In France, huge crowds of protesters gathered in her support, led by prominent intellectuals such as Louis Aragon.
Since then she has been the symbol of many struggles for emancipation worldwide. The afro hair and and miniskirt that defined her 1970s look made her a recognisable international figure: her face is still printed on T-shirts and posters. But she is more than the story of an FBI chase that has been told over and over. She could be a legend, stuck in history and idealised for her past accomplishments, but she remains an inspiration, always at the forefront of current issues.
Davis’s time in prison led her to reflect deeply on the US penal system, its links to industrial capitalism and systemic historical injustices. She has always thought about her home country from the perspective of global colonialism. Davis has never failed to address Palestine in her speeches: for decades, she has been a tireless advocate for the struggles of Palestinians and against their intolerable colonial oppression. I remember seeing her speak in Paris in 2013, when she was already calling Gaza “the largest open-air prison in the world”.
Her commitment to radical feminism translates into an indefatigable emphasis on the inclusion of all women. At a conference in 2018 in the banlieues of Paris, I heard her thoughtful reminder: “There can be no racial justice, there can be no peace, there can be no economic justice, unless we forthrightly insist on gender justice.” Not only does Davis place gender equality at the heart of all struggles, she consistently and explicitly includes every woman who identifies as a woman. In France, she understands how our secularism (laïcité) has been weaponised to target Muslims, especially Muslim women.
Her research on systemic violence naturally led her to question the relationships between humans and other living beings, and the impact of species destruction. She is vegan, but says: “You don’t have to be a vegan to be opposed to the systematic abuse of animals, which I think is very much related to the abuse of human animals.” She critiques the way in which capitalism encourages the prioritisation of profit over all else, which justifies the mistreatment ofanimals to produce meat.
The current massacre taking place in Palestine, the global Black Lives Matter and #MeToo movements, the erosion of women’s rights in the US and the devastation of so much of the natural world highlight the ongoing importance of the campaigning work she has been doing for decades.

I met Davis in person in Paris a few months ago. It was not the first time: I was lucky enough to have interviewed her at her home in Washington DC earlier last year after an event at Georgetown University, where I am a researcher. Every time I see her, I am again amazed by the relevance of her perspective on the world.
Davis’s courage in risking her life for her ideas is an inspiration – as is her refusal ever to become complacent about her position. Rather than become an “icon”, she has remained true to her intellectual integrity while always seeking to understand younger generations’ struggles and to defend the most oppressed. Perhaps every town should have a school named after Angela Davis.

39RWGSDKEP_EFXM6PAS51CVH4Q,Amazon Ring says US police will now need warrant to access user footage,Johana Bhuiyan,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/24/police-warrant-amazon-ring-footage,"Amazon Ring will now require US law enforcement to obtain a warrant to access doorbell footage from individual users. The company announced in a blog post that it would no longer allow law enforcement to request doorbell footage directly from users in the company’s social networking app, Neighbors. The move is an about-face from Ring’s long-held and controversial policy that drew the ire of civil liberties and privacy advocates.
At the bottom of a blog post about new features that make it easier for Ring users to share “heartwarming or silly” videos in the Neighbors app, Amazon announced that it was doing away with its “request for assistance” (RFA) feature. Up until this announcement, public safety agencies including police were able to ask users to voluntarily share video footage from their Ring cameras rather than seeking warrants to obtain that user data from Amazon.
“Public safety agencies like fire and police departments can still use the Neighbors app to share helpful safety tips, updates, and community events,” the blog post reads. “They will no longer be able to use the RFA tool to request and receive video in the app.”
Civil liberties experts have long criticized Amazon’s close relationship with law enforcement and the company’s willingness to facilitate warrantless police investigations by allowing easy access to private security footage from people’s homes. In response to criticism, the company previously did away with the practice that allowed police to privately send requests for video footage to Ring users. Instead, police were only allowed to publicly post these requests on the the app. Now they can only obtain footage from Ring using a warrant. Matthew Guariglia, a senior policy analyst at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said “this is a step in the right direction” but that much more can be done.
“Now, Ring hopefully will altogether be out of the business of platforming casual and warrantless police requests for footage to its users,” Guariglia said in a statement. “Ring has been forced to make some important concessions – but we still believe the devices can enable end-to-end encryption by default and turn off default audio collection, which reports have shown collect audio from greater distances than initially assumed.”
The company has previously come under fire for its broader privacy policies around access to users’ footage. In May 2023, Amazon entered into a 20-year $5.8m settlement with the Federal Trade Commission that required the company to disclose to its customers how much access it has to their data. According to the FTC filing, Amazon’s lax privacy policies allowed employees and contractors to “view, download, and transfer customers’ sensitive video data for their own purposes”. Amazon also admitted in 2022 that it had handed police video footage without the customers’ consent or a warrant 11 times that year in cases it deemed an “emergency”.

“We are also still deeply skeptical about law enforcement’s and Ring’s ability to determine what is, or is not, an emergency that requires the company to hand over footage without a warrant or user consent,” Guariglia said."
3AX15Y44QC_EA0FUZEOFDQFJ01,"Abortion prosecutions are never in the public interest, says royal college",Harriet Sherwood,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/22/illegal-abortions-prosecutions-uk-police-royal-college,"Doctors and other healthcare staff should not report suspected illegal abortions to the police as prosecutions are never in the public interest, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has said.
In an intervention on Monday that will trigger further debate on the decriminalisation of abortion, Dr Ranee Thakar, the president of the professional body, said “outdated and antiquated” abortion laws meant women were left vulnerable to criminal investigation.
Health professionals were subject to “unacceptable and unwarranted scrutiny”, Thakar said. If health staff disclose confidential patient information without consent, they could face proceedings by professional bodies, the RCOG said.
The Society for the Protection of Unborn Children said urging health workers not to report abortions could undermine public trust in the health service and the judicial system.
The RCOG’s new guidance to health staff comes amid concern over an increase in the number of investigations and prosecutions of women who have sought or had abortions.
Since 2022, at least six women have been taken to court and dozens have been investigated for allegedly ending their pregnancies outside the legal requirements covering abortion. In the previous 20 years, just three women were prosecuted.
Recent prosecutions include that of Carla Foster, who was jailed for procuring her own abortion, when the foetus was 32 to 34 weeks’ gestation, in 2020. She was later released on appeal amid a public outcry.
Bethany Cox from Teesside was cleared of the same charge earlier this month. Three more women accused of illegal abortions are due to appear in court this year.
The RCOG’s guidance, announced on Monday and drawn up with the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare, the British Society of Abortion Care Providers and the Faculty of Public Health, will say there is no legal obligation to report women who have abortions to police or external agencies, and it is not in the public interest to do so.
Medical staff should not divulge information without consent unless they are concerned for the woman’s safety or the safety of others, and they must be able to justify any disclosure, the guidance will say. Blood tests or other samples should not be provided to the police or other agencies without consent or a court order.
By law, health staff cannot disclose patients’ data unless consent is given. Healthcare workers can breach confidentiality rules to give information to the police about possible crimes only if it is deemed to be in the public interest.
A statement published on the RCOG website said: “Unless a statute requires it (for example with female genital mutilation), a healthcare [worker] must abide by their professional responsibility to justify any disclosure of confidential patient information or face potential fitness-to-practice proceedings. Where healthcare professionals do involve the police it should be in the patient’s best interests or needed to protect others – for example, where there is a risk of death or serious harm.”
Abortions in England must be approved by two doctors and take place within the first 24 weeks of pregnancy. Otherwise, it is illegal to deliberately end a pregnancy and, under the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act, it carries a maximum punishment of life imprisonment. Terminations after 10 weeks are carried out in a hospital or clinic.
The RCOG said it was concerned at the increase in prosecutions involving “deeply traumatised” and vulnerable women. Thakar said: “We firmly believe it is never in the public interest to investigate and prosecute women who have sought to end their own pregnancy. These women should be treated with care and compassion, without judgment or fear of imprisonment.
“Outdated, antiquated abortion laws mean women who have experienced unexplained pregnancy loss are also vulnerable to criminal investigation, and health professionals are placed under unacceptable and unwarranted scrutiny.
“We hope this new best practice guidance gives healthcare professionals clarity around their legal and professional obligations. It is vital that they understand what is expected of them and the potential consequences of breaching patient confidentiality.
“It is just one of the ways we are working towards removing abortion care from criminal law and placing it instead under medical regulation.”
Dr Jonathan Lord, who co-chairs the RCOG abortion taskforce, told the BBC: “We have witnessed life-changing harm to women and their wider families as a direct result of NHS staff reporting women suspected of crimes, and we just don’t think that would happen in other areas of healthcare. We deal with the most vulnerable groups who may be concerned about turning to regulated healthcare at all, and we need them to trust us.”
Lord said the college’s main concern was the sharp rise in women being investigated. “Although the numbers are hard to tease out, at the very tip of the iceberg are those who end up in court … And for everyone who ends up in court, there’s a much greater number who are investigated, and it’s those investigations that really caused the harm to women and their families.
“It’s also just so deeply traumatic if you suffered a pregnancy loss or a natural miscarriage, whether it was from abortion care or whether it was just a natural thing, to then face suspicion and investigation, and know that your name could be very public and you could go to jail, is just deeply distressing.”
According to the Crown Prosecution Service, such cases are rare and addressed sensitively.
A government spokesperson said: “It is important that all women have access to safe and legal abortions on the NHS, which now includes taking abortion pills at home. We understand this is an extremely sensitive issue and we recognise the strongly held views on all sides of the discussion. That is why, by longstanding convention, any change to the law in this area would be a matter of conscience for individual MPs rather than the government.”"
3DZY74EK85_M8678GN2HI1JX4D,Court rejects Trump’s request to reconsider appeal against gag order in election interference case,Hugo Lowell,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/23/court-rejects-trump-gag-order-appeal-january-6-case,"A federal appeals court on Tuesday rejected Donald Trump’s request that it reconsider his appeal against a gag order imposed against him in the criminal case over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results, the latest defeat for the former president in his attempt to remove the restrictions.
The decision by the US court of appeals to deny Trump an “en banc” rehearing – where the full bench of judges consider the matter – paves the way for him to lodge a final appeal with the US supreme court.
For months, Trump has been attempting to free himself from a limited protective order entered by the US district judge Tanya Chutkan, who is overseeing the criminal case in Washington, which has prevented him from making inflammatory statements that could intimidate trial witnesses or poison the jury pool.
The gag order came after special counsel prosecutors complained that Trump’s brazen public statements attacking them, court staff and potential trial witnesses could chill witness testimony and impede the fair administration of justice.
The filing from prosecutors drew attention to Trump’s rally speeches and posts on his Truth Social platform. In one post, Trump attacked his vice-president, Mike Pence, wildly claiming he had “made up stories about me” and had gone over to the “dark side” by talking to prosecutors.
Trump has also attacked Gen Mark Milley, the former chair of the joint chiefs of staff and another likely trial witness, after his testimony was cited in the indictment. Trump suggested that Milley had committed treason and mused that people who committed treason have historically been executed.
Chutkan agreed with prosecutors and issued an order preventing Trump from assailing prosecutors, court staff and trial witnesses. She allowed Trump only to have free rein to attack the Biden administration and the US justice department, and to allege the case was politically motivated.
Trump appealed but had his challenge largely rejected by a three-judge panel at the DC circuit, which upheld the restrictions with the caveat that Trump would also be free to assail the special counsel Jack Smith and people involved in post-2020 election matters as long as he did not target their trial testimony.
The panel rejected Trump’s position that there could only be a gag order after a statement by him had chilled a witness to be misguided, not least because the point of the gag order was to ensure no such harm would occur in the first place.
“Mr Trump is a former president and current candidate for the presidency,” the appeals court wrote in a 68-page opinion. “But Mr Trump is also an indicted criminal defendant, and he must stand trial in a courtroom under the same procedures that govern all other criminal defendants.”

The defeat led Trump to seek a rehearing from the same three-judge panel of Patricia Millett, Cornelia Pillard and Brad Garcia – all Democratic nominees to the bench – as well as from the full court. On Tuesday, Trump had both of the rehearing requests turned down in single-page orders.
The chilly reception that Trump has received from the DC circuit over his gag order appeals has been unsurprising. Protective orders are standard in criminal cases, and federal appeals courts are generally loath to interfere with the wide discretion enjoyed by trial judges."
3EXUINX5EC_96WZ34Z1700EO9N,Tory MPs rally around Rishi Sunak after ex-minister calls for PM to quit,Eleni Courea,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/jan/24/tory-mps-rally-around-rishi-sunak-after-ex-minister-called-for-pm-to-quit,"Conservative MPs have rallied around Rishi Sunak as a former minister who called for him to quit said he felt he was shouting “iceberg” on the Titanic.
Sir Simon Clarke was roundly criticised by Tory colleagues for writing that Sunak should be replaced as party leader in a scathing opinion piece in the Telegraph.
One Tory MP from the 2019 intake said Clarke, 39, who was housing secretary in Liz Truss’s short-lived administration, should lose the whip for undermining the PM in an election year.
“He’s a tosser,” they said, and referred to other recent articles in the paper. “A guy out for revenge for the failed Truss experiment relying on a single Telegraph poll which was paid for by Rishi’s enemies to discredit him.”
Tobias Ellwood, the former defence minister, said: “It’s been interesting how his comments have prompted an impressive rally of support for the PM and against Clarke. I suspect this may deter others from following such a reckless call for yet another leadership campaign.”
In an interview with the BBC on Wednesday, Clarke, knighted in Boris Johnson’s resignation honours, likened himself to someone shouting “iceberg” as the Titanic heads towards disaster.
“I totally respect the strong views that something like this evokes,” he said. “No one likes that guy that’s shouting ‘iceberg’ but I suspect that people will be even less happy if we hit the iceberg.
“And we are on course to do that … I don’t want a decade of decline under [Keir] Starmer. I really worry that we’re on course for a shattering course.”
In a particularly humiliating development, Clarke has been removed from an event to launch a free-market Conservative group he had worked on alongside Truss and Jacob Rees-Mogg.
A source close to Truss said Clarke would no longer be appearing at the launch event of Popular Conservatism on 6 February.
Tory MPs from all wings of the party joined in to criticise Clarke on Wednesday. There was not a single message in support of him on the Conservative MPs’ WhatsApp group, according to one source.
Kwasi Kwarteng, who was Truss’s chancellor, told Times Radio: “I don’t agree with Simon … I think to change the leadership now, without a general election, would be very unwise.
“It was an odd intervention. The thing that struck me is that I think every single person, and there have been lots of people, have really jumped on him and said: ‘What are you doing? Get behind the leader. You’re not speaking for the vast majority of people in the party.’ He’s very much a lone voice on this.”
Another Tory MP, Stephen Hammond, told Times Radio that Clarke should “keep quiet”.
Sunak was greeted by particularly loud cheers from his backbenchers as he entered the Commons for prime minister’s questions on Wednesday.
Starmer accused Sunak of “endlessly fighting with his own MPs”.
“We have seen this story time and time again with this lot, party first, country second,” the Labour leader said.
Asked afterwards what his message was to Tory MPs who are calling for his resignation, Sunak’s press secretary replied: “What, Simon Clarke?”
On being reminded that one other MP, Andrea Jenkyns, had urged Sunak to go, she said: “They are both known critics. That is their view. Clearly, lots of other Conservative MPs disagree with them.”
The regular 1922 Committee meeting of backbench Tory MPs ended after just 15 minutes. Asked if Clarke was there, one MP asked sarcastically: “Who?” Another said that if Clarke had come, “we would have had tar and feathers ready”.
Some Tory MPs privately agree with Clarke’s criticisms of Sunak but think that the idea of replacing him is fanciful. One former minister said: “This is unwise as there is no alternative plan.”
Clarke’s intervention has raised further questions about a major YouGov poll that was commissioned by a shadowy group called the “Conservative Britain Alliance” and published with great fanfare in the Telegraph last week.
After asking those surveyed initially who they would favour between Starmer and Sunak, the poll then asked voters to carry out a “hypothetical thought experiment” where they chose between Starmer and a new Conservative leader who is tough on migration, cuts taxes for working people and gets NHS waiting lists down.
YouGov published a clarification of its methodology on Wednesday after criticism, including from Manchester politics professor, Rob Ford, who called it “one of the worst poll questions I’ve ever seen”. It is not known who paid for the polling.
In his piece, Clarke argued that Sunak “is leading the Conservatives into an election where we will be massacred” because “he does not get what Britain needs. And he is not listening to what the British people want.”"
3IKQTKFLZ8_IRWKPCAER1AUFYY,Ita Buttrose backs David Anderson after ABC board passes unanimous vote of confidence,Jordyn Beazley,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/jan/23/abc-managing-director-david-anderson-no-confidence-vote-fails-ita-buttrose-support,"The ABC’s board has rejected a union vote of no confidence in managing director David Anderson, with chair Ita Buttrose saying the suggestion he did not support the broadcaster’s journalists was “abhorrent and incorrect”.
It comes after a week of internal unrest at the national broadcaster after the journalist Antoinette Lattouf lodged an unlawful dismissal claim against the ABC.
On Monday, in a meeting of more than 200 ABC union members, it was claimed that the broadcaster’s leadership team had failed “to defend the integrity of the ABC and staff from attacks”. A motion of no confidence in Anderson was passed.
The ABC board met on Tuesday to discuss the unrest and the claims lodged by Lattouf in the Fair Work Commission (FWC), before passing a unanimous vote of confidence in Anderson.
“David Anderson has always been strong a supporter of the independence of the ABC and its journalists. He has encouraged them to report without fear or favour and has never weakly surrendered to criticism as some critics have alleged,” Buttrose said in a statement after the meeting.
“The ABC regularly receives, and responds to, complaints from individuals or organisations and the assumption that either the managing director as editor-in-chief or I would be influenced by any sort of lobbying pressure is quite simply wrong.
“The Board, including the managing director, recognise that this is a very difficult environment for our staff with many societal issues that threaten to divide us. We will continue to prioritise actions that support our staff, ensure our journalistic independence, and protect the trust that Australians place in the ABC.”
Last Tuesday, the Sydney Morning Herald reported it had seen a chain of leaked WhatsApp messages showing a letter-writing campaign from pro-Israel lobbyists targeting Anderson and Buttrose in the week starting 18 December over Lattouf’s fill-in job on ABC radio in Sydney.
On 20 December, Lattouf was summoned to a meeting with senior management and told she was terminated immediately because she had reposted on Instagram a post from Human Rights Watch that said: “The Israeli government is using starvation of civilians as a weapon of war in Gaza.”
In a defence filed to the FWC, the ABC claimed Lattouf was warned about posting on social media about controversial topics before she was dismissed from her role. The ABC also objected to Lattouf’s claim that her firing was unlawful, writing “with respect, the application is fundamentally and entirely misconceived”.
Lattouf has claimed unlawful termination on the grounds of “political opinion or a reason that included political opinion” and later expanded the claim to include race due to her Lebanese heritage.
She is seeking a detailed public apology and compensation for harm to her reputation and for distress and humiliation. She will also seek an order that the ABC offers her a commensurate role back on air.
The ABC later advised Lattouf’s lawyer, Josh Bornstein, that it was now claiming it did not terminate her employment and she was not entitled to make an unlawful termination application.
On Tuesday, ABC news director Justin Stevens sent an email to staff, seen by Guardian Australia, saying members of the public are entitled to make complaints about the ABC’s journalism, but said the broadcaster never buckles to “external pressure”.
“During my time at the ABC, I have dealt with multiple complaints and representations – some from powerful vested interests looking to influence our publications,” he said. “Our guiding principle is that we listen to all complaints but we never buckle to external pressure over our journalism.”
Stevens also responded to allegations that “the News Division does not defend its journalists” and the motion of no confidence in Anderson, saying he believes Anderson is a person of “utmost integrity”.
“I take this very seriously. We work constantly to defend our journalists against unjustified attacks, often multiple times in a day,” he wrote.
“Some of this you can see publicly. What you won’t see is the advocacy and pushback done behind the scenes on your behalf.
“I have seen [Anderson] back our journalism to the hilt on countless occasions, privately and publicly.”"
3JU5RYJ10M_YZ0B0M6H5NY4VRG,"Of course we should let the children play, but should we let them swear as well?",Emma Brockes,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/25/children-swearing-teacher-school-us,"A big topic of conversation in our house is how much stricter English schools are than their American equivalents. What if, one of my children will say as we leave the house in the morning, I wore what I’m wearing to school in England? (You’d be sent home.) What if I wore my beanie in class? (You’d be told to take if off.) What if – the big one – I went to school in makeup and false nails, as some nine-year-olds in their school do? (I would probably get a call from the office and quite right, too.) “What about self-expression?” they complain, like diligent Americans, and I explain that this is not a priority in the English school system, besides which, wearing Air Jordans because “Ava does” isn’t what self-expression means.
These differences are, obviously, all uniform-based and elsewhere the two systems are clearly more aligned. In Mississippi this week, a news story to warm the heart as a seven-year-old was admonished by the teacher for “unacceptable language”, when, to quote the letter from the school his mother uploaded to Facebook, “he said Jesus Christ when he dropped the Legos he was clearing up”. The document the boy was sent home with fell under the rubric of “parent notice of disciplinary incident”, an over-reaction his family are objecting to in a post that has promptly gone viral.
This incident is only funny, I would suggest, because of the very particular role played by the words “Jesus Christ” in the swearing lexicon as it applies to minors. It is one of those litmus tests that show up early on when you meet other parents – how they respond to bad language and where the line falls – and it often comes as a surprise. On a playdate the other day with a mum I consider vaguely permissive, the speed with which she corrected her daughter’s use of the word “ass” to “behind” forced me to reassess. Although, like politicians who police everyone else’s moral standards to distract from their own, I sometimes think fussiness around language accompanies weird dynamics elsewhere.
Then again, I would say that; I’m very bad about swearing. (In my defence, New York apartments are small and I can’t swear in private with another adult unless I put my people in headphones). As a result, my children are exceedingly prim on the matter of language, which is both pleasing and incredibly tedious. I can get away with “shite” because it’s English and they don’t understand how it lands, but they are on me for everything else. Gratifyingly, when asked to delineate the hierarchy of bad words, their generation appears to skew somewhat political: “the N-word, the B-word, the Sh-word,” they tell me. They don’t like the “A-word” either, although we have had a long discussion this week about why, exactly, the word “bad-ass” is common usage while just “ass” on its own is quite rude.
Meanwhile, the F-word, which you would think might place high on the list, is simultaneously so pervasive, and so beyond the pale, that they don’t even rank it – although they cannot recognise that, in the right circumstance, it can be very funny. Last year, when one of their third-grade teachers tripped on the corner of the rug and mouthed the word “fuck”, my daughter clocked and brought it home for us, in a story we will enjoy revisiting for the rest of our lives.
Which brings us to Jesus Christ, sort of. Even my puritanical children can understand that, in the case of this particular vulgarity, it is age-inappropriate not because it’s obscene, but because, like a baby wearing a flat cap, it has an aesthetic that belongs to old people. A small child swearing with the jaded frustration of a grizzled executive or a salty old diva can’t reasonably be considered anything but funny – except, it turns out, in Mississippi.
Approached for comment by a local Fox TV station, the DeSoto county school district remarked on the matter of the seven-year-old’s outburst at having to clear up the Lego: “DeSoto County students would not be reprimanded for simply saying Jesus Christ.” However, the spokesperson added: “It is possible that a student could be corrected for a disrespectful use of Jesus Christ’s name.” Well, quite. Context is all. In which case, I would draw your attention to the recent viral video of an Australian two-year-old looking out her window and saying, guilelessly, “there’s a fucking goat outside!”, which – I’m not proud of this, but what can I do? – strikes me as one of the funniest things I’ve ever seen.

3LDB8KMJPW_K67EQ0HT2B2DSI7,The endgame looms for Sunak and the Tories. ‘Rwanda’ will be the epitaph on their political grave,Simon Jenkins,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/25/rwanda-rishi-sunak-tories-public-services,"The ship goes down and the panic starts. As the Tory party lurches towards the electoral rocks, the bridge is losing control and the crew are taking to the boats. Or at least some of them are, joined this week by a disaffected backbencher, Simon Clarke, and a reported band of a dozen rebels. Clarke’s thesis is that “an electoral massacre” can only be avoided if the ship mutinies and acquires its fifth captain in five years. His colleagues are mostly refugees from the Boris Johnson and Liz Truss eras, the source of so much of the Tories’ present troubles.
The new rebels are a measure of the herculean task that confronted Rishi Sunak on taking the Tory leadership just 15 months ago. A government long in office at this stage in a parliament has almost nothing going for it. Polls have sometimes been wrong – they forecast a Labour win in 1992 – but this seems unlikely now. They merely argue over the size of defeat. The Tories’ task is to keep their nerve, maintain loyalty to their leader and measure up to the challenge history has given them.
The trouble is that as the election approaches, Tory MPs worry less about their party winning and more about losing their seats and their jobs. A recent YouGov poll suggested as many as half may do so. For MPs such as Clarke who have never known opposition, this is enough to induce a loss of political nerve – and put pressure on their leader either to go or to offer a barrage of electoral bribes.
This runs directly counter to what was a sensible strategy for Sunak on taking power in 2022. Facing almost certain failure, his mission was to steady the ship. He needed to clear up the budgetary aftermath of the pandemic and the chaotic legacy of Johnson and Truss. He had to make a Tory vote in 2024 seem like one for stability and common sense. The first budget from his downbeat chancellor Jeremy Hunt conformed to this. Together, they seemed the ideal team for the job.
Since last summer, however, things have fallen apart. Sunak’s weeks have been filled with photo opportunities setting up decisions, or more often leaks of decisions, that have grasped at electoral straws. He and Hunt have signalled tax cuts, energy price caps, more childcare, higher pensions, more NHS recruits and rescued council budgets. Almost all are near meaningless for a regime with less than a year to run and absolutely no spare money. Worse has been the one issue that has replaced Europe as the perennial obsession of rebellious Tories: immigration.
All prime ministers have tended to depart office with a fatal phrase stamped as a memorial on their graves. For Margaret Thatcher it was the poll tax, for Tony Blair Iraq, for David Cameron it was Brexit and for Johnson it was Partygate. Sunak’s memorial is destined to be Rwanda. The policy was the talismanic favourite of his rightwing home secretary, Suella Braverman, on whom he was rumoured to have depended in his leadership bid. The iron law of cabinets is that home secretaries chosen for any reason other than merit are accidents waiting to happen. Braverman’s Rwanda was the prime minister’s great mistake.
Every occupant of Downing Street has needed an in-house adviser, a source of caution, a second thought in time of stress. Sunak has conspicuously lacked one. We know he had regarded Rwanda as a nonsense, as he, in effect, admitted when he was at the Treasury in 2022. Deporting a few hundred asylum seekers to central Africa would be absurdly expensive, statistically trivial and ethically dubious. Its declared purpose was buried in the reckless authoritarian concept of deterrence. Never can deterrence have been less plausible than in the case of those risking their lives on the nightmare trek across half the world.
Rwanda’s history as a deportation centre is more than chequered. It has become nothing but a totemic sop to rightwing opinion. Whatever the legality of any British deportation, it seems unlikely that a single plane will depart by election time, let alone a single migrant be shown as deterred. The reality is that illegal migration into Britain from continental Europe has one solution, and that lies in Europe. All else is pretence.
Sunak must now stagger on through the rest of 2024. He faces the terminal period of office that risks being defined by a policy that panders not to public opinion – which is equivocal on Rwanda – but to his right wing. If he has any concern for his reputation he will shelve Rwanda, cast aside his fixation on tax cuts and do everything to rescue public services, whose state is the most glaring failure of modern British government. His Commons jibes at Keir Starmer are like those of a man howling in the dark. He would do better to seek the Labour leader’s support in reforms that Starmer will next year have to implement.
What should matter now is the dignity with which Sunak completes what was always a difficult task. He should want it to be said of him that, in whatever shambles he left the Tory party, at least he did the right thing for the country.

3ND9W2XP4S_029DL4W2IVZ9TPT,Florida advances law banning children under 16 from using social media,Sam Levine,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/25/florida-social-media-teenager-ban-bill,"Florida lawmakers advanced a bill on Wednesday that would prohibit social media platforms from allowing young teens to have an account while requiring everyone else to verify their age.
The measure prohibits anyone under 16 from creating a new social media account and requires platforms to delete existing accounts held by minors who are younger than 16. It also would require social media companies to delete any personal information from the accounts and for the platforms to use a “nongovernmental, independent, third-party not affiliated with the social media platform” to verify users’ age.
The bill passed the Florida house with a bipartisan 106-13 vote and now heads to the Republican-controlled senate.
“These dopamine hits [from social media] are so addictive, it’s like a digital fentanyl,” Fiona McFarland, a Republican state lawmaker who cosponsored the legislation, said on the house floor on Wednesday, according to Politico. “And even the most plugged-in parent or attuned teen has a hard time shutting the door against these addictive features.”
Vivek Murthy, the US surgeon general, released a warning last year about the dangers of social media for kids. While he said more research was needed to fully understand the effects, “there are ample indicators that social media can also have a profound risk of harm to the mental health and wellbeing of children and adolescents”.
The bill does not name which platforms specifically the bill would apply to but says it would apply to anything that “utilizes addictive, harmful, or deceptive design features, or any other feature that is designed to cause an account holder to have an excessive or compulsive need to use or engage with the social media platform”.
Florida is one of several states that has taken action recently to limit teenagers’ exposure to social media. Last year, Utah became the first state in the country to ban people under 18 from using social media without consent from a guardian. The state also prohibits minors from using a social media account from 10.30pm to 6.30am. An industry trade group is currently suing Utah over the law.
Other states have required the platforms to undertake measures such as children safety assessments and requiring a change in the algorithms that are served to minors. New York City also declared social media a “public health hazard” on Wednesday."
3OSZ23UCHQ_ZMKEI4RZY61F066,Books and looks: gen Z is ‘rediscovering’ the public library,Alaina Demopoulos,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/jan/26/books-and-looks-gen-z-is-rediscovering-the-public-library,"Henry Earls dresses up to go to the library. He’ll plan outfits after searching “dark academic” on Pinterest, taking inspiration from the internet subculture obsessed with higher education and literature. He picks out cozy knitted sweaters and accessorizes with well-worn copies of classic books. Earls looks like an adjunct English professor – or an extra in Saltburn.
“I want to cultivate an aesthetic when I go to the library,” the 20 year-old Cooper Union art student said. “And, honestly, I dress up to see if someone will come up to me and say hi.”
When Earls isn’t studying at the New York Public Library, he cruises the reading room for friends – or more than friends. Last week, he (respectfully) slipped his number to a young woman sitting near him, which led to a flirty text exchange. A few days ago, he made a friend on the library steps, a law student prepping for an exam.
“We met in an environment that supports focus and growth, so we hit it off,” Earls said. “He might come hang out with my friends and me sometime.”
Gen Z seems to love public libraries. A November report from the American Library Association (ALA) drawing from ethnographic research and a 2022 survey found that gen Z and millennials are using public libraries, both in person and digitally, at higher rates than older generations.
More than half of the survey’s 2,075 respondents had visited a physical library within the past 12 months. Not all of them were bookworms: according to the report, 43% of gen Z and millennials don’t identify as readers – but about half of those non-readers still visited their local library in the past year. Black gen Zers and millennials visit libraries at particularly high rates.
Libraries have never been just about books. These are community hubs, places to connect and discover. For an extremely online generation that’s nearly synonymous with the so-called “loneliness epidemic” libraries are increasingly social spaces, too.
“We traditionally think of libraries as very quiet, and parts of them are, but what we observed watching gen Z in libraries is that there are some really great spaces for teens, big rooms where they can do things like gaming or making their own music,” said Rachel Noorda, a co-author of the ALA report. “It’s a place to be solitary, but also a place to build community.”
And a place to flex. On TikTok, Earls posts selfie videos showing him studying, journaling or reading in front of the Bryant Park library’s breathtaking beaux-arts backdrop. The clips get millions of views. “I think people my age are craving something more authentic, and looking for something that’s real,” Earls said. “What’s more real than books and physical material?”
Library-related content does well on #booktok, where young literary influencers – many of them still in high school – drive sales by recommending and reviewing stories. (Colleen Hoover, #booktok’s favorite author, shot to the top of bestseller lists due to viral endorsements; other recommended books often fall into the “romantasy” young adult category.)
“A lot of my followers find libraries appealing in an aesthetic way,” said Marwa Medjahed, an 18-year-old TikToker who posts about life as a George Washington University freshman to her 115,000 followers. “They feel like I’m enjoying studying, rather than being in a bleak dorm room with harsh lighting.”
While many young people read digitally, downloading (or pirating) titles, hard copies of books are fetishized on social media. “Ebooks don’t make good props on TikTok,” Kathi Inman Berens, co-author of the ALA report, said. “You need book materiality, a printed book, something that helps visually.” Why buy the title when you can just borrow it at the library?
Tom Worcester, 28, is one of the co-founders of Reading Rhythms, a New York-based “reading party” held at bars. Attendees pay $20 to cozy up with their books while DJs play ambient tracks in the background. Guests can mingle in between sets. The events are held twice weekly, but that doesn’t stop Worcester from going to real libraries, too. “If I know I have a good four-hour block of time to myself, I’ll ask a bunch of friends, ‘Do you want to go to the library today?’” he said. “I make it a social event.”
At the end of last year, Worcester and a friend took a trip to Amsterdam, where they visited the Openbare Bibliotheek. Inside the second-largest library in Europe, the pair conducted personal “annual reviews”, spending hours reflecting on the highs and lows of their year. “When you’re at the library, there’s an unspoken agreement that you will focus on what you have to do,” he said.
Talk to any young and online person long enough about libraries and they’ll inevitably bring up the “third place”, a term coined in 1989 by the urban sociologist Ray Oldenburg. Like attachment styles or imposter syndrome, the third place is an academic term turned social media discourse point. Separate from home and work, it is a space for gathering and socialization. Bars, coffee shops, churches and libraries are the usual examples.
Gen Z’s well aware that they lack many of the third places their parents had, especially as the lines between work and home blurred during Covid. Libraries are the last place they feel exists that asks nothing of them. You can truly come as you are.
“Coffee shops get so crowded, and you have to spend money to be there, but libraries are open for everyone,” said Anika Neumeyer, a 19 year-old English student who volunteers at the Seattle Public Library. “There’s a lot less pressure to be doing something in the public library. No one’s going to judge you.”
In 2018, the librarian and academic Fobazi Ettarh coined the term “vocational awe”. It describes the idea that libraries are “inherently good” and “beyond critique”, which can lead to the exploitation of their workers. Abby Hargreaves, a librarian in the Washington DC area who posts about her job to 48,000 TikTok followers, believes gen Z has a tendency to romanticize the position.
“There’s this idea of, ‘I’ll go to my library and have some great adventure while I’m there,’” Hargreaves said. “But then we also see people who are looking to tear libraries down, whether that’s through budget cuts or legislated book bans.”
If gen Z is going to save libraries, they couldn’t pick a better time to advocate for them: across the country, these institutions and their workers are under attack. Last year, Mayor Eric Adams of New York City slashed funding to public libraries, cutting Sunday service in the five boroughs – and drawing the ire of Cardi B, who went on an Instagram Live tirade over the news.
A series of library-related bills are making their way through Idaho’s legislature that would restrict material it deems inappropriate for minors and allow family members to file $2,500 lawsuits against libraries that violate the law. Last year, Missouri Republicans attempted to strip all state funding from public libraries. This week, Chaya Raichik, the rightwing influencer behind Libs of Tiktok, was appointed to a library advisory position for Oklahoma’s schools, which means she could help determine what books are “appropriate” for students.
Meanwhile, school librarians in states across the country report enduring harassment – and for some, death threats – by rightwing trolls just for doing their jobs.
“It’s so strange when you hear, ‘Oh, gen Z loves libraries,’ or when the algorithm keeps feeding you videos of beautiful libraries, but then there’s no more Sunday service and you have to wait weeks for your book to come,” said Anna Murphy, an upper school librarian at the Berkeley Carroll School in Brooklyn. “The library love and hate seems to exist in two different universes.”
Emily Drabinski, president of the ALA, reminds us that the vast majority of US voters oppose book bans and hold librarians in “high regard”. “Most people love the library, especially after 50 years of systematic disinvestment of public institutions, since it’s the only one left standing,” she said.
Arlo Platt Zolov is a 15-year-old who lives in Brooklyn and has what must be one of the all-time-best after-school jobs: running the information desk at the central branch of the public library, steps away from Prospect Park. “A lot of people my age are surrounded by tech and everything’s moving so quickly,” he said. “Part of me thinks we’re rediscovering libraries not as something new, but for what they’ve always been: a shared space of comfort.”"
3PSXEK5O3K_I2OWRIO4EQBLHGW,‘Utter stupidity’: Missouri Republican bids to bring back dueling for senators,Martin Pengelly,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/26/missouri-republican-dueling-statehouse,"A Missouri Republican’s proposal to reintroduce dueling to solve statehouse differences was branded “utter stupidity” by a leading historian of political violence.
“Back in the day,” Joanne B Freeman of Yale tweeted, “they were smart enough to take dueling OUTSIDE. The draft that I saw suggests doing it in the chamber. This doesn’t show guts or bravery or manhood – if it’s supposed to. It shows utter stupidity.”
Freeman is the author of The Field of Blood: Violence in Congress and the Road to Civil War.
The state senator behind the proposal said he was making a point about the breakdown of regular order in Missouri politics.
The draft rule change came to national notice when it was posted to social media by Democrats in the state senate.
“The Missouri Republican civil war continues to escalate as a member of the Freedom Caucus faction has filed a proposed rule change to allow senators to challenge an ‘offending senator to a duel’,” they wrote.
The Missouri Freedom Caucus is a hardline rightwing group on the lines of the group of the same name in the US House of Representatives and with a similarly fractious relationship with party leaders, impeding political business.
The draft rule read: “If a senator’s honor is impugned by another senator to the point that it is beyond repair and in order for the offended senator to gain satisfaction, such senator may rectify the perceived insult to the senator’s honor by challenging the offending senator to a duel.
“The trusted representative, known as the second, of the offended senator shall send a written challenge to the offending senator. The two senators shall agree to the terms of the duel, including choice of weapons, which shall be witnessed and enforced by their respective seconds.
“The duel shall take place in the well of the senate at the hour of high noon on the date agreed to by the parties to the duel.”
The author, Nick Schroer, represents District 2 in the Missouri senate. According to his biography, he is a lawyer, specialising in family law and criminal defence.
His chief of staff, Jamey Murphy, told Newsweek that Schroer was “deeply committed to restoring a sense of honor in the Missouri Senate” but suggested “the idea of a duel … in a metaphorical sense”.

Schroer told the Kansas City Star: “The behavior that we’ve seen on the floor, lack of communication from leadership, politics as a whole just eroding … If we’re going back in time and acting like an uncivilized society, I think we need to have discussion.”
Dueling was long part of the American political scene, famously resulting in the killing of the US founder Alexander Hamilton by Aaron Burr in 1804. It had largely died out by the 1850s but other forms of political violence continued.
Freeman has illuminated how incidents of political violence – including the South Carolina congressman Preston Brooks’ caning of Charles Sumner, an anti-slavery senator from Massachusetts, in 1856 – paved the road to conflict.
In 2021, after Donald Trump incited the January 6 Capitol attack and amid fears of rising violence, Freeman told the Guardian of the incidents she studied: “Depending on how it’s acted out and the language that’s used and the posturing that’s taken by the members of Congress, it’s deliberately intended to rile up Americans, which it does.
“That kind of violence can encourage violence, intensify political rhetoric [and] seemingly justify extremism and violence. It has an impact on the public. If the public gets riled up, they’re going to demand more things from their representatives – more violence, more extremism.”"
3PVL5VZJIK_BS2JTGXO4D8HBAB,"The House of Lords is very flawed. But if it picks apart Sunak’s Rwanda bill, that’s its job and it deserves support",Martin Kettle,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/25/house-of-lords-rishi-sunak-rwanda-bill,"Recent prime ministers have been all too obviously thrilled by the adrenaline rush of the flak jacket and international conflict. One or two others have preferred the more cerebral challenge of the British constitution’s Rubik’s-cube intricacies. Neither of these, though, has ever seemed like an issue that floats Rishi Sunak’s boat. Instead, this prime minister has always appeared far more interested in new technology, economic theory and mastering the detail, rather than national security policy or political checks and balances.
Yet now, at the start of 2024, Sunak finds himself out of his managerialist comfort zone. Instead, he is increasingly reliant on defiant public postures on both military action and the constitution. In the former case he has taken on the improbable mantle of a warrior leading a bombing campaign against Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping. In the latter, equally awkwardly, he is now casting himself as a populist hammer of the House of Lords in the pursuit of his Rwanda policy.
Both are stances without vision. Both are thrust on Sunak by other failures. Both tell us more about the floundering nature of his prime ministership, which a handful of second-order politicians such as David Frost and Simon Clarke seem determined to terminate, than about any flowering.
It will be useful to keep this in mind next week when the so-called safety of Rwanda bill reaches the House of Lords. The bill, which gives the government the power to deport refugees and migrants to Rwanda, has struggled to get through the House of Commons in the face of rightwing opposition. It now faces an equally tough passage through the upper chamber, starting on Monday with its second reading. Anyone who believes that the parliamentary climax of the Rwanda issue has already been reached may have another think coming.
The bill will be in the Lords for at least a month. It would be surprising if it were not significantly amended during February’s committee stage. After all, the Lords have already defeated the government on a closely connected issue this week. On Monday, peers voted by a majority of 43 for an all-party motion, moved by the former attorney-general Lord Goldsmith, not to ratify the UK-Rwanda treaty (on which the Rwanda safety bill is based) until the treaty’s new protections, many of which are a response to the supreme court’s verdict last year, have been properly implemented. If this is also the mood when the Lords debates amendments to the bill, then further government defeats will surely follow.
The government’s line is already clear. In his press conference after his nail-biting Commons victory last week, Sunak said “only one question” was any longer at stake. Would the appointed House of Lords “try and frustrate the will of the people as expressed by the elected house?”. The Home Office minister Lord Sharpe took this line in the debate on the Goldsmith motion this week. So, on social media, did Nigel Farage, who demanded the sacking of all peers after the government was defeated. Prepare to hear plenty more of it in the weeks to come.
Sunak is right that the willingness of the Lords to challenge the Rwanda bill is a real question. But it is not the only one, and certainly not in the terms he is posing it. Yes, the unelected nature of the upper house is an obvious affront to Britain’s status as a democracy. But the affront is hardly new.
What is more, the last five Conservative governments have done precisely nothing to change it. On the contrary, they have made the affront worse. David Cameron, now a notable beneficiary of the system himself, pulled the rug from under the Lords reform when he was prime minister in 2012. The issue has been off the Conservative agenda ever since. Its abandonment paved the way for the many ennoblement abuses committed in the Boris Johnson and Liz Truss eras.
Sunak could have taken a stand against those corruptions. He did not do so. It is therefore a bit rich for him to rail against the appointed upper house when he himself is currently doing the appointing. Since 2010, Britain’s five Conservative prime ministers have created more than 200 new Tory life peerages.
And the rate of these appointments is rising. Sunak has been prime minister for a mere 15 months, yet he is already on the verge of surpassing the number of Tory peers that the more modest Theresa May appointed in three years. He also knows, if the Conservatives lose the election, that even more of his former MPs, advisers and donors will soon be lobbying him for their ermine in his dissolution list.
The case for reforming the UK’s upper chamber is very strong. But that is not the case Sunak is making. There are other big constitutional issues at stake in the Rwanda bill too. They include the government’s attempt to exclude domestic and European courts from the law, and the importance of adherence to international treaties and conventions. There is also the issue highlighted by Goldsmith’s motion this week. If parliament has no effective rights over our treaties, then the will of the people that Sunak is invoking counts for little.
In its desperation to send some refugees to central Africa before the next election, the government and the Commons have brushed all these principles to one side. The Lords should not do the same. The upper chamber in its present form should be history. But hold your nose a little longer. While it exists, it is entitled to do its job, to do it properly, and to be supported for its efforts.

3W19LYN0UP_02AOVBFV8J7YPQ9,World’s oldest Holocaust museum adds ‘Gaza’ abuse to London collection on 90th anniversary,Daniel Boffey,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/23/worlds-oldest-holocaust-museum-adds-gaza-abuse-to-london-collection-on-90th-anniversary,"In the basement of the world’s oldest archive of the Holocaust, located in a townhouse on Russell Square in London, the latest artefact to join the Wiener Holocaust Library’s collection leans against a wall.
It is a metal sign that had been attached to the building’s front railings until early November when it was brought downstairs after staff arriving at work found it daubed with the word “Gaza” in red paint.
“It is quite bulky so I don’t think anyone’s worked out where it is going to be stored”, said the head curator, Dr Barbara Warnock.
There had been similar examples of antisemitic graffiti found around the capital in the weeks after the 7 October attacks in Israel.
“I assume it was coordinated,” Warnock said of the defacing of schools, bus stops and synagogues at the time. “I don’t think the police have managed to identify anyone as far as I’m aware – at least not that I’ve heard.”
It marks a dispiriting start to next week’s 90th anniversary of the library’s establishment, something that is being commemorated in London with an exhibition of some of the archive’s most significant objects, and in Amsterdam with the installation of new Stolpersteine (stumbling stones), concrete cubes with metal plates, engraved with the names of Kurt Zielenziger and Bernhard Krieg, who died in the Bergen Belsen concentration camp.
They had worked at the library’s predecessor, the Jewish Central Information Office (JCIO), after it was established in Amsterdam in 1934 by Dr Alfred Wiener, a German Jew who had left his home country with his family after Hermann Göring personally told him that he was no longer welcome.
Wiener had been warning since 1919 of the rise of antisemitism in Germany and had shown extraordinary foresight about the threat the Nazis posed even when they appeared a spent force in the mid-1920s.
A third Stolperstein is being installed for Wiener’s wife, Dr Margarete Wiener-Saulmann, who also worked at the JCIO. She and her three daughters did not receive the visa they needed in time to join Wiener in London, where he had fled from Amsterdam with the collection before the German invasion of Holland in 1940.
Margarete died on 21 January 1945 as a train was taking her to Switzerland from the Bergen Belsen concentration camp as part of a prisoner swap. Her daughters, including Mirjam Wiener, the mother of the Conservative peer and journalist Daniel Finkelstein, survived.
Wiener’s collection was not just a warning. When Adolf Hitler’s deputy, Rudolf Hess, flew solo to Scotland in an attempt to negotiate a peace proposal, the library provided evidence of who he was and his past actions. It provided intelligence on the Möhne dam to assist with the Dambusters raid, including maps of the area.
Today it remained as relevant as ever, said Warnock. The rise in antisemitic and Islamophobic attacks since October had been difficult, she said, but it had not come out of a vacuum.
The period during which Jeremy Corbyn led the Labour party was deeply uncomfortable while the Covid pandemic was an excuse for the dissemination of a whole new wave of antisemitic conspiracy theories, she added.
Among the pieces on show for the next week are a pamphlet published by the JCIO on London in 1945, which is one of the earliest accounts from a survivor of the Auschwitz death camp. Mordechai Lichtenstein, born in Bendzin in Poland in 1912, chronicled the workings of the camp, and noted the particularly murderous intent of the guards after hearing the latest speeches from Hitler and Goebbels over the wireless.
There are also drawings on display from children who witnessed the genocide in Darfur, western Sudan. Warnock said they were, at heart, an organisation concerned with the plight of refugees.
Of the exhibition, Warnock said: “I think we’re hoping to make people aware of us, aware of the history aware of the quality and depth and range of the collections, and its significance to Britain.
“With our history as a refugee organisation, we are also concerned about, you know, rhetoric, and sometimes policy around refugees as well. There’s a lot to be concerned about.”"
3XMGILG7G8_H65XSQSMPWNCQ0W,UN expert condemns UK crackdown on environmental protest,Sandra Laville,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/23/un-expert-condemns-uk-crackdown-on-environmental-protest,"A severe crackdown on environmental protest in Britain with “draconian” new laws, excessive restrictions on courtroom evidence and the use of civil injunctions is having a chilling impact on fundamental freedoms, the United Nations special rapporteur has said.
As the world faces a triple planetary crisis of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution, environmental protesters were acting for the “benefit of us all” and must be protected, Michel Forst, the UN special rapporteur on environmental defenders, said on Tuesday.
Forst said that during a two-day visit to the UK earlier this month he uncovered worrying information on the treatment of peaceful protesters.
Rules imposed on defendants in one London court have prevented them from explaining their motivations to the jury. At Inner London crown court, peaceful protesters have been forbidden by court order from mentioning the climate crisis, fuel poverty or even the US civil rights movement in their statements to the jury.
“It is very difficult to understand what could justify denying the jury the opportunity to hear the reason for the defendant’s action, and how a jury could reach a properly informed decision without hearing it, in particular at the time of environmental defenders’ peaceful but ever more urgent calls for the government to take pressing action for the climate,” Forst said.
He said the prosecution of peaceful protesters under “regressive” new public nuisance laws in the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022, which carried a 10-year sentence, and the use of the Public Order Act 2023 was criminalising peaceful demonstrations.
Forst highlighted the case of a peaceful protester jailed in December for six months for walking slowly down a road for 30 minutes during a climate protest under the new public order law.
“It is important to highlight that, prior to these legislative developments, it had been almost unheard of since the 1930s for members of the public to be imprisoned for peaceful protest in the UK,” said Forst, in a statement issued on Tuesday morning. “I am therefore seriously concerned by these regressive new laws.”
Forst also picked out the harsh bail conditions imposed on climate activists for peaceful protests. These include being forced to wear tags while awaiting trial, restrictions on movement, and bans on speaking to other environmental activists.
“Some environmental defenders have also been required to wear electronic ankle tags, some including a 10pm-7am curfew, and others, GPS tracking,” said Forst. “Under the current timeframes of the criminal justice system, environmental defenders may be on bail for up to two years from the date of arrest to their eventual criminal trial.
“Such severe bail conditions have significant impacts on the environmental defenders’ personal lives and mental health, and I seriously question the necessity and proportionality of such conditions for persons engaging in peaceful protest.”
He condemned the widespread use of civil injunctions to stop peaceful protest and the “toxic” discourse in the media and among politicians about climate protesters.
“The toxic discourse may also be used by the state as justification for adopting increasingly severe and draconian measures against environmental defenders,” he said.
“In the course of my visit, I witnessed first-hand that this is precisely what is taking place in the UK right now. This has a significant chilling effect on civil society and the exercise of fundamental freedoms.”
Forst said he was speaking out because of the gravity of his concerns about the widespread restrictions on peaceful protest. His investigations are ongoing as he considers formal complaints about treatment that have been submitted to him.
He called for a constructive dialogue with the Conservative government to ensure that members of the public seeking to protect the environment were not subject to persecution, penalisation or harassment for doing so.
The UN special rapporteur is appointed under the Aarhus convention to which the Uk is a signatory.
Tim Crosland of Plan B said the convention was legally binding on the UK and the implication of the special rapporteur’s report was that the Government was acting unlawfully.
“ If the events related by the UN rapporteur were taking place in Russia or China we’d be appalled,” he said.
“The British Government aims to crush political opposition to its environmental destruction through a violent programme of repression - imprisoning peaceful demonstrators and undermining the right to a fair trial. In doing they vandalise not only our environment and Britain’s international reputation, but also our democracy.”
Sacha Deshmukh, Amnesty International UK’s chief executive, said: “The UN special rapporteur offers a damning indictment of the repressive crackdown climate activists in the UK face for exercising their right to peacefully protest.
“The UK Government seems more intent on creating a climate of fear than tackling the climate crisis.“"
3Y7UA7GQGY_YY254ESYW1PXUPZ,Data gold rush: companies once focused on mining cryptocurrency pivot to generative AI,Josh Taylor,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/27/tech-companies-shift-generative-ai-chatgpt,"Since generative AI exploded into global consciousness in 2023, an unprecedented demand for computing power has emerged alongside the demand for apps utilising the technology.
Tool’s like OpenAI’s ChatGPT require thousands of Nvidia GPUs (graphics processing units) to smoothly process all the information being fed in and output. Nvidia last week compared GPUs to rare earth metals for AI, saying they’re “foundational” for the operation of generative AI today.
The energy required to power all this hardware is the equivalent of a small country, according to a report released by French energy company Schneider Electric last year. On Wednesday OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, told an audience at Davos that an energy breakthrough was needed to power AI advances. “There’s no way to get there without a breakthrough,” he said, suggesting it was motivation for investing more in nuclear fusion.
Fortune Business Insights estimated earlier this year the global GPU market size was valued at US$2.39bn in 2022 and is projected to grow from US$3.16bn in 2023 to US$25.53bn by 2030. Nvidia claims more than 40,000 companies use Nvidia GPUs for AI and accelerated computing.
To meet the demand, Nvidia announced in August it would be tripling its production of GPUs. In November, Microsoft signed a multi-year deal with Oracle to supply computing power for its Bing Chat AI functionality.
Now companies that once serviced the boom in cryptocurrency mining are pivoting to take advantage of the latest data gold rush.

Canadian company Hive Blockchain changed its name in July to Hive Digital Technologies and announced it was pivoting to AI.
“Hive has been a pioneering force in the cryptocurrency mining sector since 2017. The adoption of a new name signals a significant strategic shift to harness the potential of GPU Cloud compute technology, a vital tool in the world of AI, machine learning and advanced data analysis, allowing us to expand our revenue channels with our Nvidia GPU fleet,” the company said in its announcement at the time.
The company’s executive chairman, Frank Holmes, told Guardian Australia the transition required a lot of work.
“Moving from mining Ethereum to hosting GPU cloud services involves buying powerful new servers for our GPUs, upgrading networking equipment and moving to higher tier data centres,” he said.
“The only commonality is that GPUs are the workhorses in both cases. GPU cloud requires higher end supporting hardware and a more secure, faster data centre environment. There’s a steep learning curve in the GPU cloud business, but our team is adapting well and learning fast.”
For others, like Iris Energy, a datacentre company operating out of Canada and Texas, and co-founded by Australian Daniel Roberts, it has been the plan all along. Iris did not require any changes to the way the company operated when the AI boom came along, Roberts told Guardian Australia.
“Our strategy really has been about bootstrapping the datacentre platform with bitcoin mining, and then just preserve optionality on the whole digital world. The distinction with us and crypto-miners is we’re not really miners, we’re datacentre people.”
The company still trumpets its bitcoin mining capability but in the most recent results Iris said it was well positioned for “power dense computing” with 100% renewable energy. Roberts said it wasn’t an either-or situation between bitcoin mining and AI.
“I think when you look at bitcoin versus AI, the market will just reach equilibrium based on the market-based demands for each product,” he said.
“So bitcoin’s in demand as a store of value, gold 2.0… it’ll go up, it will command an economic incentive to secure it.
“Conversely, AI as adoption grows there, people will be willing to pay for that. And then for us, we’ve got the optionality to pivot between the two and optimise on a path-dependent basis.”
Holmes said Hive also saw the two industries operating in parallel.
“We love the bitcoin mining business, but its revenue is rather unpredictable. GPU cloud services should complement it well,” he said.
“The revenue should be steadier, but still offer attractive margins and the opportunity for rapid growth.”
Despite what had been declared a “crypto winter” in 2023, the value of bitcoin reached a two-year high of US$49,061 on 11 January, after the US securities regulator approved the first US-listed exchange traded funds (ETF) to track bitcoin. It dipped back below US$40,000 this week.
As with cryptocurrency mining, the massive computing power required by AI systems means massive amounts of energy and carbon emissions for some of the centres.
AI companies like OpenAI keep their carbon emission figures a secret, but it has been estimated that the training of the previous iteration of GPT, GPT-3, consumed 1,287 megawatt hours of electricity and generated 552 tonnes of CO2 – the equivalent of 123 fossil-fuel-powered cars driven for one year.
Iris Energy views its use of renewables not just as better for the environment, but a cost saver.
“We have gone to the source of low-cost excess renewables where we’ve gotten an abundance of land and an abundance of power,” Roberts said. “[At our] Texas site, we’ve got a 600-megawatt grid connection into an area where there’s 32 gigawatts of wind and solar. And the transmission line is 12 gigawatts to export that down to Dallas and Houston.”
While there is much hype, some are viewing the shift in the market with a level of scepticism, suggesting some might be jumping from one fad to the next.
Institutional Investor reported in August that a “penny stock” company known as Applied Sciences had reinvented itself as a bitcoin miner hosting company in April 2022 as Applied Bitcoin, but by November 2022 – perhaps sensing the shift in investment – renamed itself Applied Digital with a focus on AI."
3Y8J4P5XXV_IRFHBCCL0PU3YF9,Expats review – Nicole Kidman is running on the fumes of her talent,Lucy Mangan,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/jan/26/expats-review-nicole-kidman-is-running-on-the-fumes-of-her-talent,"I never thought I would live so long as to see Nicole Kidman become one of the most boring actors of her generation, but we are where we are. Her latest outing, Expats, is the latest in a long line of prestige television dramas in which she wafts about the place as an ethereal, privileged woman haunted by a secret sorrow that all the exquisite soft furnishings and beach views in the world cannot ameliorate.
We have had her as the queen bee of moneyed Monterey society cum victim of domestic violence in Big Little Lies; a bereaved therapist working through her trauma with a group of clients in a luxury spa in Nine Perfect Strangers; and, most recently, as a successful Manhattan psychologist who begins to suspect her loving husband of murder in The Undoing. In the third of those, she was outshone by her character’s emerald-green coat, the garment garnering more interest than anything she has done since Paddington, in 2014.
In new Lulu Wang-directed drama Expats, the feeling that she is running on the fumes of her talent is hard to avoid. Here, she plays Margaret Woo, a landscape architect who gave up her job to follow her loving husband, Clarke (Brian Tee), to Hong Kong for his. They live among many other rich expats in the most prestigious apartment block in the territory; it is literally called The Peak. And what is there to do from a peak, my dears, but fall?
The drama plays out across two timelines: before and after the sorrow that haunts Margaret. If you have ever watched television or read a book, it will be clear to you, almost from the beginning, that this sorrow is either the death or disappearance of a child; I consider it only a small spoiler to tell you that, this time, it is the second.
Over six episodes, Expats intertwines the stories and fates of the three characters it most directly affects. There is Margaret, of course, the grieving, guilt-ridden mother of Gus, whom she left briefly in the care of Mercy (Ji-young Yoo), a young Columbia postgrad whom she was thinking of hiring to replace the family’s longtime nanny and “helper” (in the preferred euphemism of The Peak), Essie (Ruby Ruiz). In the local night market, Mercy is momentarily distracted by her phone – she is trying to glean information about how she should behave during what she has come to realise may be an informal job interview – and Gus is gone.
Margaret’s neighbour and (in the post-disappearance timeline) semi-estranged friend Hilary (Sarayu Blue) is embroiled by virtue of her proximity to the tragedy and by the deepening involvement of her husband, David (Jack Huston), with Mercy.
All of which sets the stage for a languorous – soporific? – meditation on grief, guilt, classism, capitalist greed, the disingenuousness of the rich, racism, emotional and geographical dislocation. Indeed, it ticks just about every box it is possible for a prestige drama – especially one starring Kidman – to tick.
It comes to life, briefly but brilliantly, in the fifth episode – a 90-minute special that plays like an indie film, banishes the main characters to the margins and puts Essie and Hilary’s “helper”, Puri (Amelyn Pardenilla), front and centre. We see Hong Kong life through their eyes as they meet, shop, gossip and navigate their own separations from home and family. We hear that Essie’s son is eager for her to retire and return to the Philippines to live with him, his wife and their baby son. Through Puri in particular – Hilary uses her as an emotional crutch while her marriage falls apart – we see the stresses and precarity with which the domestic staff have to live, never truly able to depend on anything or anyone but themselves.
It plays out against the backdrop of civic unrest. Expats is set in 2014 and in the fifth episode we follow a pair of students who are part of the “umbrella movement” protesting against China’s increasing grip on Hong Kong. One passionately believes in the cause; we watch his mother suffer as he puts himself in increasing danger. The other won’t sacrifice her studies and her chance of escape from her penurious home.

It is moving, even if it doesn’t properly connect to anything that has gone before or comes after. It feels less like an organic part of the drama than a nod to those seeking more than another look at the gilded but discontented lives of the elite. But, the fifth episode aside, this is all Expats really amounts to. It looks great and there are some fine performances – especially from Yoo and Blue – but we have seen it all before. Sometimes with Kidman, sometimes without. But many times before.

40US8XZ6JO_D34035BPAA8HD0H,Open University academic wins tribunal case over gender-critical views,Haroon Siddique,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/22/open-university-academic-wins-tribunal-case-over-gender-critical-views,"A professor of criminology, who was compared with “a racist uncle at the Christmas table” because of her gender critical beliefs, has won an unfair dismissal claim against the Open University.
Prof Jo Phoenix, a lesbian who set up the Gender Critical Research Network (GCRN) at the OU, was also found to have suffered victimisation and harassment, as well as direct discrimination.
She becomes the latest in a series of gender critical feminists, who believe sex is biological, immutable and should be prioritised over gender identity, to win employment tribunals.
In a judgment published on Monday, the tribunal found that Prof Louise Westmarland, head of discipline in social policy and criminology at the OU, made the “racist uncle” comment, which amounted to harassment, because she was unhappy about Phoenix signing a letter in the Sunday Times registering disquiet over a perceived inappropriately close relationship between the LGBTQ+ charity Stonewall and UK universities, and about her expressing her gender critical beliefs at a Woman’s Place UK talk.
The tribunal panel, led by Judge Jennifer Young, found that Westmarland “was effectively telling the claimant off for having expressed gender critical beliefs”.
“Prof Westmarland knew that likening the claimant to a racist was upsetting for the claimant. We conclude that its purpose was to violate the claimant’s dignity because inherent in the comment is an insult of being put in the same category as racists”.
The panel found instances of direct discrimination including the prohibition of Phoenix from speaking at departmental meetings about her experiences of being treated in detrimental ways because of her gender critical beliefs or talking about her gender critical research. Additionally there was “silence and lack of praise” motivated by her gender critical beliefs when she obtained a C$1m grant while another colleague was praised just for making a grant application, according to the tribunal.
After Phoenix set up the GCRN, 368 of her colleagues signed an open letter calling for the disaffiliation of the group, which it labelled transphobic, from the OU because of the beliefs of its members. OU did not take action to ask those behind the letter, published in a Google Doc, to take it down and the tribunal said this was harassment, having “a chilling effect on the claimant expressing her gender critical beliefs and carrying out gender critical research”. A statement about the GCRN in a similar vein to the open letter was published on the university’s website by the wellbeing, education and language studies faculty/reproduction, sexualities and sexual health research group. There were also tweets and retweets from colleagues about the GCRN.
Phoenix resigned from the OU in December 2021. The tribunal found that she was constructively unfairly dismissed because the university breached the implied terms of trust and confidence in her employment contract and the duty to provide her with a suitable working environment. Remedies will be determined at a later date.
The judgment said: “We find that the claimant was not provided with effective protection from the effects of the launch of the GCRN. We find that the respondent did not provide the claimant protection particularly in the form of asking staff and students not to launch campaigns to deplatform the GCRN, or make calls to remove support for the claimant’s gender critical research, or use social media to label the claimant transphobic or TERF (trans-exclusionary radical feminist). The respondent failed to protect the claimant because they did not want to be seen to give any kind of support to academics with gender critical beliefs, including the claimant.”
Prof Tim Blackman, vice-chancellor of the OU, said the university was disappointed by the judgment and would consider whether to appeal. He said: “We acknowledge that we can learn from this judgment and are considering the findings very carefully.
“We are deeply concerned about the wellbeing of everyone involved in the case and acknowledge the significant impact it has had on Prof Phoenix, the witnesses and many other colleagues. Our priority has been to protect freedom of speech while respecting legal rights and protections.”

40ZXBF7CPU_ZFUDFQLNC1HV5NS,Germany considers entry ban on Austrian behind mass deportation plan,Kate Connolly,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/24/germany-considers-entry-ban-on-austrian-martin-sellner-mass-deportation-plan,"German authorities are closely examining the possibility of an entry ban for the far-right Austrian whose master plan for the deportation of immigrants is at the heart of a storm gripping Germany over the rightwing populist Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party.
Martin Sellner, the founder of the so-called Identitarian Movement, which preaches the superiority of European ethnic groups, could be banned from entering Germany if he is deemed to pose a threat to German democratic stability, according to members of the interior affairs committee of the Bundestag.
Martina Renner, the anti-fascism spokesperson for the leftwing Die Linke and the party’s representative on the interior affairs committee, said she had raised the question this week as to whether the government of Olaf Scholz intended to take measures against Sellner to prevent his entry.
Representatives of the interior ministry, in whose power such a ruling lies, confirmed at the meeting that they were examining the options and were in consultation with Germany’s security agencies, who would ultimately take the decision.
The proposal appears to have broad support across the political parties. Another committee member, Philipp Amthor, of the conservative CDU, who backed the motion, said: “In our robust democracy we should in general not tolerate any agitation against our constitutional order, especially not from foreign extremists like Martin Sellner. In this respect, I think it is right and necessary for the security authorities to seriously examine an entry ban against Martin Sellner.”
However, Amthor urged caution over such a move and called for a precise legal examination of the case to avoid Sellner being able to present himself as a victim. Legal hurdles to ban entry to Germany are high, especially for EU citizens, and Amthor said these would need to be carefully examined.
The debate follows an exposé by the investigative journalist bureau Correctiv, which this month published details of a meeting in a Potsdam villa in November 2023 at which neo-Nazis, representatives of the AfD, members of the CDU belonging to an arch-conservative offshoot of the party and business donors discussed plans presented by Sellner to expel large numbers of foreigners and Germans of foreign origin who had not assimilated. The discussion focused on how the plans could feasibly be put into practice were the AfD to gain power.
Sellner confirmed the subject and nature of his talk, including his proposal for a “model city” in north Africa to which people could be deported. The so-called remigration plans were “widely and openly discussed in patriotic circles”, he told the meeting.
AfD’s leadership has denied supporting the ideas. Alice Weidel, a co-leader, sacked her closest aide after he confirmed he had attended the meeting.
The emergence of plans to examine an entry ban follow days of protest against the AfD, as well as debate about the possibility of banning the party on the grounds that it is anti-constitutional.
Nationally, the party is on about 20% in the polls, the second strongest standing behind the conservative CDU/CSU. It is leading in three eastern states where elections are due to be held in the autumn.
Sellner, seen as one of the leading far-right influencers, is a frequent visitor to Germany. A ban would put paid to his visits but might well increase his stardom within the far-right scene, experts have warned.
The same argument has been applied over proposals to ban the AfD. The party already puts much emphasis on what it perceives as its own victimhood, for instance over intelligence agencies’ classification of it in several states as rightwing extremist.
Most recently, Sellner joined farmers protesting in Germany this month against plans to reduce their fuel subsidies.
He founded the Identitarian Movement (Identitäre Bewegung Österreich) in Austria in 2012 and although he has since withdrawn as its official leader, he remains its poster boy and continues to be very active in the background, including mobilising support for the movement and attempting to influence politics in Germany, Austria and elsewhere in the region.
The movement believes in the superiority of European ethnic groups. Among the ideologies it promotes are pan-European nationalism, remigration and the “great replacement” conspiracy theory. Its aim is for slow, long-term change and typically it uses euphemistic, meek language such as “remigration” to convey its ideas and anchor them in mainstream thinking, in particular among young people.
Sellner first came to the attention of authorities as a teenager when he was caught putting swastika stickers on a synagogue. Describing himself as a neo-Nazi until 2011, his switch to identitarianism was influenced by a Holocaust denier as well as his membership in an established Austrian Burschenschaft , or nationalist student association.
Sellner confirmed to German media that he had participated in the Potsdam meeting. He also confirmed his intention of using the meeting to help construct rightwing extremist public support for identitarian ideas, with the help of influencers, in part to alter the “climate of opinion” towards the “decades project” of remigration.
The Identitarian Movement hit the headlines in 2019 when it was revealed that Sellner had been in contact with the gunman who carried out the Christchurch attacks in New Zealand, Brenton Tarrant, who made a €1,500 donation to Sellner’s organisation. Since then, Austrian authorities have been examining the possibility of banning the movement.
Sellner later used the protest movement around coronavirus to recruit new members. Since 2015 he has been active in the Institute for State Policy, a far-right thinktank run by the German publisher Götz Kubitschek that has been classified as rightwing extremist by authorities in Saxony Anhalt, where Kubitschek lives.
In 2017, Sellner chartered a boat and tried to prevent asylum seekers from crossing the Mediterranean. Viewed as a bridge builder between identitarians, thinktanks and rightwing parliamentarians, Sellner is variously viewed as the hope of rightwing extremist movements dreaming of gaining power or a grave threat to democracy and the rule of law.
Mehmet Daimagüler, an anti-racism ombudsman, joined the calls for an entry ban, urging the government to tighten measures in general to enable entry and resident bans to be applied more easily to rightwing extremists such as Sellner.
In a letter to the interior minister, Nancy Faeser, he cited the increase in a “transnational network of rightwing extremist actors” and the “threat they pose for internal security in Germany”. As a result, he said, it was “necessary that all legal measures at the state’s disposal are used against such rightwing offenders”."
419DWPK7NO_17IQYVAYRYAEZCX,Australian-first inquiry into women’s pain launched as Victoria seeks to tackle ‘shame and stigma’,Benita Kolovos,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/22/australia-first-womens-pain-inquiry-victoria-chronic-illness,"An Australian-first inquiry into women’s pain will be held in Victoria after a survey of women in the state found two in five respondents suffered from chronic pain.
The premier, Jacinta Allan, and the health minister, Mary-Anne Thomas, on Monday announced the inquiry, which will examine the systemic issues women face when seeking care and support for pain.
Allan, who suffers from endometriosis, said while chronic pain affects a higher proportion of girls and women than men, women are less likely to receive treatment.
She said this was in part because women were told that there pain was “normal” by medical professionals.

“Many women in our community know that there is a gendered pain gap. They know that their pain is real and they also know that for too long, that pain hasn’t both been believed and received the treatment it needs and deserves through our health system,” Allan told reporters.
“That is why the government is placing a significant amount of attention and resources on this issue, because when we support women’s health, we support the health of all Victorians.”
Led by a panel of experts and overseen by the Women’s Health Advisory Council, which is chaired by Labor MP Kat Theophanous, the inquiry will hear from women with lived experience of pain, as well as healthcare workers and stakeholders.
It will make recommendations and report back to the health minister by the end of 2024.
The inquiry was part of a $153m women’s health package that Labor took to the 2022 election and includes a commitment to create 20 comprehensive women’s health clinics, double the number of endometriosis surgeries in the public system and create a Women’s Health Research Institute.
The federal government has also released a National Women’s Health Strategy and established 20 clinics to treat pelvic pain and endometriosis across the country.
The survey also found half of participants reported menstruation-related conditions, such as heavy periods, cramping and PMS affect their health and wellbeing. About 30% of participants said they were affected by symptoms of perimenopause or menopause and half of women who have been pregnant reported pregnancy and birth complications continued to affect their health.
One in three women also reported insensitive and disrespectful health practitioners, who left them feeling dismissed and unheard.
The online survey of 1,772 women was conducted during September and October 2023 by Engage Victoria, the government’s consultation arm.
Thomas said the survey findings were consistent with efforts to remove the “shame and stigma” associated with women’s health.
“I remember scuttling off to the bathroom trying to hide pads and tampons, ashamed that I had my period when I was at school,” she said.
“We know that it was not too long ago where to talk about menopause was something that no one does in polite company, let alone in the parliament.

“Our role as leaders … is to break down that shame and stigma and empower more women to talk about what’s happening to their bodies, and to make sure that they’re accessing the health care that they need.”
Marilla Druitt, an obstetrician, gynaecologist and women’s pain specialist based in Geelong, said the survey was consistent with the growing awareness of women’s pain.
“The results of the survey are a good example of if you build health literacy in the community, you probably find more problems but then you can fix them more easily,” she said.
Druitt said women should not have to live with pain that directly interferes with daily activities, such as working or having a social life.
“We need pain because it’s a protective mechanism to keep you out of trouble. But if it’s changing the function of your life then that’s not acceptable,” she said.
The clinical director of obstetrics and gynaecology at Peninsula Health, Nisha Khot, said healthcare professionals were letting women down.
“It’s not that women are afraid or shy of speaking – it’s that we have not been listening,” she said.
“If we start from the position of listening with an inquiry, then that would be a good start to get to the bottom of where women’s pain comes from and how we best manage it.”
Khot said there were “little things” the health system can do to improve women’s care and cited a successful trial at Peninsula Health that saw every patient who has an IUD inserted or removed offered Penthrox, a painkiller commonly known as the green whistle.
“An IUD is actually the best and most reliable method of contraception and for women who are afraid to get it because of pain – they are missing out on a really useful way of managing their own lives,” she said.
Druitt said even something as simple as playing calming music could help women through such a procedure."
42NCOMUZWE_GYDF6BCBH591FOW,Tight and proud: how counting the pennies was rebranded as ‘loud budgeting’,_,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/jan/23/tight-proud-counting-pennies-loud-budgeting,"Name: Loud budgeting.
Age: New for 2024.
Appearance: Tight and proud.
How much noise can budgeting actually make? As much as you want.
If this is about screaming at my kids for leaving the fridge open, I’m already doing that. Think of loud budgeting as the antidote to quiet luxury.
OK, I will, but first: what is quiet luxury? It’s a casual, “low-key” approach to luxury styling: “A battered Hermès Kelly bag or a £1,000 camel coat thrown over an ancient pair of vintage jeans,” according to Vogue.
Sounds stupid. It’s also very 2023. Loud budgeting is the opposite.
An ancient camel coat thrown over £1,000 jeans? More of a wholesale rejection of aspirational consumerism and an open embrace of thriftiness. The concept comes from a viral post by the TikToker Lukas Battle, now viewed more than 1.5m times.
Is he just telling me to admit I’m poor? “It’s not ‘I don’t have enough,’ it’s ‘I don’t want to spend,’” says Battle.
He’s saying I should give up trying to be like rich people. According to Battle, this is being like rich people. “If you know any rich people, you know that they hate spending money,” he says. “So it’s almost more chic, more stylish, more of a flex.”
And this is catching on? In the US it is. Social media is full of people telling you to “broadcast your spending limits” and be financially upfront with friends.
What are some of the techniques of loud budgeting? Financial experts suggest putting “deactivation stickers” on your credit cards, to remind you what you’re saving for.
I’m not doing that, but carry on. Turn down costly social invitations, and be honest about why. Unfollow luxury brands on social media. Be proud to pack your own lunch.
Hang on. Is this communism? No, this is actually the secret key to capitalism: being mean.
But being mean isn’t new. Apparently it’s a bit of a novelty for Gen Z.
Gen Z … Are they the ones who can’t afford to buy houses because they eat so much avocado toast? No, that was millennials.
And now we’re telling the next generation they can survive financial catastrophe by proudly bringing their own coffee from home? It’s a wonder they don’t murder us in our sleep.
Do say: “If it takes the stigma out of budgeting in these difficult times, then I’m all for it.”
Don’t say: “Are you gonna eat that?”"
42UK20D79X_GERGYYUMEWZ30JZ,Banning prayer rituals in school? Just get religion out of education completely,Polly Toynbee,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/23/banning-prayer-rituals-in-school-just-get-religion-out-of-education-completely,"Schools are too often the crucible in which social conflicts are fought out, with teachers expected to put right whatever we fail to fix in the world outside. Religion is one such battleground, where “values” are set by education secretaries, and of whom there have been 10 in the past 14 years.
The latest row blew up in Michaela Community school in Brent, north-west London, Katharine Birbalsingh’s notorious free school, regimented to her direction. The discrimination case brought by a Muslim girl last week stirred up rightwing commentators devoted to the headteacher, who made her name condemning education under Labour as “broken”.
One girl praying in the playground soon became 30 pupils, the school says. The KC representing the school trust in the case says they coerced other Muslim pupils to join them: 50% of pupils there are Muslims. “Children were intimidated into greater observance,” he said. “The school observed a child starting to wear a headscarf who had not previously done so. A little girl dropped out of the school choir as she was told by one of the other Muslim children that this was ‘haram’ [forbidden] during Ramadan.” Children were told they were “bad Muslims” if they didn’t pray.
The governors banned “prayer rituals”. A bomb hoax in the school and a stone through a teacher’s window followed a social media campaign and online petition, with teachers intimidated. One pupil was permitted to pray, but was suspended for five days for arguing with a teacher who stopped them bringing a prayer mat into school. The family took the school to court for discrimination. Birbalsingh tweeted: “We believe it is wrong to separate children according to religion or race, and that it is our duty to protect all of our children and provide them with an environment which is free from bullying, intimidation and harassment.” The court will decide soon.
My gut instinct was to back Birbalsingh. If proven true, it’s appalling for children to be bullied into religious observance. As a vice-president of Humanists UK, my hackles rose, as you would expect. By instinct, I like the French revolutionary tradition commanding absolute secularism in schools and state institutions. But French secularism tends to cause less social harmony, not more, used as an easy pretext for far-right anti-Muslim attacks. Humanists defend people’s right to private beliefs and religious practices, as long as they impose on no one else. Yes, I’m sad to see women in hijabs, a “modesty” not imposed on men, but, like Voltaire, I defend to the death their right to wear what they want. Schools navigate competing human rights and cultural demands, warding off protests from ultra-conservative religious parents of many faiths to give pupils good sex and relationships education, including on LGBTQ+ issues.
School heads I asked this week wonder how the situation at Michaela community school reached this state of conflict. “Bullying of any kind has to be stopped at once. This is about bullying, more than religion,” said one. Another secondary head said, “We have students pray at break or lunch, and one of our staff oversees it. Never been a problem. Never heard of it being a problem in another school. If that [bullying or intimidation] happened in my school I’d focus on the ethos and culture where students feel intimidating others is appropriate.”
I don’t know if this explosive conflict is caused by Michaela school’s rigidity, where every minute of every child’s day is regimented: they move silently in single file around the school; while in class their eyes must always fix on the teacher; and there is no free socialising, so in break they only meet in groups of a maximum of four. Before lunch they recite poetry, and lunch conversation is limited to a subject set by a teacher. Parents choose this knowingly, and are rewarded with top exam results, but others would never have their child drilled like this.
How oddly this tale of banned prayers at a non-religious school, lauded by the right, sits in England, where the state pays religions to run a third of our schools – fewer than 1% of those non-Christian. In this most atheist country, pews are empty except when parents get on their knees at admissions time for a vicar’s letter. Why? Because religious schools can select 100% of their pupils, causing social segregation by class and race, as well as faith. They escape other schools’ obligation to prioritise children in care. It’s hard to see what’s “Christian” about that. Faith schools that avoid some chaotic families boast better behaviour and results than neighbouring schools loaded with more than their share of problems.
The Sutton Trust’s alarming report earlier this month revealed just how socially selective faith “comprehensives” have become, even more selective than grammar schools. Top-performing comprehensives admit 5% fewer children on free school meals than would be expected in their local area, and faith schools are most selective of all. Sutton Trust founder Peter Lampl says this “social segregation” is “unacceptable”, calling for a new admissions code. Catholic schools, the most socially segregated of all, always deny it with a slippery claim: “Catholic schools take in 50% more pupils from the most deprived backgrounds than the state sector.” That Jesuitical use of “background” disguises taking socially better-off children from zones marked deprived.
The last time Labour was in power it allowed councils to use lotteries to allocate school places, and 26 councils chose this fairer social spread. But along with scrapping Sure Start and anything of Labour origin, Michael Gove’s great purge during his tenure as education secretary banned admissions lotteries. It’s time to let councils bring them back to prevent social segregation, and time to abolish religious schools.

45MPBT00HI_M3Q4SIXG0ZM0OOK,"UK mass screening of police employees has led to nine criminal inquiries, chiefs say",Vikram Dodd,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/23/mass-screening-uk-police-employees-criminal-investigations-chiefs,"Police chiefs have said a mass screening of more than 300,000 UK police officers, staff and volunteers has led to nine criminal investigations.
The records of 307,000 police employees were checked against a national intelligence database in an exercise after the cases of Wayne Couzens, the officer who kidnapped, raped and murdered Sarah Everard, and David Carrick, who became one of Britain’s worst convicted serial rapists, despite repeated concerns being raised about him.
Police gave very little detail about the alleged wrongdoing unearthed by the exercise, citing privacy concerns, but said sexual assault was among the allegations.
The exercise was overseen by the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) during which the records of everyone working in policing were checked against the police national database, which holds details of intelligence, convictions, crime reports and other details.
Of the more than 300,000 people checked, the review unearthed 88 cases where discipline investigations were needed, and a further 139 where vetting needed to be reviewed, as well as the nine criminal cases. Police said another 128 required “management intervention”.
The figures are lower than expected. For instance the Metropolitan police said last year it was re-examining 1,131 past allegations against officers or staff merely in the category of alleged wrongdoing against women.
In 2022, a report by the policing inspectorate lambasted vetting in law enforcement and warned of concerns about “hundreds if not low thousands” of officers.
A review by Louise Casey into the Met found that since 2013, 1,809 officers and staff had more than one allegation against them. A 2022 freedom of information request found 284 police employees with criminal convictions.
Harriet Wistrich the founder of the Centre for Women’s Justice (CWJ), which has been at the forefront of trying to stop police covering up their own wrongdoing, said: “The outcome that only a tiny number of police officers from across the country have been found to require further investigation simply does not accord with the recent findings in the Met police alone as revealed in the Lady Casey report and Operation Onyx [Met police re-examination of complaints].
“Neither does it accord with the evidence we have collected from women who have come forward to CWJ following our police super complaint submitted in March 2020.”
She said her organisation had received claims that complaints reported to police against their officers were not recorded: “Victims of police perpetrated domestic abuse have been told that the incident they have reported is a ‘civil matter’ and so doesn’t need to be recorded as a crime. If the information isn’t being recorded in the first place, then it isn’t going to show up.”
Defending their findings, the NPCC said anything already being examined or investigated was not included in the counts released to the public on Tuesday.
Hailing what is believed to be the biggest exercise of its type in the UK, the NPCC chair, Gavin Stephens, said: “I hope that it gives further reassurance to communities, and to colleagues in policing, that the overwhelming majority of the workforce can be trusted, and that if you are involved in wrongdoing, there is no place to hide.”
The Home Office will provide fundings so the scouring of the intelligence and data about police employees is continuous.
The policing minister, Chris Philp, said: “Public confidence in police has been damaged by a number of truly shocking cases, and we must take action to root out any officer not fit to serve.
“While we know that the vast majority of officers and police staff – over 99% – are brave, hard-working and dedicated to protecting the public, new serious concerns have been raised in a small number of cases as a result of this work.
“The police are now carefully scrutinising these cases, and we will continue to work with the police to remove those who fall short of the standards we expect.”"
468W0T4TOF_V7EW475IDV4EV2P,Netflix to scrap Halle Berry sci-fi film in post-production,Benjamin Lee,_,20230124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/jan/24/netflix-cancel-halle-berry-movie-mothership,"Halle Berry-led sci-fi thriller The Mothership will not be released after Netflix decided to stop post-production.
The Mothership, which completed filming in 2021, was originally set to be released in 2022 and a brief clip was teased by the streamer in a trailer for the year’s big releases. But the film was the victim of multiple delays and has now been scrapped entirely, according to Variety.
Reporting by The Wrap has sources claiming the decision was not “taken lightly”. The film allegedly required “significant reshoots” which would have been expensive and difficult with child actors having aged.
It was written and directed by British Oscar nominee Matthew Charman, who co-wrote the script for Steven Spielberg’s 2015 drama Bridge of Spies. He also co-wrote the Michelle Williams-starring romance Suite Francaise.
The news follows other similar scrapped films, such as the $90m DC adventure Batgirl which was cancelled while in post-production and last year’s reveal that Coyote vs Acme would also not be released despite completion of production. Both were the result of studio Warners choosing a tax write-down. The latter, a live-action/animation hybrid starring John Cena, has since been shopped around.
Last year Netflix decided not to release two completed films – thrillers The Inheritance and House/Wife – but allowed the makers to shop them elsewhere.
This week saw an impressive Q4 report from Netflix with over 13 million new subscribers, ahead of predictions. The platform also performed well during the announcement of this year’s Oscar nominations with a tally of 18.
The Mothership starred Oscar-winner Berry as a single mother who finds an extraterrestrial object on her farm. Berry has worked with Netflix before on the release of Bruised, her directorial debut, and will next be seen in the streamer’s action thriller The Union alongside Mark Wahlberg.
Neither Berry nor Netflix has made an official statement."
46NAT9BO2A_NXBQ7VPZ4LJOI3Q,"Facial recognition used after Sunglass Hut robbery led to man’s wrongful jailing, says suit",Johana Bhuiyan,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/22/sunglass-hut-facial-recognition-wrongful-arrest-lawsuit,"A 61-year-old man is suing Macy’s and the parent company of Sunglass Hut over the stores’ alleged use of a facial recognition system that misidentified him as the culprit behind an armed robbery and led to his wrongful arrest. While in jail, he was beaten and raped, according to his suit.
Harvey Eugene Murphy Jr was accused and arrested on charges of robbing a Houston-area Sunglass Hut of thousands of dollars of merchandise in January 2022, though his attorneys say he was living in California at the time of the robbery. He was arrested on 20 October 2023, according to his lawyers.
According to Murphy’s lawsuit, an employee of EssilorLuxottica, Sunglass Hut’s parent company, worked with its retail partner Macy’s and used facial recognition software to identify Murphy as the robber. The image that was put through the facial recognition system came from low-quality cameras, according to the lawsuit. While Houston police department was investigating the armed robbery, the EssilorLuxottica employee called police to say they could stop the investigation because the employee had identified one of two robbers with the technology. The employee also said the system had pointed to Murphy as committing two other robberies, according to the lawsuit.
When Murphy returned to Texas from California, he went to the department of motor vehicles (DMV) to renew his license. Within minutes of identifying himself to a DMV clerk, Murphy told the Guardian he was approached by a police officer who notified him there was a warrant out for his arrest for an aggravated robbery. Murphy said he was not told any details about his supposed crime except for the date the robbery occurred. He realized he was in Sacramento, California, at the time of the robbery – more than a thousand miles away.
“I almost thought it was a joke,” Murphy said.
Still, he was arrested and taken to the local county jail, where he was held for 10 days before being transferred to and processed in Harris county jail.
After a few days at Harris county, his alibi was confirmed by both his court-appointed defense attorney and the prosecutor, and the charges against him were ultimately dropped, according to the lawsuit.
Murphy was never convicted of a crime. Nonetheless, he says his detainment left him with deep scars. He was brutally beaten and gang-raped by three other men in the jail hours before he was released, he alleges. They threatened to kill him if he tried to report them to the jail staff, according to Murphy. After the alleged attack, Murphy remained in the same cell as them until he was released.
“That was kind of terrifying,” Murphy said. “Your anxiety is up so high, you’re still shaking the entire time. And I just got up on my bunk and just faced the wall and was just praying that something would come through and get me out of that tank.”
“The attack left him with permanent injuries that he has to live with every day of his life,” the lawsuit reads. “All of this happened to Murphy because the Defendants relied on facial recognition technology that is known to be error prone and faulty.”
Murphy did not realize facial recognition technology may have been used as evidence against him until two weeks ago, when he began working with his attorney, Daniel Dutko.
Dutko said he discovered from police documents that the Sunglass Hut worker shared camera footage with Macy’s, which employees from the department store chain used to identify Murphy. After that, Macy’s and Sunglass Hut contacted the police together, according to Dutko. Though Macy’s has retail partnerships with the eyewear brand in several locations, Macy’s had no connection to this robbery as the Sunglass Hut in question is a standalone location, he said.
“We feel very comfortable saying facial recognition software is the only possible explanation, and it’s the only reason why [Sunglass Hut] would go to Macy’s to try to identify him,” Dutko said.

Murphy’s case would be the seventh known case of a wrongful arrest due to facial recognition in the US, further highlighting the flaws of a technology already widely adopted by police departments and retailers. However, in all of the publicly known cases of wrongful arrests due to facial recognition up until now, the victims have been Black. Murphy’s would be the first known case of the failure of the technology leading to the wrongful arrest of a white man. Just last month, Rite Aid settled with the Federal Trade Commission over its use of a facial recognition system that misidentified Black, Latino and Asian customers as people previously identified as “likely to engage” in shoplifting. The pharmacy chain is forbidden from using facial recognition in its stores for five years as part of the settlement. And in the summer of 2023, a woman named Porcha Woodruff was arrested on charges of car jacking due to false identification by a facial recognition system.
Macy’s has previously been sued over its use of facial recognition technology. In a 2020 lawsuit, a Chicago woman accused the company of working with facial recognition provider Clearview AI without her or other customers’ consent in violation of Illinois’ biometric privacy law.
Nathan Freed Wessler, deputy director of the America Civil Liberties Union’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project said this was another example of the “extreme dangers of face recognition technology”.
“In case after case, we’ve seen police reflexively trusting unreliable face recognition results, and then allowing false matches from the technology to taint witness identification procedures,” Wessler said in a statement. “As the facts alleged in this case show, the consequences of being wrongfully arrested are horrible. Lawmakers must put a stop to police and corporations’ hazardous reliance on face recognition results to put people in jail.”
Murphy is seeking $10m in damages.
Macy’s said it had no comment on pending litigation and EssilorLuxottica did not immediately respond to a Guardian request for comment."
47SQIDBNMQ_NHXJ8COTTFAO3NN,‘Like a ghost howling’: ex-Tropical Cyclone Kirrily to bring heavy rain to Queensland as Townsville residents survey damage,Eden Gillespie,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/26/cyclone-kirrily-qld-queensland-coast-townsville-damage-storm-downgraded-tropical-low,"The cleanup from ex-Tropical Cyclone Kirrily has begun in north Queensland after the weather system was downgraded to a tropical low.
Damaging winds and rainfall totals from 100-150mm hit the region on Thursday evening but minimal property damage was recorded and no lives were lost.
Authorities have now begun the process of restoring power to tens of thousands of homes and businesses.
About 100 Ergon Energy workers were on the ground conducting damage assessments, with a further 600 headed to Townsville over the weekend.
“They’re mobilising from across the state,” Ergon’s cyclone response leader, Chris Hooper, said.
Vegetation and trees on power lines must be cleared before crews can assess the full extent of the damage to the grid.
Their priority was to reconnect emergency services, hospitals, schools and critical infrastructure.
The Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) said the cyclone “decayed rapidly” on Thursday night from a category three storm to a category two and then category one system.
The system was downgraded to a tropical low on Friday morning.
The cyclone brought wind gusts of up to 143km/h offshore but slowed as it hit landfall, with gusts reaching 90km/h in Townsville on Thursday night.
“Despite a tense night, no lives were lost. The threat is not over though,” the Queensland premier, Steven Miles, said. “We’re not out of the woods but we will continue to work to be prepared to support Queensland communities.”

About 65,000 homes and businesses across the region remained without power, the majority of which were in Townsville.
Authorities said 215 calls for service were made to the SES in the last 24 hours but no swift water rescues were needed.
More calls for service were expected as the cleanup from Cyclone Kirrily continued.
The federal emergency management minister, Murray Watt, said the Australian defence force remained on standby to assist but initial reports indicated it would be within the state government’s capacity to manage.
Townsville airport reopened by 3pm Friday.
The BoM said on Friday the system had “an extreme amount of moisture” which would produce heavy rainfall and could lead to life-threatening flash flooding and damaging winds.
Flood watch warnings remained in place for coastal and inland catchments between Tully and Airlie Beach, as well as parts of the central west and Gulf catchments.
The BoM advised minor to major riverine flooding was possible across those areas as the system moved west towards the border over the weekend and into next week.
A “continued monsoon” would remain in far north Queensland for the latter part of next week.

The state disaster coordinator, deputy commissioner Shane Chelepy, said 15 residents of Georgetown on the Etheridge River would be doorknocked and warned about the risks of the rising river.
“We have sufficient aviation fuel, food and water for those communities. And we also have some appropriate plans in place to continue that resupply over the next coming weeks,” he said.
Robyn Johnstone was one of the tens of thousands of Townsville residents who woke up without power this morning.
Johnstone lives in the suburb of Hermit Park and said she was thankful she only lost a small tree to Kirrily.
On a drive through her neighbourhood on Friday morning, Johnstone surveyed the damage, observing fallen branches and debris littering the roads.
“The cyclone sounded like a ghost howling. It was pretty windy. There was lots of rain,” she told Guardian Australia.
At 28, Johnstone has lived through Cyclone Yasi in 2011 and the 2019 floods. She said her community was feeling optimistic – even with heavy rainfall and strong winds still forecast.
“People [up here] are pretty resilient. A lot of people just think the worst of it is gone.”
Maria – who requested her surname not be used due to her job – spent the days before Cyclone Kirrily frantically removing bamboo and trees from her home in Kirwan in the western suburbs of Townsville.
She moved to the property from Melbourne in 2014 and wanted to ensure she was prepared for her first cyclone.
“We hired a large trailer to remove 13 metres of dwarf bamboo and eight metres of heliconias … If we didn’t cut them down, I reckon we would now be picking it all up,” she told Guardian Australia.
Maria said she felt lucky she had not lost power and had no damage to her home.
“I now understand how scary Cyclone Yasi was back in 2011. It does worry me what the actual category three would feel like.”

4AA66FJE39_XLXQUKCOLHIQWUN,US calls on Israel to protect staff and patients as military reportedly storms Gaza hospital,_,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/23/us-calls-on-israel-to-protect-staff-and-patients-as-military-reportedly-storms-gaza-hospital,"The White House has called on Israel to protect innocent people as Palestinian officials said the Israeli military had stormed one hospital in Gaza and placed another under siege.
National security council spokesperson John Kirby said on Monday Israel had a right to defend itself but added: “We expect them to do so in accordance with international law and to protect innocent people in hospitals, medical staff and patients as well, as much as possible.”
Israeli troops advanced for the first time into Gaza’s al-Mawasi district near the Mediterranean coast, west of Khan Younis, the main city in the territory’s south, in what some Palestinians said was the bloodiest assault so far in January.
There, they stormed al-Khair hospital and were arresting medical staff, Gaza health ministry spokesperson Ashraf al Qidra told the news agency Reuters. The hospital is just inside the safe zone at Mawasi, where the Israeli military had said it would not carry out operations.
There was no word from Israel on the situation at the hospital, and the military spokesperson’s office had no comment.
The Palestinian Red Crescent said tanks had surrounded another Khan Younis hospital, al-Amal, headquarters of the rescue agency, which had lost contact with staff there.
“We are deeply worried about what is happening around our hospital,” said Tommaso Della Longa, spokesperson for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.
Qidra said at least 50 people were killed overnight in Khan Younis, while the sieges of medical facilities meant dozens of dead and wounded were beyond the reach of rescuers.
“The Israeli occupation is preventing ambulance vehicles from moving to recover bodies of martyrs and the wounded from western Khan Younis,” he said.
Volunteers with the Red Crescent also said strikes hit four schools west of Khan Younis – two of them inside the Mawasi “safe” zone – causing an unknown number of casualties. They said the organisation’s ambulances could not reach the sites.
Israel says Hamas fighters operate in and around hospitals, which Hamas and medical staff deny.
Elad Goren of COGAT, the Israeli defence ministry branch that coordinates with the Palestinians, added that: “A particular effort led by a dedicated team has been put on making sure civilians have access to medical care.”
Residents said the bombardment from air, land and sea was the most intense in southern Gaza since the war began in October.
Israel launched an offensive last week to capture Khan Younis, which it now says is the principal headquarters of the Hamas militants responsible for the 7 October attacks on southern Israel that killed 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies.
On Monday the Israeli military claimed it had found weapons, explosives and rockets and destroyed tunnel shafts and underground infrastructure in recent days in Khan Younis. It also said three Israeli soldiers were killed on Monday in southern Gaza.
The newest phase of the war has brought fighting deep into the last corners of the enclave packed with those fleeing bombardment. At least 25,295 Gazans have been killed since 7 October, Gaza health authorities said in an update on Monday.
Most of Gaza’s 2.3 million residents are now penned into Rafah just south of Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah just north of it, crammed into public buildings and camps of tents made from plastic sheets lashed to wooden frames.
“This is the seventh time I get displaced,” Mariam Abu-Haleeb told the Reuters news agency, as she sat in a car surrounded by her possessions.
“Where should I go? Should I go to Rafah? Rafah is like one street. What do they want from us?” said Ahmad Shurrab, who was fleeing Khan Younis with his family and said he had also been displaced multiple times.
Ahmad Abu-Shaweesh, a boy, described sheltering in the Al-Aqsa University only to find it coming under attack. “We hardly made it out … We didn’t expect the tanks at the university’s gates,” he said.
Gaza has had no communications or internet service for 10 days, hampering ambulance dispatches to areas targeted by Israel and preventing people from checking on one another and on the whereabouts of Israeli forces.
At Nasser hospital, the only major hospital still accessible in Khan Younis and the largest still functioning in Gaza, video and photos showed the trauma ward overwhelmed with wounded being treated on a floor splashed with blood.
Reuters reported that graves were being dug within the hospital grounds because it was not safe to venture out to the cemetery. Authorities said 40 people were buried there.
In Brussels, Palestinian Authority foreign minister Riyad al-Maliki told reporters the situation in Gaza was out of control and asked the European Union to call for a ceasefire.
“The health system has collapsed. There is no way for injured Palestinians to be treated in the Gaza Strip and they are not able to leave Gaza for treatment outside.”
Israel says it wants to annihilate Hamas. But Palestinians and some western military experts say that may be unachievable given the group’s diffuse structure and deep roots in Gaza, which it has ruled since 2007.
Although Israelis overwhelmingly support the war, a growing number say the government should do more to reach a deal to free Israeli hostages, even if that means reining in its offensive.
About 20 relatives of hostages stormed a parliamentary committee session in Jerusalem on Monday, demanding lawmakers do more to help free their loved ones.
Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a group of relatives there was no truth to reports of a deal to free hostages in a ceasefire.

4BJLVAE8AF_LAN1HLR5XTCV5MA,"In 1924, cinema was hailed as an agent of world peace. Has it failed?",_,_,20230123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/jan/23/cinema-peace-and-war-dw-griffith-charlie-chaplin,"Exactly 100 years ago, in an article in Collier’s magazine in 1924, the film director DW Griffith made the following prediction: “In the year 2024 the most important single thing which the cinema will have helped in a large way to accomplish will be that of eliminating from the face of the civilised world all armed conflict.” He added: “Pictures will be the most powerful factor in bringing about this condition. With the use of the universal language of motion pictures the true meaning of brotherhood of man will have been established throughout the Earth.”
Leaving aside the irony that’s Griffith’s 1915 picture The Birth of a Nation, a deeply racist film that led directly to the revival of the Ku Klux Klan may have inspired more violence than any other, Griffith’s prophecy of peace and end to national-scale conflicts has not materialised. The violence in Gaza, Ukraine, Sudan and elsewhere are all bloody reminders that war is still a fact of life.
Cinema may have thrived during the last hundred years, but its role as peace ambassador needs some improving. Instead, it has been continually used by governments to justify military action: sometimes through allegory, other times through overt propaganda. Russia’s culture ministry is prioritising films that will help the Russian war effort in Ukraine. Last year, Russia released a film called The Witness, a two-hour propaganda project masked as a story about a Belgian violinist in Kyiv on the eve of the invasion. Lenin called cinema “the most important of all the arts” and it still clearly has its place in Putin’s regime.
The cinema’s power to influence the masses was recognised from its earliest days. Even before Griffith’s idealistic plea, film had already been used as a means of promoting national strength and building up public support during times of war. During the first world war, for example, the British government established the Cinematograph Committee with the purpose of boosting the war effort. The first major film it produced was called How Britain Prepared, a documentary showcasing British readiness for war. Its aims were to boost soldiers’ morale and instil fear into the enemy army commands, but there was an undeniable conscription motive as well and was plainly intended to inspire patriotic zeal in the hearts of young, recruitable lads. A newspaper described the scene at the film’s London premiere: “If anything could help enlistments, these films should certainly gladden the heart of the recruiting sergeant.”
In the second world war, Frank Capra made a series of films to explain the rationale of American involvement abroad. The result, Why We Fight - seven films produced between 1942 and 1945 – is perhaps the most famous example of a government enlisting the help of a mainstream film director to defend its war effort. The films were originally intended to be shown exclusively to soldiers, but President Roosevelt felt them important enough to be shown to civilians to boost support. The camera and the screen had become significant weapons in the US’s arsenal.
More recently, the US has relied on popular movies to help bolster army enrolment. When Top Gun opened to audiences in 1986, recruitment across the US military soared by 500%; recruitment tables were even stationed outside several theatres, ready to catch impressionable moviegoers still in a Maverick-haze. Voiceovers and newsreel footage weren’t necessary; Tom Cruise flying upside down was enough to drive thousands to the recruiting desks around the country. The best propaganda needn’t call itself propaganda at all.
But cinema hasn’t just been used by the west; films were a major tool in anti-colonial struggle throughout Africa and South America. Some films focused on the emotional and economic toil colonialism inflicted on a country; others were calls to action. The leading proponents of Third Cinema, the anticapitalist film movement from Latin America, well understood that film had been used by colonial powers to further cement their power. It was only natural that a counterrevolutionary cinema was created in response. Anti-colonial struggle was famously shown in Gillo Pontecorvo’s 1966 film The Battle of Algiers, depicting violent Algerian resistance to French colonial rule. Violent actions shown in the film were used to develop training manuals by the Blank Panthers and the IRA. For their part, the French government obviously believed in cinema’s potential to inspire violence as well: the film was banned on release.
But some films have openly called for cooperation and peace: arguably the most famous cry for brotherly understanding in cinema comes from Charlie Chaplin at the end of The Great Dictator, released in 1940. Chaplin plays a Jewish barber who is mistaken for Adenoid Hynkel, a manifest parody of Hitler. In the film, the barber gives a public speech dressed as Hynkel, but uses the opportunity to preach for understanding rather than conflict. “Soldiers! Don’t give yourselves to brutes – men who despise you – enslave you – who regiment your lives – tell you what to do – what to think and what to feel! Don’t give yourselves to these unnatural men – machine men with machine minds and machine hearts! You are not machines! You are not cattle! You are men! You have the love of humanity in your hearts!”
Chaplin’s speech isn’t a plea for pacifism. Rather, it’s a rallying cry for people to unite against dictatorship. “Soldiers! Don’t fight for slavery!” Chaplin cries. “Fight for liberty!” His sentiments are the same as Capra’s in Why We Fight,, and can still bring a tear to a cynical eye when watched today.
Sadly, the world today is a far stretch from the one predicted in 1924. Thousands are still dying in armed conflicts around the globe. And cinema is still being used in the service of oppressors and occupiers. A film will never change a despot’s mind, but it may inspire a country’s people to resist. Would the last hundred years have been more or less violent without the invention of the cinema? It’s impossible to say. What is certain is that we are a long way from armed conflict being eliminated. One hopes we are at least a little closer in another hundred years."

A statement from the London festival, released on Wednesday, said that Gladstone had died on Monday after a short illness. “Internationally celebrated for her exquisite taste and incisive acumen, Emma was a joyful collaborator who was loved by artists, colleagues and audiences alike,” said the statement. “Her infectious laugh, delicious wit and kindness made her a cherished friend and mentor to more people than we can count; and her dedicated encouragement, care and companionship made her an extraordinary mother, stepmother and wife.”
Gladstone was artistic director and chief executive of Dance Umbrella from 2013 to 2021. Under her leadership, the influential festival – which was founded in 1978 – inspired audiences of all ages, with an eclectic year-round programme of work that included performances not just in the city’s major venues and smaller arts centres but also in art galleries and other surprising locations, often outdoors. Gladstone’s programme was at the cutting edge of dance, literally so when she brought the Canadian ice-skating collective Le Patin Libre to the UK for a performance at Alexandra Palace’s ice rink in 2014.
She was dedicated to disability arts, expanded dance’s family-friendly offerings, gave UK audiences their first taste of countless international companies, commissioned performances by established talents such as Jérôme Bel and embraced joint initiatives with companies around the UK and abroad. Her successor at Dance Umbrella, Freddie Opoku-Addaie, said: “One of Emma’s superpowers was the readiness to share tools, impart lived experience and dive into the deep end to reach the desired goal with care.”
Many dance companies paid tribute to Gladstone on social media. Akram Khan Company posted: “We are deeply saddened by the passing of Emma Gladstone, a truly beautiful human being. Akram has lost a dear friend who had supported his artistic journey for so many years. An immense loss for the dance community.” Alleyne Dance said: “We cannot say thank you enough to Emma Gladstone. She reached out to inspire and uplift so many lives. We wish for you to forever Rest In Power! Your legacy will live on through the growing stars you have touched.”
Gladstone completed a postgraduate diploma in community dance at London’s Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance in 1985 and was awarded a scholarship to perform with Transitions Dance Company. In 1987 she co-founded the company Adventures in Motion Pictures (which later became New Adventures) with fellow Laban graduate Matthew Bourne. As a dancer she was best known for performing with Arlene Phillips and Lea Anderson’s The Cholmondeleys. Gladstone was artistic director of the high-profile BBC Young Dancer competition in 2015, 2019 and 2022. She was awarded an OBE for services to dance in 2021.
After her role as associate director at London dance institution The Place from 1997 to 2003, Gladstone was artistic programmer at Sadler’s Wells from 2005 to 2013. Alistair Spalding, artistic director of Sadler’s Wells, said: “I knew Emma in many of her guises – beautiful dancer, programmer, advocate, leader, producer and friend. She was so dedicated to the art form she loved – always thoughtful, articulate and charming.”"
4CS66BD9Q0_06BJFS8TQXX4HZT,Jeffrey Epstein’s brother doesn’t believe he died by suicide and wants new investigation,Edward Helmore,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/22/jeffrey-epstein-mark-epstein-interview,"The night before Jeffrey Epstein flew from Paris back to New York in July 2019, he called his younger brother, Mark. The pair had been in contact only occasionally since their mother died 15 years earlier and it was the last time they ever spoke.
Mark Epstein says his brother had no inkling he was going to be arrested as he stepped off his jet at Teterboro in New Jersey. He believed he had been granted immunity from federal prosecution under a 2007 plea deal reached with the then US attorney Alex Acosta when he pleaded guilty to state charges of soliciting a minor.
Barely a month later, Jeffrey Epstein was found dead in a Manhattan jail cell. He had killed himself despite being under psychological observation at the time after a suicide attempt.
It was a sorry end to the quest for justice for Epstein’s victims but far from an end to the mystery, drama and intrigue that surrounds Epstein’s story – and the powerful figures who wined and dined and partied with him across the world. That drama would continue through the trial and conviction of his confidante Ghislaine Maxwell and even through the release this month of thousands of once-sealed court documents about the case.
But still the mystery remains. Not least – for Mark Epstein anyway – the manner of his brother’s death.
Mark Epstein doesn’t accept the justice department report that found jail officials guilty of negligence, misconduct and outright job performance failures, but also found no evidence that his death was anything but suicide.
“I would like a full investigation of his death. If you look at all the evidence, including the autopsy, the photographs of his body, the bullshit DOJ report that is filled with inaccuracies, you would never come up with the conclusion that this was a suicide – but based on what?” he said.
The sexual, political and financial corruption at the heart of the Epstein story has left a trail of ruined lives and reputations. About $150m has been paid out from Epstein’s $580m estate to the victims, often underage, of the sex trafficking conspiracy Epstein orchestrated with Maxwell, now serving 20 years in a Florida prison.
But the release of long-sealed documents from a 2017 defamation suit brought by Virginia Giuffre against Maxwell served to further damage the reputations of Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew and a host of other men whose names appeared in the records.
The documents also stoked yet more fresh interest in Epstein’s life, and theories that the circumstances of his death were covered up.
Epstein was not on suicide watch and was alone in his cell. Two correctional officers responsible for guarding Epstein that day were later charged with falsifying prison records. The charges were dropped soon after Maxwell was convicted in 2021.
Mark Epstein says he thinks another prisoner on the tier could have gotten into his brother’s cell and killed him, and that he’s been told that not all the cell doors were locked that night. But cellmates who might have had a view of Epstein’s cell door said they did not see anyone go in, according to the DOJ report. A camera pointing at Epstein’s cell door was not recording that night.
Days after Epstein’s death, the then US attorney general, Bill Barr, criticized “serious irregularities at this facility that are deeply concerning and demand a thorough investigation” and vowed to “get to the bottom of what happened. There will be accountability.”
Barr told the Associated Press in November 2019: “I can understand people who immediately, whose minds went to sort of the worst-case scenario because it was a perfect storm of screw-ups.”
But Mark Epstein is not satisfied and still believes in the conspiracy theory: “The question is, who had him killed?”
A former artist turned property developer, Mark Epstein says he was investigated by the FBI after his brother’s death. The source of his wealth has been described by the Wall Street Journal as “mysterious”, but he told the Guardian he was not a trustee of his brother’s estate nor a beneficiary of his will.
Yet he had been linked to his brother financially through a 200-unit Manhattan condominium, once donated an 80-foot yacht to the Marine Science and Nautical Training Academy in South Carolina and offered to put up his brother’s bail against a Florida condominium valued at $100,000.
The Jeffrey Epstein story is full of rabbit holes, and a virtual industry has grown up inviting amateur sleuths to go down them. When Judge Loretta Preska cleared out her court files earlier this month, the names held within made headlines for days and claims of secretly recorded sex tapes ensured that the Epstein scandal will rumble on.
But the files didn’t advance central questions around Jeffrey Epstein – namely how he made his fortune, questions that his brother says he can’t discuss.
Mark Epstein says that other than calling for a new investigation into his brother’s death – a request that he says has not received a response – he’s nonchalant about being the brother of a man at the center of scandal.
“Other than having to deal with death threats, the FBI and NYPD and needing security early on, my life is normal,” he says. “They looked into me but they realized I was clean and there was no dirt on me.”
The Jeffrey Epstein story is for now on a break from the headlines. Mark Epstein claims he didn’t look at the recent documents and maintains he’s not planning to continue to raise questions. “I’m only concerned about the circumstances of my brother’s death,” he says."
4CSMTVDOWE_33Q0LZ7D1C14F9W,‘I nearly called an ambulance during my period’: UK women tell of misery of endometriosis,Clea Skopeliti,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/jan/26/endometriosis-uk-women-tell-of-misery-periods,"Women with endometriosis in the UK feel “gaslit” by doctors because of a lack of knowledge of the condition, research has found, with many being “fobbed off”. More than 1.5 million women in the UK live with the painful condition.
The study, carried out by academics at Manchester Metropolitan University, found that that “a lack of confidence to challenge medical experts meant that participants were likely to accept the medical discourse and avoid seeking help in future”.
Here, three women in the UK share their path to diagnosis and treatment.
Sophie, 36, public arts sector worker in London
After almost 25 years of being told there was no reason for the pain, during a pelvic scan in 2021 a sonographer casually told me I had advanced endometriosis and I had an endometrioma on my left ovary. No other doctor or nurse had picked this up during scan after scan. There was a feeling of massive relief – I’d felt like a hypochondriac my whole life.
I had a laparoscopy [keyhole surgery] in 2022 – faster than normal waiting time because an endometrioma on an ovary can cause torsion which can be an emergency. I had stage 4 endometriosis and they found it in five places. It took six months for a full recovery, but the pain was nothing compared with endometriosis.
I have since been advised to go on contraception, but the thought of the mental health deterioration stops me – I was put on the pill at 12 and over the years felt it contributed to my depression. This month, despite being in debilitating pain again, I had a follow-up appointment cancelled and rearranged for nine months’ time – there’s only one endometriosis doctor at my hospital.
Recently, I have begun having pain between periods and my periods have gotten heavier. I nearly called an ambulance during my last period and am waiting for a scan, but don’t know when that will be. I’ve accepted a prescription for opioids for the first time, but haven’t taken them. There are still huge gaps in knowledge and there is no cure for endometriosis.
The mental health effects of the pain are something no one talks about – planning your life around pain. You have the psychological impact of pain your whole life.
Rosie, 60, self-employed dementia support adviser in Norfolk
From 12, my periods were always painful – I was told all girls suffer excruciating period pains and to get on with it. One morning waiting for the bus when my period was starting, I almost passed out.
I began to experience real problems in my late 20s. I had a burst ovarian cyst when pregnant at 19 but my pregnancy continued, and I had my second child at 22. My periods were worse than labour.
I was divorced, raising two children but couldn’t hold down other jobs so cleaned houses where owners were absent and I could lie down regularly. At 29, I went to the doctor because I was breaking through on the pill and had very heavy bleeding. The doctor said it could be endometriosis. I had never heard of it before.
When I had a scan, the radiologist said: ‘I hope you don’t want more children’, which caused me to break down. It was so unfeeling. I had a laparoscopy and my bowels, bladder and one of my ovaries were stuck to my womb.
At 31, I had a full hysterectomy. It was devastating – I had really hoped that I might marry again and have more children. It was a shock to the system. I was put on different types of HRT [hormone replacement therapy] but when I’d come off it, I’d have instant menopause. If I had sex, I was in excruciating pain. The hormonal rollercoaster was awful.
After a great deal of research, eight years ago I found a kind of synthetic oestrogen that works for me and I’ve been pain free since. It’s a different world for me now. I had to arm myself, I became very knowledgeable. It’s so easy to go down rabbit holes of what might work – you’re never quite sure what to believe.
It’s taken over 30 years of my life and five abdominal surgeries. It ruined my pelvic floor and, for a long time, my self-esteem. I look back and can’t believe what an impact this condition had, how it defined me.
Amy, 43, therapeutic music practitioner in Manchester
My diagnosis had come after nearly 20 years of being told it was “normal”; I’d had painful periods since I was 13. It was only when I took my partner with me to a GP appointment that I was taken seriously. My partner said I spent days in bed, screaming and blacking out in pain. It was only after hearing this from him [that the GP] referred me to a gynaecologist.
I had a laparoscopy at 40 and was diagnosed with stage 4 endometriosis but needed further surgery. I still wanted children at the time and after 18 months of trying to conceive naturally, IVF was suggested. I went through one round but it didn’t work.
After nearly three years of waiting I had a hysterectomy [removal of the womb] and an oophorectomy [removal of the ovaries] in November 2023. The surgeon said my womb, fallopian tubes, ovaries and bowel were fused together with scar tissue.
I’ve not had any pain since surgery, which is amazing. It’s also odd, because I’m not used to living without pain. It’s a lot to come to terms with and deep down I’m really angry for all that lost time. I’m in a good place now and have people to support me, but I can’t help but wonder if things would’ve been different if I had been diagnosed sooner. It’s heartbreaking to think I could have a child now."
4EOCCXFJL2_2N851ECHCBO652J,Night Watch by Jayne Anne Phillips review – ravages of the US civil war,_,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/jan/24/night-watch-by-jayne-anne-phillips-review-ravages-of-the-us-civil-war,"During a particularly memorable scene in Night Watch, which is set around the American civil war, a little girl is lowered headfirst into an open grave by her mother in order to pull a rifle off a fresh corpse. That this harrowing exploit ultimately proves pointless – the protection offered by the retrieved weapon is insufficient for the danger they face – is emblematic of the book’s unsparing vision.This is Jayne Anne Phillips’s sixth novel, and her third, after Machine Dreams and Lark and Termite, to take up the cost of war for combatants and non-combatants alike. She is unusually well placed, then, to probe the civil war, a brutal four-year conflagration that killed more than 700,000 people, devastated the lives of many more and sent aftershocks of violence and division rippling all the way through to the present.
Though it contains numerous vivid characters – including John O’Shea, a disfigured night-watchman who gives the book its title, an Irish healer named Dearbhla and a wild orphan boy called Weed – the novel is largely the story of the little girl, ConaLee, who was lowered into the grave, and of her mother, Eliza, who did the lowering. Set mostly in West Virginia and Virginia during the war and at the Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum some 10 years afterwards, Night Watch depicts the horrors the two confront in the wake of ConaLee’s father’s enlistment, as the US begins to tear itself apart.
Their trials come at the hands of a sadistic veteran who makes his entry into their lives by perpetrating a terrifyingly detailed assault on Eliza. Insisting grotesquely on being called “Papa”, he returns again and again to tyrannise them. In scenes that both mirror and warp the wartime travails of ConaLee’s actual father, which Phillips describes economically in alternating chapters, mother and daughter are brought low indeed.
When Papa finally tires of them, he enacts an elaborate, Wilkie Collins-style scheme to be rid of them and simultaneously cover his tracks: have them committed. At his instruction, teenage ConaLee becomes a servant known as “Nurse Connolly”, and Eliza, largely mute after years of rape and abuse, plays the role of her employer, a troubled gentlewoman called “Miss Janet”. The two are admitted with little question into the “home for lunatics”.
Phillips’s depiction of a ravaged world in which so many have lost their way or had it stolen from them, both physically and mentally, feels true to the profoundly destabilising nature of her subject. As one woman puts it, understatedly, “My husband came back [from battle] but struggled to be himself.” Voluntarily or involuntarily, the novel’s characters have changed names, or otherwise been distanced from themselves, and the asylum, set in handsome grounds and run according to remarkably forward-thinking principles, proves a haven. As “Nurse Connolly” and “Miss Janet” accustom themselves to days that are suddenly filled with regular meals, long walks pleasant company and salubrious carriage rides, other tales emerge and become intertwined with theirs.
One story belongs to O’Shea, the guardian of the asylum, who came out of the war with an injury-induced amnesia that cuts him off from any knowledge of his past, except that he feels disturbingly comfortable with a rifle in his hands. We relive the brutal battle in which he was wounded through Phillips’s crisp narration: “The line yelled together, plunging down the slope in a bombardment of shell and bullets so heavy and deafening it was as though they’d entered a field on fire.”
O’Shea’s current condition both deepens the mystery that informs the novel and serves as the central node of a matrix of coincidence that in less skilful hands might have detracted rather than enhanced. Phillips pulls it off by leaning into the device rather than away from it: the attentive reader will perceive clues and spot coincidences throughout Night Watch. The result is that when, say, one character’s relationship to another becomes fully clear, it feels like a satisfying confirmation born out of a context of deep connection, rather than a cheap reveal.
Night Watch is tough reading, even excruciating at times, but far from unrelentingly bleak; small notes of grace appear throughout the novel, especially, albeit briefly, at the end. If at one juncture ConaLee remarks grimly “I’d not seen the war except in what it ruined”, she and some of those around her at the asylum are also offered a glimpse of what might, with time and care, be restored. “Much of [the civil war] is encrusted in myth or still unexplored,” the late Tony Horwitz, author of Confederates in the Attic, wrote in 2010. With this excellent novel, Phillips has brought a little more of this foundational American episode into the light.

Heatwave conditions hit regions across Australia on Thursday and will continue on the public holiday before cooling off over the weekend.
Bureau of Meteorology warnings are in place for NSW, Queensland, WA, SA and the Northern Territory, while extreme heatwaves could impact parts of far south-west Queensland.
The BOM is forecasting maximum and minimum temperatures to be around 6C to 12C above-average in large parts of central and eastern Australia.
“Widespread temperatures above 40C are expected across inland and eastern parts of Australia over the next few days, with some inland areas as hot as 49C,” a spokesperson said.
Birdsville’s 49.4°C this afternoon was Queensland’s highest temperature since 1972 and only 0.1°C off the state’s all-time record. pic.twitter.com/wHfWg3NzJ9
Sydney was forecast to reach 35C on Thursday, but fell just shy at 32.1C. The bureau has has lifted its forecast for Sydney from 35C to 38C for Friday, with a few places in the city’s west and south-west looking set to reach 40C.
Temperatures in the mid-to-high 30s swept parts of the NSW coast on Thursday, with Newcastle peaking at 39.2C.
Inland areas of Southern Australia’s north, south-west Queensland and north-west NSW sweltered in temperatures in the mid-to-high 40s on Thursday and are forecast to do so again on Friday.
Roxby Downs, about 500km north of Adelaide, hit 45.7C on Thursday, while further inland the outback town of Coober Pedy hit 41.4.
Birdsville, in Queensland, hit maximum temperatures of 47.2C and 47.9C on Tuesday and Wednesday before clocking 49.4C on Thursday. The town holds the hottest temperature recorded in Queensland after it hit 49.5C – just 0.1C above Thursday’s temperature – in 1972.

Meanwhile, far north Queensland is facing heavy rainfall which could lead to flash flooding with Tropical Cyclone Kirrily, now a category three system, expected to land north of Townsville later this evening.
The bureau is expecting isolated total rainfall of about 300mm in the next 24 hours and potential very destructive winds of up to 224 km/h.
Cooler air developing in the south of Western Australia on Wednesday is set to gradually spread across the southern states on Thursday and Friday, ending the heatwave for many.
The forecast change will bring cooler weather for almost all areas on the weekend."
4FB1GTGSL3_6YDFBW1IAYYZDGU,Biden hopes abortion will keep him in the White House. But has he done enough to protect rights?,Carter Sherman,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/26/biden-abortion-rights-expand-protections,"Joe Biden’s re-election campaign has made a big bet that outrage over abortion will keep the president in the White House come November.
Over the last several days, the Biden administration has unleashed a blitz of ads and events to spotlight the devastation wrought by the overturning of Roe v Wade. Biden met with a reproductive health task force, while his vice-president, Kamala Harris – who he has entrusted to lead this effort – embarked on a national tour to talk about abortion. They even devoted their first joint campaign stop of 2024 to the issue.
From the podium, Biden promised to sign any bill that would codify Roe’s protections into law and to fight back efforts by Congress to diminish abortion access.
“Donald Trump and Maga Republicans, including the speaker of the House, are hellbent on going even further,” Biden said, a reference to the hard-right Republican speaker, Mike Johnson. “As long as I have power of the presidency, if Congress were to pass a national abortion ban, I would veto it.”
Congress is unlikely to ban or protect abortion anytime soon. Not only is Congress largely frozen – it passed just 27 bills last year – but both political parties seem wary of tackling national legislation around a third-rail topic like abortion.
Now that Roe is gone, the question of if and how to regulate abortion access is largely up to state governments to answer. But the executive branch of the US government still maintains several powers to protect abortion access – and undermine it.
The Biden administration’s ability to enforce remaining federal laws that touch on abortion is perhaps its greatest weapon in the fight over the procedure. Shortly after Roe’s demise, the Biden administration announced that it believed a 1986 federal law that protects people’s access to emergency care at hospitals also applies to emergency abortions. The administration later sued Idaho, arguing that the state’s near-total abortion ban flew in the face of that law, the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (Emtala).
That case has now made its way to the US supreme court. The supreme court justices are also set to hear arguments in a case involving the availability of a major abortion pill – a case in which the Biden administration is, once again, arguing in favor of abortion access.
“Being a check on the supreme court is pretty significant,” said Mary Ziegler, a University of California Davis school of law professor who studies the legal history of reproduction. The US supreme court is dominated 6-3 by conservatives. “If the supreme court says that you can or should enforce rules against abortion providers, I don’t think a Biden administration is going to do that.”
Since Roe fell, anti-abortion activists have also begun to argue that the federal government could enforce a de facto national abortion ban through the Comstock Act, a 19th-century anti-obscenity law that bans the mailing of abortion-related materials.
However, the Biden administration has issued guidance declaring that they do not believe the Comstock Act can or should be used to enforce a national abortion ban. According to the Biden administration, as long as someone does not intend to break the law when they mail abortion-related materials, they are not violating the Comstock Act.
The answer depends on who you ask. Abortion rights advocates have long been dissatisfied with Biden’s approach to the procedure; Biden has supported Roe’s protections but also said that, as a Catholic, he is personally not “big on abortion”. During his campaign and the first several months of his presidency, he seemed wary of even saying the word “abortion”, leading reproductive justice advocates to launch a website devoted to answering the question “Did Biden Say Abortion Yet?” (He has now said it multiple times.)
The Biden administration has pursued several cases under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, or Face Act, a federal law that penalizes people for threatening, obstructing, or injuring someone who is trying to access a reproductive health clinic, or for vandalizing a clinic. But abortion providers have long complained that the law is not being enforced enough.
Abortion rights supporters have also proposed a litany of other, experimental ways to protect abortion access, such as by leasing federal land to abortion providers or advocating for the repeal of the Comstock Act. Biden could also loosen regulations around abortion pills, although Ziegler cautioned that such actions run the risk of politicizing the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to a dangerous degree.
Abortion rights advocates have also said that the Biden administration could take steps to lessen the impact of the Helms Amendment, a decades-old law that has been used to block the use of federal funding to pay for abortions. Advocates have accused Biden of inappropriately over-enforcing the Helms Amendment, to the point that the US Agency for International Development in 2021 cancelled a conference session on the provision of safe telemedicine abortion.
However, in Ziegler’s view, the threat of the supreme court tamps down on Biden’s ability to innovate. Rather than pursuing novel, national ways to protect abortion access and run the risk of litigation, the administration may want to stay out of federal court entirely.
“I think Biden has been really cautious,” Ziegler said. “But I do also think that had he not been as cautious, it could have ended up the same or worse anyway, just because the supreme court is so conservative.”
If Trump wins the presidency in November 2024, he may reverse course on many of the Biden administration’s decisions around how and if to enforce federal abortion law. He could try to implement the Comstock Act to ban abortion in some form, including in states that haven’t passed bans. He could also decrease Face Act prosecutions, or tighten regulations on mifepristone.
Unlike Biden, he likely wouldn’t worry about politicizing the FDA, Ziegler said. “There’s a lot of asymmetry that hurts Democrats, but also Democrats do value some of these institutional separations that Republicans don’t.”
Trump’s first four years in the White House also offer a blueprint for how he may further dismantle access to both abortion and contraception if he returns to power.
Since the 1980s, whenever a Republican becomes president, he has implemented what is known as “the Mexico City policy” or the “global gag rule”, as abortion rights supporters call it. This policy typically blocks foreign NGOs that receive US family planning funding from providing abortion-related services or even advocating for increased access to the procedure. (Historically, whenever a Democrat replaces a Republican as president, he has rescinded the Mexico City policy.)
Trump, however, turbocharged the Mexico City policy during his presidency. Rather than stripping funding only from family planning assistance, in 2017 his administration expanded it to apply to all US global health assistance. Rather than impacting $600m worth of funding, by 2018 it impacted $12bn, according to estimates by the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights.
As president, Trump also implemented a “domestic gag rule”, which blocked members of Title X, the nation’s largest family planning program, from even referring people for abortions. Rather than comply with this rule, a quarter of Title X-funded health centers simply left the program. Six states were left with zero Title X providers, who offer low-cost access to family planning services like birth control.
If Trump wins in 2024, he will likely reinstate this rule, said Robin Summers, vice-president and senior counsel for the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association. And that’s just the beginning of Summers thinks he might do.
“I think it only gets worse,” Summers said.
Trump could, Summers suggested, legally label certain forms of hormonal birth control – such as IUDS – as abortifacients, suggesting that they cause abortions. (Medical experts widely believe that they do not.) The US supreme court has previously supported a similar move. In a 2014 decision, issued when the court’s makeup was far less conservative, the justices ruled that a corporation did not have to cover certain forms of birth control for employees because the corporation’s religious owners believed them to be abortifacients.
“The bottom line here is that advocates sounded the alarm for years that Roe was at significant risk of being overturned. And we were dismissed by many as catastrophizing the whole thing,” Summers said. “And look where we are.”"
4FIKYKXADN_BFR3B7SLWPJLRUI,Trump and his toadies are trying to rewrite history so that he’s not an insurrectionist,Sidney Blumenthal,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/23/donald-trump-republicans-january-6-insurrection-history,"OJ Simpson decided he could make some “blood money”, as he called it, by writing a “hypothetical” book on the murders of his estranged wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman entitled If I Did It. When it was announced in 2006, the outrage was so overwhelming that the publisher, HarperCollins, owned by Rupert Murdoch, fired the editor, Judith Regan, and cancelled a scheduled Fox network special. The OJ book fiasco appeared to be a rare moment of Murdoch sensitivity, but he was concerned that the association besmirched his own reputation.
A week after Donald Trump’s attorney argued in the DC district court that he could not be prosecuted for his attempted coup culminating in the January 6 assault on the Capitol and could order the assassination of any opponent, Trump took to his Truth Social account on 18 January to insist that he “MUST HAVE COMPLETE & TOTAL PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY” even for “EVENTS THAT ‘CROSS THE LINE’”. If the glove fits, you must still acquit.
Trump’s If I Did It moment was followed, not with repulsion, but instead with his former warm embrace by Murdoch’s Fox News, reflexive bended knee by the entire Republican leadership, and Polonius-like advice from JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon to Democrats to “grow up” and “listen” to Maga.
After 6 January 2021, Murdoch swore that Trump was an “asshole”, “a fucking idiot” and a “loser”. Fox News itself agreed to pay $787m to settle a case alleging that Fox News broadcast falsehoods to advance Trump’s lies about the Dominion Voting Systems company. The day after Trump’s OJ-like confession, Fox News host Brian Kilmeade said: “He’s gone out of his way not to look back,” and “there’s a sereneness about him.” Fox’s Laura Ingraham urged Ron DeSantis “to step aside and endorse Trump”. Murdoch had touted DeSantis in his New York Post and on Fox, but he is now back to round-the-clock promotion of Trump, whom he appeared to privately wish dead: “This would all be solved if … ” If I Did It …
The day after the US Capitol attack in 2021, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase felt morally compelled to issue a formal corporate statement: “This is not who we are as a people or a country.” But at the Davos World Economic Forum last week, Dimon said that Democrats should “grow up”, “listen” to “Maga”, stop “scapegoating” Trump supporters, and “treat other people with respect”. “I think people should be a little more respectful of our fellow citizens.”
Wearing a Ukrainian flag pin in his lapel, but seemingly unaware of its meaning, Dimon remarked that Trump was “kind of right about Nato”. Trump, according to his national security adviser John Bolton, pledged to wreck Nato, and bluntly told European leaders that he would not honor the US treaty commitment to defend them if they were attacked.
After Trump’s Iowa romp and apparent unobstructed path to the Republican nomination, the corporate statesman, holding forth from the pinnacle of globalism, hedged. His studied ambivalence came a week after his bank reported that in 2023, under Joe Biden, its profits surged to its best year in its history. But Dimon still swiveled. “I have to be prepared for both. I will be prepared for both. We will deal with both.”
Dimon’s grave words after 6 January 2021 were from a discarded balance sheet: “Our elected leaders have a responsibility to call for an end to the violence, accept the results, and, as our democracy has for hundreds of years, support the peaceful transition of power.” His condescension against condescension against the Trumpetariat is risk management. But his hypocrisy is more than interest on his capital. His feigned empathy about Maga as an oppressed minority community garbles bits and pieces of the half-digested drivel of table talk of Republican billionaires with whom he breaks bread.
While Dimon and others at the Davos aerie considered the annual Economic Forum’s Global Risks Report, which identified disinformation and misinformation from artificial intelligence as the greatest short-term threat to democracy, a Manhattan courtroom was hearing the second defamation case of the adjudicated rapist Trump against E Jean Carroll.
Carroll testified that she had been inundated with death threats from Trump supporters. Trump’s incitement against the judges and their staff overseeing his various trials has provoked constant death threats against them, and they are surrounded by security details. The jurors’ anonymity is closely guarded to protect their safety. Trump’s antics are deliberate tactics of intimidation and political base mobilization. The shadow of stochastic violence hangs over the justice system. Everyone under threat “listens” to Maga.
While Dimon suggested learning from Maga, Trump provided educational lessons in two courtrooms. In his New York trial for financial fraud, he broke the judge’s conditions that he should not to attack the court or use the forum to make a “campaign speech”. After the closing arguments, Trump raged in the court that the judge has an “agenda”, and that the trial is a “political witch hunt” and “a fraud on me”. Judge Arthur Engoron, who would probably have declared another defendant in contempt, told Trump’s attorney: “Control your client.”
At the E Jean Carroll trial, Trump interrupted Carroll’s lawyer repeatedly with loud remarks from the defendant’s table. Judge Lewis Kaplan staid that if he continued his disruptions he could be excluded from the courtroom.
“I would love it,” Trump replied.
“I know you would, because you just can’t control yourself in this circumstance, apparently. You just can’t,” Kaplan said.
“Neither can you,” Trump countered, using one of his favorite gambits – accusing the person calling him out for his actions of doing the same thing. (“Puppet, puppet, you’re the puppet,” he shouted at Hillary Clinton in a debate, to claim she was Putin’s plaything.)
During the lunch break in the trial, Trump posted a series of attacks on the judge, calling him a “seething and hostile Clinton-appointed Judge”. “He is abusive, rude, and obviously not impartial but, that’s the way this crooked system works!” Another defendant would have been held in contempt, subjected to a gag order, or excluded from the proceedings. His Maga followers were listening and watching.
Then, at a New Hampshire rally, on 20 January, Trump staged an Orwellian exercise in projection, appearing before a gigantic sign reading: “Biden Attacks Democracy.”
The very day of Trump’s cross-the-line If I Did It statement, the Republican congressional leaders en masse affixed their signatures to a document unprecedented in US political history. It was a declaration of unconditional surrender to Trump. In an amicus brief filed before the US supreme court in the case in which the Colorado supreme court ruled to remove Trump from the ballot for engaging in an insurrection under the constitution’s 14th amendment, section 3, they defended him as an innocent victim. To depict the guiltless Trump, they offered a story of alternative facts.
During the protests in the summer of 2020, he was the real target of violence: “Violence aimed towards the sitting President was perhaps unsurprising … ” Then, during the election, “both sides could attempt to label the other as having actively opposed the peaceful transfer of power to the rightful winner, or at least being morally complicit in those actions – and thus both Trump and Biden partisans could try to disqualify each other under Section 3, in tit-for-tat … ” But Trump on 6 January 2021 was the voice of peace and reason, telling his supporters to “go home now.”
The amicus brief that is the white flag raised by the congressional Republicans has been signed by 44 senators and 135 members of the House, all the leadership in both chambers. The signers are a confederacy of cynics and co-conspirators.

Of the senators, Ted Cruz, Lindsey Graham and Mike Lee were almost certainly privy to far more of the “stop the steal” movement, the fake electors scheme and the events of January 6 than they have revealed. The Georgia grand jury recommended Graham’s indictment for election fraud, but he was let off the hook when the prosecutor opted not to charge him.
Of the House members, speaker Mike Johnson and Jim Jordan, among others, were extensively involved in Trump’s plot. Johnson, among other things, was central to organizing objections to certification of the electoral college count. Jordan refused to honor the subpoena of the January 6 committee.
“Leader Mitch McConnell” is listed on the amicus brief. On the day of January 6, McConnell was hustled by the Capitol police to a secure location, where with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer they frantically called for military intervention to end the assault. McConnell was in physical danger. He is frail. He has unstable balance. He cannot run. He had a bad fall the year before, fracturing his shoulder. He has heart trouble.
That evening, after the Capitol was cleared of the attackers, McConnell quaked with anger. “The mob was fed lies,” he said. “They were provoked by the president and other powerful people.” He told his staffers that Trump was a “despicable human being”.
He thought Trump was done. Now, McConnell has lent his name to a legal document that claims Trump did not “engage” in an insurrection.
The brief, prepared by a Federalist Society chop-shop of rightwing lawyers, provides an à la carte menu for the conservative majority on the US supreme court to select an excuse for Trump. There are the sophistries – the president is not an “officer” of the US; his oath differs by a word from that of a senator; Trump didn’t “engage in” an insurrection.
There is whataboutism – as in, what about antifa in Portland and Maxine Waters. There is twisted illogic – the falsehood that a state lacks power to disqualify a candidate because it “interferes” with the congressional authority to remove a “disability” through an amnesty.
There is constitutional nonsense – that the 14th amendment is not self-executing; that the qualification mentioned in the 20th amendment, the “lame-duck” amendment, that prevented a lame duck Congress from choosing a president and established the line of succession in case of an electoral deadlock or a death, had anything to do with the qualification regarding insurrection provided by the 14th amendment, section 3.
In its defense of Trump, the brief winds up conceding the entire case. Invoking the non sequitur of the 20th amendment, the lawyers argue it “confirms that a candidate may be elected President even if he is not qualified to hold the office”. Splitting hairs, they have beheaded Trump.
Finally, in an even weirder conclusion, they cite George Orwell’s 1984 to defend Trump as the victim of authoritarian tyranny. “It is hard to imagine an actual insurrectionist quickly asking for peace and encouraging disbandment. But once ‘engage in’ is defined so broadly, even significant countervailing evidence can simply be labeled as a ruse, as insufficient, or even as an implied recognition and praise of ongoing violence. Enterprising state officials, in other words, may conclude that ‘Peace means War.’ Cf. George Orwell, 1984.”
But, then, after all that, Trump demands immunity for “EVENTS THAT ‘CROSS THE LINE” – If I Did It.
For McConnell, his fellow signers, and the Republicans racing to endorse Trump, the clock is striking thirteen.

4M6S1AU9BC_R0WX6P59X644XTR,Iran bars Hassan Rouhani from seeking re-election to key body,Patrick Wintour,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/25/iran-bars-hassan-rouhani-from-seeking-re-election-to-key-body,"The Iranian regime has taken its crackdown on any internal opposition into a new phase by disqualifying the reformist former president Hassan Rouhani from seeking re-election to the assembly of experts, the body that chooses the country’s supreme leader.
Reformists reacted angrily on Thursday to the regime-controlled guardian council’s announcement. The 88 assembly members serve an eight-year term, and since the incumbent supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, is 84, it is highly likely that the next assembly will choose his successor.
The regime has often used disqualification on spurious technical grounds as a means of preventing regime opponents from standing for elections. Other past presidents Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad have also found themselves barred but it is a sign of the regime’s audacity that it has chosen to exclude someone so experienced and prominent as Rouhani.
Tara Sepehri Far, an associate fellow at the Chatham House thinktank, said: “The system wants to be very clear that they want to be in control and are not interested in sharing power with anyone. It used to be understood elections in Iran were not free and fair but contested, but over the past 20 years there has been a persistent attempt to disempower the electorate, making it harder to argue any good comes from electoral politics.”
Iran’s former vice-president Eshaq Jahangiri said of Rouhani’s disqualification: “People ask what is the mechanism that in every election many personalities and high-ranking officials, such as presidents etc, are disqualified or excluded? What are the reasons for disqualifying a large number of candidates for the parliamentary elections, ignoring the conditions for holding passionate and competitive elections?”
He asked: “How can someone be disqualified who has been the secretary and chairman of the supreme national security council for many years and has been present for several terms in the assembly of leadership experts and the Islamic Council, and who received 24m votes from the people six years ago”.
Jahangiri said Iran was facing “complex and difficult economic, social and political issues and the regional and international situation is risky”. Administering a blow to the hope of the people and shrinking the circle of the system would intensify the threats, he said.
Rouhani, who was president for two terms from 2013 to 2021, has three days to appeal against the decision, as do the other disqualified candidates. He said he disagreed with the decision, vowed that nothing would weaken his will to defend the nation, and demanded an explanation.
Rouhani said he had been disqualified along with thousands of other parliamentary candidates. Previously he said “a way must be found to make the ‘protest vote’ the voice of the Iranian people”, without elaborating.
Outlets linked to Iran’s Revolutionary Guards highlighted protests, a crashed economy, the collapse of the nuclear deal and Israeli assassinations as Rouhani’s chief legacy.
The guardian council is a creature of Khamenei’s. It comprises six clerics appointed by him and six jurists approved by MPs from a list provided by the judiciary chief, who himself is an appointee of the supreme leader.
One of the media reasons cited for Rouhani’s disqualification – a failure to build mosques – was ridiculed as absurd by Hossein Ansari Rad, a former reformist MP and cleric. No official explanation has been given.
Other reformists said the government was storing up trouble before another wave of protests that would come after the “women, life freedom” movement that rocked the regime from September 2020.
This week the regime executed two people involved in those earlier protests. Their deaths prompted 61 female political prisoners in Evin jail to launch a hunger strike on Thursday.
Rouhani’s casting aside is also a sign that the regime is not interested in improving relations with the west and remains committed to developing strategic relations with Turkey, Russia and China.
Alex Vatanka, the head of the Iran programme at the Middle East Institute, said Rouhani’s removal showed that Khamenei was not interested in compromise.
“It is ‘my way or the highway’,” he said of Khamenei’s approach. “The men who decide – the [Revolutionary Guards] and the office of the supreme leader – know nothing else … They believe in the language of force and, frankly, force is what works for them. The supreme leader crushes his opponents. It is the approach he believes he can pull off in the region.”

Jason Moore’s conviction for stabbing to death Robert Darby in an east London pub car park in 2005 relied heavily on witness testimony that is now in doubt. The victim’s brother, Tim Darby, is among those campaigning for Moore’s release.
Just weeks after Moore made a fresh application for his case to be referred back to the court of appeal, intelligence of a £10,000 reward to have him stabbed in prison emerged. Police are investigating and Moore is in solitary confinement in HMP Oakwood for his own protection.
Speaking from prison through a relative, Moore, 54, said: “My life has been a nightmare for the last few days.” He said that the unknown person ordering a hit “sent photographs and prison numbers to people, so the threat is very credible”.
The situation has prompted Moore’s lawyer to request that the miscarriage of justice body, the Criminal Cases Review Commission, expedites his case, given the potential risk to him and witnesses.
Moore said he hoped the CCRC would understand the urgency of the situation. “I’m a lot more concerned now … so they mustn’t drag their feet. They need to deal with this ASAP so nothing can go wrong for me, hopefully. “
He added: “They’ve got to realise now that they can’t take forever to look at this because all the time they’re dragging this out I’ve got this hanging over me.”
Moore was a professional gambler with no previous convictions for violence. He is more than a decade into an 18-year sentence with little hope of release soon because he refuses to do courses that would force him to admit to the crime.
The fresh application to the CCRC focuses on new evidence from the only witness to identify Moore in a lineup. The witness initially picked out a volunteer who looked nothing like Moore and told the Romford Recorder last year that he was in fact drunk at the time of the incident and got only a fleeting glance.
The new CCRC application also alleges that when the body turned down Moore’s last application it inaccurately summarised the position of another witness.
Intelligence about a hit followed the arrival of a suspicious package at the prison in December that his family said appeared to be an attempt to frame him for an escape plan.
Moore’s sister, Kirstie Moore, said this was the third time that a breakthrough in her brother’s case had prompted threats. She said that when his first CCRC application was submitted in 2020 she was threatened with acid and that when he launched an appeal in 2017 his girlfriend received a warning from police that her life was in danger.
“Every time we go with the hope of Jason’s case being reinvestigated, all of a sudden, all this activity of threatening behaviour happens,” she said.
A spokesperson for G4S, which runs the prison, told the Guardian it took the threat very seriously and that after a full security assessment Moore was moved to a safe space.
A CCRC spokesperson said: “An application has been received related to this case. It would be inappropriate for us to discuss the application or make any further comment at this stage.”
A spokesperson for Essex police said: “We are investigating an allegation of threats made against an individual following a referral by colleagues with Staffordshire police.”
They said the investigation was at an early stage and that they had contacted the informant to progress it."
4MTANJJDS2_HPP3JW2V0KMVMRA,Jury dismissed in trial of maths teacher accused of having sex with student at elite Sydney school,Daisy Dumas,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/22/jury-dismissed-in-trial-of-maths-teacher-accused-of-having-sex-with-student-at-elite-sydney-school,"A judge has discharged the jury in the trial of a former teacher who allegedly groomed and had unlawful sexual activity with a student at an elite Sydney high school.
Judge Sophia Beckett told the jury that she was forced to make the “very unusual” decision after evidence about the health of the defence barrister came to light, threatening the fairness of proceedings.
“I am discharging you because I have reached the view that the accused cannot have a fair trial,” she told the jury at the Downing Centre district court on Monday morning.
The mathematics teacher, who cannot legally be named, was on trial for allegedly forming a sexual relationship with a minor after she became their pupil in 1984. The teacher has pleaded not guilty to one charge of carnal knowledge.
The jury was told that the defence counsel had not been well and that his illness had impacted his capacity to properly represent his client.
In four and a half years as a judge, it is the third jury Beckett has ever dismissed and one of those was due to Covid, she said.
“This is a very unusual situation but I have made a determination that it cannot continue,” she told the jury. “I want you to know that I don’t do this lightly.”
The development comes after five days of hearings, including the complainant’s cross-examination.
In his opening remarks, the crown prosecutor David Patch said the student, who turned 17 in 1984 and also cannot be named, was groomed by the teacher.
“It’s the crown case that the accused was sexually interested in the complainant from when they first met and almost immediately began grooming the complainant,” he said.
The teacher and student are alleged to have had sexual intercourse about 10 times before August 1984.
The court heard on Thursday that the teacher did not begin a relationship with the complainant until 1985, while the complainant’s former boyfriend remembers her breaking up with him in March 1984 because “she had someone new, which was the teacher”.
The complainant’s evidence and transcripts from the aborted trial will be used in a future trial, Beckett said.
A subsequent trial date, expected in the next six to 12 months, is yet to be set."
4SFI8REE94_P1HF29F0Z7BT1ZN,Revenge: Our Dad the Nazi Killer review – we may never know the truth about these shadowy deaths,Lucy Mangan,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/jan/23/revenge-our-dad-the-nazi-killer-review-we-may-never-know-the-truth-about-these-shadowy-deaths,"Jack, Jon and Sam Green remember their childhoods as happy and their father, Boris, as a vital part of that. But he was “not an open book at all”. This was surely the same experience as many children of Holocaust survivors. Boris and his brother Fima, who spent years as partisan fighters in eastern Europe, hunting Nazis in the Lithuanian forests, were the only members of their extended family still alive by the end of the second world war. When Fima found Boris again, he was living 200 miles away from their home town with a handful of other survivors, wanting to die with them rather than live with all his memories and terrible losses. Fima wouldn’t let him stay, or die. “That is what I achieved in my life,” he tells an interviewer compiling their stories for a Holocaust memorial museum. “I saved my brother. That is all. That is all.”
They emigrated to Australia in 1948, but instead of the real-life paradise they had been promised, they found themselves in a land that also offered succour to Nazis and collaborators who had – thanks to the uninterest of the international courts in prosecuting them for war crimes – easily escaped punishment.
Danny Ben-Moshe’s film Revenge: Our Dad the Nazi Killer follows Boris’s sons through their investigation of the possible consequences arising from that awful conflation of circumstances. There were always whispers and hints, shadowy family lore that suggested their father had been involved with the murder of a man in Sydney in the 1950s – a revenge killing, perhaps, of someone connected with the Nazi regime.
They hire the private investigator John Garvey, a former police detective. He sifts through the dusty police archives and fragile documents found for him by various Jewish museums in Australia and Lithuania, and gathers what facts he can. Usually with Jack or Jon present, he also interviews Boris’s old friends and fellow postwar émigrés to try to get a sense of the man and answer the question at the heart of the film and the boys’ quest: did he have it in him to kill a man, and what do you do with that knowledge if the answer comes back “Yes”?
His old friends are clear that they believe the man who came out of the Lithuanian forests did not leave his partisan past behind. Between them and the archives, Garvey pieces together evidence of an entire network of Jewish surveillance groups who tracked suspected war criminals and collaborators in Australia. When they reported their findings to the police, they discovered that the police were more likely to tip subjects off about their discovery than arrest them. There were, as the 50s and 60s wore on, a high number of suicides and unexplained deaths among those the groups suspected. Garvey narrows down the list of possible victims and, as Boris’s own interviews with Holocaust researchers recording for posterity are screened, it becomes increasingly likely that he and Fima were directly involved in at least one death, of a man likely to have taken part in the killing of their townsfolk, and probably their family.
The question is not – and perhaps can never be – definitively answered, but that is not the point of this industrious film, and perhaps not even the point of the brothers’ inquiry. Instead, it disinters a relatively unknown part of Jewish and Australian history, and poses the question of whether it can be morally right to kill and – more subtly – how much blame should be laid at the feet of governments and authorities who fail to deliver justice and punishment for those guilty of some of the worst crimes in history.
Richard (no surname given), a child aide to the partisans, who also emigrated to Australia, where he was part of a local committee of Jewish survivors, says that he believes Boris did kill a fugitive collaborator after the war “and I hope that he did”. The survivor Abe Goldberg, who remembers babies bayonetted by Nazi soldiers and saw Boris speak at a Holocaust commemoration service in Melbourne, says killing those responsible would have been the moral thing to do, and he would have shaken Boris’s hand if he had.
“There was a war after the war,” says Sam Green, who worked with his dad in the family jewellery shop, and remembers shattered survivors coming in to tell his father that they had seen the men who had killed their families and being taken into private rooms for further discussion. Jack says he feels closer to and prouder of his father now that his secrets have been at least partially brought into the light. “If we’re talking about standing up for justice and preventing more [harm] when other people aren’t doing that, then I don’t only hope that he did it, but I’m proud of him if he did,” says Jon. The film doesn’t insist on a point of view, but it is hard to disagree with Boris Green’s boys.

4SWSEEYDZ1_8E6D97ISV7G4XLT,Woolworths CEO denies serving up ‘wokeness in aisle three’ after Australia Day controversy,Rafqa Touma,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/24/woolworths-australia-day-merchandise-ceo-response-bradford-banducci-peter-dutton-boycott,"Woolworths’ chief executive has denied accusations it is serving up “wokeness in aisle three” after the supermarket chain made a decision not to stock Australia Day merchandise in its stores.
Bradford Banducci, who appeared on both Channel Seven’s Sunrise program and Nine’s Today on Wednesday morning, said the decision was commercial, not a political statement, but said “we could have done a better job” in explaining the move.
Sales of Australia Day merchandise “has actually been reducing for a number of years”, he told Sunrise on Wednesday morning. “It is really specific items.
“That space in our store has been shrinking.”

On Channel Nine’s Today program, Banducci said: “Let’s be honest here, to all the people watching this … how much do you have in your cupboard from last year?”
When the day is over “it goes into landfill or, even worse, into waterways”.
Stock is ordered 10 to 12 months in advance, so the decision to not stock merchandise is the consequence of an ongoing process involving customer feedback, he told Sunrise.
On Today, Banducci disagreed with host Karl Stefanovic’s suggestion that Woolworths had served up “wokeness in aisle three”.
“I would completely disagree on that call,” Banducci said. “We’ve served up a focus on what we think we need to do better and the most meaningful way we can contribute to our customers.”
Woolworths’ announcement in early January prompted criticism from media and Coalition politicians, with the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, calling for a boycott of the retailer and saying the decision was “against the national interest”.
Since then two stores have been vandalised with pro-Australia Day graffiti and, according to Banducci, there had been a 50% increase in the number of acts of rudeness or aggression to workers.
The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, warned against Dutton’s boycott, pointing to the impact it might have on its 200,000 employees.
Asked if he was anti-Australia Day on Today, Banducci said “Australia Day means different things to everyone” but confirmed Woolworths stores would be decorated in green and gold.
“We want everyone to make their choice of how they want to mark Australia Day,” he said.

“We are going to be celebrating the best of Australian food for this long weekend, because no matter how you think about the day, what we will bring is everyone together sitting down and having a great Australian meal.”
The CEO told Today that Woolworths “could have clearly done a better job of explaining our decision”.
“That is why I’m here, because I think we could have done a better job,” Banducci said. “The weight for myself is the impact that this is having on our team. They are proud, hardworking Australians.”
Banducci told Sunrise he was worried about people who “don’t fully understand our message”.
“There is a risk of them taking out frustrations in store with hardworking employees … who will be working on the long weekend.
“I have read incident reports of unfortunate incidents in our stores … People being rude and threatening our team.
“If nothing else comes out from this headline, the clear message is: treat our team with the respect they deserve.”

4TDB2ESLKC_HZ7P49IZA6YFCSK,The world should learn from Poland’s tragedy: restoring democracy is even harder than creating it,Timothy Garton Ash,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/23/poland-restoring-democracy-harder-donald-tusk,"“Evolution or revolution?” The question being asked in Poland today captures the dilemma of trying to restore liberal democracy after eight years of populist state capture. Must one, for instance, break the letter of a specific law in order to restore the rule of law as an overall condition? The Polish experience will tell us something important about the future of democracy inside EU member states. It also prefigures a challenge the United States could face at the end of a second Donald Trump presidency.
The last few weeks in Polish politics have been dramatic, angry and sometimes bizarre. Two former ministers of the previously ruling Law and Justice (PiS) government, convicted of the falsification of documents while in public office, take refuge in the palace of the president, their party comrade Andrzej Duda. While Duda is away at another meeting, the police arrest them in the palace and carry them off to prison. The president says they are “political prisoners”, talks of “rule of law terror”, and even makes a comparison with Bereza Kartuska, a notorious concentration camp in 1930s Poland. PiS launches a protest demo in the snow, deploying the iconography of the Solidarity movement that led Poland to freedom in the 1980s. PiS leader Jarosław Kaczyński says the arrested politicians are heroes who should be awarded the country’s highest honours. Poland’s genuinely tragic and inspiring past is recycled as grotesque parody.
The supposedly “public service” television station, TVP, which for eight years blasted out the most vile, mendacious, abusive propaganda for the ruling party, is taken over by the new government. Former staff are shut out, the station is declared bankrupt as a commercial enterprise but swiftly resumes broadcasting. Its new-style news programmes are incomparably more impartial (I’ve been watching them), but even a legal scholar highly critical of PiS characterises the steps taken to achieve this good result as “revolutionary moves”.
Different courts, some with clearly party-political judges illegally appointed by the PiS government, flatly contradict each other. At moments this feels like what the Bolshevik revolutionary Leon Trotsky called “dual power”. The name-calling gets ever louder, but the new coalition government headed by Donald Tusk, a former prime minister (from 2007 to 2014) and president of the European Council (from 2014 to 2019), continues to purge PiS’s strongholds of embedded state power with what this formidable politician has called “an iron broom”.
Three different threads intertwine in this drama. Most obviously, there’s the difficulty of restoring the institutions of a liberal democracy, built from scratch on the ruins of a Soviet-type system after 1989 and then subject to systematic demolition after 2015, when PiS came to power, but with the country remaining a member of the European Union. Like Viktor Orbán in Hungary, Kaczyński made great efforts to keep the facade of a democratic, pluralist, rule-of-law state, conforming with EU standards. As another legal scholar puts it, you have so-called judges delivering so-called verdicts on the basis of so-called laws. A Potemkin constitutionalism, if you will.
As a result, the restoration of liberal democracy is both more and less difficult than was its original creation after the end of communism in 1989. It’s less difficult externally, because instead of still being in the Kremlin-dominated Warsaw Pact and Comecon, Poland is in Nato and the EU. The EU is not just applauding the efforts of the new government but rewarding it with what may soon be upwards of €100bn in EU funds, withheld from the previous government because of its violations of the rule of law.
It’s more difficult internally, because this is not, as in 1989, an externally imposed one-party dictatorship which almost all Poles – including many of the former communist power-holders – agree must be transformed through a peaceful revolution. Rather, it’s an entirely homemade mess, shrouded for the most part in laws approved by a democratically elected parliamentary majority.
Second, it’s a case of hyperpolarisation, fake news and hysteria strongly reminiscent of today’s United States. Like Maga Republicans and leftwing Democrats, supporters of Kaczyński and Tusk live in different realities, each denouncing the other for violating the rule of law and betraying the nation. A stable liberal democracy depends on a basic social consensus around the legitimacy of key institutions such as parliament, presidency, independent courts and free media. How do you recreate a well-functioning liberal democracy when that minimal social consensus doesn’t exist?
Last, but by no means least, there’s the role of individuals. Kaczyński and Tusk have played leading parts in Polish politics for a quarter of a century, and they hate each other’s guts. Kaczyński, a prime example of the paranoid style in politics, strode up to the parliamentary lectern moments after the Tusk government was sworn in, and denounced the new prime minister as a “German agent”.
As fateful in the current crisis is the country’s president. Duda is weak, vain, easily swayed, and usually ends up doing Kaczyński’s bidding. His own former doctoral supervisor calls him “wobbly”. According to the much-respected first head of Poland’s supreme court, Adam Strzembosz, the president who now plaintively calls on the EU to stop the new government’s violations of the constitution has himself violated the constitution no fewer than 13 times. Instead of playing the vital role of a neutral head of state during a difficult political transition, he has become even more partisan, offering convicted criminals refuge in the presidential palace and bleating fatuous hyperbole.
The new government says it wants a quick cleaning of the Augean stables, before focusing on Poland’s future. That’s easier said than done, especially given Duda’s significant powers of veto and delay. In as much as PiS has a political strategy, it’s probably to make hysterical chaos last as long as possible, in the hope that voters will come back to them in April’s local elections or June’s European ones. There are few signs of this yet; in fact, opinion polls suggest the opposite. But it can’t be ruled out.
Beyond that, the biggest challenge for Tusk and his coalition partners will be to resist the temptation of simply turning the tables, installing their own partisan loyalists instead of the other lot. In short, Poland needs to build back better. By the end of this parliamentary term, in 2027, the public service broadcaster should be more solidly impartial, the courts more fully independent, the president more unquestionably above parties, state-owned enterprises more thoroughly non partisan, the public administration and security services more truly independent – not just than they were under PiS, but than they were under earlier Polish governments, including Tusk’s own previous ones, before the populists came to power. Here’s the real test, the true labour of Hercules.

4UZZB1CGYL_LSMT24GAHXRJ9JO,"R&B sensation Erika de Casier: ‘I don’t know if I ever think – yep, I’m a musician’",Michael Cragg,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/jan/22/erika-de-casier-still-interview,"Erika de Casier is uncomfortable. She is sitting cross-legged on the floor of what looks like a building site, cables hanging above her head, an unopened box to her right, and what appears to be an upturned sofa to her left. “Excuse the mess,” she says, adjusting her laptop on the bare wooden floorboards of her newish home in Copenhagen as we video call at the end of 2023. “I moved in a year ago but I haven’t really been home, so now I’m renovating it all. I’ve been living in a suitcase,” she sighs.
De Casier spent most of last year either touring her Dua Lipa-approved suite of 1990s and 00s-inspired R&B opuses, writing songs for others, or working on her forthcoming third album, Still, which features input from Blood Orange and Shygirl. It’s the completion of the album that means she is not just physically in limbo, but mentally, too. “I’ve been a mess lately, actually,” she says. “Before I release anything I get cold feet about releasing it. When you start making music you have this feeling of: ‘Oh, this is great, and it’s fresh,’ and then after a while you get critical about everything. So I’m in that stage.”
The worrywart on screen feels at odds with the braggadocio swagger De Casier exudes as an artist. On the cover of Still, the 33-year-old is a leather-clad superstar in a hall of mirrors being chased by paparazzi; in her songs she channels the sultry confidence of Aaliyah and the other R&B, hip-hop and UK garage superstars she used to study on MTV as a teenager; while her album titles are Greatest Hits-esque flexes such as 2019’s debut, Essentials, which inspired Lipa to get in touch to remix her Physical single, and 2021’s critically lauded follow-up, Sensational. Even Still’s title was inspired by the never knowingly humble J-Lo and Dr Dre. “It’s funny as I haven’t been around that much to say: ‘Oh, I’m still here,’” she says, “but it’s my way of keeping things light. I was going through different titles like Platinum, but I thought that was maybe too much.”
It was around Sensational that De Casier also invented an alter ego, Bianka, who debuted in the video for the single Polite. Bianka was a way of moving closer to that projected bolshiness. “It was just me with a wig on, but it helped me deal with the pressure – plus you don’t have to be yourself all the time,” De Casier explains. While she’s not what you would call exuberant now – her answers often trail off into the ether, while compliments are awkwardly welcomed with a quiet “Thank you” – she’s making steps in the right direction. “I don’t know if Bianka will be back,” she says. “I don’t need her at the moment.” She sits upright, flattening out her light-blue fleece, as if making an announcement. “I don’t have to be somebody else any more. I’m a person who has a lot of different sides to me.”
One of those sides is as pop’s most sought-after songwriter. Last year she co-wrote four of the six tracks on the second EP from hugely popular K-pop girlband NewJeans. Released in July, Get Up sold more than 1.65m copies worldwidein a week and beat the Barbie soundtrack to No 1 in the US. The call to collaborate came completely out of the blue. “To be honest, I didn’t know who it was,” laughs De Casier. “I read the email and was like: ‘NewJeans? Who is that?’ So then I looked them up and thought it sounded pretty fresh. They asked me if I’d listened to K-pop and I had to be honest and say: ‘No, I haven’t,’ and they were like: ‘Perfect!’ They have their antennae out and they’re trying different things.” Rather than simply utilising De Casier’s way with a catchy hook, songs such as Super Shy (more than 390m Spotify plays and counting) sound exactly like De Casier records: all tactile, softly sung R&B, liquid drum’n’bass plus a gift for tender introspection housed in a club setting. “People were writing to me: ‘Is this you singing?’ and I’m like: ‘Nope,’” she says. “I find it flattering that they liked the sound and they kept it the way it was.”
Born in Portugal to a Belgian mother and Cape Verdean father, De Casier credits her humility to Denmark, the country she moved to when she was eight with her mother and younger brother. “It’s a part of me,” she says, referring to janteloven, the Scandinavian trait of not wanting to stand out. “It feels unnatural to talk about myself.” When she first moved to the small town of Ribe, she was unable to speak Danish. She and her brother were also ostracised for being the only mixed-race children in their school. De Casier found solace in MTV, both in the music’s universal language and because she could see people with the same skin tone.
As she got older she started to dabble in music production on her computer and would borrow CDs by the likes of Destiny’s Child and Erykah Badu from the local library. Her hushed, introspective vocal style was honed more out of necessity than anything else; she would often sing at night and didn’t want to disturb her flatmates. Music was never meant to be a career, however. “I was thinking about going to art school and I was thinking about medicine. Then I wanted to be a psychologist. That’s a plan B for me.” She still has trouble calling herself a musician today, three albums in. “I have a lot of impostor syndrome. I don’t know if you ever do something and think: ‘Yep, I’m a musician.’”

But it’s in the music she creates, often as sole songwriter and producer, that De Casier can dismiss any misgivings and tap into her id. On the Sensational highlight Polite she scolds a date for being rude, while Still’s loose album-long concept of charting a relationship from hot-and-heavy beginnings to messy endings is anchored by the slinky Ooh, which finds De Casier breathily describing fantasies and dishing out come-ons. My Day Off, meanwhile, is both a nod to her hectic schedule and a newfound sense of being able to say no. “I didn’t feel like answering any emails or messages,” she says of the song, which also mentions the very un-R&B topic of catching up on laundry. “I was just being a brat on that song – it’s like: ‘I just need a day off.’”
Days off are going to be few and far between in 2024. Still will be followed by more touring and more songwriting for others, while songs for album four are already taking shape. But, for now, all of that is at the back of De Casier’s constantly whirring mind. “I’m not hearing back from the builders, I don’t have a kitchen, I’m living in a building site,” she sighs, looking around at the dusty detritus. “We’re in my living room where I’ve knocked down a wall,” she says, before clarifying: “I didn’t do that myself.” It turns out there are some things she can’t do.
Still is released on 21 February."
4VSFQLCFQU_AXG3N4KJ7DDKG01,‘The EPA needs to humble itself’: why some US non-profits are turning down agency funds,_,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/26/epa-grants-requirements-nonprofit-pollution-communities,"Bella Romero Academy, a K-8 school, sits 1,200ft from a fracking site in Greeley, Colorado.
Air on the playground is often thick with benzene – a chemical that can cause dizziness and headaches in the short term, and blood illnesses like leukemia with long-term exposure. In 2019, independent researchers found that benzene spiked above healthy levels 113 times there in a seven-month period.
Local advocates wanted to monitor the air quality outside the school to help administrators figure out the safest times to let the kids play outside. “Most of these sites are completely unmonitored,” said Micah Parkin, the executive director of the non-profit 350 Colorado.
She applied for an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) grant aimed at helping communities monitor their own air quality and was thrilled when her organization was selected to receive roughly $500,000.
But Parkin and her colleagues quickly ran into hurdles. The EPA wanted her team to hold a competitive bidding process to find a local partner, even though 350 Colorado had already identified one: the air-quality monitoring firm Boulder Air. They also demanded financial information that Parkin said would require 350 Colorado to overhaul its accounting and reporting procedures. These processes required time and resources that 350 Colorado, with an annual budget of under $1m, simply didn’t have.
In late 2023, after months of conference calls and untold amounts of paperwork, Parkin and her board made the difficult decision to turn down the money. “I kept saying: ‘Let’s just get this done – come on, people.’” she recalled. “But it became clear to me that there was no end in sight.”
The Biden administration has made unprecedented commitments to environmental justice, with tens of millions in funding meant to tackle problems like air pollution and unsafe drinking water that disproportionately affect low-income communities and communities of color. Grants like the one Parkin applied for are part of an effort to direct 40% of the funds from certain federal investments to “disadvantaged communities”. (At Bella Romero, 90% of the mostly Hispanic student body qualifies for school lunch assistance.)
These efforts have drawn in dozens of first-time EPA grantees, like Colorado 350, but some of those groups say the grants come with too many conditions to make them truly accessible.
“I think we’re in a period of growing pains,” said Jay Benforado, a retired EPA official. “To provide community organizations and small NGOs federal grants requires a change in supporting infrastructure.”
Near Denver, the community organization Cultivando also turned down a half-million dollar grant to monitor pollution in a largely Hispanic community near a petroleum refinery. The group had previously found high levels of radioactive particles and PM2.5, which is associated with increased incidence of respiratory problems, among other problems.
Cultivando had planned to hire Boulder Air, the same air-quality consulting firm that Colorado 350 intended to work with. But like Colorado 350, Cultivando wasn’t equipped to carry out the competitive bidding process required before they sign on Boulder Air, executive director Olga Gonzalez said.
“I was actually shocked that they didn’t know more” about how community-based organizations operate, she said. “The EPA needs to really humble itself and think about what it means to partner with community-led efforts.”
While other small organizations found ways to meet the requirements, they can understand why some of their peers have given up.
“The [EPA has] released an insane amount of money without updating the process by which that money is distributed,” said Christian Poulsen, a policy analyst for the Seattle-based Duwamish River community coalition. Poulsen said his organization, which is slightly smaller than Colorado 350, relied on previous experience with federal grants to successfully navigate this one, but said the process is taxing nonetheless. “So most community-based organizations are ill-positioned to capture that money and that benefit for our communities,” he said.
Most community groups have accepted funding. Of 132 organizations who were awarded grants to measure air quality, only five, including Colorado 350 and Cultivando, have withdrawn from the program. In its response to the Guardian, the EPA’s press secretary, Remmington Belford, said the agency had offered “extensive support” to both groups, and said it would continue to work with both organizations in the future on potential funding opportunities.
The EPA, together with the Department of Energy, is funding 16 environmental justice technical assistance centers throughout the country which, among other things, will help small non-profits comply with federal grant requirements. In the meantime, Belford said, it’s also trying to screen grant applicants more carefully, so it can “really probe applicant readiness to take on the responsibilities involved in managing larger federal awards”.
Benforado, the retired EPA innovation officer, said he believes the attrition rate with this program has likely been higher than normal, because the federal government has deliberately tried to partner with underserved communities that have little or no experience receiving federal grants. He and two other ex-officials are working with the Environmental Protection Network to host a free, monthly webinar where they offer advice on the EPA grant process. He said 30 to 40 people tune in each month.
For organizations that have been able to meet EPA requirements, the grants have been a boon to localized research. We Act, an environmental justice organization based in Harlem, is using funds to enlist residents to place small air sensors on their fire escapes and in their homes. They’re collecting baseline data on air pollution in the Upper Manhattan neighborhood before congestion pricing goes into effect below 60th street this spring. (We Act is concerned the move will push drivers – and pollution – into Harlem.)
“Oftentimes we don’t get the opportunity to craft our own data to make some of the cases that we need to make,” said Manuel Salgado, a research analyst at We Act. “This gives us a way to do that.” He said data from small air sensors will help the organization advocate for policies to alleviate pollution in Harlem, like bringing congestion pricing uptown and restricting new parking facilities.
In Colorado, Parkin said her organization remains committed to Bella Romero Academy. Another local institution may take over air-quality monitoring there – and 350 Colorado will support that project if it comes to fruition, she said.
Gonzalez said she hopes other small organizations like hers will have better success working with the EPA in the future. “Maybe we had to be the guinea pig for them to do better on the next round,” she said, “if there is a next round.”"
4VXBSI6BF4_MXTLDC5A2IY0ZBN,Qatar accuses Netanyahu of deliberately obstructing Gaza mediation efforts,Bethan McKernan,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/25/qatar-accuses-benjamin-netanyahu-deliberately-obstructing-gaza-mediation-efforts,"Qatar has harshly criticised Israel’s prime minister, accusing Benjamin Netanyahu of deliberately obstructing ceasefire and hostage release negotiations with Hamas for personal political gain.
Doha’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Majed al-Ansari, said on Wednesday night that his government was “appalled” by leaked remarks allegedly made by Netanyahu in which he criticised the country’s mediation efforts over the war in Gaza, adding that the Israeli leader’s comments were “irresponsible and destructive” but “not surprising”.
“If the reported remarks are found to be true, the Israeli PM would only be obstructing and undermining the mediation process, for reasons that appear to serve his political career instead of prioritising saving innocent lives, including Israeli hostages,” Ansari wrote on X, formerly Twitter.
Netanyahu’s office is yet to issue a response in the public spat, which threatens to complicate the already arduous negotiations on aid, a ceasefire and the release of approximately 130 hostages believed to still be in captivity in the Gaza Strip.
At least 20 people were killed and 150 wounded while waiting for the distribution of aid in Gaza City, local authorities said on Thursday, as fierce fighting continues to rage across the besieged coastal territory. Hamas blamed Israel for the attack. The Israel Defense Forces did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
On Thursday, Israel’s far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, fanned the flames with a post on X accusing Qatar of being responsible for the 7 October Hamas attack, calling the Gulf state the “patron of Hamas” and “a country that supports terrorism and finances terrorism”.
Ansari’s statement came in response to recordings of Netanyahu’s closed-door meeting with family members of hostages earlier this week obtained by Israel’s Channel 12, in which he reportedly said Qatar’s role in the mediation process was “problematic”.
The prime minister allegedly told the relatives he had intentionally not thanked Doha for its efforts to date and that he had expressed anger towards the US, Israel’s most important ally, for deciding to keep a military base in the semi-democratic oil state.
“Qatar in my opinion is no different, in essence, from the UN. It is no different, in essence, from the Red Cross, and in some ways it is even more problematic,” he said. “I am prepared to use any actor at the moment that will help me get [the hostages] home. I haven’t any illusions about [Qatar]. They have leverage.”
Israel has long maintained that international organisations such as the UN are biased against it. Doha in recent years has carved out a role as international mediator in conflicts such as Ukraine, Sudan and Afghanistan, as well as in previous rounds of fighting in Gaza. It has deep ties to Hamas and hosts several members of its political wing.
Qatar, along with Egypt and the US, has served as a leading mediator in the three-month war in Gaza sparked by Hamas’s attack on Israel in which 1,140 people were killed and about 250 taken hostage. Israel’s offensive, which it says will completely eradicate the Palestinian militant group, has killed more than 25,700 people and displaced about 85% of the strip’s 2.3 million population from their homes.
Qatar was critical in securing a week-long truce in November in which more than 100 hostages were released in return for 240 women and children held in Israeli jails.
Numerous rounds of negotiations have since faltered. The current deal under review is believed to include a 30-day pause in fighting, during which the remaining Israeli hostages would be freed in several instalments, but the parties are far from agreeing more permanent steps to end the conflict.
Recent diplomatic efforts have been overshadowed by the heaviest fighting in Gaza this year, centred on the southern city of Khan Younis, which the Israeli army said on Wednesday it had “encircled” after two days of airstrikes and fierce ground fighting.
Khan Younis’s three hospitals had been cut off by the fighting, Médecins Sans Frontières and the Palestine Red Crescent said. On Wednesday, a centre in the city run by the UN’s agency for Palestinian refugees, where about 800 people had sought shelter, was hit by shelling, according to the agency’s director. Twelve people were killed and 75 injured, with medical teams unable to access the building.
Israel denied its forces were responsible for the attack.
Support for the war remains high among Israelis, but opinion polls show lagging support for Netanyahu and his far-right coalition. Weekly Saturday night rallies demanding the release of hostages have been supplemented in recent weeks by growing calls for elections.
Tuesday’s killing of 21 Israeli soldiers who were mining buildings for demolition and were hit by grenade fire – the deadliest single incident for Israeli forces in the conflict to date – has fuelled public dissent.
On Wednesday night, traffic on a major motorway was briefly blocked as thousands of people attended a protest in Tel Aviv organised by women’s advocacy groups to demand an immediate government proposal for a new deal to free the hostages."
4YV4ATB42H_ACQ2A7RNNOGB9YH,Nikki Haley chases upset in bitter New Hampshire face-off with Trump,Lauren Gambino,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/23/new-hampshire-presidential-primary-nikki-haley-donald-trump,"New Hampshire held its primary on Tuesday, seen by many as the last chance for Republicans to stop Donald Trump seizing their presidential nomination a third time. Would voters stand by the former president, the winner in Iowa, or would they put Nikki Haley in striking distance or even hand her a win?
Trump led polling by double digits but was considered vulnerable in a state where independents make up nearly 40% of the electorate and can vote in party primaries. Balancing that, on Sunday Ron DeSantis, the hard-right Florida governor, left the race to Haley – but endorsed Trump.
In 2016, New Hampshire propelled Trump to the nomination. Eight years later, eight days after a record Iowa victory, another big win would effectively extinguish Haley. The former South Carolina governor staked her candidacy on New Hampshire, attempting to convince voters she is best placed to beat Joe Biden in November.
“We’ve come a long way in these 11 months,” Haley’s campaign manager, Betsy Ankney, said in a “state of the race” memo.
“We started at 2% [support]. We started with zero dollars in the bank. No one thought we had a shot … And here we are, $50m raised, over 200 stops, and 12 fellas [failed male candidates] later, and Nikki’s still standing.”
Trump’s campaign released its own memo, aides Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles predicting Haley’s efforts would only win an “aggressive – and bloody” campaign for “First Place Loser”, against the vanquished DeSantis.
In the first official results, all six voters in Dixville Notch picked Haley in a traditional midnight primary, a contest once seen as a bellwether for predicting the nominee. So, later in Concord, did Martin Janoschek, a Republican-leaning independent.
“I know she’s a long shot,” said Janoschek, 57 and unemployed. “I think she’s a pretty common-sensical person, from what I heard.”

If it came down to Trump or Biden in the November general election, Janoschek said, he would probably vote for the former president over the current one.
In Nashua, at Bicentennial elementary school, voters came and went. At the snowy entrance, a few people waved signs.
Rita Case, 78 and a retired IT worker, said she had wanted to vote for DeSantis. “I like the things DeSantis believes in, and there would not be the chaos and division that might come with Bozo, whose mouth is his worst enemy,” she said, referring ungraciously to Trump.
But she switched to Trump anyway, explaining: “He can keep people in their place and take care of the border and not let other countries walk all over us. The chaos and the ‘Uh, well’ comes in second.”
Escorted by her prize supporter, the Republican governor, Chris Sununu, Haley has traveled the state from the “suburbs to the seacoast”. Trump had been seen less widely: facing 91 criminal charges, attempts to keep him off the ballot for inciting an insurrection and assorted civil lawsuits, he held New Hampshire rallies between court appearances in Washington and New York.
For much of her near-year-long campaign, Haley, 51, avoided direct confrontation, seeking instead to draw implicit contrasts with calls for a “new generation” of leaders and proposing cognitive tests for older politicians such as Biden, who is 81, but also Trump, who is 77. In the final days, Haley went after Trump more aggressively, questioning his mental fitness.
Trump responded with insults and misrepresentations, accusing his former UN ambassador of relying on “globalists” and liberals. He also revived a “birtherism” lie which claims Haley is ineligible for president because her parents were not US citizens when she was born. Born in South Carolina to parents from India, Haley is eligible. Trump also appeared to mock Haley by referring to (and misspelling) her given name, Nimarata. Haley has always used her middle name, Nikki.
Many New Hampshire voters complained that the campaign mostly played out in TV ads and mailshots as millions were spent. Some voters said they received up to 10 pieces of literature each day. In Manchester, the night before the primary, Haley told her audience: “You’re excited because you won’t have to watch any more commercials. You won’t have to see the mail and the text messages will stop.”
The flood is about to consume another state. Haley scheduled a rally for North Charleston, South Carolina, for Wednesday. It was set to be accompanied by $4m in television, radio and digital advertising.
“We don’t believe in coronations in this country,” Haley told Fox News. “I’m in this for the long haul.”
Trump dominates South Carolina polling, however.
Democrats were also holding a New Hampshire primary on Tuesday, if without Biden on the ballot after the party tried to start its contest in South Carolina. Voters chose between Dean Phillips, a congressman from Minnesota, and Marianne Williamson, an author and self-help guru. Biden supporters urged voters to write in the president’s name.
At a high-school in Windham, Phillips chatted with Theresa Arangio. Later, she said she wavered between Biden and Phillips, before Phillips won her over.
Arangio, 81, said: “President Biden, I really think he’s done a great job. I really like him. But, you know, the age is a factor. And with Trump, I’m just afraid. I don’t want four more years of him. I just don’t for our country.”
In Concord, AhLana Ames, 23 and a law student, said she did not vote for a person but for a word: “Ceasefire”. She had taken part in a campaign to write in the term, in protest of Biden’s support for Israel’s war in Gaza.
“I’m against war in general,” Ames said. “I don’t think what’s going on in Israel is particularly just. I’m not particularly pleased with how Joe Biden is handling it, but wanted to vote Democratic.”
Saying she planned to move to Pennsylvania, a swing state Biden will probably need in the general election, Ames conceded she would probably support him.
“I just know I’ll never vote for a Republican,” she said."
561P60A488_8HS1ZVFILZTQFVY,"As petals rained down and celebrities beamed, Modi unveiled his vision of a Hindu India",Mukul Kesavan,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/22/modi-ram-temple-hindu-right-project,"The inauguration of the Ram temple in Ayodhya, the small north Indian city that Hindus believe as a matter of faith to be the birthplace of Lord Ram, a Hindu deity, is both a milestone in republican India’s history and a sideshow.
It is a milestone because the prime minister of a nominally secular republic, Narendra Modi, was the master of ceremonies at this event. In just over 30 years, India’s political class has travelled from condemning the demolition of the mosque, on the site of which the half-built temple now stands, as an act of sectarian vandalism, to celebrating it as the first act in the re-founding of a hitherto rootless republic. The idol of the infant Ram installed in a temple raised on the site of a razed mosque is to be the icon of this new Hindu nation.
It is a sideshow, because the movement to build a Hindu temple at Ayodhya was never an end in itself; it was a means to an end, the public assertion of Hindu supremacy over India’s religious minorities, particularly its Muslims. The Bharatiya Janata party’s campaign for the Ram temple was a lever used to prise apart the institutional safeguards that protected India’s nominally secular democracy.
In this, the BJP has succeeded. Its vanguard role in the destruction of the Babri Masjid mosque made it, by the end of the 20th century, the pan-Indian party of Hindu grievance. The killing of Ram temple activists in a railway train in 2002 (31 Muslim men were convicted of setting fire to the train) and the pogrom of Muslims that followed, gave Modi, then chief minister of Gujarat, the chance to stand out as the hammer of the Hindus. In his political persona, the sacred symbolism of the temple and the profane satisfaction of violently showing minorities their place were joined.
It is this coming together that was celebrated in the spectacle today at Ayodhya. The names of the main guests at the idol-installation ritual, published in full-page newspaper advertisements, were a clue to the political theatre the public could expect. It was a shortlist of the principal figures of the Hindu nationalist right: prime minister Modi, Mohan Bhagwat, the chief of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), Yogi Adityanath, the militant Hindu monk who is the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh (UP) and in the running to be Modi’s successor, and Anandiben Patel, the BJP governor of UP.
These were the only four public figures present in the sanctum when the ritual of consecration was performed. Modi was front and centre; ostensibly he was only one of the yajamanas, the ritual patrons on whose behalf the ritual was being performed, but for the camera he was the One. Interestingly, the only person who got to share the frame with Modi through most of the ritual was Bhagwat. This was appropriate, because for his organisation, the RSS, this moment of Hindu triumphalism has been nearly a century in the making. Founded in 1925 to forge a Hindu nation, the RSS is both Modi’s and the BJP’s parent organisation. Bhagwat was there in his role as the political Hindu’s paterfamilias.
The idol that was consecrated was just 51 inches tall, deliberately smaller than an adult male because the Ram of this temple is a child. The symbolism of Modi’s part in the ritual was obvious: he was the Hindu regent who ruled on behalf of this beatific infant. And since the child will never grow up, Modi’s regency will endure.
Outside the sanctum, the campus of the half-built temple was crowded with an invited audience made up of religious ascetics, members of hardline Hindu organisations such as the Bajrang Dal and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, early adopters of the temple cause and celebrities from the worlds of business and cinema. The billionaire industrialist Mukesh Ambani and his family were there, as were film stars such as Amitabh Bachchan, Rajinikanth, Chiranjeevi, Madhuri Dixit, Hema Malini, Alia Bhatt, Ranbir Kapoor, Ayushmann Khurrana and Vicky Kaushal. One breathless television anchor gushed about Ayodhya becoming “celeb central”. Whether they knew it or not, these celebrities were there in a dual capacity, or, to put it in terms they would understand, in a double role: as devotees of Ram and as extras for Modi.
The rows of chairs stuffed with celebrities, the music on the public address system, the helicopters sprinkling petals overhead – the occasion recalled, in an odd, incomplete way, India’s Republic Day parade, minus, of course, the parade. The half-built temple served to remind viewers that Bhagwat and Modi’s Hindu Rashtra (Hindu nation) is a work in progress, that more of the same will follow. But in the end, this tableau that celebrated the resurgence of a new Ram-centred nation was important not for the citizens present, but for those who were absent by design – every Indian who wasn’t a political Hindu.
In this season of Donald Trump, it’s worth remembering that the ethno-nationalism that the temple at Ayodhya embodies isn’t the handiwork of an erratic, populist tycoon; it is a century-old political project backed by militant cadres that number in the millions. The India (or Bharat) that Modi and Bhagwat envision is more like Netanyahu’s Israel, only on a subcontinental scale; as majoritarian and as intolerant.

She’s an artist not a service industry worker, 19 January), at the risk of sounding like an old fart, how can it be acceptable for Madonna to start a concert two hours late, causing great inconvenience to concert-goers (whatever they paid for their tickets), when a full symphony orchestra of dozens of musicians is seldom more than a few minutes late? When did the expectation that a concert begin on time become a “misplaced sense of entitlement”?Jane Gillon Oakham, Rutland
So some people have a problem with the artist turning up late (Is Madonna tardiness lawsuit death knell to rock’n’roll behaviour?, 19 January)? They should have tried following Johnny “I’ve never missed a gig in my life” Thunders around London in the 1980s. The ticket would say “Doors open 8pm”; at about 10pm we’d be thinking if he doesn’t turn up soon we’ll miss the last tube home, and on one occasion he appeared on stage at 2am – which meant the early tubes were just starting up by the time he’d finished. Not to mention the legendary Limelight club gig where after 20 minutes he walked off stage and headed for New York. We wouldn’t have expected anything less.Warren BrownIlkley, West Yorkshire
Michael Fellows and Jonathan Hadden, who have filed a lawsuit against Madonna, should count themselves lucky; had they been fans of the Fall they would have witnessed some proper disruptive behaviour, courtesy of Mark E Smith. Once, after waiting two hours to see the band, they played for 20 minutes while Smith lambasted the audience from behind the speakers, called everyone a C-word and left the building.

57YRL2J5YZ_97DPYPW3NSAKO97,How Winston Churchill became a mascot for anti-woke warriors,Zoe Williams,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/22/how-winston-churchill-became-a-mascot-for-anti-woke-warriors,"‘Success is not final, failure is not fatal; it is the courage to continue that counts,” Ron DeSantis said, as he pulled out of the race to lead the Republican party. It was a strange way to announce that what counts – the continuing bit – is the thing you don’t have. Also, it is quite contestable, for such a short statement; failure isn’t necessarily fatal, but it does depend on what you have failed at. Still, what set most pedants afire wasn’t the substance but the attribution: DeSantis said it was Winston Churchill; the International Churchill Society disagreed. Meh, let’s not split hairs. It is a sort of obvious notion, made of words, so it is surely the kind of thing Churchill would have said, had he said it.
This is my favourite kind of Churchill-eering, where politicians summon his ghost simply by adopting similar rhetoric. Penny Mordaunt’s fabulous “Stand up and fight! Stand up and fight!” before going on to add, “Never forget those who went before us and remember that without a Churchill, you can’t have a Zelenskiy” during her speech to last year’s Tory conference was a classic of the genre: a pitch-perfect throwback to “We shall fight on the beaches”, having first removed the beaches, the landing grounds, the fields, the streets, the hills, any obvious enemy, any clear sense of what was being defended and any endgame. Churchill here stands in as an all-purpose fighty-man, and as such wouldn’t make much of a cultural export, since everyone’s history has those.
It took Boris Johnson to repackage Churchill for an international audience, not so much with his book, The Churchill Factor, as in his strategically idiotic attack on Barack Obama in 2016. He was mayor of London then, when the most he could screw up was planning on the Vauxhall gyratory which, to be fair, quickly cohered as a literal and figurative shrine to the emptiness of late capitalism, and is probably the most coherent thing he ever did. But in his downtime, he wrote a column for the Sun, enraged that Obama had moved a bust of Churchill out of the Oval Office (a full seven years previously), contending that the “part-Kenyan president” was motivated by anti-colonialism, “ancestral dislike” of the British empire. To follow the logic, Johnson, having German heritage, would also have reason to dislike Churchill, but he is not doing logic, he is focusing on Obama’s race, which I feel Obama should have met with unending hellfire, rather than a mild: “No, we just moved Churchill to a different corridor.”
Too late to worry about that now: Churchill, in Johnson’s new frame, stood not only for nostalgia, a comforting world order with the posh at the top, but also for white supremacy and colonial brutality as an essential part of that past. Winston was now a mascot for the anti-woke warriors, the embodiment of their core principles: the past is better than the present; the world makes more sense with the posh at the top, just listen to their lovely cadence; the dicey bits – racist exploitation and carnage – are expiated by nostalgia (it was all a long time ago) and implicitly celebrated by it (weren’t things better then?), and anyone who disagrees hates their country.
It makes no sense as an export, least of all to the US, which had made its feelings plain about the yoke of the British empire 99 years before Churchill was born. It doesn’t even make much sense as a British narrative, which had previously been happy to dial down Churchill’s imperialism, concentrating on its more nuanced expressions, and use him mainly as the totem of Britain’s successful fight against fascism. In Johnson’s revision, Churchill the Coloniser is as valorised as Churchill the anti-Nazi. Its nonsensical nature is why it’s the perfect cultural export: stripped of all meaning, just some loud, posh vibes, caricatured to the point where you can’t remember what the original looks like, political rhetoric’s answer to Saltburn.
Loth as I am to get into combat about who knows Churchill the best, between me, Johnson and DeSantis, we all know this, right? He was a lot of things, but he wasn’t stupid; he would have hated this. He would be turning in his grave.

5CBOADMY7W_HFCZRFGTJ1RIQSD,Elon Musk visits Auschwitz after uproar over antisemitic messages on X,_,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/22/elon-musk-visits-auschwitz-antisemitism-twitter-x,"Elon Musk, who has endorsed antisemitic conspiracy theories and been criticized for allowing antisemitic messages on X, formerly Twitter, visited the site of the Nazi death camp Auschwitz-Birkenau on Monday.
Musk’s visit at the most notorious site of the horrors of the Holocaust came before a scheduled appearance later that day at a conference on antisemitism organized by the European Jewish Association in the nearby Polish city of Krakow.
Musk was photographed visiting the Birkenau site together with Daily Wire podcaster Ben Shapiro, who was also set to attend the EJA conference. Birkenau is a village near Oswiecim, in southern Poland, fenced off with barbed wire, where wooden barracks for the prisoners and the ruins of a gas chamber endure as evidence of Nazi crimes, and where a monument to the victims stands. International ceremonies are held there each year.
“Before Elon Musk’s arrival to the European Jewish Association conference, he took part in a private visit to Auschwitz-Birkenau with EJA chairman Rabbi Menachem Margolin, Ben Shapiro and Holocaust survivor Gidon Lev. Musk laid a wreath at the wall of death and took part in a short memorial ceremony and service by the Birkenau memorial,” the EJA said in an email.
Musk was set to discuss antisemitism online with Shapiro at the conference in Krakow, which was held before International Holocaust Remembrance Day on 27 January.
The billionaire has faced accusations from the Anti-Defamation League, a prominent Jewish civil rights organization, and others of tolerating antisemitic messages on the platform formerly known as Twitter since purchasing it in 2022. He sparked an outcry in November, including from the White House, when he responded on X to a user who accused Jews of hating white people and professing indifference to antisemitism by posting, “You have said the actual truth.” He later apologized for the comment, calling it the “dumbest” post that he’s ever done.
Several big brands, including Disney and IBM, stopped advertising on the platform last year after liberal advocacy group Media Matters found that their ads were appearing alongside pro-Nazi content and white nationalist posts. X has since sued Media Matters, saying the Washington-based nonprofit manufactured the report to “drive advertisers from the platform and destroy X Corp”.
More than 1.1 million people were murdered by the Nazis and their henchmen at Auschwitz during the second world war. Most who were killed were Jews, but the victims also included Poles, Roma, Soviet prisoners of war, queer people, and others. In all, about 6 million European Jews died during the Holocaust. When the Soviets liberated the camp, they found about 7,000 survivors."
5DVBCM3582_1XELLRG1W0NYKHM,Trump campaign blocks NBC journalist from New Hampshire event,Sam Levine,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/22/trump-campaign-blocks-nbc-reporter-vaughn-hillyard,"Donald Trump’s presidential campaign reportedly blocked an NBC News journalist from covering campaign events in New Hampshire on Sunday.
Sunday’s exclusion of the NBC News correspondent Vaughn Hillyard came when he was set to serve as a pool reporter. Instead of having a pack of reporters follow a candidate everywhere, campaigns will often allow television, print and radio news organizations to send a single pool reporter to travel with them – and those reporters in turn then send a readout to other news outlets.
But on Sunday, Hillyard wrote in an email to the pool: “Your pooler was told that if he was the designated pooler by NBC News that the pool would be cut off for the day.”
The email, which was subsequently published by several news organizations, added: “After affirming to the campaign that your pooler would attend the events, NBC News was informed at about 2.20pm that the pool would not be allowed to travel with Trump today.”
Hillyard a day earlier had pressed the New York congresswoman Elise Stefanik – said to be a potential Trump running mate – on whether she believed the ex-president had sexually assaulted E Jean Carroll.
NBC News and Steven Cheung, a Trump campaign spokesperson, did not immediately return a request for comment.
Cheung told the New York Times the campaign does not “bar reporters based on their reporting”, and the campaign’s pool system was an informal one. The Times also said Hillyard was allowed to attend an event later on Sunday in New Hampshire.
Despite the Trump campaign’s denial that Hillyard’s exclusion Sunday was retaliatory, the former president has a long history of trying to retaliate against news organizations for their coverage by trying to block them from continuing to cover him.
In 2016, when he won his lone term in the Oval Office, his campaign refused to credential several news organizations for rallies that had been critical of him.
In 2019, the campaign banned Bloomberg News reporters from covering his rallies after the organization announced it would not investigate Michael Bloomberg, who was running for the Democratic nomination, or his other Democratic rivals.
As president, Trump attempted to revoke the press pass of the CNN host Jim Acosta who became known for asking pointed questions during press briefings.

A jury last year found Trump sexually abused and defamed Carroll.
There is now an ongoing trial over how much Trump should have to pay in damages for separate defamatory comments he made in 2019, setting the stage for Hillyard’s questions to Stefanik about the case.
“How do you grapple with standing by his side while a jury is debating how much to award E Jean Carroll for being sexually abused by Donald Trump?” Hillyard asked Stefanik. Stefanik replied that this was an example of a “witch-hunt” and how “the media is so biased”.
“You don’t believe E Jean Carroll?” Hillyard responded. “It’s not me! It’s not the media! It’s a jury that found that he sexually abused.”
The Carroll trial is separate from more than 90 criminal charges pending against Trump in various jurisdictions."

However, any tinkering of the agreed-to stage-three package sets the stage for a bitter political brawl with the opposition to claim a broken election promise.
Ahead of a cabinet meeting on Tuesday Albanese, promised that “everyone will be getting a tax cut”, comments that MPs noted did not rule out making the stage-three tax cuts less generous for some.

Labor’s caucus will meet in Canberra on Wednesday to give input into the economic plan, before Albanese’s address to the National Press Club on Thursday.
Media reports late Tuesday claimed cabinet had agreed to the changes.
The Australian Financial Review reported the changes would see the 37% tax rate maintained, which is now slated to be abolished under the legislated plan, but that it would be applied from a higher income level than current tax rates. This would mean some higher income earners would receive a smaller tax cut than legislated. The AFR also reported the plan would include increasing the Low-Income Tax Offset for those earning up to $50,000. The Sydney Morning Herald was reporting Albanese had secured cabinet agreement to offer bigger tax cuts to workers who earn up to about $150,000 a year.
A spokesperson for the prime minister would not confirm or deny these claims.
Meanwhile, business groups issued a last-ditch warning ahead of the meeting that modifying the stage three tax cuts – which flatten the tax brackets for those earning between $45,000 to $200,000 – would “undeniably dent the government’s credibility and damage the prospect” of future tax reform.
But government sources indicated Labor could deflect accusations of a broken promise by guaranteeing the full value of the tax cuts but with a fairer distribution, offering “substantial” cost-of-living relief, particularly to middle-income earners.
The government had rejected a report that it will lift the tax-free threshold while retaining the highest tax bracket at $180,000 instead of lifting it to $200,000 but has not ruled out other changes.
“I support tax cuts and everyone will be getting a tax cut,” Albanese said on Tuesday.

“Middle Australia particularly is doing it really tough … people who have a mortgage. So we’re looking at ways in which we can provide assistance to them.”
Julian Hill, a Labor MP and convener of the left faction, said he “warmly welcomes” the prime minister’s commitment, and people in his community will be “delighted” to hear it.
“We’ll thrash out the best way to provide relief when the government meets [on Wednesday],” Hill said.
Some Labor MPs are concerned about backlash from aspirational middle income voters and the Coalition campaign about broken promises hurting in marginal seats, particularly in Western Australia.
But even some frontline MPs privately acknowledge although reforms will be weaponised, that it is a debate Labor must have to fund greater relief for those struggling to keep up with increased prices, particularly of rent and mortgages.
“Surely there is capacity for a sensible government to tweak the tax cuts appropriately,” one MP said. “There are a lot of people who need it more than income earners on politicians’ wages.”
The Australian National University’s associate professor Ben Phillips, a member of the government’s Economic Inclusion Advisory Committee, said that $2bn a year could be saved by keeping the top tax bracket at $180,000 and lifting the tax free threshold to $20,000.
But this would provide a worker just $380 a year income tax relief, and would be “poorly targeted” because 40% of households who don’t pay income tax would not receive it, while many middle and higher income earners would.
He called on the government to instead keep the 37-cent tax bracket, which currently applies for income above $120,000 but would be eliminated by the stage three cuts.
“To remove the equity issue they really should be doing a much bigger change than tinkering at the bottom or top.”
In a joint statement the Australian Industry Group, Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Business Council of Australia and Minerals Council of Australia said the tax cuts – due to take effect in July – “have not only been legislated: they have won support at two general elections”.
“It is easily forgotten that the first and second stages of the 2018 reform package were skewed towards lower- and middle-income taxpayers and that the full package is much more balanced.”"
5IWC0NVPGY_3ITLKMX3JVACWTV,Telling health staff not to report women for suspected illegal abortions has firm legal basis,Haroon Siddique,_,20230122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/22/proposed-guidance-to-health-staff-not-to-report-suspected-pregnancy-termination-to-police-may-be-lawful,"The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists’ call for abortion to be decriminalised – and announcement that it will tell its members not to report women to police if they believe they may have illegally ended their pregnancies – is a significant intervention in the debate.
Concerns about the existing laws in England and Wales came to the fore last year when a woman was sentenced to more than two years in prison for procuring drugs to induce an abortion after the legal limit, which is generally 24 weeks.
The 28-month sentence, which was halved on appeal and suspended – with a judge saying it called “for compassion, not punishment” – prompted outrage and calls for a change in the law, which dates back to the Offences Against the Person Act 1861.
Carla Foster, who pleaded guilty, was said to have knowingly misled the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) by saying she was below the 10-week cut-off point for a medical abortion at home, when she believed she was about 28 weeks pregnant.
Doctors later concluded the foetus was between 32 and 34 weeks’ gestation at the time of termination. Earlier this month, another woman, Bethany Cox, was found not guilty of using drugs to bring about an illegal abortion, after prosecutors decided to offer no evidence, after a three-year investigation.
While such prosecutions are uncommon, they are growing. Between 1861 and November 2022, only three women were convicted of having an illegal abortion, but as well as the cases of Foster and Cox, three more women accused of illegal abortions are due to appear in court this year. Additionally, police investigated at least 67 cases of procuring an illegal abortion in the 10 years to April 2022.
Terminations up to 28 weeks – later reduced to 24 weeks – were legalised under the 1967 Abortion Act but only where two doctors agree that continuing the pregnancy would be risky for the physical or mental health of the woman.
The investigations into women have occurred because the 1861 law was never repealed, so anyone who has an unregulated abortion or tries to terminate their pregnancy without supervision from medics is acting unlawfully. Anyone assisting them can also be prosecuted.
By way of contrast, while Northern Ireland only legalised abortion in 2019, it removed all related criminal penalties at the same time.
RCOG, alongside the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare (FSRH), British Society of Abortion Care Providers and the Faculty of Public Health has joined campaigners and MPs in calling for a change in the “outdated and antiquated” law.
There is no general legal obligation to contact the police about a crime (for the public or healthcare professionals) so the RCOG is within its rights to actively tell its members not to do so.
The NHS code of practice governing patient-clinician confidentiality states that “staff are permitted to disclose personal information in order to prevent and support detection, investigation and punishment of serious crime”. However, serious crime is not defined and the code says “there must be either explicit patient consent or a robust public interest justification”.
There are some statutes which require disclosure to police, for example where healthcare professionals encounter cases of female genital mutilation (FGM) in girls under 18, as highlighted by RCOG. But RCOG says such instances for healthcare professionals working in women’s health are rare and, in line with the NHS code of conduct, it tells healthcare professionals they “must abide by their professional responsibility to justify any disclosure of confidential patient information or face potential fitness to practise proceedings”.
So, while what RCOG and others have said might seem radical at first glance, it has a firm basis in the law surrounding the reporting of crimes in England and Wales as well as the NHS code of practice. They are likely to have been moved to produce the guidance at this point in time because of fears that “deeply traumatised” and vulnerable women, as they put it, are increasingly being exposed to harrowing investigations and prosecutions.
Ultimately, RCOG and others believe that abortion care should be removed from criminal law and placed instead under medical regulation."
5JOZN4ZD2J_OAGNCRKVEUSBNKA,Britain’s richest 10% don’t think they’re wealthy – and that’s disastrous in the fight against inequality,Anoosh Chakelian,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/24/britain-richest-10-per-cent-wealthy-inequality-labour-private-schools,"What does it mean to be “wealthy”? It is perhaps this question more than any other that haunts British society. The public’s definition can be glimpsed in the reaction to Labour’s mansion tax idea for properties worth more than £2m in 2015, or its proposal for a 45p tax rate on earnings over £80,000 in 2019: a revolution of polite but pushy well-to-do Britons (and a Conservative election victory) never seemed to take long to follow.
Like expensive Swiss clockwork, it’s happening again. At the time of writing, more than 70,000 parents of private school pupils have signed a petition to stop Keir Starmer’s plan to charge private schools VAT. Tony Perry, an NHS data analyst on a £60k salary and leader of the Education Not Taxation: Parents Against School Fee VAT campaign – who sends his 10-year-old son to a £21,000-a-year school in Berkshire – describes himself as “a non-wealthy parent”. Go through the comments on the petition and many others chime in to protest just how wealthy they aren’t.
In reality, the median salary in the UK before tax is £34,963. And from simply the school fees perspective, beyond special educational needs places (which Labour’s VAT charge would exclude), there is no need for anyone in the UK to send their child to a private school. If parents feel so cash-strapped, they should just use our state education system, where 93% of pupils in the country are educated.
But the fact remains that many in the top 10% of earners – those on £59,200 and above – do not feel rich, and that has major societal consequences.
First, the feelings of this group matter because they are simply more likely to vote, to trust in political institutions, and to influence our laws, as the academics Gerry Mitchell and Marcos González Hernando found in their 2023 book about the top 10%, Uncomfortably Off.
Second, the nuances in public attitudes towards wealth, salary and class must be understood by our politicians because they make it very difficult for parties to pitch wealth taxes, raise taxes on higher incomes, or land attacks on wealthy individuals in public life – and they are also key to understanding something profound about the British psyche.
Question Time viewers may remember the case of an irate audience member in 2019 earning above £80,000 who assumed he wasn’t in the top 5%, or even the top 50%. Since then, I’ve been fascinated by our perceptions of wealth and have been doing my own research for the New Statesman magazine with the Redfield & Wilton Strategies polling firm on these questions. We’ve uncovered some stark views: 60% of those on £80,000-£100,000 believe they are “about average” on the income scale, for example, and a quarter of Britons paid £100,000 or more identify as “working class”.
But more generally, we have found that no matter where you sit on the scale, you generally tend to underestimate how much you earn compared with the average, and you are more likely to feel your social circle is “better off”, and yourself “worse off”. This makes particular sense in the case of the top 10%, who are often working in jobs – as lawyers, consultants, recruiters and financiers – that expose them to people far richer than themselves. In the scheme of the haves, have-nots and “have yachts”, they see themselves as the “have not yachts”. Perry voices this very bias in his interview with the Telegraph: “Charging VAT won’t hurt the wealthy students attending public schools like Winchester, where Mr [Rishi] Sunak studied. It will hurt many others, however.”
Yet perception isn’t the only thing at play. There is real inequality high up the income scale. While certainly not the most egregious economic divide in our country, the top 1% are pulling away from the top 10% at a drastic rate.
The Uncomfortably Off authors reveal that even those in the top 5% (earning £82,200 and above) are much closer to the national median than to the top 1% (£183,000 and above) – where wealth is rapidly accumulating. The Labour MP Liam Byrne’s new book, The Inequality of Wealth, details how the average wealth of an individual in the top 1% of Britain’s richest increased 31 times more than that of those in the bottom 99% between 2010 and 2021. Overall wealth in the UK rose £4tn in the same period – nearly a quarter of which went just to the top 1%.
However you feel they should spend their money, it is little wonder, then, that the Tony Perrys of Britain feel as if their lifestyle is slipping away from them. The challenge for politicians aiming for a fairer Britain is to make this section of society care about inequality in general, rather than simply who gets to afford which private school.

5K56M5R0JL_TSUOE7L93U9WYOU,Peer who praised rising temperatures appointed to climate crisis committee,Ben Quinn,_,20230122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/22/david-frost-peer-who-praised-rising-temperatures-appointed-to-climate-crisis-committee,"David Frost, the influential Conservative peer who has been criticised for claiming that rising global temperatures could be beneficial to the UK, is being appointed to a key parliamentary committee on the climate crisis.
The appointment showed that “wacky, fringe views on climate” were no longer confined to the Tory party’s extremes, Labour said.
Frost, who was Boris Johnson’s Brexit negotiator, will be appointed at the end of the month to the House of Lords select committee on environment and climate change.
The former diplomat, who became a peer in 2020, is also a trustee of the Global Warming Policy Foundation, which opposes a number of net zero environmental policies and which is funded by wealthy Tory donors. He describes the foundation as an “educational charity in this area”.
In a debate in the House of Lords last year, Frost said that rising global temperatures due to the climate crisis were “likely to be beneficial” in the UK, because it would mean fewer people would die from cold temperatures.
“At the moment, seven times as many people die from cold as from heat in Britain. Rising temperatures are likely to be beneficial,” he said.
More recently, he has been issuing veiled criticisms of Rishi Sunak from the right of the party.
A YouGov mega-poll that last week projected an election wipeout for the Tories was commissioned by Frost in collaboration with Conservative Britain Alliance, a previously unknown organisation described only as a “group of Conservative donors”, which covered the estimated £70,000 cost.
Ed Miliband, the shadow secretary of state of climate change and net zero, said Frost’s appointment showed that Sunak was trying to keep those seeking to oust him onside.
“Rishi Sunak is so weak that he has allowed this key position to go to someone who thinks the climate crisis is a good thing,” he said.
“The truth is that wacky, fringe views on climate are no longer resigned to the extreme wing of the Conservative party – they are now the official position of Rishi Sunak’s flailing government.
“By trying to keep happy those in his own party who want to oust him, Sunak is putting party above country. The result is a disastrous energy policy that will leave Britain with high energy bills, energy insecurity, and Britain left lagging behind other countries.”
Downing Street has been approached for a comment."
5K8SI6PLN7_1LYS5K481XX8F8E,Crumbling churches are ‘UK’s biggest heritage challenge’,Harriet Sherwood,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/24/thousands-churches-risk-closure-uk-heritage,"Thousands of church buildings are in such a dire state that they are facing closure, according to a campaign that says the situation is the UK’s single biggest heritage challenge. Churches, chapels and meeting houses were under threat because of a shortage of funds and expertise to maintain them, the National Churches Trust said. This was putting important community services and social spaces at risk, including food and warm banks, it added.
To save church buildings, the trust has launched Every Church Counts, a “manifesto” of six actions. They include public funding of £50m for urgent repairs; expanding the use of church buildings for community services such as food banks, nurseries, youth clubs and warm spaces; and cultural activities including concerts, exhibitions and craft fairs.
Sir Michael Palin, the trust’s vice-president, said churches were “a vital and much-loved part of the UK’s history and we need to act now to prevent the loss of tremendously important local heritage … Right now, many church buildings are in danger of closure.”
More than half of the UK’s 38,500 churches, chapels and meeting houses are listed buildings, reflecting their importance to national and local heritage. But Anglican churches face a backlog of repairs of at least £1bn, and the annual cost of maintenance repairs is estimated at £150m.
Such work is the responsibility of individual parishes but few local clergy have expertise in building management or fundraising. The trust is proposing a network of professionals to support places of worship belonging to all faiths.
About 3,500 churches in the UK have closed since 2013, while more than 900 places of worship are on Historic England’s “heritage at risk” register. In Scotland, more than 180 are officially at risk, and the Church of Scotland is considering closing up to 40% of its churches.
The National Churches Trust also recommends a drive to boost tourism, appealing to UK residents and visitors from abroad. It says churches should be open beyond services, and seven days a week where possible, to allow them to “better connect with local people and attract visitors”.
Claire Walker, the chief executive of the trust, said: “Every Church Counts offers a blueprint of how churches can be saved for the future. With hundreds facing closure, a national plan is urgently needed to help secure their future. We are calling on the government, heritage organisations and Christian denominations to work together to tackle what is the UK’s single biggest heritage challenge.
“With so many churches offering vitally important community services, from food banks to warm spaces, they provide what is in effect the UK’s national help service, crucial to the social and economic wellbeing of millions of people. Keeping churches open means that support for the vulnerable can continue, especially important in more deprived areas.”
According to a UK opinion poll carried out for the trust, 68% of adults agreed that churches, chapels and meeting houses remained an important part of the country’s heritage and history. Older people were more likely to agree than younger adults.
More than half (54%) had visited a church in the past year. More than a quarter​ visited for a religious service, including Sunday worship, weddings or funerals;​ one in five for a non-religious community activity or service such as a​ food bank, playgroup, lunch club, concert or meeting, and one in six went to a​ church, chapel or meeting house as a visitor or tourist."
5LG9ANL7QM_GSO3Y3WWXAJOOK5,Do you have text neck? How phones are affecting us physically,Tik Root,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/jan/24/text-neck-phones-physical-health,"Earlier this year, a patient came to physical therapist Theresa Marko complaining of neck pain. Marko, who is based in New York City, began the appointment as usual, asking a series of questions about her lifestyle, habits and posture. Soon, a likely culprit emerged: the woman’s cellphone.
The woman, who Marko declined to name for privacy reasons, said she typically placed her phone, or her tablet, on her lap and looked down while using it. “That’s going to cause a big strain to your neck because you’re very, very flexed forward,” said Marko.
Marko says she frequently talks to patients about how they use their phones. “I don’t think that people end up coming to physical therapy because they realize that their cellphone is a problem,” said Marko. But, as she problem solves, it often becomes a focal point.
While the mental health harms associated with smartphone use are much discussed, the physical effects can also be significant. Severe outcomes, like selfie-related injury and death, can occur but chronic issues are far more common, especially in the upper body. This year, a study used hospital data to estimate that between 2011 and 2019, hand and wrist injuries due to cellphone use nearly doubled, to about 7,300 annually.
“It feels like [phone] use just keeps going up and up and up,” said Carolyn Sommerich, the director of the engineering laboratory for human factors/ergonomics/safety at Ohio State University. While that sentiment isn’t new, Gallup polling found that the number of people who reported using their smartphone “too much” went from 39% in 2015 to 58% in 2022. At 84%, twentysomethings were the most likely to feel that way.
One study told the story of a teenager coming into a hospital with a headache, vertigo and ataxia. An MRI showed that her neck was curving in the wrong way. Doctors suspected phone use was at least partly to blame and instructed the woman to limit her touch-screen use to two hours a day.
Incidents like this have become so prevalent that the resulting issues have earned nicknames, such as “text claw” and “text neck”. Opticians have documented eye strain from blue light exposure as well. Sommerich said: “You have to recognize that you’re taxing your body, even though it wouldn’t seem obvious at first blush.”
Experts say that most of the issues arise from people keeping their bodies in unnatural positions for long periods of time. Neck muscles, for instance, don’t have to work very hard when a person’s head is balanced over their body. But when using a smartphone, users often hold their head at an angle, which results in tense muscles.
“Your head is like a bowling ball. It weighs a fair amount. It gets heavy after a while,” said Sommerich – and the same principles apply to other body parts when it comes to prolonged smartphone use. “Everything can get overused.”
Another issue is that people often hold their elbows in a V shape while using a smartphone, said Brandon Donnelly, a surgeon in New Orleans who focuses on upper extremities. That stretches the ulnar – or funny bone – nerve, which can result in numbness in the ring and pinky fingers.
“If I’m sitting on my phone at night reading in bed, my pinky finger goes numb and tells me I need to straighten my elbow out,” he said. While he says it’s rare for anyone to get to the point of needing surgery, he does regularly see people with symptoms that could be attributed to cellphone use. He added that most of the issues he sees are with adults in their 30s and 40s.
“I’m not seeing it in younger kids,” Donnelly said. “Their tissue is more pliable.”
But, he said, people of all ages can develop smartphone-related problems in their hands. For example, intense gripping can lead to pain in the meaty thenar muscles of the palm, as well as tendonitis or even tendon rupture. And in older patients, prolonged holding can aggravate arthritis, especially at the base of the thumb.
The most reliable solution to these ailments is for people to not use their phones, but most experts agree that’s not realistic.

“The best we can do is to let them know the risks so they can change their behavior,” said Gwanseob Shin, who is an ergonomics researcher at Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology in South Korea.
One of the biggest changes Shin would like to see is for people to stop using their phones while walking, a habit that increases the risk of running into obstacles like cars or other people. “You have less than a second to stop and avoid a collision,” he said. And, according to the 2023 hospital data study, falls accounted for nearly a third of all cellphone-related injuries.
Walking while using a phone also causes people to look down, putting stress not only on the neck but also the back. Shin’s research has found that neck muscle activation is roughly 21 to 42% higher when using a phone while walking, compared to sitting or standing. This is particularly true when texting compared to general browsing.
“The angle was higher when people were texting, compared to browsing or viewing websites,” said Shin. A possible (albeit theoretical) solution, he added, could be an app or phone feature that warns users when their posture is putting them at risk. “We have sufficient datasets and sensors.”
Until then, there are plenty of other steps that people can take to avoid the physical impacts of smartphone use. Adhesive handles, like PopSockets, can help keep people from clenching while holding their phones, said Donnelly. Being mindful of how bent your elbows are is critical, as is taking rest breaks, to avoid being in the same position for too long. Voice to text can also be an alternative to typing.
The most impactful change for your neck is to raise the phone to eye level. “If you’re going to be constantly on your phone you need to be looking directly at your phone,” said Jeremy James, an orthopedic surgeon in Louisiana. “That way your neck can stay in a neutral position.”
Marko, the physical therapist, is a big fan of using a stand as a way of elevating phones and other devices. That’s what she recommended to the patient who was propping her phone on her lap, and it’s starting to work.
But she knows that this won’t be her last patient with phone-related pain. “I talk about smartphones all the time,” she said."
5NSBKZ20TW_KE94RAD2WWSZO8X,"New Hampshire primary set turnout record with more than 300,000 voting",Alice Herman,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/24/new-hampshire-primary-record-turnout,"More than 300,000 voters turned out Tuesday to vote in New Hampshire’s presidential primary, underscoring Donald Trump’s tendency to mobilize both his diehard supporters, but also his most fervent detractors at the polls. The final results show fractures in the Republican party, even as the former president is on the fast track to the nomination.
The primary set a record for voter turnout in any previous New Hampshire presidential primary – a notable milestone given New Hampshire regularly turns out a higher share of voters than other states for presidential primaries. New Hampshire is also known for having a strong share of independent voters and conducts open primaries, meaning voters are not required to declare a party affiliation to vote there. For those reasons, former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, Trump’s last challenger, hoped for an upset victory.
Haley was ultimately unable to turn out enough independents – or Republicans who have soured on Trump – to beat him. But she was able to garner enough moderate Republican defectors to eke out 43% of the vote there, gaining 9 delegates while Trump earned 12. She has said she will stay in the race, doubling down on efforts to draw moderate voters ahead of the primary in her home state of South Carolina next month, despite Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel’s statement Wednesday that she doesn’t “see it for Nikki Haley”.
“In 2016, Trump did pretty well amongst Republicans regardless of ideology,” said Christopher Galdieri, a professor of political science at Saint Anselm College in New Hampshire. This year, 73% of New Hampshire voters in the Republican primary who describe themselves as “moderates” broke for Haley. “That suggests, ‘OK, maybe there are some Republicans who are in play who could be convinced to close their eyes, hold their nose and vote for Biden in the fall,’” said Galdieri.
Some of the decisive factors could rest on how people feel about the key issues of abortion or democracy. The 6 January 2021 insurrection by pro-Trump rioters at the US capitol, for example, drove a split within the Republican party and Trump’s numerous criminal cases have deepened the divide, turning off moderate Republican voters but strengthening support among his strongest supporters.
Biden’s campaign, meanwhile, ran a strong enough write-in campaign to beat long-shot Democratic challengers Dean Phillips and Marianne Williamson – despite his name not appearing on the ballot after the Democratic party changed its process for conducting partisan primaries. Losing out to Phillips, who has led efforts within the Democratic party to challenge Biden ahead of the 2024 election, would have been an embarrassment for the Biden campaign.
His ability to pull off a write-in campaign – which would typically draw drastically fewer voters than on-ballot candidates – could suggest the president will be able to garner stronger turnout than expected, given his struggling poll numbers, in November.
There’s precedent for high turnout working in Biden’s favor. Turnout in the 2020 presidential election soared, with a higher share of eligible voters turning out to vote than in any other US presidential election in decades.
But this year holds another twist. Even if the 2024 election draws similarly strong voter interest, the presence of uncommonly strong third party candidates like conspiracy theory-touting Robert F Kennedy Jr, or Cornel West, who is running to Biden’s left, could complicate the picture for either party’s nominee.

Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters
after newsletter promotion
All told, the Iowa primary, which garnered a smaller turnout – but more heavily favored Trump – and the New Hampshire primary, imply the general election in November could be decided by whether or not Trump’s detractors are motivated enough to put their vote behind a Democrat.
The first two contests of the year, however, are proof that Trump’s strongest supporters, including those who do not usually vote in presidential elections, will make it to the polls if their candidate is on the ballot come November.
“There are people who vote for Donald Trump when Donald Trump is on the ballot,” said Galdieri. “They might not vote other times – they might not have voted that much before 2016. But if you put Trump on a ballot, they will crawl over broken glass to get there and cast a ballot for him.”"
5VWRDE5K9Z_KRTO0U2HULZTT0U,Nottingham attacks: the missed opportunities to stop Valdo Calocane,Jessica Murray,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/24/nottingham-attacks-missed-opportunities-to-stop-valdo-calocane,"Valdo Calocane had been suffering from extreme mental illness for years before he launched his violent rampage through the streets of Nottingham in June last year, and questions are now being asked about why he was not under closer supervision.
The 32-year-old has paranoid schizophrenia, and for years experienced psychotic delusions in which he believed he was being targeted by “malign forces” and agencies such as MI5 who were controlling his thoughts and actions.
Despite alarming warning signs – including numerous violent outbursts and a plea for MI5 to arrest him – he evaded authorities for months and had been left untreated for almost a year at the time he killed three people and attempted to kill three others.
Dr Sanjoy Kumar, the father of Grace O’Malley-Kumar, said her killer had misled psychiatrists and that the failure to formally charge him for a number of previous violent incidents was a “missed opportunity” that may have “altered his course”.
The case has disturbing similarities to that of Zephaniah McLeod, who killed 23-year-old Jacob Billington and injured seven others in a violent and random stabbing spree in Birmingham in September 2020.
He was diagnosed with schizophrenia, and a report on his treatment found he had been released from prison months before the attack with no restrictions or supervision despite experiencing delusions and refusing to take medication.
Here is a timeline of Calocane’s engagement with mental health services, and the chances to stop him before he turned to violence.
It is thought the symptoms of Calocane’s schizophrenia began in 2019, but he first came into contact with mental health services in May 2020 when he went to A&E believing he was having a heart attack. Afterwards he returned to his home in Nottingham and knocked down a door to another apartment in his block.
He was arrested for criminal damage, and assessed as psychotic when taken in to custody, but released without charge. On returning home, he almost immediately knocked down another apartment door. He was arrested and, this time, sectioned.
Less than a month after being discharged, Calocane was hospitalised again after he stopped taking his medication and broke into another apartment. He was discharged on 31 July, then managed in the community by an early intervention psychosis team, and his medication was increased.
The following year, Calocane’s family reported that his mental health had deteriorated and that he had reported hearing voices telling him his family members would die. But he was “actively concealing symptoms of psychosis” from medics, prosecutor Karim Khalil KC told the court. He admitted he had stopped taking his medication and had no intention of continuing his treatment.
After evading contact with a community mental health team, a warrant was issued for a search of Calocane’s property. Eight months’ worth of unused medication was found and his behaviour was hostile.
He was sectioned again, and assaulted a police officer while being transported to Highbury hospital in Nottingham. After being released in October, he missed mental health appointments and often appeared confrontational, Khalil said.
Calocane was involved in an altercation with his flatmate, and on 27 January he was sectioned again, for three weeks, after failing to engage with at-home mental health services. It was later found that Calocane first started buying weapons in 2022 as voices were telling him to harm others, psychiatrists said.
Calocane travelled to London and attempted to hand himself in to MI5, who he believed were controlling him, at their Thames House headquarters, urging them to “please arrest me”.
A community mental health service prompted Calocane to collect his medication, but he lied and said he was out of the country. On 4 August, a mental health team visited his discharge address but were told Calocane no longer lived there.
Calocane was due to appear in court for the assault of the police officer in September 2021, but he failed to attend and a warrant was issued for his arrest.
That warrant was still outstanding nine months later when he was arrested for the attacks in Nottingham, and police have admitted they should have done more to track him down.
Khalil said Calocane was “unmedicated and out of touch with psychiatric services for almost 12 months” in June last year when he carried out the attacks. He claims he committed the crimes because voices in his head told him to, and he hadn’t sought help because he believed the doctors who had been treating him were involved in controlling him."

All of Us Strangers has finally been released in the UK after leaving cinemagoers in the US, and at various film festivals, in floods. It’s won seven gongs at the British Independent Film awards and is up for six Baftas, but no Oscars – whatever. For me, the film’s achievement is the way it’s managed to talk about love, grief and loneliness in such a powerful and original way. I first saw it at the end of September when it hit me like a ton of bricks, and I can honestly say that I’ve thought about it every single day since.
When I interviewed writer-director Andrew Haigh before Christmas, he told me that while he had designed the film to be increasingly dreamlike as it went on, the plot underneath was logical. Nonetheless, he said that he was open to other interpretations. So let’s dig into them, shall we?
At the end of All of Us Strangers, Adam (Andrew Scott) returns to his flat after meeting the ghosts of his parents for the final time. He goes to Harry (Paul Mescal)’s apartment, which he’s never entered before, and is knocked back by the smell of a decomposing body. Then Harry’s ghost appears, holding the empty bottle of whisky he was drinking when he came to Adam’s door looking for late night company at the start of the film.
It seems reasonable to assume that after being rejected by Adam, Harry went back to his flat, finished the whisky, took ketamine (Adam finds a baggie) and died of a drug and alcohol overdose, meaning that as well as reuniting with his parents who are ghosts, Adam has been having a love affair with one too.
Adam is only able to let his guard down enough start his relationship with Harry once he confronts his past and meets the ghosts of his parents – after he’s first come back from Croydon, he gets together with Harry after their discussion about the terms “gay” and “queer”.
After Adam has come out to his mum (Claire Foy) back in Croydon, he has sex for the second time with Harry, who has encouraged him to take a bath because he’s feverish. It’s never made explicit in the film, but Haigh told me that Adam starts to feel unwell after his mum mentions Aids, and in the bath he tells Harry (who has no such hangups) that for years he had been too frightened of the disease to have sex with anyone. Later on in the film, as Adam runs through the tube train tunnels looking for Harry, there are old public information posters about Aids on the walls. In order to break out of his repression and fall in love, Adam has to lay to rest his terror of catching HIV.
Shot in the Royal Vauxhall Tavern in London, one of Haigh’s old haunts, this is the only big musical moment that isn’t set to an 80s hit – the soundtrack to Adam’s ketamine trip is Blur’s woozy Death of a Party, from 1997. Haigh told me that there’s a subplot buried within All of Us Strangers in which Adam manages to break out of his loneliness and live as a happily out gay man – so perhaps this is the way he would have gone out partying in his early 20s, in the 90s. While he’s high, Adam imagines himself and Harry having the long-term relationship he has yearned for – though sadly it doesn’t seem to last, with Harry gliding past him in the club after locking eyes with someone else, before Adam wakes up screaming.

All of Us Strangers takes place in a mysteriously unpopulated world – a metaphor for Adam’s isolation. He and Harry appear to be the sole residents of their tower block, and Adam and his parents are the only guests in the diner where they have their last encounter, a childhood outing Adam never got to experience. The only other person is the waitress: presumably she can’t see Adam’s mum and dad, since she wonders whether he’ll be able to finish the family meal he’s just ordered.
Adam’s mum asks him whether she and Adam’s dad died quickly after their car crash – he tells her that they did, even though we know that his mum took days to die, a white lie that I felt was Adam kindly parenting his parents, shielding them from harsh truths they didn’t need to know in a moment of mature understanding.
The line that really got to me, though, was the part when Adam’s dad (Jamie Bell) tells him that he’s proud of him, and when Adam asks why, given that he hasn’t done anything, his dad replies, “Well you’ve survived. It can’t have been easy.” Finally, his parents recognise his sadness and pain, and the effort it’s cost him to keep going, even if he doesn’t have a wife, kids, a successful career or any of the other trappings of heterosexual manhood to show for it.
In the last scene of All of Us Strangers, Adam and Harry cuddle up together on a bed. Harry asks Adam to put on a record, and without him doing so, The Power of Love by Frankie Goes to Hollywood comes on – Adam was watching an old Top of the Pops performance of it from 1984 when Harry came knocking at the beginning of the film. The song contains the deeply romantic declaration “I’ll protect you from the Hooded Claw / Keep the vampires from your door”; in a (to him, unconscious) allusion to the lyrics, Harry had told Adam, as the older man turned him away, “there’s vampires outside my door”.
Now Adam and Harry can truly love, console, protect and care for each other, but it’s a brutally bittersweet image as it’s happening in some kind of supernatural realm, not real life. As the camera gets further and further away from the spooning lovers, it depicts them as one of a constellation of stars in a night sky, perhaps the other lonely strangers of the film’s title.
So is Adam also dead? I don’t think Haigh means us to think that he is. I think the image says that love is strong enough to smash the boundary between life and death, and that it’s our only defence against the infinite darkness that surrounds us, something Adam has come to understand after spending a lifetime running away from his own desperate need for human connection. Now, I think I may have something in my eye …"

The prospect of a deal to release the remaining hostages held by Hamas appears to have receded after a Hamas official said the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu’s rejection of their conditions meant there was “no chance” of their return.
Netanyahu had earlier dismissed the militant group’s conditions to end the war, which he said included leaving Hamas in power and Israel’s complete withdrawal from Gaza.
A Hamas official said Netanyahu’s refusal to end the military offensive “means there is no chance for the return of the [Israeli] captives”, which are estimated to be 130 in number.
Family members of hostages began a protest outside the PM’s private home in Jerusalem saying they would remain until “the prime minister agrees to a deal to return the hostages”.
Victorian opposition drops support for treaty | The Victorian Labor government and the Greens have condemned the state opposition’s decision. The Coalition backed a bill in 2022 to start the treaty process with Victoria’s Indigenous people but spokesperson Peter Walsh says “things have changed”.

Sarah Ferguson diagnosed with malignant melanoma | The Duchess of York has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of skin cancer months after she was diagnosed with breast cancer. A spokesperson for Ferguson, 64, said medics had removed a mole on her body, which tested as a malignant melanoma, during treatment for cancer. Doctors are now working to establish whether it was caught early.

Adam Weir, the CEO of Surf Life Saving Australia, says this figure was above the 10-year average and above the number of drowning deaths at the same time last year.
Modern life can be exhausting. Psychologist, author and fatigue expert Vincent Deary says the answer is to learn how to rest.
Deary has a mantra: work needs rest and rest takes work. We need to take time out to rest so we can heal from extreme exhaustion, chronic illness or unexpected life events – what Deary terms “biographical disruption”. We also need to rest from work and free ourselves from an “audit culture” that pushes us, sometimes, to breaking point. “It’s a skill,” he says of resting – one that nowadays has to be acquired.

64T74VMAUE_A86VJBEOX9XJ4TN,ICJ to give interim ruling in Gaza genocide case against Israel,Haroon Siddique,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2024/jan/26/icj-to-rule-on-south-africas-case-alleging-israeli-genocide-in-gaza,"The international court of justice in The Hague is set to give a preliminary ruling on Friday in South Africa’s case alleging genocide by Israel in Gaza, as the world watches to see whether the judges will order a ceasefire.
At a two-day hearing this month, South Africa asked the court to issue provisional measures requiring Israel to immediately end its military campaign in Gaza, which began after the 7 October attacks by Hamas.
About 1,200 Israelis, mainly citizens, were killed in the 7 October attacks, with 240 taken hostage, an estimated 129 of whom are still being held captive. The death toll from the assault on Gaza stands at almost 26,000 – mostly women and children – with a further 7,000 buried under rubble presumed dead. About 85% of the Palestinian territory’s 2.3 million people have been displaced.
The court’s rulings are final and cannot be appealed against, but it has no enforcement powers and Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has already said “no one will stop us, not the Hague”. However, an adverse ruling could lead to sanctions and would put more pressure on Israel’s allies and military backers – including the US, which previously described the case as “meritless” – to rein it in.
On Thursday, the Israeli government spokesperson, Eylon Levy, voiced confidence about the outcome. “We expect the ICJ to throw out these spurious and specious charges,” he told reporters.
South Africa’s foreign minister, Naledi Pandor, is flying to The Hague to be present for the decision, suggesting confidence on the part of the claimant, too.
The 1948 genocide convention, enacted after the mass murder of Jews in the Nazi Holocaust, defines it as “acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group”. For provisional measures to be enacted, it is not necessary to prove conduct amounting to genocide but that at least some of the alleged acts are capable of falling within the convention.
In court, the South African lawyer Adila Hassim alleged that genocidal acts committed by Israel included the mass killing of Palestinians, causing serious mental and bodily harm to Palestinians, deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about the physical destruction of Gaza in whole or in part, and Israel’s military assault on Gaza’s healthcare system.
She told the court: “Nothing will stop this suffering, except an order from this court. Without an indication of provisional measures, the atrocities will continue; with the Israel Defense Forces indicating that they intend pursuing this course of action for at least a year.”
As well as an immediate ceasefire, South Africa also asked the court to order measures prohibiting the deprivation of access to adequate food and water, humanitarian assistance and medical supplies and assistance.
Israel has rejected calls for a ceasefire, insisting that it will not stop until its goal of destroying Hamas, which it says is the only way to ensure its citizens’ safety, is accomplished.
Tal Becker, the Israeli foreign ministry’s legal adviser, told the court: “It is in response to the slaughter of 7 October – which Hamas openly vows to repeat – and to the ongoing attacks against it from Gaza, that Israel has the inherent right to take all legitimate measures to defend its citizens and secure the release of the hostages. This right is … not in doubt.”
The president of the court, the American judge Joan Donoghue, will read out the decision at 1pm local time (1200 GMT).
Unlike the international criminal court, which is also investigating alleged war crimes by Hamas and Israel, the ICJ tries only states, not individuals."
69ZRNS1F0Z_R0WX4NG7XK1SU4B,"Phew, Eh Readers? The Life and Writing of Tom Hibbert review – the PG Wodehouse of pop journalism",Nick Duerden,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/jan/22/phew-eh-readers-the-life-and-writing-of-tom-hibbert-review-the-pg-wodehouse-of-pop-journalism,"Before they went the way of the coal miner, music journalists were a definable demographic and music journalism an actual occupation. The good ones boasted cachet and influence; the best could inspire a generation. Tom Hibbert was perhaps the music journalist nonpareil for at least a dozen years between the early 1980s and 90s, an idiosyncratic stylist whose work graced the pages of Smash Hits and Q, where he repeatedly refused to kowtow to celebrities, irrespective of their status.
Phew, Eh Readers? – whose title alone gives those new to him a flavour of the arched eyebrow manner in which he wrote – is a collection of his finest and funniest writing, alongside fond recollections from those who knew him best: his wife, musician friends, fellow writers.
“He would give his subjects the impression that, despite their obvious successes, they were still somehow shameful underachievers,” wrote the journalist and editor Mark Ellen in Hibbert’s obituary for the Guardian in 2011 (reprinted here). Often, Hibbert’s victims were mere naifs (Bros, Kylie Minogue), but his skewerings were less nasty than they were mischievous. “He was at heart a satirist,” suggests erstwhile colleague Paul Du Noyer. Consumed in one go, the pieces here illustrate just what an anomaly he was: older than his fellow scribes, far more well heeled, and ultimately closer in spirit to PG Wodehouse than any punk upstart.
Born in 1952, the son of noted historian Christopher Hibbert, he came of journalistic age in the midst of an 80s pop explosion that largely failed to impress him. He preferred late 60s/early 70s fare – Syd Barrett, the Byrds – and so to help cope with having to write about such throwaway fluff in Smash Hits, he developed a withering style, with plenty of in-jokes and endless parenthetical asides (to hammer home the snark for maximum effect). He was condescending towards Phil Collins and Jon Bon Jovi, and employed a sly interview technique – later adopted by Louis Theroux for TV – which comprised asking a provocative question, then allowing his subjects to fill the awkward gaps. “Tom was unafraid of silence,” as one former colleague notes. The approach was unfailingly fruitful, and prompted Margaret Thatcher, whom he interviewed in 1987 for Smash Hits, to ramble on thus: “Television tells you lots of things you wouldn’t otherwise know but it stops a lot of things because it’s too jolly easy to go home and do your homework and then sit down in front of the television and the family sitting down in front of the television and you’re not talking to one another.”
For Q’s infamous Who the Hell… slot, he was dispatched monthly to interview bloviating types in thrall to their own presumed importance, but who, in Hibbert’s foreboding company, says Ellen, “would go on to reveal some deeper truth about themselves beyond the usual promotional flannel”. Some of the best of these – Bernard Manning, Cliff Richard, Jimmy Savile – are not included here, but those that are tickle all the same. “I was really fed up with what I was writing about,” Hibbert said in 2001, “so I invented sarcasm as a way to deal with it.”
That’s one way to put it. He offended Ringo Starr by “talking shit”, did likewise with Roger Waters (“I refuse to answer that question on the grounds that it is stupid”), and prompted this from Gary Numan: “I’m a great capitalist pig. So what?”
By the mid-1990s, increasingly Withnail-like in his disdain for all he surveyed, he briefly wrote for the Mail on Sunday, where, in his early 40s, he positioned himself as a grumpy old man pining over how things were better in his day. He found more comfortable ground on the Observer’s Pendennis column, writing about politics with the same vinegary smarts he once employed to review a new single by Kajagoogoo. In 1997, he stood in the general election for the Whig party, losing out to Michael Heseltine in Henley by 23,748 votes – this despite promising that he’d repeal the Corn Laws and grant votes for women over 30. By this point in his career, his eyebrow could lift weights.
But then later that same year, after decades of cigarettes and alcohol, he became ill with pancreatitis and pneumonia. He remained in an induced coma for four months. “When he was out,” writes his wife, Allyce, in Phew…, “he was never the same again.” Too ill to work, he spent the next 14 years mostly alone, and eventually died from complications brought about by diabetes in August 2011, a terribly sad fate for someone always so alive on the page.
This collection remembers Hibbert at his peerless best, the most inimitable of writers, and someone who could make pop music as fun to read about as it was to listen to.
Which, incidentally, isn’t easy to do.

6BG5PQ0AH6_4PQX7WKCS25YWF4,"Tweaks, delays and compromises define UK’s post-Carillion response",Nils Pratley,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/22/tweaks-delays-compromises-define-uk-post-carillion-response,"Here it is, then, six years after the collapse of Carillion: the UK’s response to the massive governance failure at a major government contractor that folded only six months after its first profits warning. From 2026 – so after yet more delay – the boards of quoted companies with a premium listing on the London Stock Exchange will have to declare that their firms’ internal controls are up to scratch.
If this rule change sounds like a watery imitation of what was promised in the aftermath of the Carillion fiasco, you’d be right. Back then, there was a zeal to take radical measures to reform the responsibilities of company directors, as well as to shake up the entire audit industry and the audit regulator, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC). Instead, in terms of what will be required of directors, we’ve ended up with a tweak to the UK corporate governance code.
Companies with a premium listing in London – the only ones to which the code formally applies – already have to carry out an annual review of the effectiveness of their financial, operational, reporting and compliance controls. The new obligation will merely make boards explain how they conducted the review and what it concluded.
The change isn’t nothing, but the contrast with the US is stark. Over there, they have the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which was introduced within a year of their own spectacular corporate blow-up – at the energy company Enron in 2001. US companies have to involve an external auditor in the review of their controls, which is a more intrusive process, and the act carries criminal sanctions. The UK version, even in tightened form, is less onerous by several degrees.
The lowering of ambition has really been led by the government. Amid the general panic about the “competitiveness” of UK plc and the declining status of the London Stock Exchange as a venue for company listings, anything that can be caricatured as bureaucratic red tape has been downgraded. The government’s mantra these days is to encourage risk-taking and growth. The FRC, in keeping rule changes “proportionate”, is merely following the script.
That same script has already resulted in years of delays to the creation of the Audit, Reporting and Governance Authority (Arga) as a muscular and statutory replacement for the FRC with powers to take enforcement action against all directors, not just – as at present – those who happen to be members of the accounting trade body. The failure to legislate for Arga is all part of the timid tone from Westminster. The corporate lobby has won most of the battles.
An incidental benefit – let’s hope – is that we may see an end to whingeing from boardrooms about the supposedly impossible burdens placed on them by regulators and box-ticking investors. The plea never made much sense given the existence of Sarbanes-Oxley in the US. And it is even less persuasive now that the FRC has also dropped, more justifiably, earlier proposals to beef up reporting on environmental and social areas and the setting of diversity expectations.

For good measure, Richard Moriarty, the chief executive of the FRC, has reminded companies that London’s “comply or explain” principle means what it says: cogent explanations for diverting from the code are allowed, and indeed are better than half-hearted compliance. That bit, at least, sounds like good sense. Company chairs are paid to make decisions and justify them. They should count their blessings: their lives have not been made impossible by regulations."
6KLF3O951K_SBO2CGW5VF57EQI,‘Ukraine fatigue’: why I’m fighting to stop the world forgetting us,Olesya Khromeychuk,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/25/ukraine-fatigue-why-im-fighting-to-stop-the-world-forgetting-us,"‘If you were 30% braver, what would you do to be a better ancestor?” the enthusiastic host asked a roomful of delegates in New York, gathered for a conference on democracy. “Take 60 seconds to think and share your answers in your small groups.”
My small group consisted of seasoned activists from different parts of the world. They were eager to discuss their opinions on courage and legacy. “I’d spend more time with my kids,” said one. “I would speak to people I disagree with more often,” said another. I kept quiet hoping no one would notice.
“You’re being quiet,” said one of them when everyone else had spoken. My group turned to me.
“Oh, I don’t know. It’s a difficult question.” I tried to get myself out of the trap. “I need more time to think about it.”
The thing is, I didn’t need time to think about it. As soon as the facilitator finished her question, my answer was right there, staring me in the face. Now that my small group was staring at me just as insistently, I couldn’t face sharing my thoughts with them. It seemed like I needed to be 30% braver just to utter the answer.
“If I were braver, to be a better ancestor, I’d join the army. The Ukrainian armed forces.”
At that moment, it was the only answer that rang true.
My response was met with the sort of uncomfortable silence I seem to bring to most social conversations. A friend has found a good term for that: a Ukrainian killjoy. It applies to those of us who keep talking about the war when people want to talk about their kids, the future and all those wonderful things that give us hope. Sometimes, we don’t even need to offer a digest of Russia’s recent bombardments, we end conversations just by entering the room.
When people think of Ukraine these days, they think of war, destruction, death, weapons, the need to produce and provide more weapons. Such thoughts bring little inspiration. And so, when asked to talk about Ukraine on international platforms, I am frequently encouraged to speak of peace, reconstruction and reconciliation. A relentless fight with no end in sight is a conversation killer. It’s also a reality in which most Ukrainians have been living since the start of the full-scale war.
Throughout history, Ukraine has been regarded as merely a buffer zone between Europe proper and the threat from the east. A stateless nation, it was denied a voice on international platforms for centuries. Despite successfully restoring its sovereignty in 1991, distrust persisted among states inclined to reserve decision-making seats exclusively for those deemed “great powers”, a designation that is frequently acquired through the imperialist oppression of other nations.
Ukraine experts have tried to shift the narrative to show the country as the gates of Europe, the crossroads of cultures, the bridge facilitating conversation among unlikely interlocutors in a multitude of tongues. For the outside world, however, Ukraine has remained a buffer zone lacking a clear identity – a territory that can be fought over, sacrificed or simply overlooked.
In 2022, after Russia’s full-scale invasion, Ukraine offered the world a new narrative about itself: it was no longer perceived as a nation of leather-jacketed riffraff from the edge of Europe, ruled by dodgy oligarchs with large wallets and poor taste. It was a new incarnation of brave David unafraid of monstrous Goliath. The narrative caught on – because who doesn’t like a good remake of an old story?
For as long as they could, throughout 2022, Ukrainians kept this image up. After the liberation of the Kyiv region and the sinking of the Moskva, the flagship of Russia’s Black Sea fleet, the Ukrainian armed forces successfully freed the Kharkiv region and then proceeded to liberate Kherson. Each time, they uncovered mass graves, torture chambers, death and devastation. They were greeted by people whose gratitude for liberation was as great as the grief that had been brought by the occupiers.
The Ukrainian army was conducting successful campaigns, and countless observers the world over conveniently forgot that, back in February 2022, they had given this same army no more than a week. Fortune favours the brave, and so do the western partners. Success at the front persuaded even reluctant nations such as Germany to deliver assistance to Ukraine. Everyone likes to support an underdog, especially if it’s winning. But it’s one thing to win a battle (or several), it’s quite another to win the war.
Ukraine was never given enough support to win. The assistance it received was vital to survive, crucial to keep going, necessary not to lose. It wasn’t sufficient to win. It turned out that one thing that was truly in short supply was courage. Not that of the people of Ukraine – they had no choice but to be brave. It was the leaders of what is known as the free world who needed to be braver to put an end to this war. A real end. Not a temporary ceasefire, which territorial concessions might bring, not a stalemate in a war of attrition. The sort of end that could only come with Ukraine’s victory, which would include the restoration of territorial integrity violated by Russia in 2014 when it occupied Crimea, the dispensation of justice for the numerous crimes committed by the Russian troops and their leadership, and the provision of the type of security guarantees that would make a new wave of Russian aggression impossible.
For much of 2023, the eyes of the world were still on Ukraine, but this attention was that of a streaming TV addict, flicking through the fresh releases, looking for a new series to binge on. The release of the 2023 season of Russia’s war, branded as “Ukraine’s counteroffensive”, was delayed. And then something more gripping came along.
In early October, I was in Ukraine at the Lviv Book Forum, a literary festival. It was co-organised with the Hay festival, and thus attracted a good number of international journalists. On the morning of 7 October I met several of them rushing through the hotel lobby, bags packed, taxis waiting to take them back to the Polish border. They were off to the Middle East.
I started to get requests for comment from papers around the world, asking me to share how it felt to compete for attention with the Israel-Gaza war. I did not wish to partake in a competition of human suffering orchestrated by the media and exacerbated by our ever-shortening attention span. For people caught in the violence, be it in Palestine, Israel or Ukraine, this was no TV series. It was their lives on display: blood, sweat and tears. But I had to admit that the Ukraine fatigue we’d been afraid of since the start of the all-out war had descended in earnest. Outside the country, there was less and less investment in Ukraine’s victory.
“You need to change your tune, you know. People don’t take this victory rhetoric seriously any more,” said a man at a Christmas party, as 2023 drew to an end. I tried to convince myself he meant well.
“How should I fight this Ukraine fatigue here in London while my compatriots fight the Russian missiles at home?” I asked.
“I don’t know, but the whole victory thing isn’t working, because we’ve given you everything and you still haven’t won.”
I gasped for air and told him that we’ve also given everything and then some. I told him that earlier that night, just before heading out to the party, I had phoned my mother. She told me that a distant cousin who had been fighting at the front had been killed. She had spoken to our relatives who had been to his funeral.
“They only buried his legs, you know,” mum said on the phone. “Couldn’t find any other parts after the blast. His comrades recognised his legs because he had distinct tattoos.”
It’s good that I also have a tattoo, I thought. Who knows? Just in case. I didn’t say that to my mum. Instead, I said: “That’s awful. At least we could bury the whole of Volodya.”
Volodya, my brother, was killed in action in 2017. That was before the world discovered Ukraine. It was when leaders of the free world still shook Putin’s hand, bought Russian oil and enabled the aggressor to prepare for the inevitable escalation. My brother was killed in Luhansk region, near Popasna, when Popasna was still standing. Now, if you look at the aerial images of that city, you can see only ruins. Remnants of cities are like remnants of people, hard to recognise.
“I guess we were lucky. We didn’t need to look for tattoos to recognise Volodya’s body,” I said to my mum. She agreed. Ukrainian luck.
Not long ago, a friend of mine told me something she’d heard from a British acquaintance: “You don’t even realise how lucky you are to live in London!” My friend is from southern Ukraine, from a city that gets shelled almost daily. After months under Russian bombardment, she decided to leave a job she loved, her ageing parents, the life she’d been building in a city she adored, and seek refuge in the UK.
“Did they mean that you’re lucky to have escaped the war zone alive?” I ask her to clarify, although I suspect that that is not what they meant.
“No! They meant that I’m lucky because my host family lives in a posh bit of London, and I can enjoy all the opportunities that this city has to offer.”
Ah yes, those plentiful opportunities refugees enjoy. Like many displaced Ukrainians – not to mention refugees from other parts of the world – she struggles to make ends meet.
To cheer her up, I told her that, a couple of days earlier, a man sitting next to me at a conference dinner in a northern European capital had said to me: “Your life must be so exciting! Whizzing around the world, giving talks! Hundreds of people listening to you, wanting to know about Ukraine!”
She asked me if I told the guy to get lost. I didn’t. I told him that I’d rather have my brother alive and my homeland at peace than all this excitement. I’d rather people learned about my country in universities and bookshops. Although, in truth, that is not easy. There is still a gaping hole in university curriculums when it comes to the study of Ukraine. In Britain, there is a handful of places where Ukrainian history, politics and culture are taught, only two universities that have Ukrainian programmes and only one that offers a degree in Ukrainian Studies.
When it comes to bookshops, some now stock works on Ukraine, but the bulk of them are focused on the war rather than the country as a whole, and most are written by observers who are not ordinarily based in Ukraine. The voices from inside the country are not being promoted. And to add insult to injury, there are also bookshops that insist on shelving Ukrainian books in the “Russian literature” section. On my recent trip to Paris, I saw my book sitting uncomfortably among the Russian tomes, and insisted it be moved to a more appropriate place. The manager replied that he didn’t have enough Ukrainian books to create a Ukraine shelf. When I explained that the only connection my book had to Russia was that its protagonist had been killed by that country’s army, the manager responded that they didn’t think of the Russia shelf as relating to the country, but more as representing a region. And what region might that be: the Russian empire? The manager did not dignify me with an answer. He snapped the book out of the Russian shelf and shoved it on a temporary “new editions” table.
Perhaps rather than feeling enraged by the experience, however, I should have felt lucky: if it wasn’t for the war, my book might not have made it to the bookshops at all. There are countless blessings I remember each day. Here in London, I don’t have to hide in bomb shelters from Russian drones and missiles. I don’t have to spend the winter with no electricity like my fellow countrywomen and men do as Russia tries to freeze Ukraine into submission. Having said that, I start my day by checking the news and texting my loved ones in Ukraine to see if they made it through the night. Every day, I hear of another death of someone two handshakes away. On a bad day, it’s someone I knew or worked with, someone whose poetry I had been reading the day before.
My calendar is marked with morbid anniversaries: in 2024, Ukrainians commemorate two years since the full-scale invasion and 10 years since the start of the war. When I marked birthdays last year, I started by saying: “He would have turned 49; she would have been 38.” My grief is immense, as is that of all my compatriots: about 80% of Ukrainians know someone who was either killed or injured in this war. In this context, my fellow Europeans highlighting my good fortune is no more than a tiresome nuisance. I realise my luck. They are yet to acknowledge theirs.
‘Why don’t you join the Ukrainian army? You speak so passionately about your people’s fight and your brother’s service. Wouldn’t you want to join the ranks yourself?” The first time a journalist asked me this question was in front of a few hundred people at a literary festival. I felt a hot wave of blood rushing through my body and had to compose myself before I could answer. We had just been discussing my book about my brother’s death on the frontline. Did he really think that that was an appropriate question to ask? Didn’t he think that visiting one war grave is enough for one family? I searched for answers, but they were all flawed.
I don’t join up because I am not trained for army service; I have no useful skills to offer. But nor do many recruits who volunteered or were mobilised for service. I don’t join up because my contribution to the war effort is to write and speak to people all over the world to raise awareness about this war and galvanise support for Ukraine. But so could many Ukrainian writers, artists, poets and people of different professions who Russia’s invasion turned into soldiers. My gender is no reason to avoid service either. Thousands of women are fighting the external enemy and the internal obstacles put in front of them by the remnants of paternalistic culture. Why don’t I join up, indeed?
The answer I gave was true: I’m not in the Ukrainian armed forces simply because I am privileged not to have to join up. I live in London. I live in a state whose sky is protected by air defence and international alliances. Whose voice on the global stage is not doubted. The citizens of my adopted country, unlike those of my country of birth, are lucky not to have to be brave. Like them, I have the luxury of choice and I choose to be safe. For now.
This will be a year of choices. Billions of people in dozens of countries will go to the polls and exercise the right to make their voices heard. Of course, not every election serves as a genuine expression of people’s will, and there are also those nations where many either take their right to vote for granted because they never had to fight for it, or feel so disenfranchised that they don’t think their vote matters. In 2024, wherever we are in the world, we can’t afford to have our choices made for us. We are obliged to exercise our agency, however limited it might seem.
We have the power to elect political representatives who can enact changes that will outlast their time in office. We need to support politicians who view Russia’s war not as an inconvenience to their economies, but understand that tolerance of a warmongering state is what led us to this situation in the first place. We need to hold accountable those leaders who allowed Russia to enjoy impunity after 2014, who benefited from continued business with the aggressor country and thus contributed to the escalation in 2022.
Crucially, we must wake up from the slumber of inaction: this war is existential not only for Ukrainians; it is existential for those of us who want to live in a world governed not by brutal force, but by the rule of law. If we don’t win the fight for democracy in Ukraine, we’ll end up fighting for it closer to home. Let us then do all in our power to help Ukrainians win the fight not only for their freedom, but also for ours.
“For our freedom and yours” is a famous slogan in east-central Europe. It originates in 19th-century Poland, a state that had been partitioned by Russia, Prussia and Austria. The initial banner featured the inscription of this motto in Polish and Russian, highlighting the Polish anti-imperial insurrectionists’ support for the anti-Tsarist Decembrists’ revolt.
The Polish nation, which gave us the slogan, survived even when it was deprived of statehood. The striving for freedom lived on in exile, in the underground, and in the minds and hearts of people who willed their country back into existence after 123 years of statelessness. Poland was restored on the ruins of the imperial powers that had tried to destroy it. Like in the Polish case, the people of Ukraine managed to keep the flame of freedom burning even through the darkest times of Russian and Soviet imperialism. They wrote poetry in Ukrainian in prison cells and published it in underground press. They passed on a clear sense of identity to their youths, like a secret spell that was bound to work its magic sooner or later. Ukrainian statehood is hard-won.
The current existential fight requires the mobilisation of the whole of Ukrainian society, but victory also requires international solidarity. Ukrainians no longer have the privilege to choose whether to be 30% braver. That choice was taken away by Russia. They must be brave in order to survive. The rest of us still have that choice. We had better make it soon.

6MXH437MFF_SWPZHW7MXZOQGQO,German defence minister says military is unfit for problems Europe faces,Kate Connolly,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/25/german-defence-minister-boris-pistorius-military-unfit-europe-problems,"Germany’s defence minister has called for a “serious national debate” about the future of the country’s military, arguing that in its current state it is not fit to tackle the array of security policy challenges facing Europe.
Boris Pistorius, who has frequently called for Germany to become “war ready” since becoming defence minister a year ago and has warned that Vladimir Putin could attack within eight years, said the country needed to be ready to confront the Russian president.
Speaking to trainee soldiers at the German military academy in Hamburg, and making clear he was also addressing wider society, Pistorius said: “Are we seriously ready to defend this country? And who is this ‘we’? This debate has to be had.”
Pistorius said the peace and freedom that most of Europe had enjoyed for decades was “no longer an irrefutable certainty” and that Germany was being “more strongly and actively challenged than ever as an active participant in security and policy”.
This week Pistorius said he was considering allowing residents without German citizenship to join the military in an effort to raise troop numbers from 181,000 to 203,000 by 2031.
There is talk that as in the US military, where people can hope to gain citizenship in return for service, participants would be rewarded with a passport.
The army has a chronic workforce shortage, with 20,000 new recruits needed every year to maintain current numbers. A job in the military does not have the kudos in Germany that it does elsewhere, owing to the country’s wartime past.
Capitals around the continent are debating whether their militaries are fit for modern warfare and the threats posed by countries such as Russia.
On Wednesday, Britain’s military chief of staff, Gen Patrick Sanders, said steps should be taken to place society on a war footing and that the public should be prepared to take up arms against Russia. The UK defence ministry quickly dismissed his comments, insisting there would be no return to conscription, which Britain abolished in 1960.
In Sweden, Norway, Finland and the Baltic nations, preparations are already well under way to deal with a potential Russian attack.
In Germany, Russia’s war in Ukraine has brought the debate about its military out into the open.
Lt Gen Alexander Sollfrank, the head of Nato troops in the southern German city of Ulm, who would be responsible for coordinating the movements of European troops in the event of an attack on a Nato member, said the German military needed not only resources but also “the visible resolve to deploy them”.
“Credible deterrence requires preparation for war and needs to include the population,” Sollfrank said in an annual state of security speech on Wednesday.
Markus Söder, the leader of Bavaria and head of the conservative Christian Social Union, said on Wednesday that Germany was in need of “soldiers capable of fighting on the front”.

Immediately after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, announced a Zeitenwende (turning point) in Germany’s military commitment, dedicating €100bn (£85bn) to a special fund to finance its upgrade and recruit more personnel.
However, the change has been slow. Pistorius, who took over from a beleaguered predecessor considered unfit for the job, and who is seen as Germany’s favourite politician, has struggled to persuade government colleagues to share his sense of urgency, and has been depicted as a lone voice in the wilderness of defence politics.
In the short term, Pistorius said on Thursday he was not aware of a swap offer that would see German Taurus cruise missiles going to Britain and Ukraine receiving British Storm Shadow systems in turn. Britain has offered Germany a swap of cruise missiles that could allow the German government a way of overcoming concerns over a suggested delivery of missiles to Ukraine, the Handelsblatt newspaper reported on Wednesday.
More generally, a wake-up call may be coming in the shape of the US election. There is a growing awareness in Berlin of the impact that a Donald Trump victory could have on Nato funding and Europe’s military strategy towards Russia.
Picking up on the theme this week, Söder said: “Should Trump win, we’ll have to dress up warm. We need a fully equipped military. We are in massive need of our own drones, and we need clarification on whether the American atomic shield will remain in place.”
Söder said he would be in favour of reintroducing conscription but making it obligatory only for men, as was previously the case.
Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, who held the post of defence minister under Angela Merkel and on whose watch in 2011 Germany did away with the decades-long policy of national service, waded into the debate on Thursday, saying it was Germany’s “damned duty” to prepare for a Russian attack."
6OWBRCRU16_RT98HVH4LHVHXBR,Popular opposition Thai MP survives election law court challenge,Rebecca Ratcliffe,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/24/thai-court-opposition-mp-election,"Thailand’s constitutional court has ruled that a pro-reform opposition figure whose party was blocked from taking power last year did not violate election law and can be reinstated as an MP.
The court rejected a complaint brought against Pita Limjaroenrat by conservative politicians that he had violated election law by owning shares in a media company.
Pita’s Move Forward party stunned observers by winning the most votes and most seats in last year’s election after promising to reform the military, break up big business and amend a law that bans criticism of the powerful royal family.
However, Move Forward was blocked from taking power by lawmakers aligned with the royalist military establishment. Legal complaints were filed against the party and Pita, leaving him suspended as an MP.
The 43-year-old denied any wrongdoing in Wednesday’s case, saying the shares were inherited from his late father, and that iTV, the company in question, had not operated as a media business since 2007.
His stake is minute (0.0035%) and would not have granted him influence, he said before the court hearing. The court ruled by eight votes to one that Pita had not broken rules banning members of parliament from owning shares in media companies.
As Pita left the court building, supporters wearing orange, the colour of Move Forward, cheered and chanted “Prime Minister Pita” – a position he was blocked from taking last year, but has said he believes he can win in future elections.
Pita said he wanted to return to parliament “as soon as possible” but added that he needed to wait for official permission. “I will continue to work for the people. My first plan now is to hold a press conference on Move Forward’s agenda going forwards,” he told reporters.
Pita and Move Forward face a separate complaint alleging their policy to amend lese-majesty, which outlaws criticism of the royal family, is tantamount to seeking to overthrow the constitutional monarchy. The court will issue a verdict in the case next week. If it rules against Move Forward, the party would be ordered to abandon its policy commitment to change the law.
Asked how he felt before the verdict, which is due to be announced on 31 January, Pita said he felt confident “because of the facts and the legal basis”.
Move Forward’s pledge to reform lese-majesty was a siginificant reason why the military-appointed senate blocked Pita’s bid to become prime minister last year, pushing his party into opposition.
More than 260 people, including children, have been prosecuted under the law since youth-led protests called for reforms to the powerful monarchy, including the scrapping of the lese-majesty law, in 2020.
Last week, a man was given a 50-year prison sentence for criticising the monarchy – the longest sentence handed down for the offence, according to Thai Lawyers for Human Rights.
Move Forward’s predecessor, Future Forward, was previously dissolved by a constitutional court ruling for breaching funding rules, while its former leader Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit was disqualified as an MP for also holding shares in a media company in a case he claimed was politically motivated."
6S4GKGC74F_4ICSLS2D7CO5KCU,Louise Bertin: Fausto album review – a superb recording of a lost opera,Andrew Clements,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/jan/25/louise-bertin-fausto-album-review-les-talent-lyriques-rousset,"Born in 1805, Louise Bertin was a younger contemporary of Berlioz, and, like him, studied in Paris with Anton Reicha. Fausto was her third opera, one of the earliest to be based on the first part of Goethe’s Faust, and first performed in 1831. It received a lukewarm reception, and Bertin composed only one more stage work – La Esmeralda, based upon Victor Hugo’s Notre-Dame de Paris, for which Hugo himself wrote the libretto. When its premiere, too, was a failure, she abandoned opera and concentrated on choral works, songs and chamber music.
The full score of Fausto was only rediscovered a few years ago, but this first recording, conducted with missionary zeal by Christophe Rousset and superbly played by the period instruments of Les Talens Lyriques, with Karine Deshayes as Faust and Karina Gauvin as Marguerite suggests that it deserves a bit more than occasional performances. Formally it’s an opera semiseria, with the text in Italian, yet the score owes much more to Beethoven and Weber than it does to Italian models, though there are still echoes of Rossini and Donizetti, so that stylistically it is a bit of a mishmash. Despite that, and a rather weak final scene, somebody surely will stage Fausto again very soon.

6S7Z9QMTXK_39CGDN8KAR0EPMA,Digested week: splits emerge in Tory party’s latest splinter group,John Crace,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/jan/26/digested-week-splits-emerge-tory-party-latest-splinter-group,"You have to move fast to catch up with the Tory party these days. Not long ago there were six factions locked in a death spiral. The “Five Families” of the Tory right – the European Research Group, the Northern Research Group, the laughably named Common Sense Group, the New Conservatives and the Conservative Growth Group – and the One Nation moderates who are too feeble to do anything.
As of last week, we could add one more: the mysterious Conservative Britain Alliance that funded the YouGov poll in the Daily Telegraph which showed the Tories were heading for electoral wipeout and from which Lord Frost – the Tory peer who specialises in getting everything wrong – concluded that every foreigner should be deported to Rwanda. After this, the Tories’ self-styled election guru, Isaac Levido, concluded the Tories needed to unite a little.
He’s obviously making good money from the Conservatives but he’s going to regret the hit to his credibility, because that merely sparked yet another splinter group. The new Popular Conservatism movement led by Liz Truss, Jacob Rees-Mogg and Simon Clarke announced it would be having its launch event in early February.
Now, you might think it was pushing it to call anything with which Truss is associated “popular” – her last outing didn’t end so well – but she’s sure as hell popular with me. She is a sketch writer’s dream. Her leadership launch event in 2022 was unbeatable. First there was an embarrassed pause as she couldn’t find her way into a room packed with MPs and media who had had no trouble locating the door. Then, after a brief hustings speech, she made her way out through the audience and tried to exit via the window. We were on the first floor. You can’t buy that kind of comic timing.
Excitingly, there’s a possibility Popular Conservatism may have splintered before it has begun with some parts being more popular than others. Clarke has gone rogue and called for Sunak to go without Liz giving him the say so. She is pretending to be loyal to Rishi by plotting against him. One day, we might remember what it was like to have a functioning government.
I think I may be finally done with TV reality shows. For years I’ve faithfully watched The Great Pottery Throw Down, which could have been made with me in mind. A ceramics enthusiast who regularly attends exhibitions and has no intention of stopping collecting even though I’ve already run out of room for the pots that I have.
But enough is enough. Partly because every series now seems to be a repeat of the last, but mainly because the format itself is so superficial. There is almost no focus on the craft, the skills that the potters are being asked to use. Instead, virtually the entire show is devoted to the “personal journeys” that the contestants are on. How the teapot they are making showcases their experience of living by the seaside for the last 10 years. How a toilet bowl is the reincarnation of their beloved pet cat who tragically died a few months ago.
All of which may be true, but is of next to no interest to me. I am not interested in the personal journeys of 10 people I don’t know and will have forgotten by the end of the series. What I want to know is if they can make ceramics that speak to me. Have a quality that can transform clay into a work of art. And nothing says a failing format than employing a presenter to constantly interrupt with crap jokes. So the sooner reality shows get back to people doing real things rather than following some bogus TV narrative the better. There. Rant over.
Being invited on to Desert Island Discs would come fairly high on my bucket list. It’s not going to happen, of course, but that doesn’t stop me thinking about what my eight music choices would be from time to time. But cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason might just be regretting having said yes.
Towards the end of what had been a lovely episode this week, the presenter, Lauren Laverne, asked him about playing at the Last Night of the Proms and what he felt about Rule, Britannia!. It was asked with no edge, no agenda, and Kanneh-Mason gave a thoughtful reply. It had been an honour to play at the Albert Hall but he had left before the end – musicians aren’t obliged to stick around – as Rule, Britannia! made him feel uncomfortable. Maybe the organisers should have another think about the finale for the Last Night. It wasn’t said in an angry or confrontational way. Just a statement of opinion. In an ideal world and all that. He probably didn’t give the pre-recorded interview another thought until last Sunday. Then all hell broke out, with the rightwing papers outraged at yet another imagined assault on British traditions.
These culture wars get very tiring. There’s one going on at the Michaela school in north London, run by the self-declared “Britain’s strictest headteacher” Katharine Birbalsingh. The school is being sued for not providing a prayer room for Muslim children. Birbalsingh has refused, saying that Michaela is a secular school and does not cater to any faiths. It’s a position with which I wholeheartedly agree. I think all schools would be better off for sidelining religion. Only it turns out that at Michaela, there are degrees of secularism. According to reports, God Save the King, I Vow to Thee My Country and Jerusalem, are sung in rotation at the daily assembly. All three of these anthems/hymns have the idea of a God implicit in the words. And, with the best will in the world, it’s very much a Christian god. So I’d suggest Birbalsingh has a quick rethink of the assembly routine before telling Muslim children what’s what.
The actor Tom Hollander has told a US chatshow how he once received the bonus meant for Spider-Man star Tom Holland for his role in The Avengers. Both actors shared the same agent and Hollander got an email to say he was suddenly enormously rich. For about an hour. Having thought he was doing OK and making a decent living, Hollander was now consumed with envy. Because Holland’s seven-figure payout wasn’t even a fee or a final bonus. It was just an interim payout because he was worth it. Holland probably wouldn’t even have noticed if the money had stayed in his near namesake’s account.
I’ve only once been on the end of mistaken identity. Thankfully, it worked out to my advantage. I’d just started out as a freelance writer in 1989 – it was the only career I could think of which didn’t involve explaining a near 10-year gap on my CV – and I sent my first ever piece to the Independent on Sunday on spec. I thought that would be the end of it. That I had written into a void and would never hear back. Remarkably the features editor read it, said she liked it and offered me £400. I later worked out she had confused me with the novelist Jim Crace. After she realised her mistake, I got only £200 per article. I didn’t quibble. I knew my place.
Another long and tense night in Westminster. Not in the Commons this time. The Tories had called for a momentary breather in their long-running war with each other. But in Bellamy’s cafe/restaurant where the annual, fiercely competitive press lobby quiz took place. This year there were 20 teams of five from print, TV and radio. The Guardian team was heroically led by our political editor, Pippa Crerar, along with Peter Walker, Andy Sparrow, Aletha Adu and yours truly.
Surprisingly, proceedings didn’t start with a minute’s silence while we all prayed for the king’s prostate. Practically all other business in parliament this week has kicked off with tributes to the royal family for having the same medical issues as the rest of us. Instead, we got stuck in straight away with rounds entitled Pot Luck and Lyrics. To our enormous credit, we were near the bottom of the pack after this. Frankly, I would have been embarrassed had we known the words to some dreary Britpop or Taylor Swift “so-called classic”. Had the questions focused on arias from Mozart or Verdi – or indeed the works of Leonard Cohen or Joni Mitchell – then we would have obviously stormed the round. I’ve always been deeply suspicious of anyone who can recite the words of every Oasis song.
After four rounds we were lower to mid-table and Pippa gave us all a rousing pep talk. If we didn’t improve, then we were all going to be fired. Sometimes, tough love does the trick. We had a storming last round on Elections in which we played our joker and scored 20 out of 10, effortlessly answering who was elected in 2017 with over 99% of the vote. Answer: Paul Kagame of that notoriously safe country, Rwanda. We ended up in a very respectable sixth-equal. Not too boastful, but quietly effective. Last was … GB News."

6TJX15FGUT_ES03EI9SZ9SR1O7,Russia accuses Kyiv of downing plane carrying Ukrainian prisoners of war,Pjotr Sauer,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/24/russian-plane-carrying-ukrainian-pows-has-crashed-moscow-says,"Russia has accused Kyiv of downing a large military transport plane carrying Ukrainian prisoners of war to an exchange on Wednesday, after a crash in the Belgorod region that killed everyone onboard.
Ukraine has neither confirmed nor denied that it hit the plane but said Moscow had created a “deliberate threat to the life and safety” of its PoWs by failing to warn Kyiv to deconflict the airspace before the swap.
Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, called for full clarity over the crash, accusing Moscow of “playing with the lives of Ukrainian prisoners of war”.
Zelenskiy said in his nightly video broadcast: “It is clear that the Russians are playing with the lives of Ukrainian prisoners, the feelings of their loved ones and the emotions of our society.”
Ukrainian military intelligence said it did not have “reliable and comprehensive” information about who or what was onboard the Ilyushin Il-76 aircraft, which was filmed crashing and exploding in a fireball on Wednesday afternoon.
The Russian ministry of defence quickly accused Ukraine of shooting down the Il-76, and claimed that the plane was carrying 65 Ukrainian PoWs who were to be swapped, along with six crew and three Russian servicemen. All of those onboard were killed, Russia said.
The Guardian could not immediately verify Russian claims of who was onboard and the cause of the crash was not yet confirmed.
In a statement on Wednesday evening, Ukrainian military intelligence did not directly confirm or deny targeting the Il-76, but accused Russia of failing to provide advance notice of which aircraft would be carrying the captured Ukrainian servicemen to the swap.
It confirmed plans for the swap, and said it had fulfilled its side of the bargain, delivering the Russian servicemen to the exchange point and providing for their safety.
“According to the agreement, the Russian side had to ensure the safety of our defenders,” Ukrainian military intelligence said in a statement. “The Ukrainian side was not informed about the need to ensure the safety of the airspace around ​​the city of Belgorod for a certain period of time, as was repeatedly done in the past.”
The agency added: “This may indicate deliberate actions by Russia aimed at creating a threat to the life and safety of the prisoners.”
The Soviet-designed Ilyushin Il-76 is a military transport aircraft designed to airlift troops, cargo, military equipment and weapons.
Russia quickly accused Ukraine of targeting the aircraft using western anti-aircraft weapons.
Vyacheslav Volodin, the chair of the Duma, said the plane had been “shot down” by Kyiv and blamed western missiles. “They shot their own soldiers in the air. Their own,” Volodin told lawmakers in a plenary session. “Our pilots, who were carrying out a humanitarian mission, were shot down.”
Andrei Kartapolov, a senior lawmaker in Russia’s parliament and a retired general, said during a parliamentary session that the plane had been shot down by three missiles.
He did not reveal the source of his information. Kartapolov added that investigations would show whether the missiles were western-supplied Patriots or Iris-Ts. He claimed Russia and Ukraine were set to exchange 192 prisoners each on Wednesday before the plane crash.
The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said Russia had called for an emergency UN security council session later on Wednesday to discuss what he described as a “Ukrainian criminal act”.
The Ukrainian state body responsible for prisoner exchanges did not confirm the incident, but urged caution over “enemy propaganda resources about the crash”. Ukrainian military intelligence later confirmed that the planned prisoner exchange had not taken place on Wednesday.
The Ukrainska Pravda newspaper initially cited sources which said Kyiv’s armed forces had shot down the plane but later withdrew the report.
Later, Ukraine’s military accused the Russian army of using military transport aircraft to deliver missiles to the Belgorod region to perform cross-border attacks in recent weeks.
“With this in mind, the Ukrainian armed forces will continue to take measures to destroy delivery vehicles and control airspace to eliminate the terrorist threat, including in the Belgorod-Kharkiv direction,” the statement said.
This month, the two countries announced the largest exchange of prisoners since the start of the war, involving the return of more than 200 soldiers from each side in a deal mediated by the United Arab Emirates.
The Belgorod region, which borders Ukraine, is a vital stop on Russian supply lines. It has come under extensive shelling and drone attacks for months including a missile strike on the region’s capital in December that killed at least 25 people."

We look at some of the cases:
Defendants on trial for peaceful protest were forbidden from mentioning the words climate change, fuel poverty or the civil rights movement when they were on trial for public nuisance. Several people, including a social worker, David Nixon, and the Dorset councillor Giovanna Lewis, were jailed for contempt of court when they defied the restrictions to explain their motivations for taking action to the jury.
A retired social worker, Trudi Warner, is being prosecuted for contempt of court for holding up a sign outside a court defending the right of juries to decide a case on their conscience. The decision to prosecute was made by the then solicitor general Michael Tomlinson KC, a minister and the Conservative MP for Mid Dorset and North Poole.
Stephen Gingell, 57, was jailed for six months after pleading guilty to taking part in a peaceful slow march protest on a London road. The sentence is thought to be the first jailing under the Public Order Act 2023, which includes an offence of “interference with key national infrastructure”. Gingell is appealing.
Civil injunctions have been issued to hundreds of individuals. National Highways has injunctions covering 4,300 miles of motorways and major A roads. Anyone who breaches this injunction faces imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine. Any corporation can apply for a civil injunction, and individuals can be punished without a trial.
Marcus Decker and Morgan Trowland made history as the peaceful protesters who have received the longest jail sentences in modern history in the UK when they were sentenced to two years and seven months, and three years respectively for public nuisance. They climbed the Queen Elizabeth II bridge over the Dartford Crossing and unveiled a banner for Just Stop Oil in 2022. The longest jail term issued to the suffragettes was three months."
6XJL6PM413_BEW1RN0L69ZYD2V,Democrats sound alarm over AI robocall to voters mimicking Biden,Martin Pengelly,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/22/biden-fake-robocalls-new-hampshire,"A prominent New Hampshire Democrat said the makers of a robocall mimicking the voice of Joe Biden and encouraging Democrats not to vote in the primary on Tuesday should be “prosecuted to the fullest extent” for attempting “an attack on democracy” itself.
“I want them to be prosecuted to the fullest extent possible because this is an attack on democracy,” Kathy Sullivan, a former state party chair, told NBC News, adding that as an attorney, she believes the call could break several laws.
“I’m not going to let it go. I want to know who’s paying for it? Who knew about it? Who benefits?”
As an investigation began, the New Hampshire attorney general, John Formella, said voters should “disregard the contents of this message entirely”.
NBC released a recording of the call.
“What a bunch of malarkey,” it began, using a term so characteristic of the 81-year-old president it has been widely used in merchandising and meme-making.
“You know the value of voting Democratic,” the voice said. “Our votes count. It’s important that you save your vote for the November election. We’ll need your help in electing Democrats up and down the ticket.
“Voting this Tuesday only enables the Republicans in their quest to elect Donald Trump again. Your vote makes a difference in November, not this Tuesday. If you would like to be removed from future calls, please press two now.”
Sullivan’s phone number was included.
Biden’s name will not be on the Democratic ballot on Tuesday, because New Hampshire went against an official reorganisation of the primary calendar which placed South Carolina first.
Sullivan leads Granite for America, a Super Pac evoking New Hampshire’s “Granite state” nickname and urging Democrats to back Biden as a write-in candidate.
Sullivan told NBC she had received calls citing the supposed message from Biden, including one from a woman who said the president had called her.
Whoever made the robocall “obviously … wants to hurt Joe Biden”, Sullivan said.
In a statement, Sullivan added: “This call links back to my personal cellphone number without my permission. It is outright election interference, and clearly an attempt to harass me and other New Hampshire voters who are planning to write-in Joe Biden on Tuesday.”
A spokesperson for Dean Phillips, the Minnesota congressman mounting an outsider bid for the Democratic nomination, told NBC: “Any effort to discourage voters is disgraceful and an unacceptable affront to democracy. The potential use of AI to manipulate voters is deeply disturbing.”
On Saturday, OpenAI, the maker of the ChatGPT artificial intelligence tool, told the Washington Post it had banned the maker of a bot that mimicked Phillips and was commissioned by a Super Pac supporting him.
“We recently removed a developer account that was knowingly violating our API usage policies which disallow political campaigning, or impersonating an individual without consent,” OpenAI said.
The Biden campaign did not comment on the New Hampshire call. A Trump campaign spokesperson told NBC: “Not us, we have nothing to do with it.”
News of the deepfake call comes amid a push for the federal government to regulate the use of such technology in campaigns. Outside groups, academics and some politicians have flagged concerns that AI could create chaos during elections at a time when US voters are susceptible to misinformation.
A petition from advocacy group Public Citizen calls on the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to regulate the use of AI in campaign ads.
The FEC chair, Sean Cooksey, told the Washington Post the agency is working on making rules for AI and reviewing public comments submitted after the petition was filed. But he said the agency would not resolve the issue until “early summer”, well into the campaign season.
Public Citizen has accused the FEC of “slow-walking the issue” and called on Congress to act.
“The political deepfake moment is here,” the Public Citizen president, Robert Weissman, said in a press release on Monday. “Policymakers must rush to put in place protections or we’re facing electoral chaos. The New Hampshire deepfake is a reminder of the many ways that deepfakes can sow confusion and perpetuate fraud.”
While the federal government figures out what, if anything, to do about AI in campaign ads, some state lawmakers have filed bills to address the practice."
70H54JA0JQ_DHU6NEWZBATG8ZR,Supreme court to hear appeal from Oklahoma death row prisoner Richard Glossip,_,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/22/supreme-court-execution-appeal-oklahoma-richard-glossip,"The US supreme court on Monday said it will hear an appeal from Oklahoma death row inmate Richard Glossip, who has steadfastly maintained his innocence and averted multiple attempts by the state to execute him.
Glossip was sentenced for a 1997 murder-for-hire of the owner of the motel where he worked.
The case will not be argued until the fall.
Glossip now has the support of the state’s Republican attorney general, Gentner Drummond, who says Glossip’s life should be spared because he did not get a fair trial.
“Public confidence in the death penalty requires the highest standard of reliability, so it is appropriate that the US supreme court will review this case,” Drummond said in a statement on Monday. “As Oklahoma’s chief law officer, I will continue fighting to ensure justice is done in this case and every other.”
John Mills, an attorney for Glossip, said his client is innocent. “He has no criminal history, no history of misconduct during his entire time in prison, and has maintained his innocence throughout a quarter century wrongfully on death row. It is time – past time – for his nightmare to be over,” Mills said in a statement.
The supreme court blocked the latest effort to execute Glossip in early May.
Despite Drummond’s doubts about the trial, an Oklahoma appeals court upheld Glossip’s conviction, and the state’s pardon and parole board deadlocked in a vote to grant him clemency.
But Drummond also has said he does not believe Glossip is innocent of the murder-for-hire killing of his former boss, Barry Van Treese, in 1997. Another man, Justin Sneed, admitted robbing and killing Van Treese after Glossip promised to pay him $10,000. Sneed received a life sentence in exchange for his testimony and was the key witness against Glossip.
Two separate independent investigations have revealed problems with the prosecution’s case.
Drummond said that Sneed lied on the witness stand about his psychiatric condition and his reason for taking the mood-stabilizing drug lithium and that prosecutors knew Sneed was lying.
Also, evidence was destroyed, Drummond said.
Some Republican state lawmakers who support the death penalty have joined the growing chorus of Glossip supporters who are seeking to overturn his conviction.
Glossip’s case has been to the supreme court before. He was given a reprieve in 2015, although the court later ruled 5-4 against him in a case involving the drugs used in lethal executions.
Glossip has been just hours away from being executed three times. His last scheduled execution, in September 2015, was halted just moments before he was to be led to the death chamber when prison officials realized they had received the wrong lethal drug. That mix-up helped prompt a nearly seven-year moratorium on the death penalty in Oklahoma.
Glossip’s case attracted international attention after the actor Susan Sarandon – who won an Academy Award for her portrayal of the death penalty opponent Sister Helen Prejean in the 1995 movie Dead Man Walking – took up his cause in real life. Prejean herself has served as Glossip’s spiritual adviser and frequently visited him in prison. His case also was featured in the 2017 documentary film Killing Richard Glossip.
It’s exceedingly rare for a prosecutor to argue against executing a death row inmate. In a similar situation to Glossip’s a year ago, the justices ordered a Texas appeals court to look again at the case of a death row inmate who also had the backing of prosecutors. The inmate, Areli Escobar, had been convicted and sentenced to death based on forensic evidence that a judge later found to be flawed.
But the Texas court of criminal appeals overturned the judge’s order for a new trial, even though the newly elected prosecutor in Travis county, Texas, was no longer standing behind the conviction. When Escobar appealed to the supreme court, the prosecutor supported his bid. Escobar was not facing imminent execution.
The supreme court will hear Glossip’s case with only eight justices. Justice Neil Gorsuch is not taking part, presumably because he was involved at an earlier stage of the case when he was an appeals court judge.
The high court had been weighing Glossip’s appeal since late September. The reason for the delay in acting on it is unclear."
70L1PO6TGK_ABO5AT6IRWKMKPJ,How an alleged office romance could derail the Trump election interference case,Sam Levine,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/25/fani-willis-nathan-wade-georgia-election-interference-trump,"After spending nearly three years seeking to hold Donald Trump and his allies accountable for trying to overturn the 2020 election, the Fulton county district attorney, Fani Willis, faces a series of imminent, critical choices that could upend her consequential case against the former president and 14 remaining co-defendants.
“The stakes could hardly be higher,” said Clark Cunningham, a law professor and ethics expert at Georgia State University.
Michael Roman, a seasoned Republican operative and one of the defendants in the wide-ranging racketeering case, filed a motion earlier this month seeking the disqualification of Willis and Nathan Wade, an outside lawyer hired by Willis in 2021 to assist with the Trump case. In court filings, Roman alleged Willis and Wade were in a romantic relationship and Wade had used some of the more than $650,000 he earned from his work for her to pay for vacations for the two of them. Bank records made public last week showed Wade had paid for tickets for himself and Willis to California in 2023 and Miami in 2022.
Neither Willis nor Wade has confirmed or denied a romantic relationship yet, and Willis has said she will respond in a court filing due on 2 February. A hearing on the request is set for 15 February. Willis has said all of the special prosecutors she hired were paid the same rate.
While experts cautioned they were waiting for Willis and Wade to respond to Roman’s claims, it has already caused a headache for Willis, whose case has long been seen as one of the strongest efforts to hold Trump accountable for 2020. Because the case is in Georgia state court, it is also immune from Trump’s interference should he win the election.
“As a legal matter, I don’t see much of anything as of yet that would make me think that a disqualification is likely,” said Anthony Michael Kreis, a law professor at Georgia State University who has closely followed the case. “In terms of the political bucket, it is both an optics disaster, but it’s also been a lot of political malpractice from the office for not responding. So this drip, drip, drip is a problem.”
A disqualification would upend the case against Trump and significantly delay it. If the judge Scott McAfee were to disqualify Willis’s office from handling the case, the executive director of the Prosecuting Attorneys Council of Georgia would appoint a replacement. There’s no time limit on how long that could take. “It could entirely derail the entire enterprise,” Kreis said.
Wade was a municipal judge and well-known lawyer in the Atlanta suburbs with little prosecutorial experience before Willis hired him to work on the Trump case. The two met in 2019 during a legal education course for judges, and he became a confidante and mentor to Willis. Willis told the New York Times in 2022 that Wade was not a first choice to work on the prosecution team, but that she approached him after other more experienced lawyers turned her down. Wade was tepid, too, she told the Times, telling her he didn’t have much prosecutorial experience. She eventually convinced him to join the team. “I need someone I can trust,” she told the Times.
Roman’s accusation has prompted national interest in Wade’s ongoing divorce. Willis was subpoenaed for a deposition as part of that case, but a judge this week put off requiring her to testify.
Regardless of what happens legally, Trump is likely to use the salacious allegation to continue to try to undermine Willis’s credibility. While his lawyers did not join Roman’s motion, Trump has already weighed in.
“When is the Great State of Georgia dropping the FAKE LITIGATION against me and the others? ELECTION INTERFERENCE! The case is a FRAUD, just like D.A. Fani Willis and her ‘LOVER’,” he wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform on 20 January.
Norman Eisen, a former “ethics czar” under Barack Obama, has been supportive of Willis, and argued that disqualification isn’t merited under Georgia law. Still, he has called for Wade to step aside.
“Questions about gifts and related matters go to Willis’s and Wade’s obligations to the Fulton County District Attorney’s office, and have no connection to assuring the defendants a fair trial,” he wrote in an essay in Just Security with the former US attorney Joyce White Vance and Richard Painter, a former ethics czar under George W Bush.
“Although the Georgia law on disqualifying a prosecutor would permit Wade to remain on the case as well, in our view he should voluntarily step down. His continued presence will create a distraction, and his departure, in addition to an on-the-record hearing in court, is the best path to dispense with any lingering concerns,” they wrote.
Willis has had a brush with disqualification already. In July of 2022, when a special purpose grand jury was still investigating the case, she held a political fundraiser for Charlie Bailey, the Democratic opponent of Burt Jones, the Republican nominee for lieutenant governor, who served as a fake elector for Trump in 2020. Jones was under investigation by the special purpose grand jury at the time. Judge Robert CI McBurney disqualified Willis’s office from handling any part of the case against Jones.
“An investigation of this significance, garnering the public attention it necessarily does and touching so many political nerves in our society, cannot be burdened by legitimate doubts about the District Attorney’s motives,” McBurney wrote in his disqualification order. A replacement special prosecutor still has not been appointed.
McBurney also admonished the DA’s office during a hearing, calling it “a ‘What are you thinking?’ moment”.

Stephen Gillers, a legal ethics expert at New York University, agreed that there was no conduct identified in Roman’s motion that would cause the indictment to be dismissed – an opinion shared by other experts.
“Indictments do not get dismissed because of behavior like this. Nothing about the allegations suggests that the indictment is in any way tainted,” he said in an interview.
He also agreed that Willis’s conduct likely would not result in disqualification. And the fact that Wade was paid a high hourly rate was not in itself grounds for him to be disqualified. “Every lawyer who bills by the hour has that interest. Hourly billing is quite common nationally. So of course the lawyer has an interest in a continuation of a case,” he said.
Still, Gillers said he was concerned by the vagueness of the invoices Wade had submitted and that were approved by the Fulton county district attorney’s office. They would not pass muster at most government agencies or corporations, he said.
“They’re generic, they are in whole numbers. Eight hours, six hours, seven hours. They don’t break down the particular tasks that were done. For someone like me, looking at that, that’s a red flag,” he said.
“In my view, he has to step aside, unless the board of commissioners or other Fulton county official, knowing all the facts, approves of the arrangement, and designates someone other than Willis to review Wade’s bills,” he continued. “His position is tainted by the romantic relationship unless there is informed consent from the appropriate authority in Fulton county.”
By filing the allegations as part of the court case, and not directly with a disciplinary body, Roman may have made a strategic decision to try and muddy the legal issues in the case, understanding the optics for Willis would look bad, he added.
Cunningham said he was waiting for more information to evaluate the merits of Roman’s disqualification claim. But regardless of what McAfee rules, he said, there are likely to be efforts to appeal that could drag out the case. Willis, he said, should step aside from the case and let a chief deputy or someone else take over and decide whether Wade continues on the case.
“The argument that the case as it moves forward is being motivated improperly goes away. That is absolutely the best way to make sure that the motion to disqualify isn’t granted,” he said.
“It minimizes it just to say it’s a question of optics, though that’s certainly the case,” he said. “Right now, they’re the story. Every day. And that’s bad in every possible way. It’s not good for public confidence in this case, which is needed.”"
70SWO2W8KY_AMLI7Y31055Q9G9,North Korea demolishes symbol of hope for reunification with South – report,Justin McCurry,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/24/north-korea-demolishes-the-arch-of-reunification-monument-south-korea-unity-hopes-kim-jong-un,"North Korea has demolished a monument that symbolised hope for reconciliation with the South, days after the regime’s leader, Kim Jong-un, said the peaceful reunification of the two Koreas was no longer possible.
In the latest sign of rising tensions on the peninsula, the Arch of Reunification – built in 2000 after a landmark inter-Korean summit – has disappeared from satellite imagery, according to the NK News website. It was not immediately clear when or how it had been taken down, NK News said.
Kim, whose tone has become markedly belligerent in recent weeks, described the concrete arch – which shows two women, one each from the North and South, holding an emblem of the outline of the Korean peninsula – as an “eyesore” at a speech this month to the Supreme People’s Assembly, the North’s rubber-stamp parliament.
He added that the North’s constitution should be amended to reflect South Korea’s new status as his country’s “principal enemy” – effectively ending decades of official policy that stressed the eventual reunification of the autocratic North with the democratic South.
The 30-metre arch, formally known as the Monument to the Three Charters for National Reunification, symbolised self-reliance, peace and national cooperation, according to South Korean government records.
Located on Reunification Highway, which connects Pyongyang to the heavily armed border with the South, it was reportedly erected to commemorate plans for reunification put forward by Kim’s grandfather and North Korean founder Kim Il-sung.
While purely symbolic, its reported removal will add to fears that North Korea has taken a more provocative course in its relations with the South and its allies, months before the US presidential elections.
The regime claimed it had launched its first spy satellite in November, and last week said it had test-fired a new ballistic missile tipped with a hypersonic manoeuvrable warhead. On Wednesday, South Korea’s military said the North had launched several cruise missiles into the sea, a fortnight after it fired artillery rounds near the countries’ disputed maritime border.
The North has used missile launches to protest joint military exercises by South Korean and US forces, which the regime considers a rehearsal for an invasion.
Asked if the provocative tone of recent North Korean announcements – including one in which it said it was “preparing for nuclear war” – was cause for concern, White House spokesperson John Kirby said: “We’re watching this very, very closely.”
He added: “I would just tell you that we remain confident that the defensive posture that we’re maintaining on the peninsula is appropriate to the risk.”
There is little prospect of a return to the era of cross-border rapprochement symbolised by the monument.
Under its conservative president, Yoon Suk Yeol, South Korea has taken a harder line against Pyongyang, vowing immediate and tough responses to North Korean provocations.
In response, the North has vowed to “wipe out” its neighbour if attacked by South Korean and US forces. Late last year, Pyongyang said a 2018 agreement with the South designed to de-escalate military tensions was no longer valid.
The Supreme People’s Assembly last week abolished government agencies that had overseen engagement with the South.

727MGFM1JM_EO1GS7W36M9NJ6M,UN security council to hear calls for Israel to let more aid into Gaza,Patrick Wintour,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/23/gaza-aid-un-security-council-israel,"Calls for Israel to allow more aid into Gaza and to accept a future Palestinian state as necessary for its own security are expected to dominate a meeting of the UN security council in New York on Tuesday.
Before the meeting, the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, met his Iranian counterpart, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, in New York to urge Israel to agree to a ceasefire and warn the US not to fuel the spread of the conflict.
The meeting comes against a backdrop of a second US-UK coordinated raid against Houthi strongholds in Yemen, as well as intensified fighting in southern Gaza.
Amir-Abdollahian said he had told the UK foreign secretary, David Cameron, in Davos last week that “your action in escalating tension in the Red Sea and against Yemen is a strategic mistake”.
Turkey’s Hakan Fidan and France’s Stéphane Séjourné are among the foreign ministers who have flown to New York for the security council debate. Attenders are likely to hear extended criticism that Israel has not acted on a resolution passed by the council before Christmas demanding a big increase in aid deliveries to Gaza.
In a flavour of the concern about aid flows into Gaza, the UK Foreign Office briefed that Tariq Ahmad, the Middle East minister, would tell the security council that the humanitarian crisis was “worsening daily, suffering is unacceptable, and our priority must be to alleviate it”. He will add that “an immediate pause is now necessary to get life-saving aid in and hostages out”.
US officials continue to defend Israel’s right to take military action, despite the public falling out between Joe Biden and Benjamin Netanyahu last week over Netanyahu’s open rejection of a two-state solution as a way out of the crisis.
Among US Democrats, support for Netanyahu is eroding. Key Democratic senators such as Chris Van Hollen, a member of the Senate foreign affairs committee, have joined calls for an immediate ceasefire. Van Hollen is now one of 20 Democratic senators calling for aid to Israel to be made conditional on the application of international humanitarian law.
Van Hollen said: “As many families of those kidnapped have stated, PM Netanyahu has deprioritised the return of their loved ones, including Americans, to prolong the war and postpone his own political reckoning, even as we face the rising risk of a regional war that sucks in the US.”
He claimed Netanyahu was “now publicly stiff-arming President Biden and his postwar plan for a two-state solution”.
In Brussels, the EU foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, presented to EU foreign ministers a 12-point plan leading to a two-state solution. He challenged Israel: “Which are the other solutions they have in mind? To make all the Palestinians leave? To kill … them?”
Borrell said: “I think more deaths, more destruction, more hardship for the Gaza people, for the Palestinian people, will not help to defeat Hamas or its ideology. It will not bring more security to Israel.”
He said the number of aid trucks reaching Gaza – averaging 100 a day – was not acceptable. On Monday the number was 66.
Borrell’s plan did not receive immediate unanimous support but Annalena Baerbock, the foreign minister of Germany, one of Israel’s staunchest allies, said a two-state solution was “the only solution and all those who don’t want to know anything about it have not yet put forward any other alternative”.
She called for humanitarian breaks, not a ceasefire, and for the liberation of the hostages and more humanitarian aid in Gaza.
Biden’s aides, long suspicious of Netanyahu, are now having to gauge whether the Israeli prime minister is calculating that his own chances of political survival are strengthened by a public confrontation with the US president.
The strategy has risks for Netanyahu. An Israeli poll found that 53% of Israelis believe that what drives Netanyahu’s decision-making during the war against Hamas is what personally benefits him, while only 33% believe Netanyahu’s actions are for the good of the country."

The defeat of the government came shortly after eleven o’clock after the close of the debate, which had been wound up for Labour by Mr MacDonald, the prime minister-to-be. After the defeat, which was greeted with loud opposition cheering, the amended address in reply to the king’s speech, was carried by 328 votes to 251 – a majority of 77 (five more than for the Labour amendment now embodied in it).
Mr Baldwin will tender his resignation to the king this morning after meeting the cabinet. The king will then send for Mr Ramsay MacDonald who, our political correspondent states, will take up office as premier and foreign secretary to-day.
Mr Ramsay MacDonald, in a statement to the press at midnight, said:
It is not a moment for elation. It is a terrible responsibility. We shall have to do our best to face it, fail or succeed. I can only say this – that no government that was ever responsible for the affairs of this country will more honestly try to serve it. I am very proud of the Labour party and it will be a great inspiration to every working man and working woman in the country to work and to sacrifice to do their party honour and to enable it to succeed.

London, Monday nightThe event fantastically imagined and described by generations of novelists and dreamt of by enthusiasts throughout the kingdom took place quietly enough to-night, with no excited crowd round the Houses of Parliament and no great meetings in the labouring districts waiting expectantly for the tidings. The coming into power of Labour came quietly, almost apologetically, with most people asleep in bed, and even the enthusiasts disputing whether it had come at the right time and what it could do. England’s distrust of high notes is as deep as ever. “Labour between two policemen” has been one favourite picture of late of the coming government by Labour. No doubt it consoled many people. But Labour does not see it that way.
A pessimistOn such an historic occasion as to-night history expects historical utterances. Here is one made to a friend to-night by a true blue Tory and Protectionist of the old school: “The awful thought is creeping over me that they may form a very efficient government.”
From our parliamentary correspondent23 January 1924
Westminster, Tuesday nightIf it were permissible to apply the wardrobe style of parliamentary commentary to masculine as well as feminine attire, one might be tempted to say that the only external sign of the change of government at to-day’s brief sitting of the Commons was Mr Ramsay MacDonald’s frock-coat – a form of garment rarely seen in these days even at Westminster, except in association with an official visit to Buckingham Palace.
In the old-fashioned phrase the frock-coat spoke volumes, all in terms of the privy council, the kissing of hands, the acceptance of seals, and the circulation of dispatch-boxes. Not a syllable escaped the new premier’s lips throughout the duration of the sitting, but to see him in his significant sartorial trappings, was enough. Both at his coming and his going out his followers cheered their gravely preoccupied leader to the echo.
An untimely thanksgiving As soon as the preliminary business was over Mr Baldwin rose to announce that as the result of Monday night’s vote “the government have tendered their resignation to the king and his Majesty has been graciously pleased to accept.” Before, however, he could proceed with his statement the Conservative leader was checked by a sudden outburst of enthusiasm from his supporters, some of whom sprang to their feet in order to give more forcible expression to their feelings.
With unimpaired self-control and speaking in his usual matter-of-fact manner, Mr Baldwin then made the announcement of the king’s acceptance of his resignation. “Thank God for that,’’ exclaimed a deep voice from the Labour benches, but despite its apparent piety the thank-offering seemed to be generally resented as equally tactless and untimely. On the whole, it must be owned, Labour behaved with remarkable decorum in its hour of triumph, refraining even from speech, apart from the solitary and inevitable exception of Mr Jack Jones.

Surely there can never have been a more interesting moment in our political history than the present. Plenty, no doubt, there have been more perilous, exciting, or catastrophic, but was there ever one so unlooked for, so full of strange possibilities, so anomalous superficially and, at bottom, so perfectly illustrating at once the genius of our people and the spirit of the constitution? In what other country would it have been possible for a new party representing what abroad would be called the Extreme Left in politics, a large proportion of whose most prominent men are drawn from the humblest rank of society, to enter on the direction of affairs not only without exciting any violent alarm but with the cordial goodwill of the other parties in the State?Continue reading"

To follow his various accounts online is to imagine a world simmering with constant sexual potential, always ready to boil over into hardcore scenarios, perhaps even involving you, his loyal follower. But even if the title of the film hasn’t clued you into the fact that Argentinian director Manuel Abramovich’s docudrama is not an enthusiastic commercial for this lifestyle, the first scene in the film will get you up to speed pretty quickly: Lalo stands alone in a busy street, people passing him by. He breaks down and begins to weep, an image of isolation in the hustle of modern living.
This isn’t an especially rare theme in modern independent queer cinema; musings on a life where explicit videos are common currency and emotional connection is a rare and seemingly unattainable thing are 10 a penny. It’s easy to see why this is a popular sub-genre – film-makers get to be existential, while also showing plenty of ass. Everybody’s happy! (This ruse is hardly the preserve of queer cinema, either; straight European arthouse has had the playbook nailed since the 1970s.) As far as I know, this sub-genre has no name, but “pornomelancholia” would actually work quite well.
However, the way Lalo’s loneliness is juxtaposed with the spicier elements of his life means this is a well-made example, with the specificity of Lalo’s world making it especially interesting. A good chunk of the film is devoted to a shoot for a pornographic film based on the Mexican revolution, with scenes alternating from loving showcases of toned bodies, to downbeat discussions between the cast around everything from HIV status to their relative happiness with their lot, to the nuts (as it were) and bolts of making a pornographic film.

7CV4RW3AIR_YROP7YETV69NZ51,"Alabama inmate executed with nitrogen gas was ‘shaking violently’ for 22 minutes, witnesses say",Ed Pilkington,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/25/alabama-executes-kenneth-smith-nitrogen-gas,"Alabama has carried out the first execution of a death row prisoner in the US using nitrogen gas, an untested procedure which the prisoner’s lawyers had argued amounted to a form of cruel and unusual punishment banned under the US constitution.
Kenneth Smith, 58, was pronounced dead at 8.25pm on Thursday evening at an Alabama prison after breathing pure nitrogen gas through a face mask to cause oxygen deprivation. The execution took about 22 minutes.
Alabama claimed that the new nitrogen gas method was “perhaps the most humane method of execution ever devised”. But eyewitness statements from reporters present in the death chamber suggested that Smith’s death was anything but humane.
Marty Roney of the Montgomery Advertiser reported that between 7.57pm local time and 8.01pm, “Smith writhed and convulsed on the gurney. He took deep breaths, his body shaking violently with his eyes rolling in the back of his head.”
Roney’s report continued: “Smith clenched his fists, his legs shook … He seemed to be gasping for air. The gurney shook several times.”
The Rev Jeff Hood, Smith’s spiritual adviser, was at Smith’s side for the execution, and said prison officials in the room “were visibly surprised at how bad this thing went”.
“What we saw was minutes of someone struggling for their life,” Hood said.
“It appeared that Smith was holding his breath as long as he could,” the Alabama corrections commissioner, John Hamm, later told a press conference.
The White House declared the execution “very troubling”, with press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre saying on Friday afternoon that Joe Biden has “deep concerns about the death penalty and whether it’s consistent with our values”.
The execution had been scheduled to begin at 6pm local time at the Holman correctional facility in Atmore, Alabama, but it was delayed as the US supreme court weighed his final appeal. Shortly before 8pm, the court denied that appeal, allowing the execution to proceed.
Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who along with two other liberal justices dissented, wrote: “Having failed to kill Smith on its first attempt, Alabama has selected him as its ‘guinea pig’ to test a method of execution never attempted before. The world is watching.”
Smith’s lawyers had argued that to go ahead with executing him under these untried conditions would violate constitutional protections against cruelty.
They also unsuccessfully argued that Smith was being dealt with doubly unlawfully by dint of him having been subjected to an execution procedure once before. In November 2022, the state strapped him for four hours to a gurney and punctured his arms and legs in a failed attempt to find a vein through which to kill him using lethal drugs.
That placed Smith in a highly rare class of an inmate who could describe what it was like to survive an execution.
The new death protocol adopted by Alabama and used to kill Smith involved placing an industrial-style respirator mask over the prisoner’s head and then forcing him to breathe pure nitrogen. The technique, known as “nitrogen hypoxia”, leads to fatal oxygen deprivation.
Days before he was executed, Smith told the Guardian in a phone call from his prison cell that he was not ready to die. He had been diagnosed with PTSD caused by his first failed execution attempt, and was suffering from sleeplessness and anxiety.
He said he was terrified by the prospect of vomiting in the mask leading to death by drowning on the contents of his own stomach, a gruesome possibility that was raised by his lawyers in court.
In his Guardian interview, Smith also appealed to the American people to show mercy for those like him facing judicial killings. “You know, brother, I’d say, ‘Leave room for mercy’. That just doesn’t exist in Alabama. Mercy really doesn’t exist in this country when it comes to difficult situations like mine,” he said.
The execution took about 22 minutes. Smith appeared to remain conscious for several of those minutes, at times appearing to shake and writhe on the gurney and pull against his restraints. This was followed by several minutes of heavy breathing, until his breathing was no longer perceptible.
In a final statement, Smith said: “Tonight Alabama causes humanity to take a step backwards … I’m leaving with love, peace and light.”
He made the “I love you sign” with his hands toward family members who were witnesses.
“Thank you for supporting me. Love, love all of you,” Smith said.
Smith was convicted of the 1988 murder for hire of a pastor’s wife, Elizabeth Sennett. He and another man were each allegedly paid $1,000 to kill her by Charles Sennett, a minister in the Church of Christ who went on to take his own life after suspicion fell on him.
Several of Sennett’s relatives attended the execution and told reporters they had forgiven Sennett’s killers. “Nothing that happened here today is going to bring Mom back,” Mike Sennett said. “It’s a bittersweet day, we’re not going to be jumping around, hooping and hollering, hooraying and all that, that’s not us. We’re glad this day is over.”
In the run-up to the execution, Alabama had come under a raft of domestic and international criticism. Hundreds of Jewish clergy and community leaders across the US signed a letter organised by L’chaim! Jews Against the Death Penalty, calling for a halt.
“Just the idea of using gas for executions is an affront to our community,” the co-founder of L’chaim, Mike Zoosman, said. “The Nazi legacy of experimentation to find the most expeditious way to rid our community of undesirable prisoners is an undercurrent for anyone who is aware of that history that should not be repeated in Alabama, or anywhere.”
Smith’s pending death was also denounced by UN experts on arbitrary executions and torture who fiercely opposed what they decried as a human experiment.
In his Guardian interview, Smith said he feared that if Alabama carried out his execution it would put the new killing method of nitrogen hypoxia on the map. He had a warning for his fellow Americans.
“I fear that it will be successful, and you will have a nitrogen system coming to your state very soon,” he said.

7KNSZ53MI7_J125E6X45IRCJBR,Downing Street denies having anti-BBC agenda after bias accusations,Pippa Crerar,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/jan/22/downing-street-denies-having-anti-bbc-agenda-after-bias-accusations,"Downing Street has denied that the government is pursuing an agenda against the BBC after the culture secretary, Lucy Frazer, accused the corporation of bias and argued that it needed to adapt or risk losing the trust of audiences.
Rishi Sunak said impartiality was an “important tenet” of the UK media industry while on a visit, but later his official spokesperson declined to say whether the prime minister agreed with Frazer’s comments about the BBC.
Asked whether it was right to say the government was pursuing an agenda against the BBC, the spokesperson replied: “No. This is rightly about ensuring the BBC is able to continue to thrive long into the future.”
Ofcom, the media watchdog, will be given more powers to investigate the BBC, while the organisation’s board could get responsibility over its complaints process, under proposals in a midterm review of its governance and regulations.
Frazer told Times Radio on Monday: “This isn’t about the government. This is about impartiality and not just about politics. Audiences are feeling like impartiality and the BBC is on a downward trajectory.”
She said the BBC was “a fantastic public institution”, adding: “It’s really important that it maintains the public’s trust. And what we’ve been hearing is that some audiences think it’s biased.”
When it was put to her that perceptions are not necessarily reality, she said: “There are only perceptions and perceptions are important. What’s important about the BBC is that it’s funded by the public, so the perception of audiences, of the public, are important.”
Asked by Sky News whether she personally thought the BBC was biased, Frazer said: “I think that on occasions it has been biased.”
However, she struggled to give examples of bias, repeatedly citing the BBC’s reporting of an attack on a hospital in Gaza, which was initially attributed to Israel but which western intelligence later concluded was the result of a misfiring Hamas rocket.
Labour’s shadow culture secretary, Thangam Debbonaire, criticised Frazer’s remarks, posting on X: “Just the latest in a long line of secretaries of state for culture wars. Attacking and undermining one of our greatest institutions at every chance they get.
“Instead of using it as a punching bag the government should be supporting the BBC to create wealth, jobs and joy.”
On a visit to the National Film and Television school in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, Sunak said: “I think all elements of the media industry have to be subject to the same impartiality rules. I think that’s what people would expect and that’s what makes our media institutions so great.
“We have a free and fair press and impartiality is at the heart of what makes the BBC a strong institution.”
Frazer also said it was not appropriate for the BBC to have “criminal tools in its armoury” to prosecute people for not paying their TV licence fee. She has said she will look at the prosecutions in a review into BBC funding.
The midterm review did not look at how the BBC should be funded. In December, Frazer confirmed that the licence fee, which funds much of the corporation’s operations, would rise by £10.50 to £169.50 a year.
The BBC board, in a strongly worded statement, said the below-inflation increase would “require further changes on top of the major savings that we are already delivering”. The BBC’s royal charter – which sets out the corporation’s mission, purpose and funding model – is up for renewal at the end of 2027.
Ofcom received 918 complaints about BBC impartiality last year, accounting for 39% of all the grievances it received about the broadcaster, and an increase on the 594 bias complaints it received in 2021-22, which equated to 19% of the total.
Since the current charter came into force in 2017, the BBC has upheld or partially upheld 29 breaches of impartiality, including four last year.
A BBC spokesperson said “no other organisation takes its commitment to impartiality more seriously” and the organisation had plans to further improve standards.
“We know this matters to audiences and the BBC continues to be the number one source for trusted news, with the highest scores for impartiality and accuracy,” they said."
7KTILQJWM2_D9D30CHYFUTMN9B,Hamas official says ‘no chance’ hostages will return to Israel after Netanyahu rejects deal,_,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/22/israel-gaza-war-hamas-hostages-release-benjamin-netanyahu-rejects-deal,"The prospect of a deal to release the remaining hostages held by Hamas appeared to recede on Sunday after a Hamas official said Benjamin Netanyahu’s rejection of their conditions meant there was “no chance” of their return.
Netanyahu had earlier dismissed the militant group’s conditions to end the war, which he said included leaving Hamas in power and Israel’s complete withdrawal from the territory.
A Hamas official, Sami Abu Zuhri, told Reuters the Israeli prime minister’s refusal to end the military offensive in Gaza “means there is no chance for the return of the [Israeli] captives”, which are estimated to be 130 in number.
Netanyahu is facing mounting pressure to secure the release the hostages, but said in a statement that the Hamas demands included “the withdrawal of our forces from Gaza, the release of all the murderers and rapists … and leaving Hamas intact.”
“I reject outright the terms of surrender of the monsters of Hamas,” he added.
On Sunday evening, family members of hostages began a protest outside Benjamin Netanyahu’s private home in Jerusalem. Israel’s Hostages and Missing Families Forum said the protesters would remain until “the prime minister agrees to a deal to return the hostages”.
In a separate statement, the advocacy group demanded that Netanyahu “clearly state that we will not abandon civilians, soldiers, and others kidnapped in the October debacle”.
“If the prime minister decides to sacrifice the hostages, he should show leadership and honestly share his position with the Israeli public.”
Under a deal brokered in late November by the United States, Qatar and Egypt, more than 100 of the estimated 240 hostages taken captive to Gaza during an attack by Hamas militants on 7 October were freed in exchange for the release of 240 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.
Since then, multiple attempts to secure another ceasefire have failed.
Netanyahu has repeatedly pledged to pursue the offensive in Gaza until “total victory”, but commentators in Israel have questioned the conduct of the war, arguing that the offensive’s goals are unrealistic, accusing the Israeli prime minister of indecision.
In his statement on Sunday, Netanyahu also repeated his strong line on the issue of Palestinian statehood. “I will not compromise on full Israeli security control of all territory west of the Jordan River,” he said.
On Saturday, Netanyahu rejected Joe Biden’s call for a Palestinian state after the war. His office said that in talks on Friday with the US president, Netanyahu “reiterated his policy that after Hamas is destroyed Israel must retain security control over Gaza to ensure that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel, a requirement that contradicts the demand for Palestinian sovereignty”.
On Sunday, Gaza’s health ministry announced that Israel’s war against Hamas had killed 25,000 Palestinians, with UN chief António Guterres describing the scale of civilian killings as “heartbreaking and utterly unacceptable”.
Most of the casualties were women and children, the ministry said, and thousands more bodies were likely to remain uncounted under rubble across Gaza.
Speaking at a global summit in the Ugandan capital of Kampala, Guterres denounced Israel’s three-month assault.
“Israel’s military operations have spread mass destruction and killed civilians on a scale unprecedented during my time as secretary general,” Guterres said at the opening of the G77+China, a coalition of 135 developing countries.

7LFY8OSOMD_JGBF21P9YK0QFF1,Tourists heading to Europe could face 14-hour queues at Dover from October,_,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/jan/25/tourists-heading-to-europe-could-face-14-hour-queues-at-dover-from-october,"Tourists heading to Europe could face waits of up to 14 hours at border controls under a scheme to be launched in October, MPs have been told.
The Port of Dover and the surrounding area could face significant disruption when the EU entry/exit system is introduced unless measures are taken to prevent delays, parliament’s European scrutiny committee has heard.
Ashford borough council, responsible for Dover, told the committee 14-hour queues were “a reasonable worst case” scenario if the scheme was implemented as planned.
The controls require people entering the EU to register their fingerprints and a photograph alongside their passport.
There have been multiple episodes of gridlocked traffic at the Port of Dover and surrounding roads in recent years, with post-Brexit checks adding to waiting times.
The tourist organisation Visit Kent expressed concerns that delays caused by the new system could have a knock-on effect on local businesses, which had been affected during previous periods of disruption.
Ashford council said 14-hour delays at the port was likely to lead to queues along the A20 and M20 that could block access to staff and tourist traffic at Eurotunnel in Folkestone.
Eurostar said without upgrades there could be queues in terminals of more than an hour at peak times. HS1, which runs UK high-speed rail services, said the decision not to enable online pre-registration would “put enormous pressure on infrastructure at St Pancras International”.
Downing Street sought to downplay the risks of delays. A No 10 spokesperson said: “On some of those scenarios, rightly we’re not going to get into hypotheticals about delays … but there are tried and tested contingency plans in place and a lot of work is managed by the Kent resilience forum so we will make sure we’re prepared and our focus remains on ensuring the scheme does not unnecessarily impact local communities or result in delays for travellers.
“We are working very closely as you would expect with the French, with all the port authorities, to ensure that travellers and passengers do not experience unnecessary delays – that work continues.”
The chair of the committee, Sir Bill Cash, said: “Queues of more than 14 hours, vehicles backed up along major roads, businesses starved of footfall: this evidence paints an alarming picture of the possible risks surrounding the entry-exit system’s implementation.
“Clearly, this policy could have a very serious impact, not only for tourists and travel operators but also for local businesses. I implore decision makers on both sides of the Channel to take note of this evidence.
“The scheme is due to be implemented in October; the clock is ticking, and these issues must be urgently addressed.”"
7MAP02OHXX_JGPJXIYRC46PI3H,‘We’ll never have the truth’: death of suspect Ian Bailey floors family of French film-maker,Kim Willsher,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/23/well-never-have-the-truth-death-of-suspect-ian-bailey-floors-family-of-french-film-maker,"Each time the killing of French film-maker Sophie Toscan du Plantier has made headlines in the last 27 years, it has taken her brother back to the moment he was asked by Irish police to identify his older sister’s body.
It is an image burned into Bertrand Bouniol’s memory, and he winces as he recalls it; Du Plantier’s head and face had been smashed with a 20kg (44lb) concrete block.
“I leant over the coffin and for one or two seconds I thought, no, that’s not Sophie. Her face had been redone and looked like it was made of wax. Then I saw her blonde hair and her hands and thought perhaps it is her. It was,” he said.
“It was an experience I wouldn’t wish on anyone. It’s always in my head.”
For the last almost three decades, Du Plantier’s family has tried to discover the truth behind her murder and see her killer brought to justice.
Now there is only frustration after the death of Ian Bailey, 66, the prime suspect. He was never brought to trial in Ireland, where prosecutors decided there was a lack of physical evidence, but was convicted in absentia of murdering the film-maker by a French court in 2015 and sentenced to 25 years.
Bailey, a British journalist, was twice arrested by Irish police and questioned about the murder. He repeatedly protested his innocence. After his conviction in the French court, he said: “All they’ve done is convict an innocent man who had nothing to do with the crime.”
In the last three decades books, documentaries, podcasts and films have been made about the case, but for the family there have been no answers, no closure.
Paris-based Bouniol, 64, said: “Now we will never know the details of what happened to my sister. This is frustrating and a great regret because for us the case will never be closed.”
Du Plantier, was living in Paris with her husband Daniel, the then president of the French film promotion agency Unifrance, and her son Pierre-Louis. She had visited Ireland as a teenager and bought the cottage where she was killed in the isolated town of Drinane near Schull, County Cork, in 1993 as a refuge and holiday home.
On 20 December 1996 she arrived in Ireland intending to return to Paris for Christmas but three days later, her body was discovered by a neighbour in a lane near the house. She was wearing nightclothes and boots and had been severely beaten.
The first the family knew was when Bouniol phoned a neighbour who looked after the house when Du Plantier was away late on 23 December 1996.
“She was crying and I didn’t understand anything she was saying. I just said: ‘Tell me, is it Sophie or not?’ She replied, yes it was Sophie. It was such a shock. It was like the sky had fallen in on us,” he said.
“We couldn’t imagine such a thing could happen in such a quiet region of Ireland. It never seemed a place of danger.”
Bouniol added: “The local police had never had to deal with anything like it, which perhaps explains their incompetence. The pathologist didn’t arrive for 28 hours and by then the police had walked all over the crime scene.”
Bailey had moved to Ireland 1991 and was living nearby. He was known to the Gardaí for domestic violence.
In Ireland people are divided: many convinced he was guilty; others considering him grievously wronged.
A French order demanding his extradition, which Ireland refused, was outstanding at the time of his death from a heart attack near his home in Bantry, County Cork, on Sunday.
Bouniol says he has no idea whether the Irish cold case investigation will be dropped.
“Hopefully it won’t and maybe now Bailey is dead witnesses who might have been afraid will come forward,” he adds.
Du Plantier’s uncle Jean-Pierre Gazeau, who set up an association to campaign for justice for his niece, said on Monday: “From the very beginning there was sufficient proof to have a trial in Ireland.
“He [Bailey] was convicted in France. To sum it up, for us he was the killer and now he is dead and the disappointment comes from the fact that we will never have a confession from his own mouth. We will never have the truth. We will never have justice. Those have always been our only objectives, not vengeance. The only person who could give us the truth is the person who committed the murder and now we do not have that.
“It’s been 27 years the family has campaigned. We want to know what happened. We can imagine all kind of things, have all manner of hypotheses but we want to know the details of what happened in the last seconds of Sophie’s life and that seems a legitimate thing for the family, friends and for justice.”
On Monday, Bouniol told his and Sophie’s father, Georges, 97, of Bailey’s death. Bouniol’s mother, Marguerite, is unwell and had not been told.
“My father took it badly. It was like a blow to the head,” he said. “We’ve had 27 years of this case bouncing back regularly and every time it takes us into it again.
“Firstly, Bailey – who in France is the killer – has escaped punishment and secondly we will never know what happened. All we are looking for is the truth. Now we will never learn it from the mouth of her killer. And it is not me or the family that considers Bailey the killer but the French justice system that found him guilty of murder.
“Knowing the details would never bring my sister back but at least we would have the answers to our questions.”
He said family members regularly visit Du Plantier’s house in County Cork, now owned by her son.
“She had a desk by a window where she could see the light from the Fastnet lighthouse,” Bouniol said. “It’s always difficult for the first couple of hours after we arrive, but after that the house is where we find Sophie.”"

Roared on by the pharmaceutical industry, ministers have been using trade talks with India to push for agreement on new, extremely restrictive patent rules that would severely undermine its generic medicines industry. India currently supplies the NHS with around 25% of its medicines and provides even greater amounts to some lower-income countries. Yet, according to leaks from the talks, the UK is demanding that it allows firms to extend patent terms and slap new patents on slightly tweaked versions of existing drugs – reversing protections that have helped India become “the pharmacy of the world”.
The British Medical Association, Médecins Sans Frontières and health organisations in India have all warned that these measures could lead to an increase in the cost of generic drugs, both in the UK and globally. To prevent even worse NHS drug shortages in the future, the government must end its efforts to trash India’s finely balanced patent laws.Tim BierleyPolicy and campaigns manager, Global Justice Now
Having to switch to a generic anti-epileptic medication is not just an “inconvenience” (Why is UK being hit by medicine supply shortages?, 14 January). The occurrence of an epileptic seizure may have consequences on long-term brain function, memory, cognitive abilities and mood. Seizures also prevent people from driving for a minimum of six months, which could have a knock-on effect on the person’s employment status and their ability to support any dependents.
“Generic brittleness” among people with epilepsy is a well‑known phenomenon, with some studies reporting that 40% of people with epilepsy experience it when switching between different brands of the same drug.
Generic brands are licensed on the basis of pharmacokinetic equivalence (often in healthy volunteers) but this does not necessarily mean that a patient with epilepsy will respond in the same way to drugs manufactured by different companies.
Neurologists are aware that they cannot always explain why some people respond differently to the same active ingredient in a tablet with different excipients. Whether the drug is the original brand or a generic is not important – the point is that switching between different manufacturers for the same drug isn’t necessarily without medical, social and financial consequences for people with epilepsy.Name and address supplied

7PT72E7QIM_RS75Q7SNW9L59J3,Former Post Office investigator insists cleared Horizon IT victim was guilty,Mark Sweney,_,20230124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/24/former-post-office-investigator-insists-cleared-horizon-it-victim-was-guilty-inquiry-hears,"A former Post Office investigator has maintained that a branch owner-operator who had his conviction for embezzlement overturned last year was guilty.
Raymond Grant, an investigator involved in the prosecution of the post office operator William Quarm, who died in 2012 not knowing he would eventually be cleared years later, had to be legally forced to appear to give testimony at the public inquiry into the Horizon IT scandal.
He told the inquiry on Wednesday he had a “clash of priorities” and wanted to focus on his current job at the Salvation Army.
Grant, a programme manager at the charity who works with homeless people, said he had been too busy with activities such as carol singing, making Christmas dinners and walking his dog over the festive period when the inquiry expected him to write up his witness statement.
“I chose my current job as being most important as it directly affected 20 members of staff and 29 homeless residents,” he told the hearing. “I fully understand my obligations to this important inquiry, but my time was limited.”
Grant said he had received 78 documents totalling 450 pages to read. He said this was an “inordinate amount” he only “glanced” at, and that he was given just 26 days to write up his witness statement. The statement filed to the inquiry was just over two pages long.
Representatives of the inquiry chased Grant, who described them on Wednesday as having “different priorities to mine”, and eventually sheriff officers visited his house to deliver a section 21 notice forcing him to comply and appear at the inquiry.
“That kind of focused me,” he told the hearing. “I drafted the minimum statement to comply with the section 21 order. I apologise to court [but] I do not think it was a fair thing to ask me to do in such a short space of time considering this inquiry was going on for months and years.”
Jason Beer KC, lead counsel to the inquiry, asked Grant whether he believed Quarm, a father of five, was guilty even though his conviction was overturned by the Scottish high court last year. “Yes, I do,” Grant said. “I still think Mr Quarm had a role to play in the loss of the money.”
Quarm, who was 66 when the case was brought against him and described as a “man of good character”, was prosecuted for embezzling funds through the Post Office branch he ran to support his loss-making grocery store on the island of North Uist in the Outer Hebrides.
Grant moved off the case into a role he described as “gardening leave” before a decision was made by the Post Office to move to trial. He said in a report following a 44-minute interview with Quarm that he had made “full and frank admissions” about using the Horizon system as part of engineering personal bank transactions and loans to support his other business.
However, evidence was shown to the inquiry that the subsequent decision to prosecute was made without Scottish cases being run through the Post Office’s central legal services team that advise on “sufficiency of evidence”.
“My understanding is that there was no lawyer employed in criminal law …. qualified to make the decision because there was no one trained in Scots law,” said Grant. “They took a hands-off approach.”

For the trial, the Post Office also did not follow the usual practice of obtaining transaction data through its team that handled Audit Request Queries, and there was no witness statement submitted from Fujitsu vouching for the robustness of the Horizon IT system.
In 2010, Quarm, who collapsed during one interview with the Post Office, pleaded guilty to embezzling money to avoid going to prison and was given a community order sentence. He died in 2012.
“The Post Office let the postmasters down,” said Grant, giving a final personal statement to the inquiry. “They let the staff who they employed down by being less than open and honest with information that should have been shared and wasn’t shared. They deceived me and deceived an awful lot more people. For my part in it, I am humbly sorry.”
The inquiry into the scandal, which is being chaired by the retired high court judge Sir Wyn Williams, began last year and has gained greater public attention since the hit ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office was broadcast this month.
Faults in the Horizon IT system, which was built by the Japanese tech firm Fujitsu, resulted in the Post Office wrongfully pursuing and prosecuting hundreds of post office operators for theft, fraud and false accounting in what has been called the most widespread miscarriage of justice in UK history.
On Wednesday, Kevin Hollinrake, the minister for postal services, said Fujitsu should pay “hundreds of millions of pounds” in compensation for its role in the Post Office scandal."
7R0FWOMV3T_7ZDXYZTUFHDI3B7,Therapy project yields ‘dramatic’ rise in Sats results at London school,Sally Weale,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2024/jan/22/nurture-therapy-programme-dramatic-rise-sats-results-london-school-camila-batmanghelidjh,"A therapeutic programme for primary schoolchildren that was designed by the Kids Company founder, Camila Batmanghelidjh, is to be rolled out to more schools after a pilot scheme showed a dramatic improvement in test results.
The Nurture programme, which supports children who face multiple adversities in their lives, has been running in a single primary school in central London. Not only do Sats results appear to have gone up, attendance and attention have improved and there has been less disruption in class, the school says.
Batmanghelidjh, who died earlier this month, had devised the programme after joining forces post-Kids Company with the Oasis charity, which runs more than 50 schools in five regions of England, often in areas of severe disadvantage, as part of its work.
Steve Chalke, the founder of Oasis, said there had been a 40 percentage point increase in key stage 2 Sats results for 10- and 11-year-olds at Oasis Academy Johanna in Waterloo, where the trial has been running. Now in its third year, the programme will be rolled out to other Oasis primaries and a Nurture guide will be made available to schools across the country.
It would be Batmanghelidjh’s “living legacy”, Chalke said. “It was Camila’s idea. It’s taken Camila’s philosophy of a child-centric, child-first approach. Camila had a completely unique way of understanding what should sit at the heart of education.”
Nurture is an attachment theory-based programme aimed at supporting children who, because of challenging situations in their lives, find school hard to relate to and can behave in destructive ways, harming themselves or distracting others, Chalke said.
Rather than punishing children who “kick off” in class, Nurture helps them to “connect to themselves and others and, in this way, to become more resilient whenever something upsets them or makes them anxious”.
The programme “is not a quick-burst diagnostic intervention to respond to medical or mental health conditions but instead a longer-term programme, enabling children to rebuild trust, often damaged where attachments have been impaired”.
Children are linked with a trusted adult – someone other than a teacher – who provides a safe space for children to express themselves. Then, using art, play and music, children are helped to explore and communicate their anxiety.
One parent at the school, Claire, who did not want to give her full name, has two children at Johanna and said she had seen first-hand the impact of the programme. “I have to say it genuinely has made an enormous difference to my kids as individuals, but also to the whole feel of the school,” she said. “It’s basically therapy, but the kids don’t realise. Both of mine have been miles more happy. It doesn’t sound like it would make a massive difference but it really has.”
Chalke said the programme continued Batmanghelidjh’s work at Kids Company, the south London children’s charity which closed in controversial circumstances in 2015. She, however, was reluctant to play a prominent role, concerned that Oasis would be “dragged down” by its connection with her. She even used an alias – “Ali Mac”, Camila written backwards – to stay behind the scenes.
At Johanna, where more than half of pupils are eligible for free school meals, Nurture’s impact had been “dramatic”, Chalke said. “Not only did the school’s key stage 2 Sats results for 2023 increase by more than 40 percentage points, but it became the highest-ranking Oasis primary academy, with combined reading, writing and maths outcomes far above the national rate of 59%, at 82%.”
In the next academic year, the programme will be rolled out to five more Oasis primary schools – one in London, two in Birmingham and two in Bristol. “We will expand Nurture to cover six schools. The year after, more,” Chalke said, “as we successively roll it out over the years ahead.”
Batmanghelidjh’s funeral took place on Saturday, drawing large numbers, including many children she worked with. Chalke said her work would continue through the Nurture programme. “It’s the future of education,” he said."
7SUW1CC3LV_HE2GCZB5B7LFIFX,British Museum and V&A to lend Ghana looted gold and silver,Matthew Weaver,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/jan/25/british-museum-and-victoria-and-albert-to-loan-ghana-looted-gold-and-silver,"Gold and silver treasure looted from west Africa by the British army in colonial wars are to be lent to Ghana in a three-year deal, the British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum have announced.
The precious regalia, which had belonged to the Asante royal court, is regarded as part of the “national soul” of Ghana. Under the deal, 17 objects from the V&A and 15 from the British Museum, will go on show later this year at the Manhyia Palace Museum in Kumasi, the capital of Asante region. Many of the items have not been seen in Ghana for 150 years.
News of the deal came as Greece renewed its call for the Parthenon marbles to be returned to Athens.
Most of the objects involved in the Ghana deal with Otumfuo Osei Tutu II, the current Asante king, were looted from Kumasi during Anglo-Asante wars in the 19th century. Some formed part of an indemnity payment forcibly extracted from the asantehene (king) at the time. But they also include a gold lute-harp that was presented to the British diplomat Thomas Bowdich during a trade treaty in 1817.
Nana Oforiatta Ayim, a special adviser to Ghana’s culture minister, welcomed the deal as a “good starting point” in righting the wrongs of the UK’s violent colonial past.
Speaking to the BBC, which first reported the deal, she said: “They’re not just objects, they have spiritual importance as well. They are part of the soul of the nation. It’s pieces of ourselves returning.”
Ayim described the deal as a “sign of some kind of healing and commemoration for the violence that happened”.
Tristram Hunt, director of the V&A, said the items were the equivalent of “our crown jewels”.
He said: “One hundred and fifty years after the attack on Kumasi and looting of court regalia, the V&A is proud to be partnering with the Manhyia Palace Museum to display this important collection of Asante gold work. As part of our commitment to sharing collections with a colonial past, we are excited to see these items on public show, in Ghana, as part of Asantehene Otumfuo Osei Tutu II’s silver jubilee celebrations.”
Major museums in the UK, including the British Museum and V&A, are prevented by legislation from permanently handing back contested treasures in their collections. These include: the Parthenon sculptures, which Greece has long campaigned to return to Athens; the Benin bronzes, which are the subject of a similar demand by Nigeria; and the Asante gold.
Hunt said the three-year deal with the king, which could be extended, was “not restitution by the back door”.
He added: “We have a responsibility to the countries of origin to think about how we can share those more fairly today. It doesn’t seem to me that all of our museums will fall down if we build up these kind of partnerships and exchanges.”
On Thursday, Greece’s prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, repeated calls for the return of the Parthenon marbles after a diplomatic spat with UK government last year.
In his first public statement on the issue since November, Mitsotakis said Greece had been in talks with George Osborne, chair of the British Museum, about a deal to bring them to the Acropolis Museum.
He said: “Let me be clear, we will insist on their reunification for many reasons. But one, in my mind, is the most important: Only by being seen together, in situ, in the shadow of the Acropolis, can we truly appreciate their immense cultural importance.”"
7UAY4EPECS_Q3DRSZQWTFGI7AQ,The first lady and the Dior bag: the scandal shaking up South Korean politics,Raphael Rashid,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/26/the-first-lady-and-the-dior-bag-the-scandal-shaking-up-south-korean-politics,"It reads like a complex K-drama plot. South Korea’s first lady is secretly filmed as she’s presented with a lavish gift from a pastor who advocates for unification with North Korea. But this is no scripted narrative, rather a real political crisis that has plunged South Korea’s conservative government into disarray.
With elections for the country’s national assembly less than three months away, South Korean media is awash with accusations and recriminations – all of which stem from the alleged gift of a Dior handbag more than a year ago.
The turmoil began with a meeting between Korean-American pastor Choi Jae-young and Kim Keon Hee, the wife of president Yoon Suk Yeol.
Choi has a history of engagement with the North and has visited the communist country several times to conduct prayers at Pyongyang’s handful of state-operated churches.
He says he was motivated by a desire to “share advice” on matters related to unification with the current administration, and so approached first lady Kim, cultivating a relationship with her which culminated in a one-on-one meeting in 2022, just months after her husband became president.
During this meeting, Choi claims that he overheard Kim engaged in a phone conversation which touched upon sensitive state affairs. Alarmed by the nature of the alleged discussion, he decided to secretly record their next meeting, employing a spy camera concealed within a wristwatch.
Accusations of abuse of power are no laughing matter in South Korea: the former conservative president, Park Geun-hye, was impeached and imprisoned for corruption, before being pardoned by her successor.
It was during the course of Choi’s second meeting with Kim that he purportedly presented her with a Dior bag valued at 3 million won ($2,240). Both the bag and the concealed camera were provided by the left-leaning news site Voice of Seoul, which is known for its staunch opposition to the Yoon government.
Voice of Seoul released the video at the end of November. In it, the first lady is seen in discussion with Choi who tells Kim that he’s brought a present, to which she replies “Why do you keep purchasing such items? Please don’t buy such expensive things.” Although the transfer of the Dior bag to Kim is not apparent, it continues to be placed on the table in her presence.
Speaking to foreign media, Choi said he was purely driven by the public’s right to know about alleged corruption. He claims that he messaged Kim in advance, notifying her that he was bringing the bag and that there were no attempts to refuse it or return it later.
The potential legal repercussions are ambiguous: anti-graft laws prohibit a public official’s spouse from receiving gifts worth more than 1 million won (US$748) in one sitting, but this must be “in connection with the duties of the public official.”
At the same time, Choi himself is facing criticism from supporters of the president who say the ploy is an attempt to influence the election.
The Guardian could not independently verify the video or Choi’s claims, however the anti-corruption agency said it was investigating the case. To date, there has been no official statement from the presidential office.
Kim Keon Hee is no stranger to controversy, having weathered a series of allegations, including plagiarism concerning her academic writings, résumé-padding and accusations of stock manipulation.
The controversies have proven a headache and a source of embarrassment for her husband. Earlier in January, Yoon vetoed a bill that would have authorised a special investigation into his wife’s alleged involvement in stock manipulation.
With South Korea’s general election scheduled for 10 April, both major political parties are going all out to secure support. Neither party enjoys significant public favour, and both sides are grappling with their own internal power struggles. It’s within this context that the emerging handbag scandal could not have come at a worse time for the country’s deeply unpopular president.
In a poll released by a local news channel, 69% of respondents said Yoon needs to explain his position regarding the controversy around the first lady. Another poll in December showed 53% of respondents believe Kim acted inappropriately, while 27% said she was caught in a trap set up to embarrass her.
“It is a political bombshell,” said Rhee Jong-hoon, a political analyst. “The Kim Keon Hee risks are only going to get bigger.”
Loyalists of the president have dismissed the bag scandal as a smear campaign. But some members of his ruling People Power party have advocated for an apology and the party’s interim leader, Han Dong-hoon, has acknowledged that the controversy might be “a matter of public concern.”
Last week Han – who until recently served as justice minister and was widely regarded as Yoon’s closest aide – stated that while the Dior bag scandal was a “planned set-up using a spy camera … there were several misdeeds in handling the issues”.
Tension between Yoon’s office and his party threatened to boil over last week when a senior member likened the situation to the notoriety of Marie Antoinette, the French Queen known for her profligacy.
With apparent disagreement on how to handle the problem at the top of the ruling party, the internal disarray came to a head on Sunday, when senior members of Yoon’s office met with Han and suggested he resign. Han refused.
The unfolding drama is not going down well with major conservative media who are typically sympathetic to the president, with the upheaval being described as a potential “risk” for the ruling party in the run-up to the elections.
“As long as it is true that first lady Kim received a luxury bag, she cannot escape the criticism of the people. If President Yoon had apologised from the beginning … things would not have escalated to this extent,” the influential Chosun Ilbo said in an editorial on Tuesday.
“He didn’t, and the problem has now reached the worst possible situation.”"
7YHBMBYV0Z_JGO2RW1ICIW8X4J,Upbeat Haley vows to press on but prospects against Trump look bleak,Joan E Greve,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/24/nikki-haley-donald-trump-analysis,"Nikki Haley was surprisingly peppy as she took the stage in New Hampshire on Tuesday, considering she had just suffered her second bruising defeat by Donald Trump. Trump beat Haley by 11 points in New Hampshire, a victory that came on the heels of the former president’s 30-point win in the Iowa caucuses.
Undaunted by the reality of her losses, the former UN ambassador pledged that she would continue on in the Republican presidential primary. Haley voiced confidence about her performance in her home state of South Carolina, which will hold its Republican primary on 24 February.
“New Hampshire is first in the nation. It is not the last in the nation,” Haley told supporters in Concord. “This race is far from over. There are dozens of states left to go, and the next one is my sweet state of South Carolina.”
But everyone not named Nikki Haley appears all too ready to declare the Republican primary over. With Trump winning a historic majority of votes in Iowa and New Hampshire, Haley’s path to the nomination appears increasingly difficult – if not impossible. In his victory speech on Tuesday, Trump belittled her efforts to downplay her losses and mocked her decision to stay in the race.
“She had a very bad night,” Trump said. “She came in third [in Iowa], and she’s still hanging around.”
In a rare moment of agreement between Trump and Joe Biden, the president made clear that he would turn his attention to the general election in November, effectively writing off any chance of a Haley comeback.
“It is now clear that Donald Trump will be the Republican nominee. And my message to the country is the stakes could not be higher,” Biden said in a statement. “I want to say to all those independents and Republicans who share our commitment to core values of our nation our Democracy, our personal freedoms, an economy that gives everyone a fair shot – to join us as Americans.”
Despite Haley’s claims to the contrary, her prospects in South Carolina and beyond look bleak. According to the FiveThirtyEight polling average, Trump is running 37 points ahead of Haley in South Carolina, where he has already locked up the endorsements of the state’s governor and senators. If anything, Haley’s losing performance in New Hampshire may represent a high-water mark for her, given her strong support among independent voters who were allowed to participate in the Republican primary.
There’s also the question of money. Haley has reportedly planned a major fundraising swing with big donors in the coming weeks. However, if those donors start abandoning her in large numbers, Haley may have no choice but to withdraw .
Of course, Haley’s campaign insists she can be competitive in many states that will vote on Super Tuesday, which falls on 5 March. In a campaign memo circulated on Tuesday, Betsy Ankney, Haley’s campaign manager, noted that roughly two-thirds of the 874 delegates up for grabs on Super Tuesday are in states with open or semi-open primaries.
“Until then, everyone should take a deep breath. The campaign has not even begun in any of these states yet,” Ankney said. “A month in politics is a lifetime. We’re watching democracy in action. We’re letting the people have a voice. That’s how this is supposed to work.”
As Haley looks ahead to South Carolina, her campaign has leaned into the message that she is the most electable Republican candidate. In one of two new ads that the Haley campaign dropped in South Carolina on Wednesday, a narrator highlights Biden and Trump’s unpopularity and makes the pitch for a new era of political leadership.
“Biden – too old. Trump – too much chaos,” the narrator in the ad says. “A rematch no one wants. There’s a better choice for a better America.”
Some data supports Haley’s electability argument. She performed well with moderate Republican voters in New Hampshire, pointing to a potential vulnerability for Trump in November, and one Wall Street Journal poll frequently cited by Haley’s team showed her beating Biden by 17 points in a general election.
The problem is, she has no viable route to that general election.
Nevertheless, at the election night watch party in Concord, Haley’s supporters echoed the candidate’s resilience.
“I’m not about to have a panic attack after one state,” Marie Mulroy, 76, said moments after Haley spoke. Mulroy is an independent New Hampshire voter who backed Biden in 2020 and remains hopeful she’ll have the opportunity to cast her ballot for the first female president in November.
“If it’s like this after Super Tuesday, then you start thinking,” she added.
Mary Ann Hanusa was so committed to electing Haley that she flew to New Hampshire to volunteer for her campaign after caucusing for Haley in Iowa, where she lives. Hanusa said she was prepared to go to South Carolina to help.
“I think Americans deserve a choice,” she said. “We’ve got 48 states to go.”"
7ZA6JKFZXM_EKXME5J65XW9NTM,The stranger across from me was my sister: how one adoptee uncovered a tragic past,Rosie Swash,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/jan/26/the-stranger-across-from-me-was-my-sister-how-one-adoptee-uncovered-a-tragic-past,"It was not long into a research trip to Bangladesh, on behalf of an organisation seeking to reunite children adopted abroad with their birth relatives, when Kana Verheul found herself huddled in a cafe toilet, comparing birthmarks with a stranger.
That trip seven years ago was one of many that Verheul, 49, had taken to the country of her birth since she was 16 years old, travelling back to Bangladesh for the first time as part of a “roots trip” organised by the Dutch government for children such as her, an orphan adopted to the Netherlands as a baby.
But this trip was different. After decades of trying in vain to find her siblings, Verheul joined forces with other people in her situation to set up an organisation called the Shapla Community, creating a network of hundreds of Bangladesh adoptees raised in the Netherlands. If she could not find her own family, she could at least help others find theirs.
Verheul was among those from Shapla who spent hours interviewing Bangladeshis with extraordinary stories about their children, many of whom claim they were taken for adoption abroad without their consent. It was one of these interviews that led her to the cafe meeting with a woman from the area where she was born.
Verheul tried to see if there was any family resemblance with the woman, but could not see any. “Some details matched but some did not,” she says. “Her sister was called Nasima. I truly believed that Kana was my real Bangladeshi name because it was in my birth papers. I couldn’t comprehend that I may be Nasima. Then I asked them the name of the village I have in my Bangladeshi passport, and she said, ‘Yes, that’s where we lived before.’”
Verheul was still not convinced, so she asked if there were any birthmarks. “The woman said her mother would often tell bedtime stories about the sister who was lost, that they both had the same birthmark on their leg. This was a shock because I have one on my knee.”
In disbelief, the women headed to the toilets and revealed their almost identical birthmarks. They hugged and cried, and soon afterwards, Verheul says, “I finally saw the resemblances between us – in her hands, her mannerisms. I have really funny feet, and she has the same funny feet,” she laughs. “It felt undeniable, but I couldn’t accept it fully until the result of the DNA test came in.”
Verheul returned to the Netherlands and anxiously awaited the results. Two weeks after they met, a DNA test confirmed they were sisters. “I remember like it was yesterday. I was driving on the highway when the doctor called. I could finally accept that this was my sister. Immediately I got a huge headache. I had to stop next to the road. I started crying. From all over, from my ears, from my toes, from deep inside me. I cried for an hour.”
Amid the joy of finding the woman she had spent decades trying to find, her sister, Taslima, was able to explain to Verheul how she came to be adopted abroad as a baby. The story she shared horrified Verheul, but it also confirmed suspicions that she had had for years.
In February 2021, the Dutch government temporarily suspended the adoption of children from abroad to the Netherlands after a lengthy investigation found children from Bangladesh, Colombia, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Brazil had been stolen or bought from their birth parents. In the case of Bangladesh, it was the culmination of many years of claims that children had wrongly been adopted between 1973 and 1981. Police in Bangladesh launched in investigation into the adoptions after the Guardian reported on the allegations last year.
Through the 2010s, as social networking grew, Bangladeshi adoptees from the Netherlands began seeking each other out online. A forum was established and the adoptees began exchanging information. “It can feel incredibly lonely, as an adoptee. But now we had each other. There is strength in numbers and our numbers were growing,” says Verheul.
Once those on the forum connected, Verheul says a number of adoptees realised that they had siblings within the group. “It proved that sibling separation was possible, despite adoption agencies saying it was not allowed, and many adoptees began wondering whether they too had a brother or sister in the Netherlands.”
The group realised the problem was bigger than they imagined and in 2017, Shapla was officially founded, to help adoptees find their relatives in Bangladesh. The organisation began recruiting fieldworkers in both countries – volunteers who would interview relatives, collect data and identify leads that could eventually result in a reunion.
They set up a DNA database and started to collate everyone’s adoption documents. “That’s when we saw certain patterns – the adoption storylines were all the same. The mother had died of poor health, father died in an accident, and grandmother or aunt brought the baby to a home.” Some information was identical, says Verheul, like “a copy-and-paste job”.
Within months, Shapla was able to reunite mothers with their children, and siblings found each other in Bangladesh and within the Netherlands. They were quickly able to confirm what many suspected – that many birth documents and adoption papers had probably been fabricated. One adoptee discovered she had an identical twin who arrived in the Netherlands at the same time as her, but the pair were split up and adopted into two different families.
Verheul, a mother of two, clearly adores her “wish parents”, the term she uses to describe couples who adopt. But there are small clues dotted around the home she shares with her family, about half an hour from Amsterdam, that the happy upbringing she had was not the end of her story. A large blackboard hangs in the kitchen, with details written in chalk of an upcoming search mission. Next to a fruit bowl lies a folder marked “Bangladesh files”.
“You can see here that it says my father was killed in a road accident and that my mother died of illness soon after,” says Verheul. “This was completely untrue.”
Taslima told Verheul their mother had never intended to give her away. She explained that her father had three wives, and one of them had convinced him to take Nasima to a daycare home nearby when her mother was away because she had become ill and needed medical care. When Verheul’s mother came back and discovered what had happened, it was too late. Nasima had already gone from the children’s home. She had been adopted by a couple in the Netherlands who believed she was an orphan. “My mother divorced my father because of this,” says Verheul.
For decades, Verheul had searched for relatives in Bangladesh. The joy of finding her sister is tempered by the fury and deep sadness she feels about her past. “My father passed away in 2012, my mother in 2014,” she says. “But they were still alive when I was searching for my family in Tongi. At one point, I had even stood on the doorstep of my father’s home. That still hurts.”
“As an adoptee you often hear, ‘You’re lucky, now you have a good life.’ But you cannot really compare the two,” says Kana. “In one sense I feel lucky that I have the best of both worlds. But nothing makes up for the loss you had to endure. Because I lost my family and my real identity.”
Shapla and a network of other adoptee groups in the Netherlands have joined forces and are campaigning to put an end to intercountry adoption altogether. The group believes that instead of international adoption, the focus should be on supporting vulnerable families, strengthening youth care systems, and improving quality of care in countries of origin so children can be cared for in familiar surroundings. Their argument is in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which recognises the right of children to grow up in their own culture, befitting their own identity.
Verheul has since met her other siblings – all half-brothers and sisters – and recently bought a plot of land in the village named in her passport. “I want to build a house there, for my sister to live in if she wishes. I would like to spend time there too.”"
7ZOIQTOD1P_K3AN7N4ZKXVWHA1,The Guardian view on the Tory right and Trump: a moral abyss and an electoral dead end,Editorial,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/24/the-guardian-view-on-the-tory-right-and-trump-a-moral-abyss-and-an-electoral-dead-end,"The Tory party is carrying out a postmortem on Rishi Sunak’s leadership before it has expired. It is a gruesome spectacle. Simon Clarke, a former cabinet minister, has called on the prime minister to resign on the grounds that he is navigating the Conservatives towards electoral calamity and incapable of steering them to safety.
MPs who might privately agree with Mr Clarke’s analysis have denounced the intervention as counterproductive. The majority of Conservatives recognise that defeat looms under their current leader and also that it would loom larger still if he were defenestrated. The succession would be chaotic; the government’s threadbare mandate would be void. Fourteen years in office would make any administration feel stale. The lack of tangible achievements, coupled with economic stagnation and decline in public services, gives Mr Sunak’s reign an unshakable aura of decay.
But there are also ideological schisms and geographic faultlines running through the Conservative base that make recovery harder. The majority that Boris Johnson won in 2019 combined long-established Conservative supporters, concentrated in southern England, with former Labour voters in the north and the Midlands.
It was a politically incoherent coalition, united only in support for Brexit (or at least impatience to end the bickering about it) and aversion to the prospect of Jeremy Corbyn in Downing Street. Labour is now under new leadership and Brexit is enacted without material benefits. What some Tory strategists identified as an epic realignment of the electorate has unravelled in the absence of either a positive prospectus for the future or charismatic leadership. Mr Johnson’s potency in that department was overrated but not inconsequential. The incineration of his popularity in the Partygate scandal also contaminated an already diminished Conservative brand.
The realignment theory is not entirely without foundation. Sir Keir Starmer might be poised to reclaim many seats in Labour’s former heartlands, but that doesn’t mean that the old allegiance, rooted in working-class identity and local culture, is renewed. Brexit was the catalyst for abandonment of a loyalty that had degraded over the preceding generation. Much of the so-called red wall will remain marginal territory after the next election.
That leads some Tory MPs to imagine a swift recovery under a more radical prospectus – fiercer in opposing immigration; more aggressive in “anti-woke” campaigns; and fanatical in cutting taxes.
The Conservative ultras draw inspiration from Donald Trump’s seemingly unstoppable march towards nomination as the Republicans’ presidential candidate, and the plausible prospect of his return to the White House in November. The apparent lesson is that blood-curdling nationalism, culture wars on a nuclear scale, contempt for democratic norms and disregard for truth are a winning formula.
As a model this is repellent on ethical grounds. On the amoral test of practicality, Trumpism has limited application in Britain. Fixating on potential gains from a more radical rightwing platform spares party ideologues the less comfortable task of accounting for lost support among moderate, liberal and former remain-voting Conservatives. They are now swinging to the Lib Democrats, Labour, or whichever of the two is better placed to oust the local Tory.
The more in thrall the Conservatives become to the extreme wing of the US Republican movement, the more brutal will be the electoral punishment that is stirring them to panic – and the more deserved."
81VQ71C34Z_V1B4YE1BV2CYAO5,Israeli officials accuse international court of justice of antisemitic bias,Bethan McKernan,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/26/israeli-officials-accuse-international-court-of-justice-of-antisemitic-bias,"Israeli officials have accused the international court of justice of antisemitic bias and expressed dismay that a South African case alleging that the war in Gaza amounts to genocide was not thrown out altogether, after the court issued an emergency interim ruling.
The ruling on Friday said Israel must take “all measures in its power” to prevent acts of genocide in the Gaza Strip but stopped short of calling for a full ceasefire. It ordered six so-called provisional measures to be implemented to protect Palestinians, including orders for Israel to prevent death and destruction and enable the provision of basic services and humanitarian aid to the strip’s trapped population.
Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said in response that his country was committed to upholding international law as well as defending its people. “The vile attempt to deny Israel this fundamental right [to self-defence] is blatant discrimination against the Jewish state and it was justly rejected,” he said in a statement. “The charge of genocide levelled against Israel is not only false, it’s outrageous, and decent people everywhere should reject it.”
While Israel is often dismissive of the UN, alleging that the international organisation is biased against it, the country took the ICJ case very seriously, sending a robust legal team to The Hague that argued it had a right to defend itself after the 7 October Hamas attack.
Yoav Gallant, Israel’s defence minister – who was cited by the court president for calling Palestinians “human animals” at the start of the Israeli offensive – said: “The international court of justice went above and beyond when it granted South Africa’s antisemitic request to discuss the claim of genocide in Gaza, and now refuses to reject the petition outright.”
Itamar Ben-Gvir, Israel’s far-right national security minister, tweeted: “This court does not seek justice but rather the persecution of the Jewish people. Decisions that endanger the continued existence of the state of Israel must not be listened to. And we must continue defeating the enemy until complete victory.”
ICJ decisions are binding but the court has no power to enforce them. Recent interim rulings related to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Myanmar’s treatment of the Rohingya people. The full investigation into Israel’s conduct is likely to take years.
While Palestinians expressed disappointment that the panel of 17 judges did not issue a binding order to stop the hostilities in the three-month-old war, the ruling still carries significant legal ramifications that could amplify international political pressure on Israel.
Hamas, the militant group that seized control of Gaza in 2007 and killed 1,140 people in its unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October, welcomed the ruling. The senior official Sami Abu Zuhri said on Friday: “The international court of justice ruling is an important development that contributes to isolating the occupation [Israel] and exposing its crimes in Gaza. We call for compelling the occupation to implement the court’s decisions.”
The West Bank-based Palestinian foreign minister, Riyad al-Maliki, said in a video statement that the ICJ order was “an important reminder that no state is above the law”, adding that the ruling “should serve as a wake-up call for Israel and actors who enabled its entrenched impunity”.
Daniel Machover, a co-founder of Lawyers for Palestinian Human Rights, called the ruling “massive and historic”. He said: “The judges fell at the last hurdle by not ordering a ceasefire, since stopping further loss of life was the combined aim of the South African application … the court could have ordered Israel to use policing methods to protect from attack.
“However, there has now been an authoritative international ruling that there is a plausible risk of genocide in Gaza and states have a legal obligation now to act to prevent that. Those measures could include things like halting arms sales.”
South Africa said the decision amounted to a ceasefire in all but name. “Israel will have to halt fighting in the besieged Gaza Strip if it wants to adhere to the orders of the international court of justice,” Naledi Pandor, the South African minister of international relations, said after the ruling. “How do you provide aid and water without a ceasefire? If you read the order, by implication a ceasefire must happen,” she told reporters on the steps of the seat of the court in The Hague.
South Africa filed a case against Israel before the court in December alleging that it was in breach of the UN’s genocide convention, signed in 1948 in response to the Holocaust. While acknowledging the particular gravity of bringing genocide charges against the Jewish state, founded in the aftermath of the second world war, Pretoria’s legal team said South Africa’s own history of apartheid was a key factor in the decision to file the case.
Lawyers for South Africa argued that the devastating loss of life in the Israeli campaign – now at about 26,000 people – as well as the forced displacement of 85% of Gaza’s 2.3 million-strong population and the denial of adequate healthcare, food and water, amounted to the “destruction of Palestinian life”."
85010YYRDS_NYYHU83ERYRG46B,France debates plan to enshrine abortion as constitutional right,Angelique Chrisafis,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/24/france-debates-plan-to-enshrine-abortion-as-constitutional-right,"The French parliament has begun debating moves for France to enshrine abortion as a constitutional right, guaranteeing women access to the means to end a pregnancy voluntarily.
The justice minister, Éric Dupond-Moretti, told the lower house of parliament, the National Assembly, on Wednesday that abortion rights were not simply a liberty like any other, “because they allow women to decide their future”.
Aurore Bergé, the minister in charge of equality and the fight against discrimination, said: “This vote will be one of the most important and remarkable of this parliament.”
But the constitutional change requires the agreement of both houses of parliament, the assembly and the Senate, and the final wording of the major constitutional change must be decided ahead of a potential vote in March.
This week, Gérard Larcher, the rightwing head of the Senate, said he did not think the right to abortion was under threat in France and that the constitution was not a “catalogue of social and society rights”.
Several parties in France, from the left to centrists, began pushing for abortion rights to be written into the constitution after the US supreme court’s decision in June 2022 to overturn the Roe v Wade ruling, which recognised a woman’s constitutional right to an abortion and legalised it nationwide.
The Socialist party’s Marie-Noëlle Battistel said in parliament: “Today is a great day for women … who are never safe from seeing their rights pushed back.” Mathilde Panot from the left’s La France Insoumise said: “Today France is speaking to the world.”
The German government on Wednesday passed a law prohibiting the harassment of women entering or leaving abortion clinics. Introduced by family minister Lisa Paus and dubbed the Gehwegbelästigungsgesetz – “pavement harassment law” – it will require Germany’s 16 states to ensure unhindered access to counselling centres and abortion clinics for women and staff. Anyone contravening the law will face a penalty of up to €5,000 (£4,275). The law was passed in reaction to a large increase in protests at the entrances of doctor’s practices, clinics and counselling centres in recent years.

86R31WJ7AV_HU10JOQ1MHLZTD9,EasyJet says Middle East crisis has cost it more than £40m,Jack Simpson,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/24/eastjet-middle-east-crisis-40m-loss-israel-gaza-trading-quarter-results,"Conflicts in the Middle East have cost easyJet more than £40m as a result of flight suspensions and weakening demand, the airline has said.
The company said that, while its year-on-year results had improved, the conflicts in Gaza and the Middle East had hit trading.
In the days after the 7 October attacks in Israel, easyJet was one of a number of carriers that paused flights to Israel and nearby Jordan for safety reasons. These flights have yet to resume.
The airline said the £40m loss was largely because of suspending these flights, with demand for trips to Egypt also affected since the conflict started. The routes make up about 4% of easyJet’s winter flight schedule.
Johan Lundgren, its chief executive, said there were, however, clear signs of recovery in Egypt. “It was definitely impacted hard in the first six or seven weeks, but very quickly bounced back as well.”
Lundgren said in November that the conflict would cause a “short-term industry-wide impact on [flight] searches and bookings”, similar to the effect at the outbreak of war in Ukraine in 2022.
He said on Wednesday: “However horrific these events are from a humanitarian point of view, even if it’s relatively close to the network points, people will take a view – the underlying demand for travel is strong.”
The airline reported a pre-tax loss of £126m in the final quarter of 2023, an improvement on the £133m loss during the same period last year. Airlines typically record seasonal winter losses as demand for holidays and flights drops. Group revenues at easyJet rose by 22% to £1.8bn.
The group’s holiday booking arm, easyJet Holidays, which was launched in 2019, posted a profit of £30m for the final three months of 2023, up from £13m in the same period last year.
The company predicted its first-half results would be up year on year despite the Middle East hit. It said the improved results came from “disciplined capacity growth” where demand was strongest and from productivity benefits.
Lundgren said: “We see positive booking momentum for summer 2024 with travel remaining a priority for consumers.
“Flight and holidays bookings took off strongly during the traditional busy turn of year sales period, as customers opted to secure their summer holidays to firm favourites like Spain and Portugal alongside destinations further afield like Greece and Turkey.”

He said the airline had recorded increased booking volumes, equivalent to filling two planes a minute at peak period, and coming in at higher prices compared with the start of 2022. “Revenue per seat, a combination of load factor and the fares and then ancillaries, is well ahead versus the same period last year,” Lundgren said.
Shares in easyJet rose about 4% in morning trading on the back of the upbeat outlook for bookings.
The airline also announced an order for more than 300 engines from CFM to power the additional 157 Airbus aircraft it has bought.
While easyJet has always used the Franco-American engine supplier, Lundgren said that with many other Airbus customers depending on troubled rival Pratt & Whitney – and other airlines affected by Boeing’s production woes – “we are probably the only airline who is getting the deliveries that we set out to do, with 16 aircraft coming in this year”."
8CALHL2UVZ_73K0S5UN35AIFEP,‘I didn’t know what I was supposed to do’: US women who miscarry are in dangerous legal limbo post-Roe,Carter Sherman,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/jan/24/us-miscarriage-laws-abortion-rights-options,"For a long time after her miscarriage, Rebecca sat on the toilet, trying to figure out what to do.
“I thought about fishing it out of the bloody water,” she said. “I didn’t really want to hold it in my hand. I also didn’t know what I would do with it afterwards. Am I gonna put it in the trash? Am I gonna dig a hole in the backyard? What the hell am I supposed to do? I had no idea.”
It was around 3 or 4 in the morning; her husband was trying to get some sleep before work. She was exhausted and in shock.
“Ultimately, I flushed it. I didn’t want to,” Rebecca said. As she thought about it all again, she kept repeating herself: “I didn’t know what I was supposed to do.”
Rebecca, who is from Ohio, experienced that miscarriage in fall of 2014. Nine years and one supreme court decision later, another distraught woman would also miscarry into a toilet in Ohio – but after she tried to flush, she would have a very different experience. Her case would ultimately land a national spotlight on the anguish, uncertainty and even danger that millions of women, like Rebecca, have experienced in the minutes and hours after a miscarriage.
In September 2023, a 33-year-old woman named Brittany Watts went to the hospital, where doctors found that her water had broken roughly 22 weeks into her pregnancy, according to the Washington Post. It was too early for Watts to deliver a healthy baby. Hospital providers debated whether they could help her; at the time, Ohio had an abortion ban on the books. Watts reportedly left the hospital multiple times, at least once against medical advice. Within days, she miscarried into her home toilet.
Police ultimately charged Watts with the fifth-degree felony of “abuse of a corpse” – a charge that rang alarm bells among reproductive rights groups, since it suggested that a fetus can be legally defined as a human body. On 11 January, months after an initial hearing and after news outlets across the country had covered Watts’ story, a Trumbull county grand jury declined to indict Watts, ending the harrowing possibility of a trial and one-year prison stint.
But as the 2022 overturning of Roe v Wade continues to roil laws around reproductive health and the legal status of fetuses, someone else may soon face criminal consequences over their handling of a miscarriage. The law can be startlingly vague on the topic of miscarriages and their aftermath, while the persistent miasma of misinformation about pregnancy loss compounds people’s confusion and terror. What should Watts have done after her miscarriage? What should any woman do, at a time when any pregnancy can be twisted into a crime scene?
For years after Rebecca’s miscarriage, she tried to simply move on, but the news stories about Watts have made that impossible. She keeps thinking “about how Republicans would want me to be in prison for the miscarriages”.
Rebecca, 44, asked to go only by her first name, because she’s afraid of anti-abortion activists and authorities coming after her. “It’s just not worth endangering my family,” she said. “That just doesn’t feel worth it any more – which is completely insane. We’re supposed to live in a free country.”
She is far from the only person to feel that way. After the Guardian published a story about Watts’ case, more than 100 people reached out to share their stories of miscarriages and their fears for the future.
“Without knowing it, these people are criminalizing their mothers, their sisters, their aunts, their friends,” said Mary Morgan, an Alabama woman who had five miscarriages within six years. “They have no idea how many women have had miscarriages – and I’m just gonna say it, have had them on the toilet, because I’m telling you, that’s a thing.”
About 10% to 20% of known pregnancies end in miscarriage, according to March of Dimes, a leading non-profit that focuses on maternal and infant health. Most of those miscarriages occur before 12 weeks of pregnancy. After 20 weeks, a pregnancy loss is known as a stillbirth (although fetuses are typically deemed viable – that is, able to survive outside the womb – at about 24 weeks).
Under normal circumstances, Dr Alexandria Wells might recommend that patients who are miscarrying earlier in pregnancy do as Rebecca did and flush. (It is, as Morgan said, common for people to miscarry into toilets.) If they want genetic testing to diagnose what went wrong, Wells might also recommend that they bring the miscarriage remains to her.
But many people in the United States are no longer living under normal circumstances.
In the 14 states with near-total abortion bans, there’s no good way to deal with the remains of pregnancy, according to Wells, an OB-GYN in Seattle, Washington and a fellow with Physicians for Reproductive Health. “This is a question that is particularly difficult for providers to answer, particularly when you get into higher gestational ages where you have recognizable fetal parts.”
Many miscarrying patients, Wells said, are probably no longer showing up at hospitals at all. Instead, they are potentially making decisions about fetal remains at home, alone.
“Honestly, we don’t know what’s safe” legally, she said. “I can’t necessarily tell someone in a restrictive state that it’s safe to bring their remains to a hospital or it’s best to bring them to a mortuary service. I genuinely don’t know. We’re in this kind of uncharted territory.”
State law, rather than federal, dictates definitions of “human remains” and how to dispose of them – but it’s not very clear, said Tanya Marsh, a professor at the Wake Forest University School of Law who teaches the only course in a US law school on funeral and cemetery law.
Historically, the law recognizes a “body” when the body possesses both a birth and death certificate, according to Marsh. But before the overturning of Roe, several anti-abortion state legislatures moved to implement requirements around the handling of fetal remains – which can also be known as products of conception – including in cases of miscarriages, stillbirths or abortion.
While those remains might have been previously classified as medical waste, medical facilities such as abortion clinics were suddenly legally tasked with treating them like human bodies and thus cremating or burying them. Abortion rights advocates attacked these laws, passed in states including Indiana and Texas, as veiled attempts to impose onerous, expensive restrictions on clinics.
“We’re not all on the same page about the answers to two of the most fundamental questions about the human condition: when do you exist and when do you no longer exist?” Marsh said. “And so then of course we’re not going to be on the same page about all the questions about: ‘OK, now what do you do with that which remains?’”
The restrictions on handling fetal remains apply only to medical providers and facilities, not individuals who may be getting an abortion or experiencing a miscarriage. (Similarly, US abortion bans typically impose criminal penalties on providers, not patients.) But while pregnant people may not be technically subject to those rules, that doesn’t mean they face zero legal risk when having miscarriages –especially in the post-Roe United States.
Elizabeth Ling serves as senior counsel for the helpline run by the reproductive justice organization If/When/How, which also provided guidance to Watts’ legal team. American callers to the helpline can get free, confidential legal advice about their reproductive experiences, including miscarriages.
“People definitely do contact us with concerns about the fact that they may have experienced a miscarriage, or they think that they have experienced a miscarriage, and being worried about that information – if given to the wrong person – might be used against them,” Ling said.
Between 2000 and 2020, at least 61 people were criminally investigated or arrested for allegedly ending their own pregnancies or helping someone else do so, If/When/How found in a report released last year. Most of the adults whose cases proceeded through the court system were living in poverty.
Many of those cases were charged under statutes that were not originally meant to address the end of a pregnancy, such as child abuse, felony assault or assault of an unborn child, even homicide and murder. The “abuse of corpse” charge that Watts faced hinged on the question of whether someone had treated a corpse in a way that would “outrage reasonable community sensibilities”. Part of the problem, Marsh said, is that it’s no longer always clear what constitutes a “corpse”.
For anti-abortion activists, that may be something of a feature, rather than a bug: their opposition to abortion rests on the belief that a fetus is a person, and legally redefining fetuses as people – complete with the ability to leave behind a corpse – is a long-term goal of many in the movement.
Now that more than a dozen states ban almost all abortions, doctors who treat miscarriages can also get caught in a legal bind. From a medical provider’s perspective, a miscarriage and an abortion can look deeply similar; in medical lingo, miscarriages are even known as “spontaneous abortions”. Under abortion bans, providers have at times been reluctant to offer “miscarriage management”, out of a fear that authorities may think they’re performing illegal abortions. Even if a patient’s pregnancy is over, they might be unable to get the miscarriage care they need.
All abortion bans permit abortions in medical emergencies – but doctors have widely said that the exceptions are too vague to be workable.
When Watts’ water broke early, she technically experienced what is known as “preterm premature rupture of the membranes”, or PPROM. In cases of PPROM, someone’s pregnancy may be effectively over, because she’ll be unable to carry the pregnancy to term – but fetal cardiac activity may continue. In the months since Roe fell, many women who have had PPROM have said that they were denied procedures to treat it.
“PPROM happens routinely, at every hospital,” Dr Ghazaleh Moayedi, an OB-GYN in Texas, told the Guardian in an interview last year. “It has been one of the scenarios that has really highlighted the inaccuracy of an abortion law, and really the fallacy in trying to define a medical procedure as one thing or trying to describe pregnancy in one way.”
Watts was reportedly turned into police by a nurse. Of roughly 1,400 cases where people were criminalized for their pregnancies between 2006 and 2022, one in three cases were instigated by a medical professional, according to an analysis of the cases by the reproductive justice group Pregnancy Justice.
Erica Freeman, a full-spectrum doula, says she’s hearing from people who worry they will not be able to get care if they miscarry. “It definitely puts people in a hard place,” she said. “Who do we trust in these circumstances, that they’re gonna believe me, they’re gonna listen to me, that they’re gonna actually hear what’s coming out of my mouth and really diagnose me properly?”
Everybody who talked to the Guardian about their miscarriages agreed: people don’t talk about miscarriages enough. Left in the dark about how common it is, people often feel like failures over their inability to stay pregnant.
Freeman recommended that people look for providers with whom they can have open conversations, both before and after pregnancy.
“We have to normalize those hard conversations and not for everyone to continue to think that pregnancy is just unicorns and rainbows,” said Freeman, who is also CEO of Sisters in Loss, a company that helps Black women speak out about pregnancy, infant loss and infertility. “Because it’s not, especially not in the US.”
When Roberta Nordheim-Wallace got unexpectedly pregnant around 1995, people seemed resentful that her pregnancy made her so nauseous. “It was all about stiffening my spine, and being grateful that I was going to be bringing new life into the world,” Nordheim-Wallace said.
That pregnancy ended in a miscarriage. She spent several hours in pain, then started to bleed heavily. Finally, she decided to go to the hospital, where she said she waited for hours. No one spoke directly to her, Nordheim-Wallace recalled.
“It was a Twilight Zone movie. The overarching feeling I had from the entire experience was that the entire thing made people extremely uncomfortable,” she said.
The way she was treated haunted her for years afterward. “It was an experience that frightened me so badly that when I reached the point of needing hip replacement, I was very nearly hysterical. I was at one point on the floor of my GP’s office, curled in a ball, because I could not accept the idea of going into a hospital again.”
In her view, Republicans are now telling women: “OK, you are no longer a thinking human being, you are now an incubator. And if you fail in your role as an incubator, you will be punished.”

8GQ6NWZP0W_D7A7T3EWI3KHN4D,Donald Trump and E Jean Carroll’s defamation trial face-off derailed by Covid scare,Victoria Bekiempis,_,20240115,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/22/trump-e-jean-carroll-defamation-trial-live-updates,"Donald Trump and E Jean Carroll’s courtroom face-off in New York in her defamation trial against the ex-president was derailed on Monday by a Covid-19 scare.
Before testimony was to resume in the case, Lewis Kaplan told attorneys in the case that a juror had fallen ill with Covid symptoms and would undergo testing.
“The juror in seat No 3 reported …early this morning that he was on the way to the city, but feeling hot and nauseous, so I sent him home for the day with instructions to get a Covid test and report back,” the judge told the parties.
Kaplan then revealed that Trump’s lead attorney, Alina Habba, had told the court: “she was not feeling well”.
“You said, Ms Habba, that one or both of your parents had Covid, is that right?”
“Yes, your honor,” an unmasked Habba said, explaining that she had dinner with them several days ago, which lasted several hours. Her co-counsel was also exposed at the dinner. Trump, who was present, did not don a mask.
They both took Covid tests and were negative. Kaplan asked whether they wanted to proceed without the ill juror – which would mean that this panelist would no longer weigh the case.
Carroll’s attorney, Roberta Kaplan, wanted to press on, saying: “We’re prepared and would like to proceed.”
Habba asked for the trial to be paused, as she wants the full panel. Judge Kaplan agreed and put off proceedings until 9.30 tomorrow morning.
He brought the jurors into court and apprised them of the situation, and then sent them home for the day. After jurors left, Habba said that Trump was poised to testify but with this adjournment, would have a scheduling conflict.
“My client reminded me, and I’m in trial mode, I apologize, tomorrow is the New Hampshire primary and he needs to be in New Hampshire,” Habba said. “I would just need his testimony to be Wednesday in light of the news about the jury today.”
Kaplan, Carroll’s attorney, wanted the trial to continue. “We’d like to get this trial over … I just think we should finish tomorrow,” she said.
The judge said he would not decide immediately whether Trump’s testimony could wait until Wednesday because he will be in New Hampshire.
Trump’s motorcade arrived at the downtown Manhattan federal courthouse just before 9am. Across from the courthouse, a handful of protesters were gathered, toting signs such as: “TRUMP IS THE BIGGEST LOSER” and “CRYBABY RAPIST LOSER.”
Trump attended the Manhattan federal court proceedings two days last week including on 17 January, when the former Elle writer described how his 2019 denials of her rape claim smeared her reputation. Carroll’s testimony marked the first time she confronted him in a courtroom.

Trump’s reaction to Carroll’s testimony was characterized by repeated outbursts, spurring Lewis Kaplan to warn that the ex-president would be booted from court if he refused to behave. Trump’s response was to taunt the judge, setting the stage for yet another potential showdown between the veteran jurist and bombastic 2024 Republican presidential candidate if he acts out again.
“Mr Trump has the right to be present here. That right can be forfeited, and it can be forfeited if he is disruptive, which is what has been reported to me, and if he disregards court orders.
“Mr Trump, I hope I don’t have to consider excluding you from the trial … I understand you are probably very eager for me to do that,” Kaplan warned last week.
“I would love it, I would love it,” Trump replied, gesturing.
“I know you would, you just can’t control yourself in this circumstance, apparently.”
This ongoing trial is Carroll’s second defamation trial against Trump. A jury in May found the former US president liable of sexual abuse and defamation, voting to award Carroll $5m in damages.
Carroll claimed Trump raped her around late 1995 or 1996, in the dressing room of a Manhattan department store. She went public with her claim in 2019 when a portion of her book, What Do We Need Men For? A Modest Proposal, was published in New York magazine.
Carroll first sued Trump in 2019 over his subsequent denials. She sued him again in 2022 when New York’s Adult Survivors Act allowed her to file suit over the sexual assault and defamatory statements he made when no longer president.
That second lawsuit went on trial this spring. Kaplan determined that the jury’s findings – that he sexually abused and defamed her – would be accepted as fact in this trial. This means the jury is only weighing damages."
8IBL00PJIG_2RRXFKKQ9KWSG40,Bangladesh launches investigation into children ‘wrongly’ adopted overseas,Thaslima Begum,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/jan/25/bangladesh-investigation-children-adopted-overseas-adoptions-netherlands,"Police in Bangladesh have launched an investigation into historical allegations that children were adopted abroad without their parents’ consent, after a Guardian investigation into adoptions to the Netherlands in the 1970s.
Bangladesh special branch in Dhaka confirmed it had opened an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the adoption of a number of children between 1976 and 1979.
It is the first time police have investigated allegations that children were lured from mothers using a tactic known as the “boarding school scam”, where vulnerable families were offered temporary shelter for their children only to find they were adopted abroad without their consent.
Special Supt Tahsin Mashroof Hossain Mashfi told the Guardian: “Shedding light on the matter has ignited a deep sense of responsibility. We commit to conducting a fair and impartial investigation, striving to contribute meaningfully to the nation’s healing process.”
Saida Muna Tasneem, Bangladesh’s high commissioner to the UK, wrote to the country’s foreign minister, AK Abdul Momen, in August 2023 to draw attention to the fact that the Guardian would soon be publishing a number of podcasts and articles about these allegations and asking that he look into the matter. Her letter was passed on to the home ministry, triggering the police investigation.
International adoption from Bangladesh began shortly after the end of the 1971 liberation war, when thousands of babies were born to survivors of rape. As a result, the government introduced emergency legislation allowing foreigners to adopt “war babies”, who had been left at orphanages across the country. Thousands of adoptions took place in the following decade, long after the war had finished.
In 1976 and 1977, allegations were made by a number of Bangladeshi mothers from the Tongi area of Dhaka that they had been duped into giving up their children for temporary care in a local children’s home and their children had been adopted to the Netherlands without their consent.
The Guardian interviewed several adoptees who believe they were stolen from their families in Bangladesh, and elderly mothers who claim that their children were taken without their consent and were still hoping to be reunited with them.
Kana Verheul, a Dutch-Bangladeshi adoptee, was the first witness to be interviewed by police. “The Dutch state has turned a blind eye to these allegations for far too long,” she told the Guardian.
“I hope Bangladesh, my birth country, will cooperate with adoptees and grant us access to the support and information needed to recover our identities and reunite with our families.”

Verheul was brought to the Netherlands as a baby and described in her adoption papers as an orphan. But when she embarked on a search for her biological family in Bangladesh, she discovered that much of what she thought she knew about her past was false. Verheul founded the Shapla Community, which represents the largest group of Bangladeshi adoptees in the Netherlands and is working to reunite them with their birth families.
In Tongi, there was a mixed reaction among the mothers, who for far too long have felt let down by the authorities. “I want to believe this is good news and that there will be justice – but what does that mean any more?” said Nur Jahan, whose baby went missing in the late 70s.
“It has been almost half a century and I am still no closer to getting my child back,” she said. “Until we are reunited, there can be no justice in my eyes.”
Sayrun Nisa, whose son also went missing in the 1970s, said: “I have been praying for this for so long, it is hard to believe it’s actually happening. The mothers of Tongi are now old and so many have already died. I hope this investigation will find the answers we’ve all been searching for and finally give us some peace.”

8LQ7GB44XL_M42766BZ1JNQEDJ,Deanna Petherbridge obituary,Charles Darwent,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2024/jan/25/deanna-petherbridge-obituary,"Deanna Petherbridge, who has died aged 84, was the prime example of an artist widely celebrated within her field but rather less well known outside it.
Largely, this was because of her chosen way of making. In a time when fashion called for eclecticism in art – the Young British Artists might move back and forth between video, concept, ceramics and paint – Petherbridge stuck firmly to a single medium. That medium, too, seemed almost wilfully old-fashioned.
“I did do rather large expressionist paintings when I first came to London,” she recalled in an interview in Studio International in 2017. “There was a lot of gory anti-Vietnam work, and some soft sculpture.” By the middle of the 1960s, though, she had settled on a career in drawing.
Size was one of the most striking things about her work. In contrast to her own diminutive stature, Petherbridge worked on a monumental scale.
Beginning with Piranesi-esque views of the flat-roofed, white-walled streets of the Greek island where she had a studio, her work evolved into huge drawings such as the five-panel Concrete Armada (1978). Dual interests in architecture and travel added geometric elements of Islamic and Hindu building to her repertoire.
In the 1980s, appalled by the Falklands war, Petherbridge also took as a regular subject the razing of architecture. This culminated in The Destruction of the City of Homs, exhibited in a solo show at the Whitworth Art Gallery in Manchester in 2016-17 and now in the Tate collection.
A triptych in ink and wash on paper, 106cm high by 228cm wide, The Destruction of the City of Homs shows the titular metropolis after the ravages of the Syrian civil war. Part expressionist and part vorticist in mood, it is a meditation on what Petherbridge called “urbicide”. Like most of her work, it is empty of people.
Its imagery is taken not from contemporary sources but from the artist’s mind. “A photograph of the bombed-out shell of Dresden, destroyed in February 1945 when I was six years old, has lived potently in my lifelong memory bank,” Petherbridge said.
If pacifism provided one stimulus for her work, feminism offered another. This found its most memorable expression in Witches and Wicked Bodies, an exhibition she curated at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art in 2013, which then travelled to the British Museum.
Starting with the engraving of a goat-born harpy by Albrecht Dürer (1501) and proceeding via Goya’s Los Caprichos, it examined the way in which 500 years of predominantly male artists had portrayed witches either as menacingly young and alluring or as old and repulsive. Kept from economic and political power, a witch, as Petherbridge tartly noted, “was evil because she was envious”.
“I’m one of the old hags myself,” she told a cheering audience at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London in 2015. Witches and Wicked Bodies, and its accompanying book, were deeply scholarly, but they were enlivened by a deadpan puckishness that marked much of Petherbridge’s work.
Born in Pretoria, South Africa, to Frieda (nee Goldberg), an art student turned housewife, and Harry Schwarz, a lawyer, Deanna studied fine arts at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. Finding apartheid abhorrent, she left for Britain in 1960. “In South Africa at that time there was a significant graphic emphasis,” Petherbridge said. “I had come from a country with immense poverty and discrimination. Drawing is a way of thinking visually at a democratic level. It’s the poor person’s way of inventing.”
It was also easy to move. Short of money herself, in 1967 she took herself off to the island of Sikinos in the Cyclades, where she was to keep a studio and spend periods of time for the next three decades. (This studio was followed, in later life, by another in Umbria.) There, she began to draw. “I discovered that pen and ink was more portable and have stuck with it all my life, really,” she said. “Even large drawings like mine can be rolled up and carried over the shoulder.”
After a brief early marriage, she was in a relationship with Guy Petherbridge, whose name she adopted.
In the UK, after lecturing on fine art at Reading University and then Middlesex Polytechnic (now University) in the 1980s, she was appointed professor of drawing at the Royal College of Art in 1995. There, she launched the Centre for Drawing Research, the first doctoral programme of its kind in Britain. She was an honorary fellow of the Warburg Institute, and research fellow at both Yale University (2007) and the Getty Center in Los Angeles (2001-02); and was, in 1996, made a CBE. Petherbridge’s book The Primacy of Drawing: Histories and Theories of Practice, published in 2010, remains a standard text on the subject. It also helped spur a revival of interest among contemporary artists, among them Tracey Emin.
Petherbridge is survived by two sisters and a brother, and by seven nephews and nieces.

8OTK8PGSLQ_F88VRUWHD2G4P8J,Taylor Swift deepfake pornography sparks renewed calls for US legislation,Ben Beaumont-Thomas,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/jan/26/taylor-swift-deepfake-pornography-sparks-renewed-calls-for-us-legislation,"The rapid online spread of deepfake pornographic images of Taylor Swift has renewed calls, including from US politicians, to criminalise the practice, in which artificial intelligence is used to synthesise fake but convincing explicit imagery.
The images of the US popstar have been distributed across social media and seen by millions this week. Previously distributed on the app Telegram, one of the images of Swift hosted on X was seen 47m times before it was removed.
X said in a statement: “Our teams are actively removing all identified images and taking appropriate actions against the accounts responsible for posting them.”
Yvette D Clarke, a Democratic congresswoman for New York, wrote on X: “What’s happened to Taylor Swift is nothing new. For yrs, women have been targets of deepfakes [without] their consent. And [with] advancements in AI, creating deepfakes is easier & cheaper. This is an issue both sides of the aisle & even Swifties should be able to come together to solve.”
Some individual US states have their own legislation against deepfakes, but there is a growing push for a change to federal law.
In May 2023, Democratic congressman Joseph Morelle unveiled the proposed Preventing Deepfakes of Intimate Images Act, which would make it illegal to share deepfake pornography without consent. Morelle said the images and videos “can cause irrevocable emotional, financial, and reputational harm – and unfortunately, women are disproportionately impacted.”
In a tweet condemning the Swift images, he described them as “sexual exploitation”. His proposed legislation has not yet become law.
Republican congressman Tom Kean Jr said: “It is clear that AI technology is advancing faster than the necessary guardrails. Whether the victim is Taylor Swift or any young person across our country, we need to establish safeguards to combat this alarming trend.” He has co-sponsored Morelle’s bill, and introduced his own AI Labeling Act that would require all AI-generated content (including more innocuous chatbots used in customer service settings, for example) to be labelled as such.
Swift has not spoken publicly about the images. Her US publicist had not replied to a request for comment as of publication time.
Convincing deepfake video or audio has been used to imitate some high-profile men, particularly politicians such as Donald Trump and Joe Biden, and artists such as Drake and the Weeknd. In October 2023, Tom Hanks told his Instagram followers not to be lured in by a fake dentristry advert featuring his likeness.
But the technology is overwhelmingly targeted at women, and in a sexually exploitative way: a 2019 study by DeepTrace Labs, cited in the proposed US legislation, found that 96% of deepfake video content was non-consenting pornographic material.
The issue has considerably worsened since 2019. Fake pornography, where photo editing software is used to place a non-consenting person’s face into an existing pornographic image, is a longstanding problem. But a new frontier has opened up thanks to the sophistication of artificial intelligence, which can be used to generate entirely new and highly convincing images, including by using simple text commands.
High profile women are particularly at risk. In 2018, Scarlett Johansson spoke about widespread fake pornography featuring her likeness: “I have sadly been down this road many, many times. The fact is that trying to protect yourself from the internet and its depravity is basically a lost cause, for the most part.”
The UK government made nonconsensual deepfake pornography illegal in December 2022, in an amendment to the Online Safety Bill that also outlawed any explicit imagery taken without someone’s consent, including so-called “downblouse” photos.
Dominic Raab, then deputy prime minister, said: “We must do more to protect women and girls from people who take or manipulate intimate photos in order to hound or humiliate them. Our changes will give police and prosecutors the powers they need to bring these cowards to justice and safeguard women and girls from such vile abuse.”"

Custer firefighters prepared and lit the torches for residents to carry in a march to the pyre Saturday night in the 11th Burning Beetle fest, the Rapid City Journal reported.
People set the tall beetle effigy on fire amid drum beats and chants of “Burn, beetle, burn.” Firefighters kept watch, warning participants not to throw the torches, even as some people launched the burning sticks into pine trees piled at the base of the beetle. Fireworks dazzled overhead.
The event, which includes a talent show and “bug crawl”, supports the local arts.
The US Forest Service calls the mountain pine beetle “the most aggressive, persistent, and destructive bark beetle in the western United States and Canada”. The Black Hills have experienced several outbreaks of the beetle since the 1890s, the most recent being from 1996-2016, affecting 703 sq miles (1820 sq km), according to the South Dakota department of agriculture and natural resources."

Lynda La Plante and James Lee Burke are the joint recipients of this year’s award, which is administered by the Crime Writers’ Association (CWA) and recognises sustained excellence in the genre.
“By an extraordinary quirk of fate, due to our new voting process, this year’s Diamond Dagger is, for the first time in seven decades, being awarded to two authors,” said Maxim Jakubowski, chair of the CWA Daggers’ committee. “If the Booker prize can do it, so can we!”
La Plante is best known for writing the Prime Suspect and Widows television and novel series. Her other series include Lorraine Page, Anna Travis and Trial And Retribution. In 2008, she received a CBE for services to literature, drama and charity. Her memoir is expected to be released later this year.
“La Plante’s Prime Suspect redefined the role of women in police procedurals and made a star of Helen Mirren, while Widows remains a talismanic – and wickedly entertaining – female-led heist caper,” said CWA chair Vaseem Khan.

James Lee Burke’s series about detective Dave Robicheaux spans more than 20 novels. Burke said he was “honoured and humbled” to receive his award. “It is also an honour to have my name among the best mystery and crime writers in the world,” he added.
Khan said: “James Lee Burke’s lyrical depiction of the American south transcends crime fiction – his prose is often considered among the best to have graced the genre. For many, Dave Robicheaux is the very embodiment of the dogged, morally incorruptible detective beset by personal demons – a beautifully rendered character.”
The Dagger judges “almost came to blows this year and for good reason”, said Khan. “Ultimately, they have chosen to recognise two incredible bodies of work that have each, in their own way, made their mark.”
Jakubowski said La Plante and Burke are “both such wonderful and deserving writers who, between them, demonstrate the marvellous diversity of crime writing”.
This year’s choices were decided by a panel of previous winners including Lee Child, Ian Rankin and Val McDermid. Other past winners include Ruth Rendell, PD James and John le Carré. The CWA awards began in 1955 with the first going to Winston Graham, best known for writing the Poldark novels."
8WL5QTKSJF_MUWC2MD2NZIS1XU,"Aged care residents only receiving appropriate care half the time, world-first Australian study finds",Natasha May,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/23/aged-care-retirement-home-residents-study-data,"Aged care residents are only receiving appropriate care half the time, and even less often for common conditions including depression, infections and wound care, according to a world-first Australian study.
Research led by the Australian Institute of Health Innovation at Macquarie University, published on Tuesday in the international journal BMC Medicine, found management of depression had the lowest rate of care being given in line with guidelines despite more than half of all permanent aged care residents experiencing depression symptoms.
Prof Peter Hibbert, the lead author, said while previous studies had evaluated a single condition such as dementia or nutrition among aged care residents, this study was the first of its kind to evaluate the adherence to evidence-based care across multiple conditions and processes of care using a standardised method.
The researchers developed a set of 236 quality care indicators for 14 common conditions and processes of care based on more than 5,600 recommendations extracted from clinical practice guidelines from Australia and around the world.
Aged care nurses then reviewed the care records of 294 residents across 27,585 incidences of needing care between March and May 2021 from 25 different South Australian aged care facilities against the indicators established by the researchers.

The study found there was considerable variation, with an 81% rate of adherence for continence care at the highest end but only 12% adherence for depression at the lowest.
The research found that only 1% of residents who had been receiving antidepressants were monitored on a monthly basis for side-effects, as recommended by the guidelines.
Researchers found that on average, residents received care in line with guidelines 53.2% of the time, and less than 50% of the time for wound care, infections, medications, end of life care, depression and sleep.
Hibbert said: “We think [the study] points to those conditions where they are ripe for quality improvement projects.
“We are not judging individual aged care providers with these results. This is a commentary on the overall aged care sector which is struggling to provide residents the right care at the right time.”
Data for the study was collected around the time the royal commission into aged care reported its findings in 2021, and Hibbert said the study provided a benchmark against which the impact of policy changes could be measured.
The researchers acknowledged limitations of only aged care facilities in one state being able to be recruited due to the restrictions of the Covid-19 pandemic, but said the profile of the South Australian facilities and the residents was similar to those of the whole Australian not-for-profit long-term care sector.
The researchers acknowledged that other limitations of the study meant the reported adherence rates may still underestimate the true extent of compliance with care standards.

Because private aged care facilities could not be recruited, they were removed from the sampling frame, but evidence points to private facilities likely having lower adherence to care standards, the researchers said.
Because researchers also relied on gathering data from aged care homes who agreed to share their care records with researchers, they acknowledged that homes open to this scrutiny could be more likely to be providing better care – a problem known as “self selection bias” which has been acknowledged in similar studies.
Dr Madhan Balasubramanian, a senior lecturer in health and aged care management at Flinders University, said the study “reveals some serious concerns about the quality of care provided to long-term care residents in Australia”.
“The authors rightly point out that this research is the first of its kind in Australia to systematically assess compliance with clinical practice guidelines for multiple conditions in long term care facilities.”
Balasubramanian said the findings from the study should be interpreted with some caution because the small sample size affected precision to some extent, as well as the underrepresentation of rural and remote areas and private facilities.
The authors said one of the most significant reasons behind the low adherence to clinical practice guidelines in long-term care facilities was the shortage of healthcare workers in aged care and lack of proper health workforce planning.
They advocated the need for innovative approaches, including the use of multidisciplinary teams, integrated care provision, structured communication and handovers, involving residents in co-design and establishing local clinical pathways that are evidence-based."

The ministry said the aircraft was carrying 65 Ukrainian PoWs who were to be swapped. The ministry added that onboard the Ilyushin Il-76 were also six crew and three Russian servicemen.
Ukraine has neither confirmed nor denied that it hit the plane but said Moscow had created a “deliberate threat to the life and safety” of its PoWs by failing to warn Kyiv to deconflict the airspace before the swap. The statement followed a now retracted Ukrainskaya Pravda report, which claimed that the military had shot down the jet.
Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, called for full clarity over the crash. Zelenskiy said in his nightly video broadcast: “It is clear that the Russians are playing with the lives of Ukrainian prisoners, the feelings of their loved ones and the emotions of our society.”
A drone attack on Ukraine’s Black Sea port of Odesa injured one person and started a fire, the regional governor said. Writing on the Telegram messaging app, the governor said the attack had damaged housing in the city.
The UK defence secretary Grant Shapps said its allies needed to “step up” the amount of military aid given to Ukraine. Writing in Politico, Shapps said: “Ukraine has done an unbelievable job of repelling its invader. It has retaken 50 per cent of the territory stolen by Russia … but Kyiv needs more support – and not just from the UK.”
The finance minister of Germany has said it can’t keep up Ukraine’s defence capabilities on its own in the long term and that others will need to increase bilateral contributions.
Viktor Orbán has said he will urge the Hungarian parliament to sign off on Sweden’s Nato bid “at the first possible opportunity”, as diplomats said Hungary’s allies were “exasperated” by the country’s foot-dragging. Sweden applied to join Nato in May 2022, but its accession was delayed as Turkey and Hungary strung out the ratification process.
Ukraine’s foreign ministry has called out US TV network HBO for casting a Serbian actor it says backs the Russian invasion of Ukraine in the next season of hit show The White Lotus.

97KNXOWA1L_UYC9QWGYXN6TSEJ,Modi inaugurates Hindu temple on site of razed mosque in India,Hannah Ellis-Petersen,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/22/modi-inaugurates-hindu-temple-on-site-of-razed-mosque-in-india,"More than three decades after a mob of militant Hindu radicals razed a mosque to the ground in the Indian town of Ayodhya, the country’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, has inaugurated the new Hindu temple that will stand in its place.
For some, the inauguration marks a hugely significant religious moment. Many Hindus believe Ayodhya to be the birthplace of the popular deity Lord Ram and the building of the temple, after over a century of disputes, has been heralded as Ram returning to his rightful place, and India freeing itself from the chains of past religious occupation.
Modi himself called it the fulfilment of “the dream that many have cherished for years”. At the Prana Pratishtha, Monday’s rituals to consecrate the temple and give offerings and blessings to the idol of the young Lord Ram placed in the inner sanctum, Modi took on a starring role, having spent the past 11 days observing a special purification ritual to prepare.
The consecration of the Ram temple became a national event, with 8,000 official guests including politicians, diplomats, Bollywood stars and holy figures, while hundreds of thousands of pilgrims flocked to Ayodhya from across the country to show their devotion to the new temple and Lord Ram. The town also underwent a $3bn government-funded transformation and was garlanded with flowers, saffron flags, images of Ram and billboards of Modi.
Arjun Kumar, 22, a driver, had spent the past 20 days on a pilgrimage walking the 466 miles (750km) from Delhi to Ayodhya. “I consider it as the most important journey of my life,” he said. “Many of my friends were afraid to take this journey but we are followers of Lord Ram and Narendra Modi, no one can stop us. I think every Hindu should walk up to here to send a message that this country belongs to us and no one can stop us.”
After the ceremony, devotees flocked to be close to Ram Mandir. Bharat Patel, 52, a herbal medicine seller from Gujarat, said: “On reaching here and looking at the temple, I collapsed and cried. I can say we felt heaven here. This is a proud moment for Hindus of the entire world.”
Others boycotted the ceremony, accusing Modi of orchestrating the event for political gain before elections in the spring, where he will seek a third term in power.
The demolition of the mosque in 1992 paved the way for Hindu nationalism to become the dominant political force it is today, and the pledge to build a Ram Temple in Ayodhya has been at the core of Modi’s Bharatiya Janata party’s (BJP) political agenda to establish Hindu supremacy in India.
The temple will not be complete until next year, prompting some Hindu holy figures to object to it being inaugurated early. Alongside Modi, the few others to take part in Monday’s temple consecration ceremony were Yogi Adityanath, the hardline Hindu monk and BJP chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, and Mohan Bagwat, the head of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the rightwing Hindu paramilitary organisation that birthed the BJP.
Kapil Komireddi, the author of Malevolent Republic: A Short History of New India, said the close alignment between the prime minister and the Ram temple was indicative of the threat posed by the BJP to India as a secular republic whose constitution enshrines all religions as equal.
“This is a purely political spectacle, the culmination of a 40-year political project – one that has been achieved through great violence,” said Komireddi. “It is the coronation of Hinduism as India’s state religion and the crowning moment for the cult of personality erected around Modi. I see this as a very sad moment for India.”
Disputes over the holy site in Ayodhya date back over a century. A mosque, Babri Masjid, had been built there in 1528 by the Mughal emperor Babur, one of the Muslim leaders who ruled India for almost 500 years, but Hindus later began to push for the right to worship at what they believed was the birthplace of Lord Ram.
Muslims continued to worship at Babri Masjid until 1949, when the issue was taken up by a small hardline Hindu group, who alleged that a temple had previously stood at the site and pledged to “liberate” the land and rebuild it. After an idol of Ram was placed in the mosque, allegedly by a Hindu priest, its gates were locked.
The campaign among rightwing Hindu groups to reclaim Ayodhya and build a temple began to build momentum again in the 1980s. By 1990, the leaders of the BJP – back then an emerging political party – threw their weight behind the movement, leading marches to Ayodhya.
In December 1992, as a mob marched into Ayodhya and began to tear down the mosque using sledgehammers, axes and iron rods, bringing it to the ground within hours, several senior BJP figures were present.
In November 2019, the supreme court declared the destruction illegal but awarded the land title to the Hindu side. No one has been convicted for the demolition or the violence in Ayodhya that followed it, which killed 17 Muslims in the town and set off riots across the country that left more than 2,000 people dead.
For Shri Mahant Dharamdas Akhil, 75, a Hindu priest and student of the priest who allegedly placed the Ram idol in the mosque in 1949, the inauguration of the temple on Monday was a culmination of a cause he had dedicated his life to and “one of the most important days in India’s history”.
He was among those who took part in the Babri Masjid demolition in 1992, which he described as a “just cause”, and was also a petitioner in the supreme court case. “It was not only us who brought down that structure, there was divine intervention from God,” he said. “This temple of Ram will now become one of the most important places in Hinduism in all of the world.”
Yet for the Muslims of Ayodhya, many of whom lost relatives or had their homes destroyed in 1992 amid the violence that broke out around the mosque demolition, Monday’s ceremony only brought up old trauma and fear.
Abdul Wahid Qureshi, 44, a shopkeeper, recalled that day in 1992, when the rightwing Hindu mob went on a rampage through his locality, killing any Muslims in their path. Among those who died was his neighbour, a frail elderly man who was burned alive in his home. Qureshi survived the violence only because a Hindu living close by gave them shelter.
“I can never forget those gory scenes,” he said. “They burned down everything which had any resemblance of Muslims. That day changed everything for us as Muslims in Ayodhya. We returned after a couple of weeks and my father managed to build a new house. But since then, the sense of security is gone.”
Qureshi said many Muslims were fearful that as hundreds of thousands of outsiders would continue to flock into Ayodhya, they would once again become a target. Half the Muslim households were deserted as the temple festivities took place. “All this takes me back to 1992,” he said. “I am afraid, like all other Muslims here, what will happen to us after the dignitaries are gone and security is lifted.”
Anwari Begum, whose husband was dismembered and killed by the mob in 1992, said she had never received justice for his death. “But I have made peace with it in the larger good,” she said. “If construction of the temple will bring peace here, I will stop asking for justice in the killing of my husband.”"
9A6R4E7YFI_Q63WG7E7UIGECVN,Bali bomber Ali Imron seeking presidential pardon in Indonesia,Rebecca Ratcliffe,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/23/bali-bomber-ali-imron-presidential-pardon-indonesia-seeking-details,"Ali Imron, who was given a life sentence for his role in the 2002 Bali bombing, is seeking a presidential pardon, saying he wants to be released so he can work on deradicalisation projects across Indonesia.
Imron, 54, has spent 21 years in prison over the bombings that killed 202 people on the Indonesian island of Bali, including 88 Australians and 38 Indonesians.
In an interview with the South China Morning Post (SCMP) – which reported he hopes for a pardon from Indonesian president Joko Widodo – he said he felt “tired”.
“I don’t want to be released purely for personal reasons,” Imron told SCMP. “I want to be free so that I can work on deradicalisation programmes across Indonesia. From a personal point of view, I am better off inside where there is no risk to my life.”
“I have to tell people the facts … Jemaah Islamiyah still exists as an organisation and there is still a potential threat to the public,” he said, referring to the terror group that carried out the Bali attack.
“There is only so much I can do from prison to warn people not to plan any more attacks.”
While in prison he has been involved in government deradicalisation programmes, including speaking at schools to warn against extremism. The Indonesian government has combined such deradicalisation work with security crackdowns as part of its counter-terrorism efforts.
Imron, who was an Islamic boarding school teacher prior to the attack, was sentenced in 2003, aged 33, for assembling and transporting explosives used in the attack. He was one of the few defendants to express remorse.
His older brothers, Amrozi bin Nurhasyim, and Ali Ghufron, as well as Imam Samudra were sentenced to death. They had defended the bombings as necessary to avenge the treatment of Muslims at the hands of the US and Israel.
Any pardon for Imron could prove highly controversial in Australia where many victims of the attack were from.
Umar Patek, who was jailed for 20 years in 2012 after he was found guilty of making bombs that ripped through two Bali nightclubs, was released on parole in December 2022.
His release sparked anger in Australia, including among victims’ families. The Australian government said at the time that many of its citizens would be “deeply hurt” by Patek’s release, and that it had “sought assurances from the Indonesian government that he will be subject to ongoing supervision and monitoring”."
9BR8WJP8DR_5BRWUMNGV96WEY0,NYPD investigating alleged chemical attack on pro-Palestine Columbia University students,Erum Salam,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/23/alleged-chemical-attack-columbia-students-pro-palestine-new-york,"The New York police department announced on Tuesday it was investigating an alleged chemical attack on students protesting in support of Palestine on Columbia University’s campus last week.
Students protesting Israel’s bombardment of Gaza – which has killed more than 25,000 people, according to Palestinian health officials – reported being sprayed with a chemical that left many with symptoms such as nausea, abdominal pain, headaches and irritated eyes.
Columbia’s chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) said eight students were a hospitalized as a result. Students reported their clothes and hair had a foul smell for hours after the protest.
NYPD is investigating claims that the chemical unleashed on these students is “skunk”, an agent developed in Israel and used as a crowd control weapon, most commonly in the occupied West Bank. SJP said the chemicals were sprayed by two students who are former Israeli soldiers, who mixed in with the crowd by wearing Palestinian keffiyehs. The Guardian could not verify this claim, and the NYPD and Columbia did not directly respond to questions about the identity of the perpetrators. According to a statement from Columbia, “the alleged perpetrators of the attack have been identified and immediately banned from campus while law enforcement’s investigation proceeds”.
The NYPD told the Guardian that a total of six students filed police reports and that no arrests were made. A police spokesperson said that the first victim who filed a report said she “smelled an unknown odor and began to feel nauseated and experienced a burning sensation in her eyes”.
In a letter to students and facultysent on Monday, Columbia’s interim provost, Dennis Mitchell, wrote: “A deeply troubling incident occurred on the steps of Low Library on Friday. Numerous Columbia and Barnard students who attended a protest later reported being sprayed with a foul-smelling substance that required students to seek medical treatment.”
Mitchell added: “We condemn in the strongest possible terms any threats or acts of violence directed toward anyone in our community.”
Mitchell added that the university’s department of public safety is working with the NYPD and federal authorities, and that “the New York City Police Department is taking the lead role in investigating what appear to have been serious crimes, possibly hate crimes”.

“It is an escalation of violence launched against peaceful protesters by individuals who seek to inflict harm and undermine the principles of peaceful dialogue and dissent upheld in any democratic society,” said Afaf Nasher, CAIR-New York’s executive director, in a statement.
Columbia has been at the center of debate surrounding free speech on college campuses since the war in Gaza started. In November, the college banned two pro-Palestinian organizations, SJP and Jewish Voices for Peace (JVP), for allegedly violating campus procedures by holding “unauthorized” events. Demonstrations have persisted on campus nevertheless."
9DVMF5YL8I_FDJK5XX1QJNPQVX,Labour pushes bill to tackle persistent school absenteeism,Sally Weale,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/jan/22/labour-pushes-bill-to-tackle-persistent-school-absenteeism,"Labour is planning to use an opposition day debate motion to bring forward legislation for a new register of children who are not in school as part of plans to tackle persistent absenteeism.
New Labour analysis found that “one in three children currently sitting their GCSEs have missed nearly three months of secondary school since the pandemic” and said this was likely to affect academic attainment.
The motion will seek to take control of the parliamentary order paper to enable the passage of a children not in school (national register) bill, to create a council-maintained register of children not on the school roll.
The measure, which will cover home-schooled children, has attracted widespread support across parliament and beyond, and was included in earlier government legislation, the schools white paper, that was dropped two years ago.
Speaking in December 2022, the education secretary, Gillian Keegan, told MPs on the education committee that a register of children not in school was “a priority” but it did not feature in the king’s speech last November. Keegan reaffirmed the government’s commitment last November and is supporting Conservative MP Flick Drummond’s private members’ bill with the same aim.
Speaking before Tuesday’s motion, the shadow education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, said: “There is no time to waste if we are to tackle the biggest challenge currently facing our schools – that is why Labour’s motion is so essential, and represents the first step of our long-term plan to get to grips with persistent absence.”
Labour’s compulsory national register of home-schooled children was announced by Phillipson this month, when she laid out Labour’s plans to reduce “frankly terrifying” levels of pupil absence in schools in England in the wake of the pandemic.
It would place a legal duty on councils to keep a register of all children who are not in school and on parents to provide information about their child’s education at home. Under Labour’s plans, children in England would be given a unique number to link records held by schools, health visitors and councils to stop any child falling through the gaps.
The motion will say: “That this house condemns the secretary of state for education for her failure to tackle the crisis of persistent school absence.”
It “calls on the government to immediately introduce legislation to amend the Education Act 1996 in order to establish a mandatory duty on local authorities in England to maintain a register of eligible children not in school, as set out in part 3 of the schools bill [Lords] published in the 2022-23 parliamentary session; and therefore makes provision as set out in this order”.
Phillipson will attack the Conservatives’ record on education. “Conservative MPs, including the current schools minister and two former schools ministers, claim to support the register of children not in school but yet again have failed to deliver,” she said.
“The secretary of state has said it is her priority to legislate on a register ‘in the very short term’: that is why Labour is giving her and her Conservative colleagues an opportunity to make good on her pledge.”
A government source said: “We are committed to legislation for a children-not-in-school register and have committed to progress with this when legislative time allows.”"
9FZ0RVXVMV_IF3UUN4ZI9OR2UN,Martin Shkreli ban from pharmaceutical industry upheld by US court,_,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/24/martin-shkreli-drug-industry-ban,"Martin Shkreli, the “pharma bro” entrepreneur who astronomically increased the price of a life-saving drug by more than 4,000% and became a symbol of corporate Wall Street greed, cannot return to the pharmaceutical industry, a court has ruled.
A federal appeals court in New York upheld his lifetime ban from the business.
A three-judge panel of the 2nd US circuit court of appeals in Manhattan said a lower court judge acted properly in imposing the ban and ordering Shkreli to repay $64.6m because of his antitrust violations.
The case had been brought by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), joined by New York, California, Illinois, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia.
Shkreli, 40, became notorious and gained the sobriquet “pharma bro” when, as chief executive of Turing Pharmaceuticals in 2015, he raised the price of the newly acquired antiparasitic drug Daraprim overnight to $750 per tablet from $17.50.
He later served more than four years in prison following his 2017 conviction for defrauding investors in two hedge funds and scheming to defraud investors in another drugmaker.
He was released more than a year early, short of his initial release schedule of September 2023.
In imposing Shkreli’s ban in January 2022, the federal judge Denise Cote cited the entrepreneur’s “particularly heartless and coercive” tactics in monopolizing Daraprim and keeping generic rivals off the market.
Daraprim is used to treat toxoplasmosis, including in Aids patients.
The appeals court rejected Shkreli’s arguments that Cote’s injunction was over broad, and unconstitutionally chilled his free speech by preventing him even from using social media to discuss the pharmaceutical industry.
“Given Shkreli’s pattern of past misconduct, the obvious likelihood of its recurrence, and the life-threatening nature of its results, we are persuaded that the district court’s determination as to the proper scope of the injunction was well within its discretion,” the court said.
Shkreli’s lawyer Kimo Peluso said the sanctions “go well beyond established legal limits”, and a further appeal was possible.
Henry Liu, director of the FTC bureau of competition, said the decision is “a win for consumers seeking affordable, lifesaving medication”, and shows how corporate executives can be personally liable for anticompetitive conduct.
Shkreli works as a software developer and as a law consultant. He originally promoted himself as a genius and a lifesaver and adopted a combative public persona, taking on critics and the media in highly personal spats, and winning publicity for bizarre stunts.
After being convicted, in addition to being banned for life from serving in any capacity in the pharmaceutical industry, Shkreli was also permanently barred from running a public company.

This outcome has looked inevitable ever since the campaign’s botched launch announcement on Twitter, but it was surprising how quickly and totally DeSantis surrendered after losing just a single contest. Many people had heralded DeSantis as the man who could take down Trump, but it was not to be. His campaign began with a whimper – then ended with one too.
The political flaws of DeSantis and his campaign have been so numerous that it’s amazing the Florida governor ever generated so much buzz. He looked politically impressive operating in the safely conservative state of Florida, but he was completely unprepared for the intensity of competitive national politics. He lacked the empathy and personal warmth necessary to connect with voters and donors alike. He proved a poor administrator. He tried to run on his management of the Covid-19 pandemic when voters had moved on. Worst of all, he could offer no plausible reason why Trump voters should opt for him rather than for the real thing.
Despite all of this, DeSantis found huge success among a certain class of Republican pundits and donors. At one point he was hailed by the Murdoch press as “DeFuture”, and conservative writers fell over one another to praise him as the Trump who “gets things done”. When someone so flawed has so many boosters, it’s worth asking about the motivation of the boosters.
In this case, the DeSantis campaign was promoted by a set of conservative elites who saw the opportunity for a kind of “Trumpism without Trump”. DeSantis drew support from people who were happy with the broad direction of the Republican party under Trump, but had doubts about the former president’s competence. Since his victory in 2016, Trump has been a serial loser of elections who invests little time in trying to implement policies, preferring to focus instead on the melodrama of his own political and legal struggles. DeSantis, by contrast, exudes the kind of grim, thuggish determination of Viktor Orbán, the Hungarian prime minister whose policies have made him a hero of the American nationalist right.
As an electoral proposition, this vision was flawed from the get-go. The idea of “Trumpism without Trump” was to take Maga content and present it in some more palatable form. But this ignores the fact that for many grassroots Republicans, Trump’s form is his content. They support him not because of the concrete policies he will implement but because of who he is and what he represents. The unhinged style of communication, the self-pitying beefs with “the establishment”, the unfiltered racism and bigotry – these are the essence of Trumpism, not paraphernalia which can be discarded.
For decades, Republican elites have believed they could channel and control the populism and bigotry of their party’s base. A video from the 2008 election which periodically goes viral of John McCain defending Barack Obama in the face of a racist question from a voter, represents the exception in this history rather than the norm. As a rule, Republican donors and politicians have winked at or actively encouraged the worst instincts of their base, believing they could be harnessed and ridden to victory. The DeSantis candidacy was just the latest example of this. But now the base is in the saddle, and what it wants is Trumpism red in tooth and claw – not some bloodless imitation.
However doomed it was at the polls, there might have been some redemptive quality in the DeSantis project if it had offered a challenge to the yawning ethical chasm at the heart of the Republican party. But rather than denouncing the cruelty towards immigrants, women and trans people that pervades the modern conservative movement, DeSantis merely promised to pursue it with more ruthless efficiency. He showed indifference to the suffering of the people who got in his way, such as the migrants he transported to Martha’s Vineyard and then abandoned for the purposes of a political stunt. The experience made them feel, one said, “like cattle” – yet DeSantis defends the action to this day.
The fact that supporters of the DeSantis project were not actually trying to challenge the core premises and practices of Trumpism will make it easier for them to take the next step: reverting to support for Trump. After he dropped out, DeSantis endorsed Trump with unseemly speed and it may take some of his backers a little longer to come around. But just as in 2016, Republican politicians and media figures will inevitably follow their base and resume backing the former president, even as he engages in Hitlerian rhetoric about migrants “poisoning the blood” of America and promises to be a dictator “on day one”.
As John McCain showed in 2008, there is an alternative course available to former DeSantis backers, if they wanted to take it. They could say publicly what many of them know privately – that while Trump poses a unique danger to the republic, Joe Biden is a decent, patriotic man with whom they happen to have some policy disagreements. They could lament the grip that a racist and authoritarian figure has on such a large segment of their party, and even try to challenge it. But they will not, because that’s never what the DeSantis candidacy was really about it. Instead, they’ll get in line behind Trump – and march themselves and everyone else closer and closer to disaster.

9O3K8UMQ4O_B6M4XYEH24GN6YV,Labour-linked TSSA union faces fresh bullying allegations,Rajeev Syal,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/jan/22/labour-linked-tssa-union-faces-fresh-bullying-allegations,"A Labour-affiliated trade union that was found to have fostered a culture of sexual harassment and coercion over more than a decade is facing new allegations of bullying.
A leaked letter shows that staff at the Transport Salaried Staffs’ Association (TSSA) claim to be working in a “toxic environment”, leaving many with anxiety and hypervigilance.
Their representatives are calling for the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service to intervene, claiming there has been an “abject failure” to follow procedures on bullying. Insiders say there have been three new allegations in recent months.
Last year, the TSSA was overhauled and a group of senior figures stood down after an independent report by Helena Kennedy KC. The general secretary of 11 years, Manuel Cortes, was dismissed for gross misconduct.
Lady Kennedy concluded that women were subject to sexual touching and manipulative behaviour over many years. She also heard evidence of failings in due process, natural justice and governance.
A TSSA insider rejected the allegations and said specific details had not been put to the union by staff reps.
A leaked letter sent to the new general secretary, Maryam Eslamdoust, from GMB London, which represents about 50 TSSA staff, demands to know why the recommendations of the Kennedy report have not been implemented in full.
“Among the staff, there is now an atmosphere of anxiety, hypervigilance and worry. The trust in the leadership that was burgeoning has completely collapsed and in general, staff are once again feeling demoralised, ignored, distrusted and exhausted from the pressures and strains of working in this … toxic environment,” GMB London’s regional organiser, Andrew Harden, wrote on 15 January.
Harden wrote that there had been “an abject failure to follow agreed procedure and protocols regarding staff complaints made about bullying”; that the general secretary was not meeting with the staff reps every week; and that staff appointments were not following proper procedure.
The Guardian first made public the allegations against Cortes in May 2022 after the union enforced a non-disclosure agreement to stop a TSSA organiser from repeating claims that she was harassed by Cortes in 2018. Cortes denied the claims and apologised for any hurt caused by his behaviour.
Weeks later, other women, including the former organisers Maggie Hayes and Hannah Plant, came forward to say they had witnessed inappropriate behaviour.
The Kennedy inquiry was launched in September 2022. After interviewing more than 50 former and current staff, Kennedy wrote: “It gave me no pleasure to uncover a series of appalling incidents, alongside leadership and management failings in the TSSA.
“Some of this behaviour was actually witnessed – or heard – directly by me.”

Managers at the union were controlling, hierarchical and bullying, she said. “The leadership seem to see staff as a problem. I have heard that people in the organisation have been described by senior staff as ‘useless cunts.’”
At the annual conference in June, Cortes made a direct appeal to members to have his dismissal overturned. Having pleaded his case via video link to the conference, he made the surprising decision to take off his shirt on camera while waiting for votes to be counted. The members rejected his appeal.
Eslamdoust was elected in October and previously worked for Jeremy Corbyn as a Labour party staffer. With her 12 years of experience as a councillor in north London, Eslamdoust’s election was seen as bringing in an outsider to help clear up the union’s procedures and reputation.
A TSSA spokesperson said: “The union does not comment on ongoing staff matters. However, we are clear that all the recommendations made by Baroness Kennedy, and by Prof [Hazel] Conley [who published a separate report on the TSSA’s equality policy and practice in February 2023], have either been completed or are being acted on.
“As we said at the time of the Kennedy report publication, TSSA is committed to implementing the widespread change needed. That remans the case.”"
9P6SEEZJFE_F2FOAWV08S12MK2,UK super-rich would be ‘bored to death’ in tax havens – survey,Rupert Neate,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/jan/22/super-rich-would-not-leave-uk-tax-reasons-survey,"The UK’s super-rich “would never leave the country for tax reasons” because they fear they would be “bored to death” in “culturally barren” tax havens, according to new research by experts at the London School of Economics.
Researchers at the LSE interviewed 35 members of the UK’s richest 1% – by wealth or income – and found that none said they would leave the UK for tax reasons. “I wouldn’t go to a tax haven. Can you imagine anything worse than going to a tax haven?” one of the respondents, Leanne, who works in consulting, told the researchers.
“Some tiny little place with just people with yachts and servants. So no, I wouldn’t leave for that kind of reason … I want to live in a vibrant economic climate where there’s room for innovation and, you know, people are inventing, and I think London is like that.”
Another respondent, Luke, who works in law, said: “I have a nice life here [in London]. My clients who moved to the Bahamas were bored to death. Sun, sea and sand. OK, it’s great for a couple of weeks to charge the batteries, but after a while you think, ‘Well, I’d quite like to go and watch an opera.’ Well, you can forget that – there’s not a theatre in the Bahamas.”
Bea and Peter, a couple who both work in finance, said that if they “move to the Middle East, [you] are in gated communities and stuff like that. I never found that attractive in any way.”
Marianne, who works in culture, said the suggestion that there would be a “big brain drain” if the government introduced higher taxes on the wealthy was “complete nonsense. And I will give you the answer why in two words, and that is National Gallery or National Theatre … that’s why people aren’t going to leave London.”
The research by the International Inequalities Institute at the LSE found that the super-rich feared the societal “stigma attached to tax migration”.
“Interviewees were disparaging about those who chose to move for tax purposes,” the research paper said.
“Some judged tax migrants on moral grounds as unduly economically self-interested, while others expressed a snobbery about tax-advantageous destinations as boring and culturally barren.”
The research comes as public and political debate focuses on tax ahead of the general election expected later this year. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, last week indicated that there may be big tax cuts in his March budget, in what was seen as one of the last opportunities for the Conservatives to claw back Labour’s lead in the opinion polls. “I believe fundamentally that low-tax economies are more dynamic, more competitive,” he said.
Hunt has come under pressure to cut taxes amid forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility that they are heading for their highest level since the 1940s. Meanwhile, trade unions, the Green party and some members of the super-rich have called for the introduction of wealth taxes to help pay for battered public services.
A “modest” 1.7% wealth tax on the richest 140,000 people in the UK could raise more than £10bn to help pay for public services, the Trades Union Congress (TUC) suggested last year, but Labour and the Liberal Democrats have ruled out introducing such a tax.
While none of the super-rich people interviewed for the paper, entitled Tax Flight?, Britain’s Wealthiest and Their Attachment to Place, said they were planning to leave over tax, many said they were concerned that the top tax rates in the UK were currently too high and would rise further.
“A minority of interviewees said they would not rule out tax migration, but only if the political and economic conditions in Britain changed dramatically,” the paper said. “A return to top tax rates seen in the 1970s or a Jeremy Corbyn-style government were frequently cited as ‘red-line’ conditions.”
Sam Friedman, professor of sociology at LSE and lead author of the research, said: “We need to challenge the prevailing assumption that if you tax the rich, they will leave.
“The rich are not only strongly embedded, but they are also acutely aware of the stigma of tax migration – of being seen as unduly self-interested or moving to places others consider culturally barren and boring.”"
9WNLVCH1FK_U548V19Z7FM1GUE,Women’s rights are disappearing in Argentina. Don’t be complacent – yours could be next to go,Luciana Peker,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/23/women-rights-argentina-javier-milei-anti-feminist,"The femicide of 14-year-old Chiara Paez, by her boyfriend, in May 2015 provoked national outrage in Argentina. “Are we not going to do anything?” asked journalist Marcela Ojeda. And we did something. On 3 June, the first Ni Una Menos (Not One Less) women’s march against femicide took place.The march awakened a new global awareness in the fight against gender violence. The Ni Una Menos movement was replicated in Peru, Uruguay, Italy and Germany, among other places. In Brazil and Mexico, protests and the hashtag #MiPrimerAcoso (“my first harassment”) took off.
The west followed suit. In 2017, #MeToo exploded, two years after Ni Una Menos. Argentina’s “revolution of the daughters” learned its own resistance from the Mothers and Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo, their search for their children and grandchildren who were kidnapped by the dictatorship that ruled Argentina from 1976 to 1983, and their fight for human rights against that regime. Many of those women were forced to flee Argentina and discovered that they’d have to fight for their rights in Europe, too.
But the country that led the struggle for women’s rights in Latin America has now suffered an extreme, misogynistic setback, and I, too, feel I have been forced to leave my country. Ever since Javier Milei took office in December 2023, his government has deployed a shocking strategy that plunders natural resources, attacks social justice, dismantles the state and erodes the rights of women and sexual diversity. The attacks on feminism that this environment enables are a huge problem for Argentina. It is also a very serious problem for Latin America and for women in the west, however distant it may feel to them.
The great virtue of feminism is not merely its promotion of sexual freedom, campaigning against the wage gap and stopping sexist violence. The power of feminism lies in its ability to transform the political landscape of a world drowning in resignation. It is not just about what is achieved, but showing that collective action does achieve things. Feminism transforms, unifies and revitalises. Feminism is hope – and that makes it the enemy of neo-fascism, which divides, individualises and crushes.
And so, less than a month after taking power, Milei’s government closed the ministry of women, gender and diversity, seemingly reducing policies against gender violence to mere bureaucratic decoration, and has put at risk the right to legal, safe and free abortion, which was won in 2020. Milei has spoken out against feminism, and has been verbally abusive to women, to the point that one female journalist walked off a live TV programme after he said: “I could take a 9mm [gun] and put it to your head.”
Of course, Latin women continue to learn from those in the west. The Argentinian nightmare seems like a real-life version of the apocalyptic British TV series Years and Years, with a woman – in Argentina’s case, the anti-abortion vice-president, Victoria Villarruel – at the helm to soften the image of the kind of regressive authoritarianism also seen in El Salvador, Italy and Hungary.
It also reminds me of Laura Bates’s brave book Men Who Hate Women, which exactly describes the strategies that Milei applied to captivate the angry young men who played an important role in his electoral victory. Such men have declared anyone denouncing abuse, rape, harassment and discomfort their enemy. As a result, the journalists, writers and feminist activists who spoke out have become targets of their attacks. Nearly three-quarters of female journalists around the world who responded to a Unesco survey in 2020 had experienced online violence – including death threats, image-based harassment and threats of sexual violence. They want us dead or silent.
Feminism in Argentina hasn’t been stamped out, but it’s under attack. That’s why I have had to leave the country, after threats, censorship, silencing and the suffocation of my work and income by Milei’s supporters. “You deserve to be next,” someone commented on my Instagram post, when I shared my article on the control weapons due to femicide. I have not left to be silenced, but to continue writing. And I have not left for ever. It’s not personal – it’s political.
Women in Latin America need women in the west to work with us to put an end to this violent oppression. Read the work of Latin authors, activists, writers and journalists, follow them on social media, share their content and support our women’s words, so that violence does not silence us and economic suffocation does not steal our voices again. Our freedom cannot be pushed back. Neither can our words.

Shaken by the Covid-19 pandemic, the WHO’s 194 member states decided more than two years ago to start negotiating an international accord aimed at ensuring countries are better equipped to deal with the next health catastrophe, or to prevent it altogether.
The plan was to seal the agreement at the 2024 World Health Assembly, the WHO’s decision-making body, which convenes on 27 May.
However, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO’s director-general, said the momentum had been slowed down by entrenched positions and “a torrent of fake news, lies, and conspiracy theories”.
He warned that if nobody was prepared to seize the initiative or give ground, the whole project risked going nowhere.
Tedros told the WHO’s executive board in Geneva on Monday: “Time is very short. And there are several outstanding issues that remain to be resolved.”
Failure to strike an agreement would be “a missed opportunity for which future generations may not forgive us”, he said.
Tedros said all countries needed the capacity to detect and share pathogens presenting a risk, and timely access to tests, treatments and vaccines.
He called for a “strong agreement that will help to protect our children and grandchildren from future pandemics”.
Tedros said claims that the accord would cede sovereignty to the WHO or give it the power to impose lockdowns and vaccine mandates were “completely false”.
“We cannot allow this historic agreement, this milestone in global health, to be sabotaged.”
WHO member states decided in December 2021 to create a new international instrument on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response, aimed at ensuring the flaws that turned Covid-19 into a global crisis could never happen again.
The WHO emergencies director, Michael Ryan, reminded countries how the pandemic “ripped apart our social, economic and political systems and became a multi-trillion dollar problem”.
In the midst of major geopolitical conflicts, “this is one thing the world agrees on”, he said.
Roland Driece, who is co-chairing the negotiations, said the project had condensed a seven-year process into two years.
He said the accord should be ambitious, innovative and with clear commitments.
On the disagreements, he said European countries wanted more money invested in pandemic prevention, while Africa wanted the knowledge and financing to make that work, plus proper access to pandemic “countermeasures” such as vaccines and treatments.
He said there were two sessions of two weeks left to do an “extreme” amount of work.
Parallel negotiations are also going on to reform the international health regulations (IHR), which many countries felt had been found badly wanting.
Under these, Tedros declared Covid-19 a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020 – the highest level of alert available under the regulations.
But it was not until March 2020 when he described the worsening situation as a pandemic – a word that does not exist in the IHR vocabulary – that the world jolted into action, by which time the virus was already widespread.
Tedros declared an end to the international emergency in May 2023.
Ashley Bloomfield, the chief executive of New Zealand’s health ministry during the pandemic, is co-chairing the IHR negotiations.
Like Tedros, he criticised a “coordinated and sophisticated campaign” of misinformation and disinformation attempting to undermine the process.
He said there were 300 proposed amendments to plough through during the talks."

The tragedy is the worst in Victorian waters in almost 20 years, Life Saving Victoria said.
Emergency services responded to reports of four people struggling in the water near Newhaven about 3.30pm on Wednesday and all were found unresponsive.
“Life Saving Victoria was called to assist four people in trouble in the waters off Forrest Caves on Phillip Island, only a couple of kilometres from our patrolled lifeguard site,” Kane Treloar, the Life Saving Victoria state agency commander, said.

“Upon arriving at the scene, our lifeguards found that off-duty lifeguards had pulled three of those people from the water and one of our rescue boats pulled that last person from the water.”
All were unconscious and unresponsive and the rescuers started CPR.
“Despite the efforts of all involved, three of those people unfortunately passed away,” Treloar said.
Three people died at the scene on Wednesday, including a 20-year-old woman and a 23-year-old man, both from the Melbourne suburb of Clyde, and a 43-year-old woman who was travelling from India.
The fourth person, a 20-year-old woman from Clyde, was flown to the Alfred hospital in a critical condition but died overnight, police confirmed on Thursday.
Treloar was not aware of the circumstances leading up to the tragedy, warning that particular section of the coast was beautiful but dangerous.
“My understanding is that they did have the intention of spending some time in the water there but it’s certainly not a place that we’d recommend anyone be going swimming,” he said.
“The rip currents there in such an exposed stretch of coastline are quite significant and only a very, very experienced swimmer should be entering the water to swim in those areas.”
Lifesavers have urged anyone planning on going in the water off Phillip Island to stick to the area’s three patrolled beaches.
“It’s certainly an absolutely tragic, tragic event,” the agency’s general manager of lifesaving operations, Liam Krige, said.

“It just goes to highlight that important safety messaging of making sure that when you are heading out to the coastline, you do prioritise heading to a patrolled location and you do prioritise water safety.”
The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, extended her condolences to the families of the victims and thanked first responders who reacted quickly.
“There will be an investigation and reports on yesterday’s incident in terms of what further actions need to be taken at that location,” she said on Thursday.
“The locals who know this area well don’t swim there – it just reminds us of when we’re visiting a place, is to be aware of the local conditions.”
The island is a popular holiday destination south-east of Melbourne, famous for its penguins and the MotoGP.
The Visit Phillip Island tourism body said the caves were formed by erosion of the cliffs and were only accessible at low tides.
Police will prepare a report for the coroner and are not treating the deaths as suspicious.
This story has been amended to clarify the ages and genders of the people who died, after an update from police."
A4JYCG2PX8_Z3NE3OJ4XESYQGX,Brazilian police raid Bolsonaro ally’s home over illegal spying allegations,Tom Phillips,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/25/brazil-police-raid-bolsonaro-ally-home-spying-allegations,"Federal police agents have raided the home and offices of Brazil’s spy chief under the former president Jair Bolsonaro as part of an investigation into the alleged illegal monitoring of thousands of people, including two supreme court judges and a key ally of the current president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
Alexandre Ramagem, a former federal police chief who ran Brazil’s intelligence agency, Abin, during Bolsonaro’s 2019-22 administration, was targeted as part of an inquiry into a “criminal organisation” that allegedly used Israeli spyware to track Bolsonaro’s political foes.
Six mobile phones, four laptops and 20 data storage devices were reportedly seized from Ramagem’s flat in the capital, Brasília, including a phone and a laptop belonging to Abin, for which he no longer works. Computers and documents were taken from his office.
Ramagem, 51, a congressman for Bolsonaro’s rightwing Liberal party, made no immediate comment on Thursday’s raids, which Bolsonaro called “relentless persecution”.
Reports in the Brazilian press say the investigation is focused on a secretive unit allegedly set up within Abin during Bolsonaro’s government called the National Intelligence Centre. The centre is said to have been created in July 2020, tasked with gathering intelligence on supposed “threats to state security and stability”. According to Folha de São Paulo, the unit was staffed with federal police agents close to Ramagem and the Bolsonaro family and became known as Brazil’s “parallel intelligence agency”.
Federal police suspect that the group – which investigators have reportedly nicknamed Abin’s “tracking gang” – was using spying software called FirstMile made by the Israeli firm Cognyte to illegally snoop on government opponents.
The website of the Tel Aviv-based company says it specialises in “threat intelligence analytics” and offers “analytics solutions designed to empower investigation & SOC [security operations centre] teams with actionable insights to detect and mitigate threats effectively”.
FirstMile can reportedly be used to track the mobile phones and tablets of targets by inputting their contact numbers into a system.
Cognyte did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Guardian. Ramagem’s chief of staff said the politician had yet to issue a statement on the police operation. The chief of staff did not reply when asked if Ramagem denied claims that he had been part of a “criminal” group engaged in illegal monitoring operations.
Speaking to the television network GloboNews earlier this month, the head of Brazil’s federal police, Andrei Rodrigues, estimated that the group had snooped on about 30,000 people without judicial authorisation. Information about the whereabouts of those targets was stored at datacentres in Israel, Rodrigues said.
Most of the group’s alleged targets have yet to be identified, although they reportedly include civil servants, journalists, judges, lawyers, politicians and police officers. But on Thursday newspaper reports suggested they included two supreme court judges, Alexandre de Moraes and Gilmar Mendes, and Camilo Santana, a former state governor from Lula’s leftwing Workers’ party. Santana became education minister last January after Lula beat Bolsonaro in the 2022 presidential election.
Moraes, Mendes and Santana were all outspoken critics of Bolsonaro and his far-right administration. O Globo reported that one document discovered by investigators suggested there had been a plot to gather intelligence supposedly indicating a link between an organised crime group and the two supreme court judges in an attempt to create fake news that would discredit them.
Another target was reportedly the former head of Brazil’s lower house, Rodrigo Maia. “I am not surprised,” Maia told Metrópoles.
In Mexico, thousands of citizens including activists, academics, journalists, diplomats and politicians were selected as possible targets for the Israeli spyware company NSO Group, which developed the hacking software Pegasus. Journalists and human rights activists were targeted as recently as 2021, the Guardian reported in late 2022. Activists say the same software has been used to target human rights defenders and journalists in El Salvador.
Political observers said the police operation against Ramagem could be a severe blow to Bolsonaro, who is facing multiple investigations relating to his tumultuous four-year administration and has been barred from seeking office until 2030 for spreading fake news. One prominent journalist described the raids as “a powerful earthquake” that had rocked Bolsonaro’s political project. Another claimed Bolsonaro allies were “in panic” at the potential ramifications of the scandal.
Bolsonaro had hoped to field Ramagem as a candidate for Rio’s next mayor in October, using the former spy chief’s police background to launch a hardline “law and order” campaign in a city long blighted by heavily armed violence.
Last month Ramagem flew to El Salvador with Eduardo Bolsonaro, son of Jair and also a politician, to visit a 40,000-capacity “megaprison” opened by its populist leader, Nayib Bukele, as part of a crackdown on the country’s gangs."
A6H1V0Q5M0_7HPQ6U8OG027YBO,Dennis Greig obituary,_,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/jan/24/dennis-greig-obituary,"Dennis Greig, who has died aged 76, was a poet and the editor of Lapwing Publications, a luminary poetry press in Belfast, for more than 30 years.
At first glance, Dennis looked like a cross between an ancient bard and a heavy-metal guitarist. After a little acquaintance he became an even more visionary figure. Michael Longley gave his blessings and voice to the establishment of Lapwing Publications, as well as Mairtín Crawford, himself an interstellar force in the promotion of new poets beyond the safety nets of academia. The cross-community nature of the venture was never in doubt, and it became the wellspring of Dennis’s theatrical projects – along with his wife, Rene, he ran a theatre group for young actors, touring to venues in Ireland and to Brighton.
Lapwing was established in 1988 and has produced more than 500 volumes, an astonishing mixture of ingenues and established writers, many from Ireland, but by no means exclusively so. If an unknown writer’s manuscript showed style, vigour, a refusal to conform and yet a celebration of formal skills, it would find a home in the citadel at Ballysillan. At the same time, if a poet languished from the vagaries of fashion, Lapwing gave space and vital support, if such support was warranted. Dennis was stubborn, voluble, brazen in his assaults on any kind of complacency or cabal. It was common to receive a Swiftian diatribe in the course of an otherwise mundane communication: his knowledge and passion for literature was in his bloodstream.
Dennis’s mother, Ruth Greig, was a cleaner all her life. His father was an Australian serviceman; Dennis never knew his name. Leaving school at 15, Dennis worked full-time in an Indian takeaway restaurant before studying engineering at Feldon College (now part of the Northern Regional College) in Northern Ireland (1979-82); then conflict-resolution counselling and theatre, at Queen’s University Belfast on a Workers’ party initiative (1993); and, finally, English literature at the University of Ulster (2012). For 20 years from 1973 he worked for TRW Mission, manufacturing parts that were used on space rockets. His passion for theatre and poetry found expression in founding the Hammer writers’ group in 1983.
Throughout Dennis’s struggle for recognition, Rene (nee Snoddy) was not only a soulmate, but a fellow pilgrim for the arts and for cross-community projects. They met in a dancehall in Belfast in 1966 and married in 1969. They were inseparable and did a great sideline in ballroom dancing, dressing for the occasion with panache.
The final years of Dennis’s life were blighted with illness, remissions and setbacks. During a brief respite from hospital, he attended a tribute reading for himself and Lapwing Press at the Linen Hall library in Belfast. Afterwards, palpably drained, he refused an ambulance back to the Queen Victoria. I only understood why when I swear I saw Dennis, Rene and their son Amos gathered on a bench, cigarettes ablaze.

A8AL8SG7OK_PQJ5BXTZ3I3J48X,Horizon scandal: concern over complex route to justice for Scottish victims,Libby Brooks,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/23/horizon-scandal-concern-over-complex-route-to-justice-for-scottish-victims,"This week, the long-running public inquiry into the Horizon IT scandal will take evidence on the case of Bill Quarm, a father of five who ran a post office in Scotland’s Outer Hebrides.
Quarm did not live to see his conviction quashed last year, after pleading guilty to a charge of embezzlement in 2010 to avoid a prison sentence, but his widow, Anne, has described the shame that overwhelmed her husband in the aftermath of his prosecution.
While about 900 post office workers across the UK were prosecuted on the basis of evidence from the faulty digital accounting system, estimates of those affected in Scotland have fluctuated between 54 and 100. But what is certain is that only 17 have thus far come forward seeking review of their convictions.
MSPs supporting post office operators are raising serious concerns about the more complicated and daunting route to justice facing Horizon victims in Scotland.
Indeed, Calum Greenhow, chief executive of the National Federation of SubPostmasters and a post office operator for 22 years in the village of West Linton, south of Edinburgh, has accused Scotland’s chief prosecutor of “placing further obstacles in the road to justice”.
In Scotland, the cases were investigated by the Post Office but they were prosecuted by the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS), the state prosecutor in Scotland, in contrast to England and Wales where the Post Office pursued the vast majority of cases directly.
Dorothy Bain, the lord advocate who heads the COPFS, gave a statement to the Scottish parliament last week in which she raised the possibility that “not every case in which Horizon evidence is present will represent a miscarriage of justice” – setting her at odds with the first minister, Humza Youaf, who has said his government would work with UK counterparts to adopt Rishi Sunak’s pledge of blanket exoneration.
Greenhow said: “Down south, it looks like the judiciary is willing to work with the prime minister to have these convictions quashed irrespective of whether the individuals have come forward or not. But the lord advocate have argued that due process must be followed, with prosecutors coming to the appeal court to explain why they are no longer relying on a conviction.
“I understand Bain saying that the court can’t have a kneejerk reaction, but her tone and language were not empathetic to what people have endured over decades.”
Michael Marra MSP, who hosted a group of post office operators at Holyrood last summer, believes there are a variety of reasons why Scottish Horizon victims may not have come forward. He said: “Some have moved on, some are too traumatised by their experience to return to it, and there is an ongoing lack of trust with the post office.”
He added: “The Lord advocate’s statement to parliament last week added further uncertainty to the process, at points contradicting what the first minister had previously said. People feel they are being asked to re-engage with an arduous process but serious doubts remain as to whether the outcome will be any different.”
In September 2020, the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission, which continues to encourage potential victims of injustice to come forward, wrote to 73 individuals who may have been wrongly convicted by Horizon evidence, undertaking extensive follow-ups given the difficulties of locating those involved in what are largely historic cases.
Since then, 17 individuals have sought s review of their cases, resulting in seven referrals to the high court, four of which have resulted in convictions being overturned.
Last week, Bain said the Crown Office had been reviewing about 100 potential Horizon cases, which had since been reduced to 54.
The SNP MSP Michelle Thomson last week asked Bain what consideration had been given to how the potential for retraumatisation could act as a barrier to some people applying for a review. Bain said this was a legitimate point. Thomson also pointed to the complex and time-consuming nature of claim forms that applicants who already feel poorly served by the legal establishment are expected to fill out.
She asked: “Are different treatment and timescales in Scotland really sustainable?”"
ACD2CAKL08_YPA6O9J2E09C98Q,‘He had a machete in his cheek’: how Guatemala’s hydropower dream turned deadly,_,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/jan/22/he-had-a-machete-in-his-cheek-how-guatemalas-hydropower-dream-turned-deadly,"Every morning, Juan Alonzo, a 35-year-old Indigenous farmer, accompanies his eldest son to work in the cardamom and corn fields along the Pojom River. Until 2017, Alonzo’s father also made the journey. But on 17 January that year, Sebastián Alonzo, 68, was killed in a demonstration against a hydroelectric project in the Ixquisis valley, an oasis of rivers and plantations in north-west Guatemala.
Since the tragedy, Juan has developed a stammer. Two of his four daughters sit on his lap as he visits his father’s grave, remembering his prominence in the Maya-Chuj Indigenous community: “My dad was very involved in the struggle for natural resources.” Juan believes it is the reason Sebastián was killed.

In Yulchén Frontera, one of the eight villages that make up the valley, a few miles from the Mexican border, subsistence farmers live in extreme poverty, without electricity and other modern amenities, which drives young people to emigrate to the US.
Yet this region is very rich in one resource: water. Three rivers – Río Pojom, Río Negro and Río Yolhuitz – are the lifeblood of these Indigenous Maya communities. The area can only be reached via pickup trucks that navigate the winding and hazardous mountain roads.
This wealth of resources caught the eye of one Guatemalan company. Previously known as Promoción y Desarrollos Hídricos, Sociedad Anónima (PDH, SA) and since renamed Energía y Renovación, the company’s arrival in 2010 marked the beginning of a long conflict over natural resources in the valley that continues to this day.
In 2012, Energía y Renovación called the eight villages of the Ixquisis valley to a meeting, during which villagers say it outlined the benefits the project would bring: the construction of schools and health centres, improved access to drinking water and, above all, the long-awaited arrival of electricity to the community – although the company denies that power was promised. At first, most of the inhabitants were enthusiastic.
Sebastián Alonzo was a man of few words and no formal education. But, his son says, when he met a company worker who told him a tunnel was being built to divert the Pojom River he immediately realised the threat to his land. “Are you going to leave us with nothing?” he asked.
The company says that although the river was to be diverted, 36% of its natural flow would still run along the original course, enough to sustain the current ecosystem. Despite this reassurance, Alonzo’s opposition to the Energía y Renovación hydroelectric project remained firm from that moment until the day he died.

María Bautista, a 39-year-old schoolteacher, lives in San Mateo Ixtatán, about 28 miles (45km) from the valley, but owns a modest plot of land and a tin house in the village of Yulchén Frontera, next to one of the rivers the hydroelectric project planned to divert.
Bautista feels that the company played on the needs of the villagers in order to persuade them to agree to the project.
Well-educated and fluent in Spanish, Bautista studied the law. After Energía y Renovación arrived, she identified inconsistencies in what she says it was proposing to residents. Under Guatemalan law, electricity generation and distribution are two separate activities. Guatemala’s National Electrification Institute is the only entity authorised to distribute electricity. Thus, Bautista realised, Energía y Renovación was not in fact able to offer electricity to the villages.

“They already had a document they wanted people to sign. I realised our people didn’t understand much of what they were reading ... So I gave my opinion and people didn’t sign,” says Bautista.
She was the first woman to oppose the hydroelectric project. Other mothers and neighbours joined her once it became clear that the electricity produced by the project would not supply the valley but would go to the central electricity grid.

Despite opposition, in 2013 the company obtained funding from IDB Invest to construct two power plants. This private organisation, a subsidiary of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) whose purposes include contributing to sustainable development in the region, receiving funds from 48 countries – including the United Kingdom since 2023 – decided to invest £11.2m of finance in the project.
By 2017, 30% of the project had been completed. The company planned to adjust four other watercourses in addition to the Pojom: the Primavera, Varsovia, Palmira and Negro rivers. Parts of the Yal Witz mountain – considered sacred by local people, who believe deities inhabit it – were dynamited to create tunnels to divert the Pojom River.
With Bautista and Juan Alonzo at the forefront, Yulchén Frontera became the heart of the opposition to the hydroelectric dam, and demonstrations against the project grew louder. On 17 January 2017, between 600 and 1,000 people from different municipalities around San Mateo Ixtatán marched in Ixquisis against Energía y Renovación.

Sebastián Alonzo was there. As the protesters reached a meadow, armed individuals began firing. The gunfire dispersed the crowd as protesters fled in all directions. Everyone except for Alonzo. His body lay motionless on the ground, his green T-shirt soaked with blood.
“When I looked back, he was already lying there with a blow to his eye and a machete in his cheek,” recalls Juan. His father remained there for four hours without medical assistance. When his friends returned, he had two bullet wounds, one in the back of his head and one in his chest. Sebastián died a few hours later while being transferred to the nearest hospital, three hours from Ixquisis.
Court papers relating to the case of murdered protester Sebastián Alonzo
Between 2012 and 2022, 1,335 land activists, like Sebastián Alonzo, were killed in Latin America – about 70% of all deaths – making it the most dangerous region in the world for environmentalists. As in about 95% of these murders, the crime remains unpunished as police investigations into Alonzo’s death are still “in progress” almost seven years later. To date, apart from a few interviews with witnesses, the police have not carried out any in-depth investigation into the events.
Cristian Otzin, a lawyer specialised in the defence of Indigenous rights, whom the Alonzo family asked to investigate the murder, argues that private security guards from Energía y Renovación shot at protesters and fatally wounded Sebastián Alonzo in 2017. “It’s the most likely hypothesis,” he says.
Interviewed in his office in Guatemala City, Alfonso de León, director of Energía y Renovación, said the security guards were not responsible for the shooting.
“For [the protesters], everything is the company’s responsibility. If it rains or doesn’t rain, it’s the company’s fault,” De León says. “It is up to the authorities to determine what happened that day.”

Since the farmer’s death, women like Bautista are at the heart of the battle for water. She says that she believes Sebastiàn Alonzo’s death was intimidation: “It was like saying to us: ‘Don’t protest any more.’ But on the contrary, it pushed us to continue the struggle.”
They face numerous obstacles. Between 2014 and 2022, the Interamerican Association for Environmental Defence (AIDA) registered almost 100 acts of violence, including intimidation of leaders, poisoning of pets, and physical assaults on opponents of the Ixquisis hydroelectric project.
For months, Bautista says she received anonymous death threats every day, as did other women who did not fall in line.
“[The anonymous callers] told me not to get involved in this problem and not to cry when something was going to happen, because they had warned me,” she says, adding: “Those of us who demonstrated were called ‘whores’. They threatened they were going to rape us, and we were afraid to walk alone at night.”

Fear didn’t stop her, though. She says: “At first, my family was not so supportive of this struggle, and my parents would always tell me, ‘Be careful. We don’t like you being involved in this, don’t go any more.’ But I say, I feel it is a job I started, and I must finish it.”
Led by Bautista, the women documented how the hydroelectric project and the modification of the rivers were affecting them and submitted a formal complaint. In response, IDB’s Independent Monitoring and Investigation Mechanism (MICI) withdrew its support for the project in April 2022 – a first for the institution. The development bank claimed the company had said there were few Indigenous people in the project area – when, in fact, they made up 86% of the population – and, among other issues, had failed to conduct a proper consultation process. .

After losing its major investor, the project is now at a standstill. But De León remains confident in the project’s future. He says: “It has technical and social viability and must continue. We will look for new investors.”
The role of women was crucial to the withdrawal of funding for the project. MICI recognised that the project did not comply with its gender policy since women were disadvantaged, as they were the most dependent on water from the rivers.
“Without water, we are finished,” says Catalina, a woman from Bella Linda, one of the villages in the valley, who is pregnant with her fifth child. “From 5am, I use the river water to heat my coffee, and then to cook and drink, and to clean my clothes, like all the women here. The best future we can give our children is to protect the water. We owe it to Sebastián.”

With the support of international associations, some of the female activists have received legal training law, allowing them to help lead the struggle for water rights. They now attend and speak at the assemblies in Ixquisis, where the future of their villages are decided. The youngest says: “Now we feel we are part of the decisions and our opinion counts. It’s new for us.”
At the end of an assembly held in the spring of 2022, Bautista explains how overwhelmed she is by the progress that had been made. “I was moved because there are few opportunities for women to express themselves, to defend themselves. No matter what happens, we will protect our rivers.”
Behind barbed wire, the company’s facilities remain, waiting for investment.

AFO2A1BET8_MUIRWDRHNK70Y8E,You don’t need to be a ship-jumping polls guru to work out Rish!’s numbers are dire,John Crace,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/jan/25/simon-clarke-rishi-sunak-ship-jumping-polls-guru-sketch,"Drip, drip, drip. The first rule of any political rebellion is to learn how to count. Something the none too bright Simon Clarke has yet to master. Though, to be fair, it is more than possible that several MPs who promised to support his call for Rishi Sunak to be replaced faded back into the shadows when the time came. Disloyalty can be contagious. If you can betray Rish! then it’s all too easy to betray Simple Simon. And the Tory right are not noted for keeping their promises.
So Clarke had been left to go it alone. A one-man rebellion shouted down by Tories from both the left and the right of the party. The closest to unity the Conservatives had come in months. And all because Simple Simon had committed the cardinal sin of telling the truth.
That kind of error just can’t be tolerated. Every Tory knows the polling is desperate, that Sunak is desperately unpopular and that the government faces annihilation at the election. It’s just that this information has to be borne with a stoicism bordering on denial. Not least because to suggest doing something about it by replacing Rishi risks a more immediate disaster of yet another unelected prime minister. It’s lose-lose.
Having originally stomped off in a sulk after finding himself on his own, Simple Simon came out of hiding for a few minutes to give a short interview to the BBC. Mainly it seemed to troll Liz Truss with a few gags about iceberg lettuces – presumably he had imagined she would be putting herself forward as the nation’s saviour – rather than to add anything new.
His basic argument was that the Tories were fucked if they stuck with Rishi and fucked if they didn’t. But the latter option might be more exciting. And it wasn’t as if the government was doing anything.
But it turned out Simple Simon wasn’t entirely alone. Because also jumping ship was Will Dry, a previously unknown special adviser in No 10. Dry, it turned out, was 26 going on 14. A photo of him revealed a teen who had been rejected at an audition for The Inbetweeners on the grounds that he looked far too young.
And yet Will had somehow come to be a Downing Street essential. Sunak couldn’t function without him. The man boy, who knew little and had done less, was more or less running the country. No wonder everything is all going so well.
But in his short working life, Dry has been on quite the journey. As a second-year undergraduate, he was part of a campaign to rejoin the EU. That seems to be the last sensible thing anyone can remember him doing. Because even as it became clearer to everyone that all of the so-called Brexit bonuses had turned out to be imaginary, Will became a Brexit believer and a signed-up member of the Sunak fan club.
Will couldn’t leave it there, though. For now Sunak is too mainstream, too centrist for him. The Rwanda plan is for wimps. So Dry has jumped ship and hooked up with the Conservative Britain Alliance (CBA), a largely anonymous group of rightwing misfits headed up by that serial failure David Frost.
Give Dry a few more minutes and he’ll be in bed with Richard Tice and Nigel Farage. And by the end of the year he will be working with Vladimir Putin. You get the feeling Dry likes strong government.
It seems that Will’s specialism is polling. Some call him a guru. That would be his imaginary friends. After all, you don’t need to be a genius to work out that the polling data for Sunak is dire. And his main contribution to his new – temporary – soulmates at the CBA has been to compile one of the most idiotic questionnaires in polling history.
“If there was a really brilliant Tory leader, one who everybody in the country really liked and could cut taxes while not crashing the economy, who could find a cure for dementia and bring world peace: would you then vote for him, rather than Keir Starmer?” Clearly, the boy will go far.
On second thoughts, maybe you can see why Tories aren’t rushing to rally behind Simple Simon. From one loser to another. But in the meantime, the government has to maintain the fiction that it is actually doing something other than fighting among itself. So it was the turn of the junior policing minister, Chris Philp, to look busy.
Philp is something of a collector’s item. Widely considered – even by fellow ministers – to be less than competent, but adored by himself. Seemingly undeterred by his slide down the pecking order – he was once a cabinet minister under Liz Truss, a sure sign that he isn’t actually very good – Chris is quite happy to repeat any nonsense that anyone in power wants him to.
It’s doubtful he actually believes anything much at all, because to believe requires some thought and some integrity. Albeit misguided. Rather he is the brown-noser’s brown-noser.
Still, the Philpster loves himself. Even though he lacks self-awareness. His Twitter biography describes him as a “serial entrepreneur”. Maybe one day he will get round to repaying those who lost thousands when businesses he founded went bankrupt. Just a thought. But for Thursday morning, Chris was out and about on the airwaves bigging up the government’s latest ideas to reduce knife crime.
It didn’t go altogether to plan. Not least because every interviewer could spot the very obvious flaws. First, the government had come up with 16 previous proposals that hadn’t worked. Why should this one? Especially when it wasn’t due to be implemented until the autumn.
Philp was all bristle and bustle. No one could possibly have foreseen that manufacturers would get around legislation by making zombie knives without markings, he said. That had really blindsided him.
And no, he hadn’t thought to include swords because … because … why would he? “Look,” he continued. “I know the legislation will need tightening up, but we can tighten it up later.”
Run that past us again. You know it’s bad legislation but you can’t be bothered to get it right now? Yup, that was exactly it, Chris nodded enthusiastically.
So why had the government cut youth services by 75%? That was because Labour had crashed the economy. Not only was this untrue, but it’s a measure of the failure. The Tories have been in power for 14 years and are still disowning any responsibility.
And that was that. Philp came back to the Home Office, genuinely believing he had nailed it. This can’t go on. The next rebellion can’t be far away."
AOGMW9804M_OOCWEKV4C345IF9,Trump edges closer to Biden clash but Haley undaunted: New Hampshire takeaways,Joan E Greve,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/23/new-hampshire-primaries-takeaways-trump-biden,"The New Hampshire primary, even with its history of unpredictability and freethinking independents, produced a familiar result on Tuesday: Donald Trump v Joe Biden.
After months of heavy campaigning in the state, the former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley came in second place in the Republican primary. Securing a double-digit win over Haley, Trump nabbed his second decisive victory after the Iowa caucuses a week before.
In the Democratic primary, Joe Biden’s name wasn’t on the ballot after the Democratic National Committee decided to have their first primary in South Carolina in early February. But New Hampshire decided to go ahead with the Democratic primary anyway, and Biden handily won through write-in votes, although the DNC has said that no delegates will be awarded based on the results.
The dynamics of the New Hampshire primary, which marked the second voting event of the 2024 election season, also held some insights for the high-stakes general election in November. Here are five things you need to know.
New Hampshire is known for its independent voting bloc – which comprises 40% of the electorate. This group has helped numerous presidential candidates rise to the top in past elections, or at least remain competitive. Haley was hoping Republican-leaning independent voters would respond to her tempered messaging, in which she pitched herself as a younger, fresher face and antidote to both Trump and Biden.
Although independent voters were not able to lift Haley to victory, their support for her could create a problem down the road for Trump. According to an NBC News exit poll, Haley won 73% of Republican primary voters who described themselves as moderate. If Trump wants to defeat Biden in November, he will need to sway some of those moderate Republicans, and Haley’s strong performance with that voting bloc indicates the former president has much more work to do to win their support.
Despite her third-place finish in Iowa and her double-digit loss in New Hampshire, Haley still insists that she will continue on in the Republican primary. As she addressed supporters in New Hampshire on Tuesday night, Haley expressed optimism about her home state of South Carolina, which will hold its Republican primary on 24 February.
“New Hampshire is first in the nation. It is not the last in the nation,” Haley said. “This race is far from over. There are dozens of states left to go, and the next one is my sweet state of South Carolina.”
But polls show Haley trailing far behind Trump in South Carolina, so it remains unclear how the state might shake the fundamental dynamics of the race.
Because of the strange circumstances of the Democratic primary, Biden’s name was not on the ballot, though the names of long-shot candidates Dean Phillips and Marianne Williamson were. There was some concern that Biden’s decision not to run in New Hampshire could provide an opening for a candidate like Phillips, who tried to present himself as more electable than the sitting president.
But in the end, Biden cruised to an easy victory thanks to the help of a write-in campaign led by his most loyal supporters and promoted by surrogates like Congressman Ro Khanna of California, who traveled to New Hampshire over the weekend.

New Hampshire provided further evidence that the 2024 general election in November will indeed be a rematch between Biden and Trump, and members of both parties indicated on Tuesday that they are ready to move past the primary.
“While we work toward November 2024, one thing is increasingly clear today,” Julie Chávez Rodriguez, Biden’s campaign manager, said on Tuesday. “Donald Trump is headed straight into a general election matchup where he’ll face the only person to have ever beaten him at the ballot box: Joe Biden.”
With more and more Republican lawmakers lining up to endorse Trump, the former president’s allies called on Haley to withdraw from the race to allow the party to focus on defeating Biden in November.
Taylor Budowich, CEO of the pro-Trump Super PAC Make America Great Again Inc, said on Tuesday: “It’s time for unity, it’s time to take the fight to the Democrats, and for Nikki Haley: it’s time to drop out.”
During the Iowa caucuses, a clear majority of Republican voters said they believe that Trump won the 2020 election, despite all evidence supporting a fair Biden win. In New Hampshire, early exit polling and interviews showed that there was more of an even split among Republicans in that state who believe the false claims about widespread election fraud in the 2020 election and those who do not.
As a Haley voter, Patricia Hemenway, told the Guardian on Tuesday: “I will have to say the January 6 thing was absolutely revolting to me.”
Nevertheless, Trump leaned into the big lie in his victory speech on Tuesday. “We won in 2016. And if you really remember, if you want to play it straight, we also won in 2020, by more,” he said. “And we did much better in 2020 than we did in 2016.”"
ARG7097NFI_QPBXOHDVLRWT852,Psychologists renew demand for doubling of Medicare-subsidised sessions,Sarah Basford Canales,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/23/psychologists-renew-demand-for-doubling-of-medicare-subsidised-sessions,"Psychologists are renewing calls for the federal government to double the number of subsidised psychology sessions a patient can access, along with reducing the growing gap fee, as the cost-of-living crisis puts households under financial strain.
The Australian Association of Psychologists Inc, one of two psychology peak bodies, wants the federal government to lift the Medicare rebate by more than $50 for some sessions and increase the number of subsidised sessions from 10 to 20.
The renewed calls coincide with alarming statistics on suicide and self-harm released by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare last week, showing higher figures in 2022 across New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria.
With a GP-approved mental health care plan, patients can receive a Medicare rebate of $93 a session with a general psychologist.
The rebate increases to $137 a session with a clinical psychologist – a psychologist with further training to specialise in a particular area.
Many psychologists are charging about $300 a session, according to the Australian Psychology Society’s schedule of recommended fees, and Carly Dober, a director at the AAPi and psychologist, said the rebate should be lifted to at least $150 for both types of psychologists.
“Research tells us, overall, Australians are feeling more mental health distress than they were last year, and in the years before that,” Dober said.
“The cost of living has made more people financially stressed or strained and has made them … make difficult decisions about where their money goes with no real end in sight,” she said.
“Unfortunately, that means that people are either rationing their treatment … or it means that people are foregoing their sessions in general because they actually can’t afford it.”
The Australian Psychology Society chief executive, Dr Zena Burgess, said the 10 sessions should stay in place for those with mild mental health conditions while 20 sessions should be offered to those with “more complex issues”.
“While the government has made some positive steps, much more is needed to ensure Australians, especially those with complex needs and our most disadvantaged, can rely on their Medicare card and not their credit card to treat their mental ill-health,” she said.
“In addition to increasing rebates for patients, the federal government should work with the states to get more psychologists working and living in areas of need, as well as investing in more psychologists in schools so we can better support our youngest Australians.”

While the federal government has conceded “more work is needed” to ensure Australians can get the mental healthcare they need, it said the temporary addition of 10 extra therapy sessions actually worsened outcomes.
Under the former Coalition government, Australians with a GP-approved mental health care plan could access up to 20 subsidised psychology sessions – a Covid-era measure that expired in December 2022 and was not renewed by the Albanese government.
The Better Access report, released in December 2022, showed the amount of new people accessing psychology sessions had reduced by 7.25% between 2020 and 2021, and out of pocket costs increased from $74 a session in 2021 to $90 in 2022.

It found while the extra 10 sessions led to better outcomes, it “disproportionately” favoured people on relatively higher incomes in major cities. However, the review recommended the extra 10 sessions remain and targeted towards those with “complex mental health needs”.
The health minister, Mark Butler, said the Coalition’s doubling of sessions had resulted in more people missing out.
Since returning to 10 sessions a year in 2023, an extra 45,000 people had accessed the Better Access program, he said.
“The temporary addition of 10 Medicare-subsidised sessions introduced during Covid worsened these problems and meant tens of thousands of Australians missed out on getting any care, altogether,” Butler said.
“An additional 45,000 people have received Better Access sessions in 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, since the former government’s scheduled end date of 31 December 2022.
“While this is a positive step, more work is needed so all Australians – no matter where they live or what their circumstances – can get the mental healthcare they need.”
A mental health reform advisory committee set up to evaluate the Better Access program is considering how to make services more accessible and affordable, and the best way to provide services for those with lower levels of needs, through to severe and complex needs.
Data released by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare showed the number of suicides had increased in 2023 to November in Victoria. In NSW, the figure from January to October 2023 was slightly lower compared with the previous year.

ASCX5XI43L_39OWF2O11OK28E1,"UK should invest in green economy instead of tax giveaways, study shows",Fiona Harvey,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/22/uk-should-invest-in-green-economy-instead-of-tax-giveaways-lstudy-shows,"The UK should invest £26bn a year in a low-carbon economy to revive prosperity instead of planning tax giveaways that will only lead to further stagnation, leading economists have advised.
Investing in energy infrastructure, transport, innovation in new technologies such as AI, and the natural environment would boost the UK’s economy rapidly, the research found.
Public investment at that level would be likely to generate about twice as much accompanying investment from the private sector, and would quickly pay off in higher productivity, efficiency savings, economic growth and carbon reductions, according to a major paper by Lord Stern, a former chief economist of the World Bank, and colleagues from the London School of Economics.
Current government plans to stifle investment, by contrast, would lead to a “continuation of stagnant productivity and weak economic growth”.
The findings are strikingly similar to the commitments made repeatedly by Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, to invest £28bn a year in a “green prosperity plan”. Those commitments have come under sustained attack from the Tories, and are now to be reviewed by the opposition leadership this week, as some figures within the party are understood to favour dropping the pledge.
The authors of the LSE paper, entitled Boosting Growth and Productivity in the UK Through Investments in the Sustainable Economy, published on Monday, arrived at their conclusions independently, by examining the fitness of the UK’s crumbling infrastructure, the challenges and benefits of low-carbon investment, the broader economic environment and international competition.
Dimitri Zenghelis, lead author of the paper, said: “This does indeed mean that Labour’s £28bn-a-year green investment plans are of the right magnitude, consistent with investing in the structural change associated with a sustainable and resilient transition.”
But he noted that the investments required – equivalent to an increase in public investment of roughly 1% of GDP – were also similar to those espoused by the former prime minister Boris Johnson, when he held the presidency of the G7 group of advanced industrialised nations.
Zenghelis said the research suggested that any “fiscal headroom” within the public finances, owing to better than expected economic performance, would be better allocated to investment than to tax cuts, which the Conservative government is planning.
“The evidence suggests that [such an uplift in public investment], after more than a decade of underinvestment, gives the UK the best chance of staying in, and possibly ahead of, the global innovation, efficiency and productivity game,” said Zenghelis.
“High taxes do constrain private activity, but the evidence shows that in the UK the far bigger constraint is deficient core infrastructure and underinvestment in produced, human, intangible and natural capital.”
Shaun Spiers, executive director of the Green Alliance thinktank, who was not involved in the LSE report, said: “The UK has been underinvesting for the last 45 years. The consequences are evident all around us, in failing infrastructure, costly energy and a depleted natural world.

“Lord Stern and his colleagues are absolutely right. Public investment must be stepped up if we are to achieve net zero, restore nature and compete with countries around the world who are investing in the green industries of the future. It is what the private sector is looking for to give it the confidence to invest.”
Ed Miliband, the shadow secretary of state for energy security and net zero, said: “While the Tories refuse to invest in the greatest economic opportunity of the 21st century, now Jeremy Hunt’s economic advisers are saying they are dead wrong. Britain needs investment to grow our economy, cut energy bills and deliver energy security for our country.
“Labour’s green prosperity plan will get Britain out of the doom loop of 14 years of low growth and stagnant living standards under the Tories, by rebuilding the strength of British industry with clean, homegrown power that we control in this country.”
A government spokesperson said: “This government is focused on long-term decisions to strengthen our economy, which is why at autumn statement we announced a business investment package which could raise investment by around £20bn a year in a decade’s time.
“We’re leading the world in our transformation of the energy industry towards more clean and renewable energy, with over 80,000 green jobs being supported or in the pipeline since 2020, and our plans to power up Britain are expected to attract a further £100bn investment in green industries of the future.”"
AU52CUMXID_BOPFG93YO3ZJ9LA,US ‘disappointed’ Hungary taking so long to approve Sweden joining Nato,Lili Bayer,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/26/us-disappointed-that-hungary-taking-so-long-to-approve-sweden-joining-nato,"The US is disappointed Hungary’s ratification of Sweden joining Nato is taking so long, Washington’s ambassador has said, saying that Budapest is “really alone” and that the Hungarian government is pursuing a “foreign fantasy” instead of foreign policy.
After months of delays, Turkey’s parliament approved Sweden’s Nato membership this week. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, signed it off on Thursday, leaving Hungary as the only country in the 31-member western military alliance that has yet to ratify the Swedish bid.
While the Hungarian government formally supports Sweden’s accession, the country’s parliament has avoided voting on the matter, fuelling frustration among Nato allies and raising questions about the motivations of Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán.
The Hungarian leader routinely criticises his western allies and has been nurturing relationships with Moscow and Beijing.
In an interview at the US embassy in Budapest on Thursday afternoon, the US ambassador, David Pressman, said: “An alliance is only as strong as the commitments that we make to each other and the commitments that we keep.
“I think that it’s important that the Hungarian government live up to its commitment, and its commitment has been that it will not be the last ally to ratify Sweden’s accession.”
He added: “Keeping your word is obviously an important element of trust in any relationship.”
Domestically, senior Hungarian politicians have argued that Sweden’s bid has not been put to a parliamentary vote because the country has been critical of the state of Hungarian democracy. Nevertheless, diplomats familiar with the Nato application process say Hungary never formally raised any objections to Swedish membership.
This week, Orbán sent a letter to his Swedish counterpart, Ulf Kristersson, inviting him for discussions, a proposal Sweden’s prime minister has accepted while indicating he will not be negotiating over the country’s Nato membership.
Asked whether Hungary had presented any demands, Pressman said: “The United States is unaware of what is causing the delay by the Hungarian government.”
He was blunt about Washington’s position, saying: “We’re disappointed that this has taken so long. And we look forward to Hungary living up to the commitment it’s made to the United States and to its other allies.”
The ambassador also underscored Budapest’s deepening diplomatic isolation, beyond the issue of Sweden’s Nato accession.
“Hungary is really alone – and it doesn’t need to be,” he said, citing Hungarian government decisions such as blocking EU financing for Ukraine, holding talks with Vladimir Putin and resisting efforts to diversify away from Russian energy as “worrying signs”.
While Hungary is formally an ally of the US, Orbán has listed the US president, Joe Biden, as one of his opponents and senior Hungarian officials have accused Washington of meddling in Hungarian politics. Government-controlled media routinely run anti-American content, including conspiracy theories about US foreign policy.
“The bilateral relationship between the US and Hungary is extremely difficult,” the ambassador said.
Pressman also described the Hungarian government’s foreign policy as a “fantasy”.
“The Hungarians have this idea that it’s a political communications device where they’re constantly talking about imperialists and colonialists and Brussels and George Soros – and all of these entities who are trying to ‘interfere’ in its domestic politics – and it’s really a fantasy,” he said. “And it’s a fantasy that is serving some political purpose in this country, but is also distracting from some of the real challenges and opportunities that Hungary has.
“And part of that fantasy involves waiting out other governments – so whether it’s wishing to see a different leadership in the European Commission or different leadership in the United States of America or different leaders in any country around Europe. It’s not a foreign policy, it’s a foreign fantasy,” he added.
The ambassador emphasised that he believed Hungary’s attempt to wait for other governments to change meant it was not addressing today’s issues.
“I think everyone would be well-served getting out of the rhetorical and into the more pragmatic,” he said.
The ambassador, a human rights lawyer, also expressed concern about the state of Hungarian democracy.
“I have seen firsthand the intense effort to intimidate judges in this country,” he said.
Speaking of Hungary’s new sovereignty protection office, which has broad powers to investigate Hungarians with no judicial oversight, Pressman said it represented “a serious step backwards in Hungary’s democracy”.
Pressman, a high-profile diplomat who arrived in Budapest in 2022, is criticised almost daily in government-controlled Hungarian media outlets, to the point that Hungary’s main pro-government daily keeps a link to his name at the top of its site, with more than 200 articles tagged.
Asked if he was bothered by the attention, Pressman said no but added that “what bothers me is that the state of the US-Hungary relationship is in the place that it is”.
“What we really need to do at this moment in this relationship is work on it – and certainly the United States is prepared to do that. But I can tell you, there’s no indication that the Hungarian government is interested in doing that – and that’s unfortunate,” he said."
AXCABLA8CN_WYK7CBZB3FUN5BN,Tory social housing plan aims to prioritise ‘British homes for British workers’,Kiran Stacey,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/jan/24/tory-social-housing-plan-aims-to-prioritise-british-homes-for-british-workers,"Downing Street wants to give UK families higher priority for social housing in a controversial scheme that will be badged as “British homes for British workers”, the Guardian can reveal.
Officials will launch a consultation in the coming weeks into how they can give British citizens faster access to social housing, a move designed in part to bolster Rishi Sunak’s reputation for being tough on immigration.
But the move has prompted anger from some in government, who warn it could further fuel support for the rightwing Reform UK party. Housing experts say it is likely to be either illegal or unworkable, or both.
Polly Neate, chief executive of the housing charity Shelter, said: “This policy amounts to nothing more than scapegoating at its worst. It is unnecessary, unenforceable and unjust. Not only does it ignore the fact that there are already stringent rules so only UK citizens or those with settled status can access homes for social rent, but it blames a group of people for a housing emergency that they did not create.”
Advisers to the prime minister originally wanted to include a “British homes for British workers” bill in the king’s speech, but decided instead to focus on reform of the rental and leasehold markets – both priorities of the housing secretary, Michael Gove.
In recent weeks, however, the prime minister has been buffeted by polls showing his party heading for a defeat on the scale of 1997, as well a high-profile call for his resignation from a former cabinet colleague, Simon Clarke. He also faces a bruising confrontation with members of the House of Lords over his bill to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda.
With N0 10 looking for ways to boost the party’s ratings on immigration, officials are looking again at the “British homes for British workers” scheme, and are planning to release a consultation early next month setting out its options.
Under current rules, local housing authorities are meant to decide social housing allocation based on need, giving priority to those who are homeless or living in overcrowded or squalid conditions. Refugees are allowed to claim social housing, but anyone who is not entitled to benefits is not, meaning most foreigners in the UK are already excluded.
The latest government figures show that 90% of the lead tenants in social housing are British citizens. In certain areas, however, that figure is much lower. In the London borough of Brent, 40% of new social homes were let to foreign nationals in 2021-22, while in Southwark the figure was 29%.
Under changes introduced under Gordon Brown’s government, housing providers trying to choose between two households of roughly equivalent need should take into account how long they have lived in the area or whether they have local family connections. Those changes were criticised at the time for equating to “British homes for British workers”, but those under consideration by the current government are expected to go further.
Since then, pressure on social housing has increased hugely thanks to a sharp drop in new housing supply. Nearly 40,000 new socially rented properties were added to the market in England in 2010-11, but by 2022-23 that figure had dropped to 9,561.
The relative lack of social housing, coupled with record immigration levels, has left ministers looking for a way to prioritise British people on the waiting lists. One option would be to discriminate on the basis of nationality, but such a move is likely to fall foul of equalities law.
A more plausible change would be to bar refugees from gaining access to social housing, but this would be controversial given that those who have successfully been given refugee status are supposed to be allowed full access to social benefits. Those who have come to the UK under the Ukrainian or Afghan resettlement schemes are likely to be protected, however, sources said.

Ministers could also seek to strengthen the rules introduced by the Brown government so that people have to show they have stronger or longer connections to an area before being given priority for housing.
Neate said: “For decades, we’ve lost more social homes than we’ve built, leaving us with a huge shortage and condemning homeless families to years on a waiting list with no hope of a stable home. If the government wants to do something that would genuinely tackle the housing emergency, there’s a clear solution – we need to build 90,000 social homes a year.”
The plan was due to be announced this week, but was postponed at the last minute after some officials warned that it would look bad to do so in the same week that Grenfell Tower victims were testifying about their experiences.
No 10 instead wants to push ahead with the announcement early next month, though it is unclear which minister will be placed in charge.
Some in government believe, however, that any policy proposals are unlikely to be implemented in time for the election. “This looks like a piece of electioneering more than anything else,” said one government source.
Downing Street declined to comment on “policy speculation”."
AXHFC4IZ7K_ZH920SROX1AJCR4,‘We will defeat Trump’: Biden sets sights on old rival after New Hampshire,Sam Levine,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/24/biden-trump-presidential-election-rematch,"Joe Biden appears to have set his sights on an almost inevitable rematch with Donald Trump for the White House in November’s election, after the former president’s decisive win in the New Hampshire primary, on his sprint to the Republican nomination.
Biden’s campaign believes the presidential election has officially begun, Politico reported, with Trump’s victory over Nikki Haley in New Hampshire on Tuesday officially kicking off what the outlet described as “the longest and most grueling general election campaign in modern American political history”.
Julie Chávez Rodríguez, Biden’s campaign manager, told reporters on Wednesday morning the New Hampshire results showed Trump “all but locked up the GOP nomination”.
With that simple fact established, the choice that American voters will face in November is coming into sharp focus. “It’ll be a choice between two visions for this country that couldn’t be more different,” she said. “Donald Trump is running a campaign of revenge and retribution that threatens American democracy and our fundamental freedoms, while Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are running to move the country forward and make life better for working people.”
It’s a dynamic that underscores the unusual nature of the 2024 campaign. Usually, the results from the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary have marked just the beginning of the nominating contest, with a long slog of an intra-party fight into the spring.
In 2024, Trump’s victories in both have affirmed his stranglehold on the GOP nomination. Nikki Haley, the last remaining Republican rival in the race, has signaled she will stay in the race at least through the 24 February primary in South Carolina, her home state. She trails Trump by 30 points in the polls there.
Michael Tyler, the Biden campaign’s communications director, told reporters the campaign had determined the former South Carolina governor had no path to the nomination “just looking at the reality of the data in front of us”.
“Coming off of Iowa and New Hampshire, you have Donald Trump, who’s fully consolidated the extreme Maga [Make America Great Again] base of the party and is marching towards the nomination,” he said. “This campaign is now laser focused on presenting that direct choice to the American people because it’s real at this point in time.”
Biden’s campaign is shifting into general election mode, the New York Times reported on Tuesday. Those preparations include a change in leadership structure. The Democratic US president announced on Tuesday that two top White House aides – Jennifer O’Malley Dillon and Mike Donilon – will take over leadership of his campaign.
The campaign also released a new line of merchandise with the slogan “Together, we will defeat Donald Trump. Again” playing off Trump’s signature “Make America Great Again” theme.
As Trump gave a winding and unhinged victory speech in New Hampshire on Tuesday, complete with lies that he won New Hampshire in the 2016 and 2020 elections when, in fact, he was beaten by Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden, respectively, a Biden aide texted a Politico reporter: “That’s the guy we will beat.”
The Biden campaign has also begun attacking Trump, 77, more aggressively over his verbal slips, using X, formerly Twitter, to point out the former president’s frequent nonsensical comments.
Both Biden and Trump have significant obstacles to winning and the race is expected to be close. Biden narrowly defeated Trump by just a combined 44,000 votes in 2020 in Arizona, Georgia and Wisconsin. Nearly 60% of Americans said in a recent Decision Desk HQ poll they were not excited about the possibility of another rematch between Trump and Biden.

The Biden campaign said on Wednesday it was unfazed by polls showing a tight race with Trump.
“To put simply, Trump’s party is divided, and now he’s about to face the only politician who has ever beaten him and who did so with more votes than any presidential candidate in history: President Joe Biden,” Quentin Fulks, Biden’s deputy campaign manager, said on Wednesday.
Cedric Richmond, the former Louisiana congressman who is a Biden campaign co-chair, also waved off the polls.
“If I had a dollar for every time somebody counted Joe Biden out based on polls or something else, then I’d be independently wealthy,” he said.
Biden called out Trump personally on ahead of the third anniversary of the 6 January Capitol attack by his supporters.“Donald Trump’s campaign is about him – not America, not you. Donald Trump’s campaign is obsessed with the past, not the future,” Biden said in the speech."
B0SAUHTWYC_FL1N7NTWSYN16Z4,The Guardian view on Grenfell’s aftermath: the investigations are taking too long,Editorial,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/25/the-guardian-view-on-grenfells-aftermath-the-investigations-are-taking-too-long,"The extent of the physical and emotional suffering caused by 2017’s Grenfell Tower fire could not be more painfully clear than it has been at the hearings held this week as part of the settlement of a damages claim. The civil case brought by 900 of those who were bereaved, or who survived the fire, concluded in April last year with a £150m payment by the companies and public authorities responsible for the disastrous refurbishment of the building and the failures on the night of the fire. At Church House in London, as part of a package mediated by Lord Neuberger, a former president of the supreme court, survivors had the chance to address 24 executives face to face.
A combination of live and videoed speeches conveyed the full range of difficult emotions, from the deepest sorrow to rage and a longing for revenge. The details of the settlement – which companies paid what, how much individuals are to receive – are private, as in other civil litigation. But the grief, disillusion and illness that are Grenfell’s living legacy were eloquently described. Overhanging it all was the enormous frustration of the tower’s residents, and their families, that six and a half years after the tragedy, no one has been charged for their role in causing 72 deaths.
It is perhaps too soon to tell whether speakers obtained any relief from the occasion; the impact of such traumatic encounters is not necessarily immediate. It is also impossible to know whether the demands on business leaders to change the culture of their organisations, to care more about people and less about profit, as Sandra Ruiz and others told them that they should, will lead to change. But the empty table where executives of Arconic should have been seated, had they attended, was a symbol of everything that is wrong with the current situation. The survivors of the disaster did not deserve for their testimony to be disrespected in this way.
After this week, once again, they must wait. The public inquiry into the disaster, an entirely separate process from the civil litigation, is due to produce its final report in the summer. After that the police will make recommendations to the Crown Prosecution Service about who should be charged and with what. That means a criminal case could feasibly get under way in 2025 – eight years after the fire. In the end, for many of the survivors, this is what accountability boils down to. Will anyone be found guilty and sent to jail for having caused the horror of 14 June 2017 or not?
The report is also expected to include recommendations with regard to construction industry regulation, oversight of public housing and emergency planning. All these issues are important, and Grenfell campaigners have made commendable efforts on behalf of other tenants, particularly those in flats with flammable cladding. In recent weeks they have drawn parallels with the long struggle of post office workers wrongly accused of theft – and stressed the importance of keeping the public interested, since this leads to pressure on politicians.
The public inquiry has done a good job of probing the disaster’s causes. But fact-finding only takes you so far, while talk of “restorative” encounters is arguably out of place when victims are still waiting for their day in the criminal courts. The message of this week has been that there is no substitute for justice."
B1I67ESD15_J96SU0C6RONU3CH,Cardiovascular disease: early deaths in England at highest rate in more than a decade,Nicola Davis,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/jan/22/cardiovascular-disease-early-deaths-in-england-at-highest-rate-in-more-than-a-decade,"Premature deaths from cardiovascular disease have reached their highest rate in England for more than a decade, figures reveal.
According to the British Heart Foundation (BHF), the rate at which people under 75 died from heart problems was in decline before the Covid pandemic, although progress slowed between 2012 and 2019.
Since 2020, however, the rate has risen. The latest data from the charity shows that the premature death rate for cardiovascular disease in England reached 80 per 100,000 people in 2022. That is the highest since 2011 when the rate was 83 per 100,000 people, the BHF notes.
The actual number of people dying prematurely of cardiovascular conditions including heart attacks, coronary heart disease and stroke has reached the highest level since 2008, with more than 39,000 such deaths in 2022.
The reversal in progress has caused consternation. “We’re in the grip of the worst heart care crisis in living memory,” said Dr Sonya Babu-Narayan, the BHF’s associate medical director and a consultant cardiologist.
“Every part of the system providing heart care is damaged, from prevention, diagnosis, treatment and recovery to crucial research that could give us faster and better treatments. This is happening at a time when more people are getting sicker and need the NHS more than ever.”
Babu-Narayan said it was tragic that hard-won progress in reducing early deaths from cardiovascular disease has been lost. “Furthermore, we are still seeing more people than expected die from cardiovascular conditions overall, more than any other disease group,” she said. “It’s clear to me that urgent intervention is long overdue.”

The Covid pandemic is thought to be one reason for the deteriorating situation. The BHF revealed last year that there had been almost 100,000 excess cardiovascular-related deaths in England since March 2020, with experts noting Covid had direct, indirect and long-term effects on cardiovascular disease.
The charity said, however, that other factors were at play including a widening health gap between rich and poor, long waiting times for tests and treatments, and a failure to tackle risk factors such as high blood pressure, raised cholesterol, diabetes and obesity.
Even before the pandemic, BHF figures for the UK as a whole suggested a rise in the number of people dying from heart and circulatory diseases before the age of 75, something the charity said was not only down to a growing population, but also other factors including stark inequalities.
“We can stop this heartbreak, but only if politicians unite to address the preventable causes of heart disease, cut long waiting lists for people who need life-saving heart and stroke care, and help power scientific breakthroughs to unlock revolutionary new treatments and cures,” said Dr Charmaine Griffiths, the BHF’s chief executive.
A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “This government has already taken significant action to reduce cardiovascular disease and its causes, including increasing access to testing and successfully encouraging reduced salt and sugar intake, but we know there is more to do.
“Our major conditions strategy will help prevent and manage conditions including cardiovascular disease while our plans to create a smoke-free generation represent the most significant public health intervention in a generation.
“In addition, we are investing almost £17m in an innovative new digital NHS health check, expected to deliver an additional 1m health checks in its first four years.”"
B25B48CSDR_KC72YXMNCW9USIL,‘Living on the fringes’: why New Zealand novelists are making waves,_,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/27/living-on-the-fringes-why-new-zealand-novelists-are-making-waves,"When author Emily Perkins decided her next novel would be set in the New Zealand capital, her editors in the UK were pleased. The 53-year-old says this specific detail “seemed to spark interest rather than resistance”. The book, Lioness, tells the story of a self-styled, luxury guru who faces midlife reckoning amid whispers of fraud, and a new friendship with her charismatic neighbour.
“There was absolute openness about something that was set in Wellington,” she says.
Perkins’ experience marks a growing interest in New Zealand fiction from readers around the word. It comes 10 years after one the country’s most acclaimed writers, Eleanor Catton, became the youngest winner of the Booker prize for her novel The Luminaries.
Academics and publishers say New Zealand writers are booming overseas, yet some authors hold concerns for the future of the industry and funding for the creative sector after the centre-right coalition government took power in October 2023.
Last year saw a string of globally successful releases from emerging and established New Zealand authors, including Catherine Chidgey, Anna Smaill and Perkins. #BookTok star Chloe Gong shot to the New York Times bestseller list with her new fantasy novella. Catton’s latest book, Birnam Wood, secured spots on bestseller lists in the US and the UK. The novel was shortlisted for several UK awards. Chidgey and Catton have also been nominated for the 2024 Dublin literary prize.
Tina Makereti, author and senior lecturer at Victoria University of Wellington says there is a “boom of New Zealand writers being published overseas”, including the US, UK and Europe.
“It’s really hard to break into those markets, and I think that’s changed,” Makereti says, citing the recent success of writers such as Tayi Tibble – who last year became the first Māori poet published in The New Yorker – and Perkins.
The sentiment is echoed by Noel Murphy, commercial director at Granta Publications, which publishes Catton. He says New Zealand authors are making inroads in countries around the world.
“All of a sudden, there are a bunch of New Zealand writers on their way into the European market in a way that probably hasn’t been the case before,” Murphy says.
Makereti says international publishers are choosing writing that is “very New Zealand”. She says after Covid, borders have become less limiting, and the star power of former prime minister Jacinda Ardern has also helped.
“New Zealand is readily identifiable because of Jacinda,” she says.
While the success is growing, writers are split on the appeal of the work coming out of New Zealand – or whether there’s a commonality at all.
Murphy says over the last few years, reader appetite has shifted “away from middle-class people worrying about getting divorced” and towards “dark, slightly unusual stories on the edge, which border on horror”.
Chidgey says New Zealand authors “seem to write from the point of view of the outsider, from someone living on the fringes”.
“And I think that’s maybe geographical – we do live on the fringes of the world.”
Wellington-based Smaill released her third novel Bird Life last year. The author, who was longlisted for the Booker prize in 2015, says there’s “a kind of a privilege to the isolation”.
“When there are fewer people, it forces a kind of independence of mind where you don’t inherit easy answers to things,” Smaill says.
“I do think the ‘Kiwi ingenuity’ is a thing. There’s a self-reliance that is a creative mode to fall back on,” she says.
Perkins stresses that just as there is no all-encapsulating style of New Zealand fiction, nor is there one clear reason for its recent popularity.
“The more there is, the more variety you see – and the more pointless it becomes to try to define it in any one way,” says the writer, who was longlisted for the Women’s prize for fiction.
“It could be a big thing like Jacinda or it could be a more conceptual thing like the colonial reckoning, or it could be down to a few people.”
Despite the recent success, some hold concern over future support for creative industries in New Zealand, with arts groups saying the sector is starved of adequate funding.
There is little to suggest the new National-led government will prioritise support for the sector. The National party did not have an arts policy in the lead-up to the 2023 election, nor were arts and culture mentioned in its coalition deals with minor parties Act and New Zealand First.
Speaking to broadcaster RNZ in December, the new minister for arts, culture and heritage, Paul Goldsmith, said funding for the creative sector would be squeezed in 2024.
“I’m taking stock of where we’re at, we’re obviously arriving at a time when there’s not large amounts of money sloshing around, or free money, or extra money to come – so it’s going to be tight.”
Creative New Zealand – the national arts development agency that funds artist projects – receives a baseline sum of just over NZ$16m a year from the government, which has barely shifted since 2006. The agency gets another 70% of its funding via the New Zealand Lottery Grants Board, which is now under threat due to proposed changes in the way the board allocates money. Creative NZ has warned it is operating at $5m less, going into 2024, than the previous year.
Despite international praise and sales of New Zealand authors, the funding that helped give rise rise to its current vanguard has been eroded. Smaill says the government led by Helen Clark, in the early 2000s, was supportive of writers.
“For me, and for many other writers I know, a far more significant and measurable impact was the support provided by the Clark government,” Smaill says.
The author says a funding scheme for creatives, dubbed the artists’ dole, was a “huge enabler of my writing career”.
“It gave me the freedom to focus on writing for a year following my master’s and was pivotal in getting my first book published. That kind of funding is such a shot in the arm for new writers, and I’d love to see a return to it.”"
B37XLLE3B7_98Z8Q7WVWF9PVL3,"Key climate language poorly understood by majority in UK, poll finds",Sandra Laville,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/24/key-climate-language-poorly-understood-by-majority-in-uk-poll-finds,"The British public has a worryingly low understanding of language around the climate crisis and environmental policies to reduce waste, according to the findings of a survey.
Only a quarter of people questioned clearly understood the term “green” and about the same number could accurately describe what “sustainable” – making something in a way that causes little or no damage to the environment – meant.
The study, released on Wednesday and conducted by the insights company Trajectory and the communications agency Fleet Street, suggests even terms in widespread use by businesses, such as “environmentally friendly” and “locally grown”, are understood only by a minority of people.
Government policy initiatives driven by reducing waste were also not clearly understood. Three months after a ban on single-use plastic cutlery and plates was introduced, less than half of consumers questioned, or 47%, were confident at defining “single-use plastics” – plastic items that are used once and then thrown away.
Mark Stretton, a co-founder of Fleet Street, said the research suggested more needed to be done to engage customers about work being done by businesses to meet net zero targets, become more sustainable and reduce their waste. “Work needs to be done to engage consumers, starting with the language used, as much of it doesn’t appear to mean much to them,” he said.
“The lack of complete understanding of what many brands and businesses would probably consider to be standard terms, such as ‘net zero’ and ‘environmentally friendly’, is striking, and indicates a level of disconnect between brands and consumers.”
He said many businesses were investing heavily in sustainability, setting ambitious objectives in the process. “But there is a big piece missing; there’s massive work to be done on the language used, and the more consumers understand, the more likely they are to positively engage with, and respond to what is clearly an enormous, generational issue.”
The analysis indicates that those aged between 18 and 24 are more confident when it comes to understanding key terms around the climate and environmental policy. The word “sustainability” was understood by 24% more people from the 18- to 24-year-old age group compared with consumers over 65.
Those with higher levels of education had greater confidence in their understanding of key terms. For example, “circular economy” – an economy that eliminates waste and reduces carbon emissions by reusing resources – was understood by 11% more consumers with a university degree or higher compared with those who had left school at 16. The term was understood by 30% more people still in formal education, compared with older people who had left education after secondary school, suggesting a greater understanding among students today than in previous generations.
Despite the confusion around some of the key terms, the research shows extremely broad support for the issues: nine out of 10 consumers thought it was important for businesses and brands to talk about their sustainability initiatives and 68% of those questioned were more likely to buy from a company that had a clear environmental strategy in place.
Just under half of all consumers – 47% – believed that brands had the most responsibility when it came to delivering action on the climate crisis.

Jamie Peters, of Friends of the Earth, said: “There’s more concern about the climate than ever before. It’s the role of environmental organisations like ours to ensure we use clear, accessible language in our communications that helps create a shared understanding of the urgency of the climate and nature crises and the solutions needed to tackle them.
“The fact that oil and gas companies, and even our own government, will claim that oil, coal or gas is ‘green’ or ‘sustainable’ or even ‘net zero’ shows how these terms are being hijacked and misused. The fossil fuel industry has whole teams and departments set up to hide behind shiny marketing tricks including environmental buzzwords. We’ll continue to call them out and speak to the huge number of people trying to do the right things for the environment.”
Paul Flatters, the chief executive of Trajectory, said: “The data indicates that there is a clear correlation between consumer understanding and how positively they feel about a specific term. This puts the onus firmly on brands to properly educate consumers so that awareness and understanding of major climate related terms are increased across the board.”
The research involved focus groups and a nationally representative online survey of 1,000 UK adults."
B6FCVUV4AX_P5LWHRU2FJCEBJR,ABC’s first Middle East correspondent urges management to back staff during Israel-Gaza conflict,Josh Taylor,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/jan/26/abc-middle-east-correspondent-peter-george-staff-management-israel-gaza-war,"The ABC’s first Middle East correspondent, who said his mother was sent a letter calling for his death during his tenure at the broadcaster, has warned ABC management to back their staff during the current conflict.
Peter George, the national broadcaster’s Middle East correspondent in the 1980s, told Guardian Australia he faced a lot of pressure during his time in the role, particularly for a Four Corners story entitled The Palestinians in 1984.
After it aired, his mother was sent an unsigned letter stating “your son should die”, he said. But the former correspondent said he felt the broadcaster at the time had supported him.
“I was in awfully secure hands at the ABC when I was in the Middle East. I never worried about any form of criticism so long as I felt that I had gotten it right,” he said.
Based on his conversations with ABC staff now, he does not believe that is necessarily the case any more, he said.
“They do feel that management does not as energetically protect them as it used to,” he said. “If journalists start feeling that their backs aren’t being protected, then self-censorship starts to become a bit of an issue.
“And that’s what worries me most about the ABC: to what extent is it just trying to peddle a middle-of-the-road view rather than actually looking at the issues and reporting them as they see them?”

This week, ABC union staff passed a resolution of no confidence in managing director David Anderson, stating the broadcaster’s leadership team had failed “to defend the integrity of the ABC and staff from attacks”. The board later passed a vote of confidence in Anderson.
The union resolution was passed amid fallout from an unlawful termination claim lodged by journalist Antoinette Lattouf against the ABC on 22 December. Lattouf said she was dismissed from a fill-in hosting role on ABC radio after she shared a Human Rights Watch post about the Israel-Gaza conflict on her personal Instagram account. Reports emerged on 16 January that pro-Israel lawyers had coordinated complaints against her in a WhatsApp group chat.
George’s comments were echoed by the broadcaster’s global affairs editor, John Lyons, who reportedly said in a union meeting on Monday that staff were thrown under the bus by management and had begun to self-censor.
Another ABC employee who spoke on the condition of anonymity told Guardian Australia they backed Lyons’s position.
“If journos aren’t supported to be fearless by managers, then obviously a culture of fear and timidity arises,” they said. “That’s the very reason great newsroom leaders are famed for always backing their staff.”
Linda Mottram, who also reported for the ABC from the Middle East, faced strong pressure from the Howard government over her reporting on the Iraq war in the early 2000s. She said the support from management felt lacking back then.
“We expected we would be defended but what we ended up with was a situation where we were sort of defended, but then management decisions led to an opening up of new opportunities for the government to complain,” she said.
“That issue has never been discussed inside the ABC, and it’s like a rotten relationship … if you don’t talk about it, it just festers.
“I just think the organisation was cowed.”

Mottram said there seemed to be uncertainty over how to respond to the extreme levels of pressure on the ABC, which could leave a journalist vulnerable.
George said the situation is exacerbated by social media, where the feedback is immediate and can be “fairly aggressive and antagonistic”. He said younger reporters might be concerned that if they’re being attacked from the outside, it might result in management believing they were the cause of the trouble.
George said ABC management could be more public in their defence when complaints are lodged, and management should face up and speak to reporters in each of the states to relieve their concerns.
In an email sent to ABC staff on Tuesday and seen by Guardian Australia, news director Justin Stevens said he rejects completely “the characterisation that ABC News does not defend its journalists”.
“The safety of our employees, defending and supporting our people against unwarranted attack and criticism and ensuring the quality of our work are fundamental to who we are,” he said.
He said he would work with staff on any issues they had. Stevens said he was proud of the “good job” of coverage the ABC had done on the Israel-Gaza conflict.
“If you spend too much time on Twitter/X, which represents a minuscule portion of our audience, you wouldn’t know that.”
He said members of the public are entitled to make complaints about the broadcaster, but as director of news he follows the ABC complaints process, and the ABC works hard “constantly to defend our journalists against unjustified attacks, often multiple times in a day” both publicly and privately.
“We’ve lodged complaints with social media platforms and other media outlets over the publication of abusive content,” he said. “We complain on behalf of employees over their treatment in external media stories.”
On Wednesday, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, announced former News Corp chief executive Kim Williams would replace ABC chair Ita Buttrose, stating he continued to have confidence in Buttrose and Anderson.
The communications minister, Michelle Rowland, said the ABC had been “forthright in ensuring that its journalists have support, continues to improve itself with regards for support for its workforce and all media organisations should seek to foster diversity in all its forms”."
BB8JJRPFU2_3KKZP41NJ2QGHC7,ICJ to deliver interim ruling on genocide case against Israel on Friday,Patrick Wintour,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/24/icj-to-deliver-interim-ruling-on-genocide-case-against-israel-on-friday,"South Africa’s foreign minister, Naledi Pandor, is flying to The Hague to be present on Friday when the international court of justice (ICJ) delivers its highly anticipated verdict on South Africa’s request for an interim ruling in its genocide case against Israel.
The ruling, if granted, would probably take the form of an order to Israel to announce a ceasefire in Gaza and allow more UN humanitarian aid into the country.
The announcement of Pandor’s travel plans does not necessarily mean South Africa knows the verdict will be in its favour, but does reflect a confidence in Pretoria that their request is going to be met at least partially.
A judgment on the merits of the South African claim that Israel is committing genocide under the 1948 Geneva convention is many years off, but the ICJ, the UN’s highest court, has powers to issue the equivalent of an interim injunction.
Israel has dismissed South Africa’s claim as a blood libel, but attended the court to mount a defence, potentially making it more difficult for Israel simply to dismiss any negative verdict.
Representatives of both states laid out their legal arguments in The Hague on 11 and 12 January in hearings that were watched worldwide.
Benjamin Netanyahu also issued a formal statement designed to reassure the court that Israel was acting in self-defence after the 7 October Hamas assaults.
The Israeli prime minister also dismissed suggestions that Israel was seeking to expel Palestinians from Gaza. Intent is critical to a court decision on genocide, so it would require the ICJ judges in some way to look past the statements of Netanyahu to other statements by ministers, and the actions of the Israeli Defense Forces, if it was to rule there is a threat of genocide that needs preventing.
An immediate ceasefire, or cessation of hostilities, is the prime provisional measure requested by South Africa. In such a scenario, nations and their governments could respond by applying pressure on Israel to comply with the order.
Provisional measures have recently been provided in cases involving the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the treatment of the Rohingya people in Myanmar."
BEFGTWYNQO_0W1YLIGJFN5S9GT,Flanders government looks to force TikTok and YouTube to share revenue,Lisa O'Carroll,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/22/flanders-government-looks-to-force-tiktok-and-youtube-to-share-revenue,"Cute cat videos, fried chicken clips and viral dances could soon help to finance Belgian TV, with the Flanders government on the verge of passing laws to force TikTok and YouTube to share revenues with local television producers.
“Politically speaking, it is important in audiovisual and media services that there are obligations on companies to invest in local TV content,” the media minister for the Flemish government, Benjamin Dalle, told the Guardian.
Belgium already takes a cut of revenues generated by Netflix, Disney and other streaming services, but Dalle said TikTok and YouTube were so popular that it was important that they also paid their way.

“What we are doing now in Flanders is to also make video-sharing platforms like YouTube, like TikTok, like Meta [the owner of Facebook and Instagram] pay for locally-made content, and we are modifying Flemish legislation in order to do so. Internationally, it is the first time this has happened,” he said.
Big tech firms have already raised concerns about the move, and the US ambassador in Brussels has written to the government about the development. “We have received several letters from these companies because it is a precedent, a world’s first,” Dalle said.
The proposed laws will go to a vote within the next few weeks and, if adopted, it will mean more cash for a thriving sector that has recently produced dramas such as Knokke Off, known as High Tides in the UK – a glitzy local teen drama set in the eponymous upmarket seaside town – and Rough Diamonds, a family crime drama centring on the return of a prodigal son to the orthodox Jewish community in Antwerp.
Hidden Assets, a co-production commissioned by Screen Ireland and Screen Flanders starring Angeline Ball and set in Limerick and Antwerp, will be recognisable to many in the UK and Ireland.
And with Belgium being holders of the rotating presidency of the EU, Dalle said he was hoping to extend the idea across the bloc: “I would like to put this on the European agenda.”
Under the proposals, video-sharing platforms would have to put between 2% and 4% of their revenues into the Flanders Audiovisual Fund or directly into a local production.
Streamers including Netflix and broadband and cable TV suppliers are already subjected to a similar rule, with €7m (£6m) generated in 2023 for local productions including Over Water, a two-season thriller about a TV celebrity lured into the world of cocaine gangs on the Antwerp docks part-funded by Telenet, a local broadband firm.
This article was amended on 22 January 2024. Benjamin Dalle is the media minister for the Flemish government, not the culture minister for the Belgian government as an earlier version suggested."

The Coast Guard’s ninth district Great Lakes station said it received a report at approximately 10.20am that the people were stuck on a mile-long floe about a half-mile off Catawba Island state park near Port Clinton in Ohio.
A Coast Guard helicopter was sent from air station Detroit and two airboats headed to the scene from nearby Station Marblehead, said petty officer Jessica Fontenette. Rescuers from the Put-in-Bay fire department on South Bass Island and the Ottawa county sheriff’s office also assisted.
The Coast Guard was able to rescue nine people; four others were rescued by the other agencies; and seven were able to get to shore themselves on an airboat, she said. No injuries were reported."
BID8UUAGE7_X6TMJZXKDYZLPQN,Nude artist sues New York’s Museum of Modern Art over sexual assault claims,Tim Jonze,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2024/jan/25/nude-artist-sues-new-york-museum-of-modern-art-over-sexual-assault-claims-john-bonafede-marina-abramovic,"A nude artist is suing New York’s Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) for allegedly failing to prevent visitors from groping him during a Marina Abramović exhibition in 2010.
The work Imponderabilia, which was first staged in 1977 and was restaged in a retrospective of Abramović’s work at London’s Royal Academy of Arts last year, required two naked performers to stand face to face in a doorway, 18 inches apart, for more than an hour at a time while members of the public squeezed between them as they moved through the gallery.
In his lawsuit, John Bonafede claims to have been sexually assaulted on seven occasions by five different visitors while performing during the exhibition’s six-week run.
He claims the assaults were always conducted by older males and followed an “eerily similar” pattern, with the alleged perpetrators turning to face him before groping his genitals. Although Bonafede claims not to have reported the first incident out of shock, he says he told security and the exhibition’s stage manager about subsequent attacks. The lawsuit states that the museum “had actual knowledge of ongoing sexual assaults against many of its worker-performers in the exhibition, yet it intentionally and negligently failed to take corrective action to prevent the assaults from recurring”.
According to court documents, one of the alleged perpetrators was a MoMA corporate member, who had his membership revoked. But Bonafede claims that the museum did not reveal to him the identity of the men who assaulted him, which prevented him from pursuing charges against them.
At the time of the show, the museum put out a statement responding to press reports of models being groped. It read: “We are well aware of the challenges posed by having nude performers in the galleries. Any visitor who improperly touches or disturbs any of the performers is escorted from the museum by MoMA security.”
Bonafede is seeking unspecified damages in a jury trial."
BJB3QIE7S7_R1H1XFDIQKI0OOX,WA police seize 30 tonnes of gold-bearing ore at back yard refinery allegedly linked to bikies,Jordyn Beazley,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/24/wa-police-seize-gold-bearing-ore-backyard-refinery-kalgoorlie-alleged-bikie-link,"Western Australian police say they have busted a backyard gold refinery in Kalgoorlie, seizing more than 30 tonnes of gold-bearing ore that was allegedly stolen from the region’s mines.
Investigators believe the alleged racket was connected with outlaw motorcycle gangs, and the gold-bearing ore was stolen with the intention of refining and laundering the gold to gain cash to purchase illicit drugs that would be sold to the community.
Police arrested and charged 20 people with a total of 56 offences over three days, including alleging they possessed stolen or unlawfully obtained gold-bearing ore and were in possession of a firearm and illicit drugs.
It comes amid a broader crackdown in the state on bikie gangs after the state government said at the end of last year it planned to toughen anti-bikie laws introduced in 2021 that are already the strictest in the country.

The Department of Water and Environmental Regulation, ChemCentre and the Department of Fire and Emergency Services assisted police due to the dangers of processing gold-bearing ore in residential homes, police said.
Det Insp Adrian Vuleta said while businesses involved in gold extraction had established safe processes and control measures, those engaged in back yard improvised extraction processes exposed themselves and neighbours to increased health risks from chemicals.
“This operation was not only important to protect the community from those extraction-related risks, but to prevent the stealing of the end gold product which we believe was being laundered to obtain cash to fund the purchase of illicit drugs such as methylamphetamine to sell in the community,” Vuleta said.

WA’s minister for police, Paul Papalia, accused outlaw motorcycle gangs of “greed” and said this particular case was “selfish and idiotic”.
“We’re committed to disrupting and dismantling [outlaw motorcycle gang] activity across WA. That’s why the government introduced the toughest bikie laws in the country,” he said of the laws which ban bikies from publicly showing their gang colours."
BK7DOQIZ4J_Q6GTG4UV3AIYISG,Overflow: this trans monologue set in a women’s bathroom has critics raving,Cassie Tongue,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/jan/23/overflow-eternity-playhouse-sydney-festival-melbourne-dates,"In 2020, for the UK artist and playwright Travis Alabanza, writing a play became harder than ever. Commissioned for London’s Bush theatre, the play suddenly needed to be Covid-restriction friendly: a piece for a single performer, on a static set, to keep cast and creative numbers – and the chance of infection – down. It was no small task, but as Alabanza says cheerfully now: “The rent was still due!”
The result is Overflow, a 70-minute monologue set in a club bathroom. It received critical acclaim in the UK and then Australia in 2022, where it was led by an all-trans and gender-nonconforming team (a first in the country) for Darlinghurst Theatre Company. Now it is playing a triumphant return season at Sydney festival before embarking on seasons in Melbourne and Geelong.
If the play feels like it contains a kernel of lockdown panic, this probably can’t be helped – we’re now all too intimately acquainted with feeling trapped. But Alabanza wrote the work fuelled by a different strain of panic: the rightwing moral panic against trans people using public bathrooms that match their gender.
“Whilst the pandemic was continuing, despite public space not being able to be accessed, trans people in bathrooms were still being talked about,” Alabanza says. “I found that such a weird feeling – like, public space doesn’t even exist any more and we’re still debated about.”
Overflow places our protagonist Rosie (played in the Australian production by Janet Anderson) in a club bathroom where she’s locked herself in to hide from transphobic would-be attackers. To distract herself, she reminisces about encounters in club bathrooms like this one on nights past – the good, the bad, the sacred – while a leaking tap slowly fills a sink and threats lurk outside the door. Alabanza describes it as “a mediation on public space”.
During the same period, Alabanza also wrote their prize-winning memoir None of the Above. “Honestly, Overflow was kind of a godsend, because [the book] was quite heavy and in the ground and very historical, but Overflow was getting to reminisce about nightclubs and parties and clubbing whilst that was all going on,” they say.
Alabanza was flattered when director Dino Dimitriadis approached them to say the Darlinghurst Theatre Company wanted to stage the play, and gave their blessing. But on the flight over to Sydney for the premiere – such a long flight, the perfect amount of time for anxieties to kick in – Alabanza started to wonder: what if Alabanza didn’t like the production? And what would it be like to be in Australia, a place where transphobia is a pet subject with rightwing commentators?
But when they arrived in Sydney, Alabanza’s worries melted away; instead, they soaked up the experience like a sponge. They were “blown away” by Anderson, Dimitriadis and the whole team. “And I’m not just saying this,” Alabanza adds; they’ve learned that “if my work goes to someone that hasn’t spent countless nights at 5am at the end of a drag bar, they won’t quite get the language”.
Plus, the Australian team is creating new opportunities for local trans talent on and behind the stage. “I met everyone, and they were all trans and gender-nonconforming,” Alabanza says. “And I’ve never experienced that with my work. I’ve tried with my work to have as many trans creatives, but I’ve never experienced everyone. The energy was incredible. It felt like a club. It felt as much like a club as a theatre could.”
Anderson, who graduated from Nida in 2022, made her stage debut in Overflow and is returning to the role after receiving glowing reviews – including from Alabanza, who calls her “a star”.
“It’s rare for actors to get an hour to themselves on stage to show off the breadth of their emotion,” Alabanza says. “It’s even rarer for a trans girl to get that moment to be like ‘this is what I can do’.”
Why Alabanza makes art is in part because of moments like the one Anderson is having right now. “In the UK, and I’m sure the situation might feel similar in Australia, when we don’t have the ability to go to so many different stages in public life – the government, our workplaces, all these places where we’re shut out, art is such a great place to reverse those feelings and to feel alive.”
Overflow is on at the Eternity Playhouse as part of Sydney festival until 27 January; then Arts Centre Melbourne 31 January – 4 February and Geelong Arts Centre 8-10 February."
BLB27PY1ZX_91FLFNKEJUAKCHC,Anna Jones: media big-hitter and champion of female entrepreneurs,Mark Sweney,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/jan/26/anna-jones-media-big-hitter-and-champion-of-female-entrepreneurs-telegraph,"When Anna Jones was interviewed about co-founding a women-only private members club to foster female entrepreneurship – having left a high-profile role running the UK publisher of Cosmopolitan, Esquire and Men’s Health to go it alone – she sported a T-shirt emblazoned with “girl power” in orange block capitals.
Seven years on Jones has been appointed as the first female chief executive of the Telegraph’s parent company, exemplifying the progress she has championed in an almost 25-year career in media businesses.
Jones, whose friends and former bosses uniformly describe as an energetic and highly capable executive with a “can do” mentality, has boldly stepped into the role abruptly vacated by Nick Hugh at possibly the most tumultuous time in the 169-year history of the rightwing national title.
She takes the reins with the prospect of its owners, the Barclay family, transferring control of the Telegraph in a controversial and complex deal to a consortium backed by the United Arab Emirates.
“She is what I’d call a liberal feminist,” said one former colleague. “Blimey, the ownership, current and what is incoming, I wonder what she thinks of that?”
Jones, who grew up in Yorkshire, has had a fair bit of time to think about that quandary having been an adviser to the Telegraph executive team on “strategic and commercial growth plans, merger and acquisition strategy and leadership development programmes” since last January.
After leaving Hearst, where she worked for more than five years, including three years as chief executive, she co-founded the women-only networking venture AllBright, which opened its first private members club in Mayfair, London on International Women’s Day in 2018.
AllBright is named after the former US secretary of state Madeleine Albright, who once said “there is a special place in hell for women who don’t help other women”.
In her seven-year break between running major media businesses, Jones has filled her resumé with roles and ventures including co-founding WJV, a boutique investment firm that “champions diversity, wellness and economic empowerment”, chairing the investment committee of the seed funding business Mercuri, taking a part-time role as a UN Women UK changemaker and serving as board member of the Creative Industries Federation.
Now the 48-year-old, who is allergic to apples and lists her interests as pilates, baking and her children, has moved from entrepreneur to one of the highest profile roles in UK media. The shift makes for a curious move, with Jones describing herself in a previous interview as impatient person and expressing frustration with slow-moving corporate structures that mean implementing change is like “turning a tanker”.
Still, she has kept her hand in the big leagues. She is now a non-executive director at Universal Music, the world’s biggest music company, and was formerly a non-executive director at Telecom Italia.
Those roles came in part as a result of her time spent working with Arnaud de Puyfontaine, the chief executive of the sprawling French media conglomerate Vivendi, which has stakes in both companies and who was her boss when he ran Hearst’s European operations.
“The reinvention of a media brand is a hell of a journey,” says De Puyfontaine, who successfully pushed for Jones to become his successor at Hearst UK when he left London for Paris in 2014.
“She is extraordinarily energetic, motivated and driven with very good managerial skills, a can-do person, I’m a big fan. Nothing prevents the energy of her entrepreneurship, alongside her previous corporate experience, to push ahead one of the most famous British media brands – depending on [what] the new ownership [want].”
Jones is all too familiar with the digital challenges facing the Telegraph, having spent most of her career in the magazine industry. From 2000, she spent five years at Emap as marketing manager for the “women’s group” of titles, Grazia, More and Top Sante.
She subsequently moved to Hachette Filipacchi, the publisher of magazines and websites including Elle, Red and Digitalspy.com, where she rose to the role of digital and strategy director. Hearst acquired Hachette in 2011 with Jones taking the role of chief operating officer of the enlarged company before she stepped up to the role of chief executive in 2014.
“She was a real pleasure to work with,” says a senior editorial executive at her former employer. “She was very sunny, hands on, encouraging and wanted everyone to be more entrepreneurial in their businesses.”
Aware of the upheaval and general groundswell of negativity over the ownership saga in the Telegraph newsroom, Jones indicated in her appointment announcement that the wellbeing of employees continues to be high on her agenda.
“Although the business is operating in a period of uncertainty due to the change of ownership process, the titles continue to thrive and my role will focus on securing certainty for our staff, subscribers and partners,” she said."
BMU60MJJOW_IRC8PATZ8D5D584,"His name at home shredded, Scott Morrison looks overseas for a fresh start. Will he find his people?",Malcolm Farr,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2024/jan/23/his-name-at-home-shredded-scott-morrison-looks-overseas-for-a-fresh-start-will-he-find-his-people,"Scott Morrison, as was inevitable, is quitting parliament for another job and, as feels like it was inevitable, the speculation is that his next salary will come from an American source.
He wants to face “new challenges in the global corporate sector”, which covers a lot of options, few in his home country.
Australian employers know his reputation and perhaps were unlikely to see him as an asset.
In the United States, there are his kind of people and they are on the rise.
Australia is getting used to watching former prime ministers at a loose end after defeat. There’s just not much call for them.
Then, there’s the money.
Since he lost the May 2022 election, Morrison has been telling sympathisers he needs a better salary than the basic pay for a backbencher of $217,000.
It seems there was little saved from the $550,000 a year he took in over close to four years as PM.
He gets super, depending on his contributions, as well as perks such as an office and a travel gold pass.
None of this, moaned Morrison, is enough for educating his two girls, paying off a mortgage and living in the appropriate manner.
And it is hard to be employed if you are a former leader named Scott Morrison who has been condemned here and abroad as a liar, and as a bungler of major matters, domestic and global.
The Liberal Malcolm Turnbull had a comfortable lifestyle and a range of interests to revive when he resigned. Labor’s Kevin Rudd bounced around energetically before becoming our ambassador in the US, while his party colleague Julia Gillard developed a global role in education. Tony Abbott tried various adventures, such as trade adviser to the UK Tory government, but seems under occupied.
Morrison has just as much blind self confidence as any of his predecessors, and a special factor to overcome his lack of ability.
The Morrison brand of Pentecostal Christianity – a faith loudly professed and credited with his successes though not his failures – would appeal to the American variants and brother Scott would already have links to those groups.
His book to be released in May – Plans for Your Good: A Prime Minister’s Testimony of God’s Faithfulness – in the title and elsewhere shamelessly trades on his former job, two years after he lost it.
It is expected to have a niche market in Australia but could be a calling card for Morrison as he builds his US contacts. Help certainly would come from the author of the book’s foreword, former Trump vice-president Mike Pence.
Morrison also has the advantage of involvement in Aukus, the multibillion-dollar deal to arm Australia with nuclear submarines.
He is no defence expert, and French president Emmanuel Macron made no secret he didn’t think he could be trusted.
But it’s another president Morrison will court – the man he expects to win the 2024 US election, Donald Trump.
The two met with Morrison’s visit to the US in September 2019 and the Australian leader impressed Trump by following him around like a puppy dog on major issues such as relations with China.
Of greater concern to his successor Peter Dutton will be the byelection contest for Cook, the seat Morrison holds.
The Liberals can expect to retain the Sydney seat, but preselection of a candidate could be a touch messy, as the area has groups of conservative Christians keen to get their chosen one into parliament. There also will be pressure to pick a woman to gain the safe seat.
But by then Morrison will have left his unpopularity behind, and perhaps even his home in the Shire.

BP67LUJWPG_175K4H6T9QVR3J4,Chinese markets rally on report Beijing considering £222bn state rescue plan,Amy Hawkins,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/23/chinese-markets-rally-on-report-beijing-considering-222bn-state-rescue-plan,"Chinese markets have lifted following a report suggesting that Beijing policymakers are scrambling to mobilise billions of yuan from state-owned enterprises to reverse a recent share rout.
The benchmark CSI 300 index, which replicates the top 300 stocks traded on the Shanghai and the Shenzhen bourses, had fallen to a five-year low, while the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which tracks Chinese stocks traded in Hong Kong, had dropped to its lowest in nearly two decades.
However, Chinese indexes recovered slightly on Tuesday after Bloomberg reported that the authorities were considering mobilising around 2tn yuan ($281bn or £222bn) from the offshore accounts of state firms to buy shares onshore. The plans may be approved as soon as this week.
On Monday, the Chinese premier, Li Qiang, who handles economic affairs, had called for “forceful and effective measures” on Monday to stabilise the market.
The proposed stock market rescue package is the latest in a series of measures that Chinese policymakers are thought to be considering, as the economy struggles to rebound after they began lifting zero-Covid measures at the end of 2022. Authorities are trying to avert a prolonged sell-off of Chinese equities as investors show signs of losing confidence in the world’s second-biggest economy.
More than $6tn has been wiped off the value of Chinese and Hong Kong stocks since a peak in 2021.
However, Beijing has proven reluctant to intervene as substantially as it has done in previous episodes of market turbulence. Li told an audience at the World Economic Forum last week that the authorities did “not seek short-term growth while accumulating long-term risk”. Some analysts believe that Xi Jinping, China’s leader, does not view the stock markets as a reflection of the success of his long-term economic strategy.
Derek Irwin, an emerging markets portfolio manager at Allspring, an asset management firm, said: “Until there is a bigger crisis, the Chinese government may just continue to kind of throw cups of water on the fire instead of something big that they probably need to do.”
Xi has said that China needs to focus on “high quality growth”, with increased investment in green and advanced technologies, rather than the years of rocketing economic activity that characterised China’s economy at the start of his tenure in 2012.
“Now, the story of China is there are some sectors that are going to have a very hard time. So you need to be more selective in terms of the companies that you buy,” said Norman Villamin, the chief strategist at the Swiss bank UBP.
Beijing is expected to set a relatively modest growth target of 5% for 2024, supported by strong central government spending, but structural problems such as high levels of youth unemployment, geopolitical tensions with the US and weak consumer demand may prove hard to surmount.

China’s economy grew by 5.2% in 2023, according to official statistics, but some economists estimate that the true figure was much lower. Analysts at Rhodium Group say that China’s embattled property sector and high levels of local government debt suggest that actual growth in 2023 was closer to 1.5%.
The ongoing economic woes have prompted a crackdown on comments that “badmouth the economy”.
Internet users ignored this directive on Monday, with several blaming China’s political system for the crash. “Other people use real money to save their stock markets, we use loudspeakers,” wrote one on Weibo.

BPVGFUA5SY_JY31SZ830O2M9XK,UN court orders Israel to ensure acts of genocide are not committed in Gaza,Haroon Siddique,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/26/un-court-orders-israel-to-ensure-acts-of-genocide-are-not-committed-in-gaza,"The ​UN’s international court of justice has ordered Israel to ensure its forces do not commit acts of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, in a historic decision.
In an interim judgment delivered on Friday, the president of the court, Joan Donoghue, said Israel must “take all measures within its power” to prevent acts that fall within the scope of the genocide convention and must ensure “with immediate effect” that its forces do not commit any of the acts covered by the convention.
The court stopped short of granting South Africa’s request to order an immediate ceasefire to the war, which has destroyed much of the Gaza Strip and killed more than 25,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health authorities.
The ruling is not the final word from the court on whether Israel’s actions amount to genocide, but it provides a strong indication that the judges believe there is a credible risk to Palestinians under the genocide convention. Granting South Africa’s application for special measures, the court did not have to find whether Israel had committed genocide, which will be determined at a later date, but only that its acts were capable of falling within the genocide convention and that urgent preventive action was necessary.
Donoghue said Israel must “take all measures within its power to prevent” killing Palestinians, causing them serious bodily or mental harm, deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about the physical destruction in whole or in part of the Palestinian group, and imposing measures intended to prevent births of Palestinians.
“The court is also of the view that Israel must take measures within its power to prevent and punish the direct and public incitement to commit genocide in relation to the members of the Palestinian groups in the Gaza Strip,” the US judge said. “The court further considers that Israel must take immediate and effective measures to enable the provision of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance to address the adverse conditions of life faced by Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.”
Donoghue said Israel must ensure the preservation of evidence of alleged genocide and must report to the court within a month. The six provisional measures were approved by a wide majority of the judges – two of them by 16 to one and four by 15 to two.
A statement from the South African foreign ministry called it “a decisive victory for the international rule of law and a significant milestone in the search for justice for the Palestinian people” and expressed hope “that Israel will not act to frustrate the application of this order, as it has publicly threatened to do, but that it will instead act to comply with it fully, as it is bound to do”.
The Palestinian foreign minister, Riyad al-Maliki, called it a decision “in favour of humanity and international law” and “a wake-up call for Israel and actors who enabled its entrenched impunity”.
A senior Hamas official said Israel must be forced to implement the decision. The ICJ has no powers of enforcement and countries have ignored its orders in the past.
The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who previously pledged that “no one will stop us, not The Hague”, did not indicate whether the ruling would lead to any changes on the ground but expressed satisfaction that the court had not ordered a ceasefire.
“Israel’s commitment to international law is unwavering. Equally unwavering is our sacred commitment to continue to defend our country and defend our people. Like every country, Israel has an inherent right to defend itself,” he said. “The vile attempt to deny Israel this fundamental right is blatant discrimination against the Jewish state, and it was justly rejected. The charge of genocide levelled against Israel is not only false, it’s outrageous, and decent people everywhere should reject it.”
Yoav Gallant, Israel’s defence minister, whose call for a total siege of Gaza as part of a battle against “human animals” was noted by the court on Friday, said the ICJ had “granted South Africa’s antisemitic request”.
Itamar Ben-Gvir, the far-right national security minister, was the first Israeli official to react to the judgment, writing on X: “Hague-schmague.”
The judgment will increase pressure on Israel’s diplomatic and military backers, including the US and the UK, to take a more robust stance to address the humanitarian crisis.
Though there was disappointment among Palestinian supporters that the judges did not call for an immediate ceasefire, the decision will raise hopes of one in order to deliver the humanitarian assistance to Gaza’s 2.3 million-strong population, most of whom have been displaced by Israel’s bombing, that the ICJ said Israel must facilitate.
Many Palestinians are living in makeshift accommodation, including tents, UN-run shelters in schools or on the floors of hospitals, or outside in freezing, unsanitary conditions. There is a shortage of food, water and medical supplies.
More than 1% of Gaza’s population – 25,700 people – have been killed in the war, mostly women and children, and hundreds of thousands of buildings have been damaged or destroyed.
Donoghue said: “The court considers that the civilian population in the Gaza Strip remains extremely vulnerable. It recalls that the military operation conducted by Israel after 7 October 2023 has resulted inter alia in tens of thousands of deaths and injuries and the destruction of homes, schools, medical facilities and other vital infrastructure, as well as displacement on a massive scale. The court notes that the operation is ongoing, and that the prime minister of Israel announced on 18 January 2024 that the war, I quote, ‘will take many more long months’.”
While Israel has been scathing of the case against it and South Africa for bringing it, it was significant that it hired a strong legal team to rebut it rather than choosing not to cooperate.
Donoghue said the court was “gravely concerned” about the fate of the hostages abducted from Israel on 7 October “and calls for their immediate and unconditional release”.
The 1948 genocide convention, enacted after the mass murder of Jews in the Nazi Holocaust, defines it as “acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group”.
A Reuters report on Thursday said the director of the US CIA and his Israeli counterpart would meet Qatari officials in the coming days for talks on a second potential Gaza hostage deal and a pause in fighting."
BS7ZMK7SLK_INHGOI10XKGJJR7,‘How to greenwash’: propane industry tries to rebrand fuel as renewable,_,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/25/propane-industry-rebrand-fuel-as-renewable,"This story is co-published with Heated
Members of a propane industry lobbying group strategized to downplay the full climate impacts of propane and market it as “renewable” or “clean energy”, recordings reviewed by the climate newsletter Heated and the Guardian reveal.
The Propane Education & Research Council (Perc), a US lobbying group, has spent nearly $30m over the last two years on advertisements for fossil fuel, according to data compiled by Drilled, a multimedia reporting project focused on climate accountability. The ads often promote propane, the vast majority of which is a by-product of natural gas or crude oil refining, as a form of clean and renewable energy.
But in a public November 2022 meeting recorded by the Energy and Policy Institute, Perc board members acknowledged that that characterization was inaccurate.
“Twenty-five percent [of people consider] natural gas to be renewable, in this millennial and gen Z bucket,” an unidentified Perc board member said. “There’s a perception out there – not reality, but that’s perception. We can attach to that for propane.”
“You can’t say natural gas is renewable,” Perc board member Leslie Woodward cautioned.
“Perception,” the unidentified board member repeated.
Erin Hatcher, Perc’s senior vice-president of communications and marketing, agreed that propane should be perceived as clean energy. “We don’t want to be in that coal bucket,” she is heard saying on the recording. “We want to be in that clean energy bucket.”
In a comment to Heated and the Guardian, Hatcher said she “did not recall any kind of comment” about mistaking propane as renewable. “Our concern about perception is that all fuels are demonized.”
She added: “There’s no attempt to mislead whatsoever. It’s to educate, because the narrative that predominates the news is that there’s only one way to a clean future, and we don’t believe that.” Woodward did not respond to requests for comment, and Hatcher said she couldn’t identify the other board members who spoke at the meeting.
To stabilize a safe climate, scientists say the world’s energy systems must reach net-zero greenhouse emissions by the year 2050. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said achieving net zero by 2050 will require “a substantial reduction of overall fossil fuel use”.
Propane is a fossil gas, commonly liquified for use in heating and cooking. Typically a by-product of natural gas or crude oil refining, propane can also be made from non-fossil sources like plant, seed and animal oils – though currently, only 0.04% of it is, according to estimates from the EPA and the US Energy Information Administration.
Propane – even “renewable propane” made from plants or cooking oil – emits carbon dioxide and other environmentally harmful fossil fumes. Propane made from fossil fuels emits less carbon than coal or diesel, but more than natural gas when burned as fuel, according to the US Energy Information Administration. In 2022, CO2 emissions from propane in the US were a tiny fraction of the carbon emissions from other fossil fuels, but that’s because the US consumes far less propane than gas and oil – not because propane is necessarily cleaner.
Still, Perc has invested millions in a multiyear strategy to rebrand propane from what it’s called a “dirty fossil fuel” to a so-called clean energy source. According to Drilled, Perc’s annual ad spending increased more than 17-fold from 2021 to 2022-23, from $1.7m to nearly $30m.
In 2022 and 2023, Perc bought ads touting the “clean energy” potential of propane across 450 media properties, according to Drilled’s data, including more than $9m on YouTube channels, including YouTube Kids; $4.7m on Fox News; $2.6m on Southern Living; $1.5m on NBC; $979,000 on USA Today; and $746,000 on ESPN.
A spokesperson for Google, which owns YouTube, said the company bans ads that deny climate change, or ads that claim human beings or greenhouse gases don’t contribute to global warming. “This policy does not prohibit other climate-related topics, including promotions of various energy sources,” the spokesperson said.
Fox News, Southern Living, NBC, USA Today and ESPN did not respond to requests for comment.
The increased ad spending is concerning to clean-energy and misinformation experts, who tell Heated and the Guardian that Perc’s claims are misleading. Propane is not renewable and does not amount to clean energy, they say, nor is renewable propane a realistic or scalable climate solution.
​“The fossil fuel industry has been a true trailblazer on one thing over the last few decades – how to greenwash,” said Wren Montgomery, an associate professor of sustainability at Western University. “Pitching propane as ‘clean energy’ seems to be just their latest greenwashing scheme.”
Energy and Policy Institute research manager Charlie Spatz, who attended Perc’s 2022 board meeting, said the fossil fuel industry has long tried to brand its products as renewable. “And so we’ve seen Perc, in some respects, catch up with the oil industry and natural gas industry to present their product as renewable, when in reality that product is not available in quantities that consumers can even access at this point.”
“Nothing is 100% clean,” said Hatcher of Perc. She said that every energy source has “some carbon involved, whether it’s in making a solar panel or a wind turbine or a dam”.
But Hatcher stopped short of calling propane “renewable” energy, even though Perc uses the term in its marketing. “Nobody here is trying to pretend that propane is not a fossil fuel-based fuel,” she said. “We’re not trying to pretend that it is renewable.”
When asked to clarify whether propane is as climate-friendly as wind or solar power, Hatcher said: “At the actual operation? No.”
In July 2021, Perc circulated an internal video calling electrification efforts “an existential threat” and introducing talking points touting propane as “a clean energy solution for everyone”.
The purpose of the rebrand was to attract a new audience for propane: people who care about the climate crisis. In 2022, Perc presented market research revealing that a promising number of younger, climate-conscious millennials had positive opinions of the fuel.

“We started thinking, is it possible they don’t know the origins of propane?” Hatcher told Perc’s board in its November 2022 annual meeting in Destin, Florida. She presented the results of a survey of 1,000 US adults, which discovered that 97% didn’t consider propane a fossil fuel, even though most of it is. (When she spoke with Heated and the Guardian, Hatcher disputed the 97% figure heard on the recording, but declined to provide the marketing survey she can be heard citing in her presentation.)
There was just one obstacle: despite overall positive views of propane, only 9% of Perc’s survey respondents thought propane was renewable energy, Hatcher said. So Perc board members discussed a strategy to market propane from renewable sources in addition to fossil fuel-derived propane.
“When they understand that propane is not only a low-carbon fuel, in the conventional version, but renewable offers even greater benefits, environmental benefits, we can change their opinion of this energy,” said Hatcher.
A second unidentified Perc board member in the meeting pushed back on Hatcher. “When they Google propane, and they see it’s a fossil fuel, 99% of them [are] going to be immediately turned off propane, whether it is renewable propane or not,” he said.
“We’re in trouble if we don’t win them over, that’s the bottom line,” said Hatcher. “We’re really in trouble. So we need to get them on our side and kind of educate them about the benefits of propane.”
Perc’s position that propane has less of a climate impact than methane gas isn’t true, according to energy experts.
“It is not the lowest greenhouse gas fossil fuel. It’s somewhere between natural gas and diesel,” said Nikita Pavlenko, the program lead at the International Council on Clean Transportation.
Even “renewable” propane is not zero carbon the way solar or wind energy is. It still emits carbon dioxide, though in smaller amounts than propane made from oil or gas. Nor is “renewable” propane a “widely accessible” alternative, as Perc also claims. The amount of “renewable” propane produced in the US is negligible – about 4.5m gallons in 2022, according to the EPA. The US propane supply derived from fossil fuel was about 12.7bn gallons that same year, according to the US Energy Information Administration.
“It’s quite common to promise renewable natural gas, or something like renewable propane,” said Pavlenko, because the people making those promises rarely have to produce it. “They often do very little to secure supply.”
The amount of propane that’s currently made from the camelina plant – the low-carbon alternative featured in many Perc ads, including in the New York Times – is even smaller. “There’s a lot of promises being made about camelina as a feedstock for biofuel and there’s very little, if any, being processed right now,” Pavlenko said. “The camelina is largely theoretical at this point.” (The amount of camelina propane produced in the US is so small, it’s lumped under “other” feedstocks by agencies that collect data on alternative fuels.)
When asked about these ads, a Times spokesperson said that the newspaper “prohibits advertising that is intentionally misleading, deceptive or contains false information”. Perc paid the Times more than $163,000 for ads between 2022 and 2023, according to media-monitoring data compiled by Drilled and reviewed by Heated and the Guardian. Hatcher characterizes these numbers as “estimates”.
When the numbers are added together, experts say, Perc’s claims that propane is “clean energy”, “environmentally friendly” and an important part of “the path to zero carbon emissions” amount to nothing more than greenwashing.
Still, Perc is redoubling its efforts to rebrand propane as environmentally friendly in 2024.
Documents reviewed by Heated and the Guardian show that Perc is increasing its self-reported advertising budget to $12.8m next year to reach new audiences, including “eco-inclined” homeowners. (Perc’s self-reported ad budget does not include a $6.4m category it calls “environmental campaigns” or $1.3m for “thought leadership”.) The budget includes payments to at least 15 influencers, including stars of HGTV home improvement shows and celebrity chefs. Perc is also rolling out new marketing tactics, like advertising in AccuWeather severe weather alerts.
Perc isn’t just aiming this rhetoric at consumers. It’s also developing it for lawmakers who have the power to regulate, and ultimately phase out, fossil fuels. This tactic has been successfully used for years by the natural gas industry, said Faye Holder, a program manager at InfluenceMap.
“All these talking points that you see about ‘clean gas’ and ‘gas is lower emissions’” are used in advertising, said Holder. “But they are also all used in the direct lobbying to policymakers [making] climate policies that would otherwise threaten the role and the business of gas.”
This advertising is “very misleading to consumers,” said Holder. “Calling fossil gas a green climate solution is disinformation because it’s just not true.”
Hatcher expressed frustration with people who don’t share Perc’s vision of a world where coal and diesel are replaced by propane, with the goal of combating the climate crisis. “We’re trying to be part of the solution,” she said several times in interviews.
But if the solution to climate change involves winding down fossil fuels entirely, which is the scientific consensus, Hatcher is less sure about the timeline. “Is there a world without propane? Possibly,” she said. “When? Who knows?”
This article was amended on 26 January 2024 to clarify that “renewable” propane is a source of carbon dioxide emissions."
BTLI6W9JEC_PDHX4RKDI6FQL3G,What’s the secret to great vegetarian gravy?,Anna Berrill,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/jan/23/secret-to-great-vegetarian-gravy-kitchen-aide,"How do I make a flavourful vegetarian gravy that is acceptable to my family, to serve with both roast meat and a vegetarian option? They all seem to rely on dried mushrooms and alcohol for flavour, both of which are unpopular with the children.Jennifer, BlackpoolGood gravy is so much more than an accompaniment; it’s the backbone of any roast dinner, holding together all the different elements on the plate, whether that’s meat or a veggie offering, alongside all the usual suspects – potatoes! Yorkshires! Carrots! “Great gravy, vegetarian or otherwise, is all about the quality of the stock,” says Sarah Wasserman, director of food at plant-based Mildreds in London. “Homemade is best, and you can store vegetable offcuts in the freezer until you have a nice full bag for making stock.”
Wasserman favours a dark stock, which she achieves by roasting onions, carrots, mushrooms (sorry, kids), tomatoes, leeks and the like, until sweet and caramelised. “Use the whole vegetable,” she says. “Onion skins, for example, are especially good for adding colour.” You’ll want herbs such as rosemary and sage in there, too, for a “nice base note”. Then, once the roast veg are at collapsing point, fry them in a deep saucepan, cover with water and boil “until the liquid is deeply coloured”.
The good news for Jennifer and her quest to satisfy the whole family is that you don’t necessarily need to harness dried mushrooms, such as porcini, to get a flavourful gravy, but you will need to add umami in some shape or form. Wasserman suggests turning to red miso, dark soy sauce or Marmite to get the required colour and depth of flavour, while also keeping the children on side. “A good-quality, rich red wine or port reduced to a whisper will give colour, sweetness, a hint of acidity and a generous splash of luxury,” she adds, though, being someone who rarely drinks, she admits that she, too, can find the taste overpowering, “especially if the alcohol isn’t cooked out as it should be”. Instead, for a more subtle sweetness and acidity, she suggests using good-quality organic apple juice; failing that, she says, vinegars such as balsamic or sherry will also do the trick, or stir in some redcurrant jelly, any leftover cranberry sauce that’s knocking about or, as Jamie Oliver does in his Christmas Cookbook, blackcurrant jam and tomato puree (plus red-wine vinegar).
You could even make your gravy all about the onions, as Richard Makin, AKA School Night Vegan, does by frying a roughly chopped white one in butter until it’s beginning to brown. In go some garlic and bay leaves, followed by flour and stock, then, once that’s all thickened, he adds soy sauce and seasons, before straining; Queen Delia Smith goes a step further and adds a splash of Worcestershire sauce, though you’ll need to check it’s a no-anchovy version for the vegetarian contingent.
Alison Roman, on the other hand, relies on brown butter and a dark roux for “complex flavour”, before whisking in stock and simmering with bay leaves, thyme, sherry vinegar, soy sauce and some seasoning. “The soy and vinegar aren’t detectable as singular ingredients, but they fortify the saltiness and provide a smack of tanginess,” she writes. Which is just yet more proof that brown butter makes everything better. No arguments.

BV6DSLVI5J_QRNWBDMKVDYS85O,"Rishi Sunak must quit before he leads Tories to extinction, says ex-minister",Eleni Courea,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/jan/23/rishi-sunak-must-quit-before-he-leads-tories-to-extinction-says-ex-minister-simon-clarke,"Rishi Sunak should resign before he leads the Conservatives to “extinction”, a Tory MP has said in an excoriating attack on the prime minister.
In a dramatic intervention on Tuesday night, Simon Clarke, who was a cabinet minister in Liz Truss’s short-lived government, urged Sunak to quit and make way for a new Tory leader.
In an op-ed for the Telegraph, Clarke said Sunak’s “uninspiring leadership is the main obstacle to our recovery” and that he has “sadly gone from asset to anchor”.
He argued that Sunak “is leading the Conservatives into an election where we will be massacred” because “he does not get what Britain needs. And he is not listening to what the British people want.”
Clarke’s article set off a fresh round of internal party warfare. Tory grandees from all wings of the party hit back at Clarke on social media.
Priti Patel, the former home secretary, said on X that “engaging in facile and divisive self indulgence only serves our opponents”. David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, said: “This is getting silly. The Party and the country are sick and tired of MPs putting their own leadership ambitions ahead of the UK’s best interests.”
Damian Green, chair of the One Nation caucus of centrist Tory MPs, said on the same platform that Clarke’s intervention was “wrong and unwise.” Liam Fox, the former defence secretary, warned that “those who have an agenda to destabilise the government in an election year should understand the consequences”.
Speaking privately, other Tory MPs were even more forthright. “Not sure we should be taking top tips on leadership from Liz Truss’s right hand,” one minister told the Guardian.
“What the bloody hell is Simon Clarke doing?” said a Tory MP who backed Truss in the 2022 leadership contest.
Another Tory MP said: “Simon Clarke hasn’t helped himself, the party, his country or any of his colleagues tonight – only [Keir] Starmer. He needs to go home, have a lie down in a dark room and repeatedly say ‘I must take the fight to Labour’ until it finally sinks in.”
A senior Tory official said of Clarke: “If he wants to help Sir Keir become the next PM he should just cross the floor.”
In his piece Clarke conceded that “many MPs are afraid another change of leader would look ridiculous”, but added: “What could be more ridiculous than meekly sleepwalking towards an avoidable annihilation because we were not willing to listen to what the public are telling us so clearly?”
Senior Tories believe Clarke’s intervention is part of a coordinated plot against Sunak by some on the Tory right, including peer David Frost.
Last week the Telegraph published a YouGov poll suggesting the Tories were headed for a crushing election defeat, accompanied by an op-ed from Frost arguing that their only hope was to take a harder line on immigration.
A new Tory leader would be the fourth Conservative prime minister in 18 months. Boris Johnson departed in September 2022 and was briefly succeeded by Truss before Sunak took charge.
Labour’s national campaign coordinator Pat McFadden said the Tories were forming “another circular firing squad”.
“There are many good reasons for getting rid of this clapped out Conservative government and liberating the British people from endless bouts of Tory infighting is certainly one of them,” he said.
The Liberal Democrats’ deputy leader Daisy Cooper said it was “utterly ludicrous that the Conservative party is even discussing installing a fourth prime minister without even giving voters a say”."
BVW6ZEH632_735NWXX7GNKYX2P,Andrew Payne obituary,Anthony Hayward,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/jan/26/andrew-payne-obituary,"Andrew Payne, who has died aged 74, was a television scriptwriter who did much to contribute to the popularity of Minder, the comedy-drama featuring George Cole as the dodgy used-car dealer Arthur Daley, but he found great personal success with his own creation, Pie in the Sky, which starred Richard Griffiths as a sleuthing chef, Henry Crabbe.
The programme, which ran for five series from 1994 to 1997, took its title from the name of the restaurant opened by Crabbe, a retired detective effectively blackmailed into returning to police work on tricky cases with the fictional Westershire force by Assistant Chief Constable Freddy Fisher (played by Malcolm Sinclair).
“I quite liked detective shows, but I wanted to do a cop show that was anti-cop shows,” Payne told the Stage in 1996. “It was a challenge to make Richard a policeman who didn’t want to be one. I like reluctant heroes, and Crabbe would rather be in the kitchen making an omelette than out solving crime.”
A kitchen was also the setting for Payne’s first Minder script in 1980. It was the penultimate episode of the first series – which had begun the previous year – and had Terry McCann (Dennis Waterman) going undercover in a Greek restaurant during a family feud over its ownership.
Payne wrote another 11 episodes of the programme, which combined action sequences with wit and humour, before leaving – as did Waterman – at the end of the seventh series, in 1989. “It did get more comedic,” Payne told Paul Stenning, the host of a Minder podcast, in 2022. “It could so easily have become a vehicle for George, with Dennis Waterman as his straight man. I always tried to give Dennis good stuff to do – I mean drama as opposed to comedy – because he’s a very good actor.”
Payne was chosen to script the 1985 feature-length Christmas special, Minder on the Orient Express. “What do you want tickets to a Chinese takeaway for?” Arthur asks Terry.
He also contributed episodes to crime series such as Shoestring (in 1980), which starred Trevor Eve as a radio phone-in host and private detective, Pulaski (in 1987), featuring David Andrews as a priest-turned-private eye, and Lovejoy (in 1992 and 1993), with Ian McShane as an antiques dealer-cum-amateur sleuth.
He wrote 11 episodes of Midsomer Murders (between 2002 and 2011), during John Nettles’s stint as Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby, and one story for DCI Banks (in 2012), starring Stephen Tompkinson.
Payne first had success on his own when he wrote Nightlife (1982) for the ITV Playhouse anthology series. It dramatised the tension that follows when a man (Michael Troughton) returns to his flat from a party with a woman (Claire Lewis) and, against his will, is joined by an aggressive neighbour (David Hayman).
His next single play, Love After Lunch (1987), for the BBC, was a comedy of manners starring Denis Lawson, whose character attends counselling sessions when his marriage is falling apart, only to discover that the leader of the group is having an affair with his wife.
Payne explored relationship issues again in the groundbreaking 1993 BBC miniseries You, Me and It. Based on the difficulty experienced by the drama’s producer, Alex Graham, in conceiving his first child, it featured a former rugby international (James Wilby) and his wife (Suzanne Burden) facing infertility problems.
“I wanted to touch all aspects of the couple’s lives and explore how infertility and the stress it creates affects their relationship with each other, their friends, family and colleagues,” Payne said. As with all his work, he sought to find some humour in the story, which he said “creeps in naturally” once the characters are developed.
Payne was born in Bovey Tracey, Devon, to Joan (nee Landamore) and Dudley Payne, and studied at Denstone college, Uttoxeter, Staffordshire, and Hornsey College of Art (1969-72) in London. He worked as a screenprinter until breaking through as a writer with the BBC Radio 4 play Danger! Man at Work! (1980). His agent sent him to Linda Agran, Minder’s script executive, and his television career took off.
He adapted stories by Dick Francis for a 1989 TV series based around the adventures of the fictional Jockey Club investigator David Cleveland (McShane). There were classy period pieces: Dead Gorgeous, Payne’s 2002 version of Peter Lovesey’s post-second world war novel On the Edge, which starred Fay Ripley and Helen McCrory as women planning to murder each other’s husbands – a stylish variation on the Hitchcock thriller Strangers on a Train; and Malice Aforethought (2005), from Anthony Berkeley Cox’s novel, with Ben Miller as a 1920s doctor who seduces, then murders, his victims.
Payne’s later stage plays, such as Plan B (2008) and Don’t Go There (2018), were championed by Robert Plagnol, an actor and producer who translated them for French theatre and festival performances. His 2013 play The Meeting was directed by Lawson at Hampstead theatre in 2016.
Payne’s 1973 marriage to Julia Manheim ended in divorce. He is survived by his second wife, Nicola (nee Gibson), whom he married in 2014, and his stepdaughters, Phoebe and Florence.

Instead we are violating children’s human rights",_,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/22/if-incarceration-made-us-safer-queensland-would-be-the-safest-state-instead-we-are-violating-childrens-human-rights,"Reports about the treatment of children in Queensland watch houses are nothing short of shameful.
Just this week, the police union president, Ian Leavers, stated his very real concerns that the impact of overcrowding in watch houses and the blatant violation of human rights are a “death in custody waiting to happen”. Surprisingly perhaps, on this occasion, I find myself in agreement with Leavers.
The routine denial of children’s human rights in the name of community safety is dangerous, and accepting the inhumane treatment of children who have been arrested is outright unacceptable – shame on anyone who believes it is.
For our justice system to be effective, we must recognise the rights of young people in conflict with the law and the rights of victims of crime are not mutually exclusive. We must insist our justice system promotes and protects the human rights of both to achieve a just outcome. We need a system that restores safety and repairs harm, rather than creating it – as ours currently does.
Let’s return to a place of agreement, the values we espouse as quintessentially Australian. Where children are loved and valued. Where they experience the joy of play and imagination. They are healthy, hopeful and live free from violence, disadvantage and the burden of grown-up problems.
They learn in good schools and find connection in communities that care about them. They have food, shelter and safety and experience dignity, belonging and justice. This is something we want unconditionally for all children, without exception, right?

There is something powerful and comfortable in embracing the sentiment that our children are our future. But to realise this promise requires much more than the repetition of a cliche. We must be prepared to back our sentiment with action, as a nation that purportedly promotes and protects the rights of all our children.
When I reflect on those values in the context of the current situation for children in watch houses, I see a dangerous complacency in how our values align with our behaviour.
Nelson Mandela proclaimed, “There can be no keener revelation of a society’s soul than the way in which it treats its children.” If we truly subscribe to that notion, we should easily pass that test, without exception. However, if the headlines, the social media commentary, and the dominant political discourse about children are measures of who we are as a society, then I say we are failing, emphatically.
So, when do we decide that the test is no longer valid or that our long-espoused values are no longer valuable and can be set aside? What are the “exceptions” that apply or the conditions that we place on the usefulness of this as a measure of our society’s soul?
When the child is poor?
When they don’t have a home?
When they don’t look like our children?
When they don’t behave as we expect them to?
When they have made choices we don’t agree with?
When they have committed a crime?
What circumstance of any child renders them unworthy of basic, fundamental human rights or justifies the abandonment of our values?
While I absolutely share concerns about the level of risk in the behaviour of some young people, to achieve safety for all in our communities, we must be prepared to let go of the flawed foundations, assumptions and fallacies that underpin the tough-on-crime playbook.
Corrective systems correct nothing. Incarceration of children in overcrowded watch houses and detention centres reinforces their sense of isolation and social rejection.
Our state has the highest incarceration rate of young people in the country. If it was in any way an effective strategy to reduce youth crime, it would not consistently produce a 90% recidivism rate. If incarceration made us safer, Queensland would be the safest state in Australia, yet the only race we’re winning is the one to the bottom.
Children who continue to be in conflict with the law often come from families that experience the most profound disadvantage in our society. Overwhelmingly, the children are contending with health problems, often undiagnosed or inadequately supported disabilities, have lived with family violence and a range of adverse childhood experiences.
A further common characteristic among many young people in these circumstances is an experience of being failed or overlooked by those systems designed to support and protect them.
A just outcome is more likely when the rights and lived experiences of victims and young people who have committed offences are acknowledged and when restitution, healing and rehabilitation are provided.
Justice is not served by the conscious violation of child rights marketed as an acceptable consequence. A mature society does not deprioritise certain rights because a child has done the wrong thing or made bad choices. They are not less deserving by virtue of being poor, nor being detained in a police watch house.
I am not advocating that a “free pass” be given but that help is given in equal measure to support young people in trouble to change course. To recognise they are children and that their current circumstances do not allow us to opt out from upholding our values nor from upholding their rights.
Without meaningful opportunities for restoration and rehabilitation, the trajectory, as you all know, is pretty much set, and that’s not justice for anyone.

BZIT6IAVDS_K4B162DE7ZF7MUP,Chagos islanders stunned as David Cameron rules out return,Mark Townsend,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/jan/26/chagos-islanders-stunned-as-david-cameron-rules-out-return,"Britain’s foreign secretary, David Cameron, has provoked fury by abruptly ruling out the resettlement of former inhabitants of the Chagos Islands, months after his predecessor revealed that the UK was discussing their potential return.
The former prime minister suggested that a return to the islands was now “not possible” for Chagossians who were forcibly displaced by the British government in the 1960s and 1970s.
His stance stunned islanders who a year ago had celebrated the news that the UK was discussing the return of islanders along with a possible future handover of the Chagos archipelago.
On Thursday, Human Rights Watch (HRW) wrote to Cameron expressing its “extreme concern” over the apparent U-turn after a long-running campaign to repatriate Chagos islanders.
In their first official statements on the development, Chagossian groups criticised Cameron’s intervention.
Marie Sabrina Jean, the chair of the Chagos Refugees UK Group, said: “Cameron does not have any respect for human rights. The problem is that all UK politicians continue the fiction that Chagossians are not native to the islands and have no property or other rights.
“Whether the UK keeps the islands or gives them to Mauritius, the Chagossians’ rights must be restored first.”
A supporting statement from Chagossian Voices, a grassroots campaigning group, added: “It is our absolute right to return to our islands. Having forcibly removed us, the UK government has both a duty of care and a duty to facilitate our return.
“The decision as to whether it was ‘possible’ was – and remains – political.”
Cameron’s stance on the issue emerged during his evidence to a foreign affairs committee hearing on 9 January, in comments that contrasted sharply with those made by his predecessor in a written ministerial statement on 3 November 2022.
In March last year, the then foreign secretary, James Cleverly, confirmed that talks between the UK and Mauritius over the future of the Indian Ocean islands included “resettlement of the former inhabitants of the Chagos archipelago”.
Cleverly, who is now home secretary, had said in November 2022 that the aim was to reach a settlement involving the return of former islanders with Mauritius early last year. Twelve months later, Cameron took over his job despite not being an MP.
The HRW letter, signed by its UK director, Yasmine Ahmed, said: “We note that your predecessor acknowledged that resettlement of the Chagossians in their homeland was part of the negotiations with Mauritius.”
According to HRW, a 2014 KPMG feasibility study – commissioned and completed when Cameron was prime minister – concluded it was possible for islanders to return.
The UK’s continuing occupation of the islands, a British territory in the Indian Ocean since 1814, has prompted widespread global opposition and two high-profile defeats in the international courts.
Justifying his intervention on the issue, Cameron highlighted security requirements and the importance of the Diego Garcia military base.
However, Cleverly’s potential agreement with Mauritius indicated that the strategic Indian Ocean military base in Diego Garcia, which the UK leases to the US, would stay open.
In fact, not even Chagossian groups were advocating for the closure of the military base, but wanted to return to live on the unoccupied islands and the unoccupied part of Diego Garcia.
Cameron also caused disquiet by failing to mention the rights of the Chagossians when discussing the future of the islands.
“Central to any future decisions concerning the Chagos archipelago must be the desires, perspectives and voices of the Chagossian people,” said Chagossian Voices.
Chagossians have campaigned to return since about 2,000 people were forced to leave by Britain between 1967 and 1971 and were exiled in Mauritius, Seychelles and eventually the UK, when in 2002 they were granted the right to apply for British citizenship.
Mauritius, which won independence from the UK in 1968, maintains the islands are its own.
In 2019, the international court of justice, the UN’s highest court, ruled that the UK’s administration of the territory was “unlawful” and must end. The UK ignored the ruling on the grounds that it was advisory.
Two years later, the international tribunal for the law of the sea ruled that the British claim to the islands was illegal. Again, the UK refused to accept the ruling.
The HRW letter also accused the UK of crimes against humanity over its treatment of the Chagossian people including “persecution on the grounds of race and ethnicity”.
Jean added: “Chagossians are descendants of enslaved peoples brought to the islands by the French and Mauritians, they were freed by the English in 1835 yet still have no rights or property. This historic wrong must be corrected.”
In the 2022 ministerial statement, Cleverly stated: “The UK and Mauritius have agreed to engage in constructive negotiations, with a view to arriving at an agreement by early next year.
“Taking into account relevant legal proceedings, it is our intention to secure an agreement on the basis of international law to resolve all outstanding issues, including those relating to the former inhabitants of the Chagos archipelago.”
Cameron told parliament that he had already looked into whether Chagossians could return to the islands, claiming it was not an option.
“When I was prime minister, it was all about trying to see if we could relocate Chagossians back on to the outer islands; lots of work was done, and it was not possible,” said the foreign secretary.
The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office has been contacted for comment."
C1GJDKRACR_YYNX8TIMC1XG709,French farming protests: mother and daughter die after car hits road blockade,Angelique Chrisafis,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/23/french-farming-protests-woman-dies-after-car-hits-hay-bale-blockade,"A woman and her teenage daughter have died in southern France after a car hit a roadblock where they were standing. The blockade had been set up by farmers taking part in growing anti-government protests.
The 35-year-old woman and her 14-year-old daughter were killed at 5.45am when a car went through a warning barrage and collided at speed with bales of straw piled up to stop traffic in Pamiers, Ariège, to the south of Toulouse.
The woman’s husband was seriously injured. The three people in the car, all Armenian nationals, were being questioned on suspicion of involuntary manslaughter.
The woman who was killed was a member of the powerful FNSEA farmers union, which has been leading nationwide protests. Her daughter was taken to hospital but later died.
Olivier Mouysset, a local prosecutor, said early results of the investigation suggested the car, carrying a couple and a friend, had not rammed the barrier intentionally. In the dark, the car ran into a wall of straw bales at the roadblock, hit the three people and only came to a halt when it crashed into a tractor’s trailer, Mouysset said.
The farming protests – calling on the government to cut regulations and taxes and ensure better prices for produce – have presented Emmanuel Macron’s newly appointed prime minister, Gabriel Attal, with his first major headache, as convoys of tractors continued to block key roads across France on Tuesday and farmers held demonstrations in towns.
Attal wrote on social media that “the nation is devastated” by the farmer’s death at the roadblock.
Macron said he had asked his government “to offer concrete solutions” to the farmers’ problems. “My thoughts go out to the victims and their loved ones who are mourning them,” he said, calling Tuesday’s collision “a drama that has devastated us all”.
Attal met farming unions on Monday night but did not assuage their anger. From Tuesday morning, farmers blocked roads across the country, including the areas around Toulouse in the south-west, Isère in the south-east, and Beauvais in the north.
“We’re prepared for anything, we’ve got nothing to lose,” said Josep Perez, a protester interviewed by BFM TV at a roadblock in the south-western fruit-growing region around Agen, where traffic on the A62 motorway had been disrupted.
Farmers on Tuesday drove to the prefect’s office in Agen and dumped piles of tripe from a local abattoir, threw kiwifruit, and splattered the front of the building in red paint. They hung a banner saying: “We won’t die in silence.”
Arnaud Rousseau, the head of the FNSEA union, told RMC radio that the protests could last “a day, a week” or “as long as it takes” for the government to respond. “Every minute, we’re learning of a new roadblock,” he said. Every single département in France would be involved at some point during this week, he said.
Arnaud Gaillot, the head of the Young Farmers union, said: “We won’t lift the roadblocks until the prime minister makes very clear announcements … the time for talking is over, action is needed.”
The government recently put its long-awaited agriculture bill on hold again, saying it wants to hear from farming representatives before including additional measures to support the sector.
When Attal met farming representatives on Monday, he promised a number of measures would be announced by the end of the week, according to the agriculture minister, Marc Fesneau.

Farmers said anger was growing for several reasons. Many feel abandoned in the face of the climate crisis, with droughts and severe weather conditions, but there is also fury at what they see as impossibly low prices for their products in the food sector, the difficulty of red tape, complex environmental norms and green policies, such as on water use, which they say are affecting profits. There is also anger about taxes on off-road diesel, which affects farmers.
The farmers’ protests in France come amid other tractor demonstrations in European countries, such as Germany and Romania, before European parliament elections in June.
France, the EU’s biggest agricultural producer, has thousands of independent producers of meat, dairy, fruit and vegetables and wine, who have a record of staging disruptive protests.
The government fears the protests could spread to other people angry about the cost of living and energy prices. Fabien Roussel, the head of the Communist party, said there should be a “convergence of anger”, calling on others to put pressure on the government over the tax on off-road diesel, as well as the rise in electricity prices and a rise in medicine costs.
In the lead-up to the European parliament elections, Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally party has appealed to farmers and rural voters.
Her party colleague Jean-Philippe Tanguy said: “Farmers are at last getting the attention of public powers.” He said he was surprised it was taking Attal so long “to understand the way French farming works”."
C27WR2HJ8B_4VM5XFL2XRN5VKT,British billionaire Joe Lewis pleads guilty to US insider trading,Dominic Rushe,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/24/joe-lewis-billionaire-tottenham-hotspur-pleads-guilty,"The British billionaire Joe Lewis pleaded guilty on Wednesday to charges he used an insider-trading scheme to enrich friends and associates, and apologized to a judge, saying he was “embarrassed” by his conduct.
The 86-year-old, whose family trust controls a majority of Tottenham Hotspur, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and two counts of securities fraud, as part of an agreement with the US attorney’s office in Manhattan. As part of the plea deal, Lewis has the right to appeal in the event he is sentenced to prison time, his lawyer David Zornow said.
Last July, Damian Williams, the US attorney for the southern district of New York, accused Lewis of giving friends, including his personal pilots, assistants and romantic partners, inside information about companies in which he was an investor.
“He used inside information as a way to compensate his employees, or shower gifts on his friends and lovers,” Williams said at the time.
Addressing the US district judge Jessica Clarke, Lewis said he knew at the time that what he was doing was wrong.
“I am so embarrassed and I apologize to the court for my conduct,” Lewis said.
The pilots, Patrick O’Connor and Bryan Waugh, were also charged. All three men entered not guilty pleas last July.
Lewis was charged by federal prosecutors with 16 counts of securities fraud and three counts of conspiracy, for alleged crimes spanning from 2013 to 2021.
Although Lewis will not plead guilty to the other counts under the terms of his deal, Clarke said she may consider them for sentencing purposes.
Clarke set his sentencing for 28 March.
Lewis founded the investment firm Tavistock Group and is worth $6.2bn, according to Forbes. Lewis has been allowed to remain free on a $300m bond secured by his yacht, named the Aviva, and private aircraft.
The terms of his bail restrict Lewis from traveling outside the United States, boarding his yacht or traveling in his personal aircraft unless it was to attend a court hearing. Lewis is limited to traveling between New York, Florida and Georgia, where he owns property.
Prosecutors have said Lewis gleaned inside information about four companies in which he had invested through his hedge fund and tipped friends and associates between 2019 and 2021.
The companies, according to prosecutors, included Mirati Therapeutics and BCTG Acquisition, a blank-cheque company that his hedge fund founded and took Tango Therapeutics public in a merger in 2021.
Lewis hid the size of his holdings in Mirati by investing through a trust and a shell company registered in the name of his granddaughter and an employee, according to prosecutors.
Williams has called Lewis’s conduct “classic corporate corruption”.

CEN0V11W7O_T2XWLBDQBWJZ0MI,Albanese government under pressure to reveal next moves after failed referendum,Josh Butler,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/24/albanese-government-under-pressure-to-reveal-next-moves-after-failed-referendum,"The Australian government must “urgently” accelerate its plans on closing the gap in Indigenous life outcomes after the unsuccessful voice referendum, according to the top representative body of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community organisations.
The Coalition of Peaks has also suggested Labor should convene a “proper process to bring together Aboriginal people” to decide the future of the Uluru statement and its calls for voice, truth and treaty.
“In the meantime, we urgently need to get on with closing the gap and the Coalition of Peaks want to see funding for our communities hitting the ground now,” its acting lead convener Catherine Liddle told Guardian Australia.

After the defeat of the referendum, which failed to win a majority in any state, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said the government would “consult on Indigenous Australians about a way forward”.
But three months on from the 14 October vote, little has emerged on Labor’s next plans in Indigenous affairs policy to bridge yawning gaps in life outcomes between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians. Indigenous-led organisations and senior figures in the yes campaign have questioned when new steps may be outlined, with some privately supporting the notion of government proceeding with legislated models for truth, treaty and voice.
The Coalition of Peaks, a representative body of more than 80 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community-controlled peak organisations, met with the Indigenous Australians minister, Linda Burney, in November 2023 to discuss next steps.
Liddle, also the chief executive of the SNAICC (Secretariat of National Aboriginal and Islander Child Care) National Voice for our Children, said the Coalition of Peaks wanted to see further funding for Indigenous issues as soon as possible.
“The Coalition of Peaks have put a proposal to the Albanese government on what could be done to accelerate efforts to implement the national agreement and close the gap in the wake of the failed referendum and we are working with the government on this,” she said.
Liddle said the coalition wanted to ensure “all governments fulfil the commitments they have already made”, which she said included having Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people “at the table with governments” in decision-making.
“We know that Aboriginal people overwhelmingly voted for a voice. We voted for change and to improve our life outcomes. The Coalition of Peaks remain resolute and committed to bring about the change communities voted for,” she said.
The Productivity Commission is expected to hand down the final report of its review into the national agreement on closing the gap in early February. The government is expected to table its latest Closing the Gap report in mid-February, where further announcements on next steps in Indigenous affairs policy could be outlined.
Liddle said the Closing the Gap report should be accompanied by “significant and adequate funding” announcements, including a legislated closing the gap fund.
“We need funding to get to our communities urgently so that they can start to see the change all hoped for. We haven’t had a huge injection to support closing the gap since 2008 when it was around $5bn,” she said.
Burney told Guardian Australia in November the government was “taking our time” with setting its next plans, admitting that “might be frustrating to some people”, but flagging that truth-telling was being considered.

In a statement this week, she said the government had “unwavering” commitment to working improving outcomes.
“The status quo remains unacceptable – we can all agree that we need to do more to address the inequality faced by many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people,” Burney said.
She said consultations she had conducted continued to raise priorities of health, jobs, education and housing, as well as “the importance of better understanding about our shared story and history.”
Labor has remained tight-lipped on the future of the Uluru statement, which Albanese has publicly committed to on numerous occasions – most prominently in his May 2022 election night victory speech.
Albanese did not answer a recent question at a press conference on whether Labor would advance truth and treaty processes, while the future of the Makarrata commission remains in limbo.
Liddle said any “significant changes” on Indigenous affairs policy, which she said would include the possibility of legislating parts of the Uluru statement, must be decided with Indigenous people.
“It is very important that there is a proper process to bring together Aboriginal people to agree what happens next on the Uluru statement and that any engagements are conducted in line with the national agreement on closing the gap,” she said. What form a truth-telling process takes should be a negotiation between the government and Aboriginal community representatives. This will take some time.
“It is clear from the referendum outcome that Australia needs a truth-telling process on our collective history and on the constitution itself, how it works and how it was developed.”"
CGRUJBW15F_GX23J011FIS9CQ4,‘The key thing is to have a plan’: the former City watchdog now helping to guide Keir Starmer,Kalyeena Makortoff,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/23/the-key-thing-is-to-have-a-plan-the-former-city-watchdog-now-helping-to-guide-keir-starmer,"Charles Randell had no idea what was about to unfold as he made his way to Downing Street in September 2007. Days earlier, the then chancellor Alistair Darling had taken drastic measures, guaranteeing deposits at Northern Rock in an effort to halt Britain’s first bank run in 140 years.
The future Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) chair – a partner at “magic circle” law firm Slaughter and May at the time – had followed the news closely, but admits: “I had no idea that this was the beginning of a huge snowball that would lead to a much bigger set of problems – and a very long-running assignment.”
After a briefing with Treasury officials, who were familiar with Randell’s work on projects privatising the likes of British Gas, he was led down to No 11 Downing Street to meet his next client: Darling himself. “The whole thing is quite a blur,” Randell recalls.
What ensued was a five-year appointment as the government’s chief legal adviser, as ministers spent £1tn to bail out and stabilise a banking system whose bosses were slow to recognise the severity of the crisis. Randell recalls being “stunned” weeks later, as he watched Northern Rock’s board discuss paying dividends just weeks after Darling’s intervention, eventually spurring him to push for government contingency plans for the bank’s eventual nationalisation.
A year later, he was in the room as disgraced Royal Bank of Scotland boss Fred Goodwin was sacked by ministers, who had launched a bailout to save the lender from collapse that eventually totalled £46bn.
“He was very surprised, and I think the [RBS] board was quite surprised,” Randell recalls. “I think this was another example of the fact that many people took a while to adjust the understanding of how bad things actually were.”
It was a relentless role that sent Randell’s career in a very different direction tto what he had imagined. Born in 1958, he spent his formative years in postwar Germany, where his father worked as an intelligence officer for MI5. His family’s financial circumstances had been masked by subsidised military living, but the illusion was shattered when he was 12 years old and they returned to the UK during the economic doldrums of the 1970s. With no savings and only enough money to rent a small flat in Merton, south London, “it was quite a bleak comparison”, says Randell.
While he eventually secured a place at Oxford University, financial worries pushed him to switch from English to law. His father’s sudden death from lung cancer left his mother with a meagre civil service widow’s pension, and a young Randell prioritising a supportive salary over his own educational passions.
But a graduate position in 1980 would lead to “varied and interesting work” as Slaughter and May became the go-to law firm for privatisation projects that took companies such as British Telecom, British Aerospace and British Gas out of public hands. His reputation resulted in his financial-crisis-era role with the UK government, which was swiftly followed by a similar position advising the Portuguese government on its own crisis in 2012.
Randell eventually returned to the UK and in 2013 was convinced to join long-term efforts to reinforce the now tarnished financial system. He became a founding board member of the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) – one of two City regulators that replaced the disgraced Financial Services Authority in the wake of the crisis.
There, he helped implement the first stress tests, meant to measure the financial strength of the banking sector, helping earn him a CBE for services to financial stability and climate change policy in 2016.
By 2018, he was persuaded to chair the second arm of the City’s regulatory system, the FCA, alongside Andrew Bailey, now Bank of England governor.
But the numerous issues plaguing the FCA – which was in desperate need of modernisation and was accused of failing to protect investors who had lost hundreds of millions of pounds though the Neil Woodford and London Capital & Finance scandals – led to a demanding four years.
While the FCA and PRA started with comparable workloads, the balance started to tip in 2014, when the former of the two bodies was put in charge of more than 30,000 consumer creditors, including derided payday lenders.
“The workload of the FCA was doubled but the staff wasn’t and the budget wasn’t,” Randell says. Next came fears over failed providers of funeral plans and concerns over the cryptocurrency boom.
“I probably look at the FCA as the most challenging job I’ve ever had. Many things were not fun … [but] there were other things that were hugely valuable to me,” Randell says, particularly connecting with real people affected by a financial sector often criticised for operating in its own City bubble.
He recalls meeting a man struggling to pay off a loan shark linked to a paramilitary group in Belfast, pensioners in Solihull struggling to access increasingly digital banking services and workers in Blackpool struggling to manage finances on meagre benefits.
They left such lasting impressions that Randell, who left the FCA after four years in 2022, was spurred on to join the Financial Inclusion Commission in November: a group of experts that sponsors research and lobbies for accessible financial services for vulnerable consumers.
Its work is now set to influence Labour’s financial sector agenda, with Randell among 10 independent City grandees advising the party as it crafts fresh policies before the next general election.
While Randell emphasises his lack of political leanings, his wealth of experience leaves him warning Labour to be prepared: “The key thing is to have a plan. Because once you get into power, events take over.”

CIUOTWUVC9_V259WWDZMY4L1TU,"Berlin film festival announces eclectic lineup including Rooney Mara, Stephen Fry and Gael García Bernal",Philip Oltermann,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/jan/22/berlin-film-festival-announces-eclectic-lineup-including-rooney-mara-stephen-fry-and-gael-garcia-bernal,"Colombian cocaine hippos, a Star Wars parody set in northern France and an unlikely father-daughter pairing of Stephen Fry and Lena Dunham all feature in an eclectic lineup at this year’s Berlin film festival, which was unveiled on Monday.
The 74th edition of the 10-day Berlinale will open on 15 February with the world premiere of Small Things Like These, based on Irish author Clare Keegan’s bestselling historical novel. Adapted to the big screen by Enda Walsh, the film sees Cillian Murphy reuniting with Belgian director Tim Mielants, who directed the third series of Peaky Blinders.
Berlinale leadership duo Mariette Rissenbeek and Carlo Chatrian, who are curating the festival for their fifth and last time, had notably eschewed glamour for more serious arthouse fare in previous years. But the duo’s swansong festival will feature several stars in intriguing team-ups with respected directors.
In the main competition, Mexican actor Gael García Bernal and Norwegian newcomer Renate Reinsve (The Worst Person in the World) star in Italian director Piero Messina’s dystopian sci-fi drama Another End, about a man whose wife dies and the woman renting out her body.
Rooney Mara features in innovative Mexican director Alonso Ruizpalacios’ La Cocina, a love story set in the kitchen of a Manhattan restaurant, while Isabelle Huppert will attend the festival to pick up the honorary Golden Bear award she received in absentia in 2022, and as the star of South Korean director Hong Sang-soo’s Yeohaengjaui Pilyo (A Traveller’s Needs).
French directors feature prominently, with Olivier Assayas’s “pandemic comedy” Hors du Temps (Suspended Time), and Bruno Dumont’s L’Empire, an absurdist Star Wars parody set in a fishing village on the Opal coast.
In German director Julia von Heinz’s tragicomedy Treasure, Dunham plays an American music journalist who travels to Poland with her Holocaust survivor father Edek (Fry). Formerly titled Iron Box, the film will see its world premiere at the festival but not run in the competition for the Golden Bear.
Also running outside competition is Dominican director Nelson Carlos De Los Santos Arias’s documentary Pepe, about a hippopotamus who lived in Colombian druglord Pablo Escobar’s private menagerie.
The Visitor, Canadian artist Bruce LaBruce’s London-set reimagination of Pier Paolo Pasolini’s Theorem – about a refugee who stays with a bourgeois family and has sex with every single one of them – will world premiere in Berlin’s Panorama section.
Rissenbeek and Chatrian, who will pass the directorship baton on to former London film festival director Tricia Tuttle, opened their programme presentation on Monday with a positioning statement on the Israel-Hamas war.

“Festivals provide a space for artistic expression and enable peaceful dialogue. They are places of encounter and exchange and contribute to international understanding. We believe that through the power of films and open discussions, we can help foster empathy, awareness, understanding, even and especially in painful times like these,” Chatrian said.
Earlier this month an anonymously organised petition had called for a boycott of German cultural institutions over the government’s alleged silencing of pro-Palestinian voices, and last week two film-makers announced they had withdrawn their films from the Berlinale.
Chatrian said he regretted their decision, but that there were no signs that any film-makers in the main programme were joining the boycott."
CK6UU4WMV3_OTJYATIXOO00DWH,‘I was told I could visit. Then she went missing’: the Bangladeshi mothers who say their children were adopted without consent,Thaslima Begum,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/jan/25/i-was-told-i-could-visit-then-she-went-missing-the-bangladeshi-mothers-who-say-their-children-were-adopted-without-consent,"More than four decades have passed, but Sayrun Nisa still cries for her son as if she lost him yesterday. In 1977, she had been taking care of her child and sick husband at home when there was a knock at the door. She opened it to find two people who claimed they were from Terres Des Hommes Netherlands (TDHn), an organisation that operated in the Dattapara camp for refugees of the Bangladesh war of independence, where she lived.
“They started telling me about a children’s home they were running,” says Sayrun, now 80. “They said they could take care of my son for me and give him a good education. I had no reason to doubt them as they were from what I thought was a respectable organisation.”
Sayrun recalls feeling unsure as she watched her six-year-old playing in the corner. But when she discussed it with her husband, they felt it might not be a bad idea. “My husband had been sick for a while and was unemployed. If we put our son in the home, it would mean that I could find work,” she says.
Sayrun Nisa thought her son would be given a good education at the children’s home that took him in but she never saw him again
The couple were poor and lived in a hut with a roof that often leaked when it rained. “There were days where we struggled to eat,” recalls Sayrun. A week later, she took her son to a children’s home she believed to be run by TDHn. Sayrun thought the staff might show her around. But instead a woman at the gate asked her to hand over her child and leave. “I gave him over with only the clothes on his back,” says Sayrun, holding back tears.
The following weekend, Sayrun returned to the school but was told her son was no longer there. “I demanded to speak to someone and told them I wouldn’t leave until I knew where my son was,” she says. “I waited for over an hour until an officer came to the gate and told me to go home.” When Sayrun refused, she says the guard pointed a gun in her face.
Sayrun told her husband what had happened and the next day they filed a complaint at the police station. “Days turned into weeks and nothing was done,” she says. “I kept going back to the children’s home and then one day, they offered me a job. I took it thinking it might be a way to find my son.”
Sayrun began working for the children’s home but couldn’t find any answers to her questions. One day, she learned from a colleague that a group of children had been sent abroad. “I asked if my son was among them and she told me yes. I fainted on the spot.”
Sayrun often dreamed that her son would return. “I’d hear a knock at the door and my heart would jump with joy,” she says. “One day, I was on a bus in Dhaka and thought I saw a young man that looked just like him. I jumped off and chased the man down the street but it wasn’t him. People thought I had lost my mind.”
The fate of Sayrun’s son was not an isolated incident. In the town of Tongi, on the outskirts of Dhaka, a number of women claim that their children disappeared in similar circumstances.
All the women interviewed for the Guardian say they left their children in what they believed would be the temporary care of the children’s home run by TDHn, in Tongi, only to later discover the children had been adopted abroad.
TDHn says it did not run a children’s home in Tongi at that time and that, although the perception that the organisation performed adoptions was then persistent in Bangladesh, it was entirely incorrect. “The allegation that local [TDHn] staff were involved in misleading parents to give up their children for adoption is not new. Investigations conducted at the time concluded that the claims were not substantiated,” a spokesperson says.
A number of investigations into the allegations took place in the 1970s, including by TDHn, which concluded that they were “false and baseless”. None of the mothers whose children went missing were interviewed for the investigation. Police in Bangladesh have launched an investigation after reports of the allegations by the Guardian last year.
Rezia Begum, who says her three-month-old daughter was taken from her
Rezia Begum says she was approached in 1977 by men claiming to work for TDHn offering to take her child, but she politely declined. A week later, she laid her three-month-old down to sleep and went to the bathroom but when she returned, her daughter was missing.
“I was only gone for a moment” says Rezia, now 72. She ran out of her house screaming, telling the neighbours what had just happened. “Everyone started to search the area. We went from door to door until nightfall but we couldn’t find her anywhere.”
From left: Rezia Begum holds a picture of her daughter, who she was reunited with decades after her 1977 disappearance; Aasia Begum’s daughter Falani was six years old when she went missing
For weeks, Rezia sat in the same spot she last held her daughter; the sound of her baby’s cries still ringing in her ears. “I just wanted her back,” says Rezia, tears streaming down her face. “She was the most beautiful little girl – with these big brown eyes and a small button nose. I couldn’t believe she was just gone.” It would be more than 20 years before Rezia was finally reunited with her daughter thanks to the pioneering help of a campaigning group of Bangladeshi adoptees. Others who have lost their children are still waiting.
Aasia Begum, now in her 80s, was a single mother living in the Dattapara camp with her two young daughters. The elder one, Falani, was six years old – a chatty, joyful girl who liked to play with the other children on her street.
“I would sing them lullabies and longed for them to grow up and become educated and successful,” says Aasia. So when she heard about the children’s centre around the corner from her house, she happily enrolled her elder child.
“I was told I could see her every weekend and that in a few years, she could return home,” she says. But Aasia would soon learn that would not be the case. One day, she went to drop off some bananas at the school but found the gates locked. “I could see Falani playing in the courtyard and called out to her. But a guard quickly came and told me I had to go.”
Her daughter had also seen her and ran up to speak to her but the two were separated by force. “She went missing after that,” says Aasia.
Jahanara Begum’s two-year-old son Montu went missing in 1977
Jahanara Begum’s son Montu was two years old when he went missing in 1977. “He learned to walk quickly and would bump into everything in his way,” she recalls. “Even the chickens in the courtyard would run from him.”
These are memories from decades ago that Jahanara clings to: they are the only proof she really has that her child even existed. He too disappeared after Jahanara left him in what she thought would be temporary care at a children’s home she believed was run by TDHn. “For a long time, I was worried I might forget the little things. So I would talk about him to anyone that would listen.”
Nur Jahan’s son Bilal was taken when he was only six months old
For years, Jahanara wondered if it might have been better if her son had died. “Then I could mourn and find some sort of peace,” she says. “But when you don’t know where your child is, you desperately hold on to the idea that they could still be out there somewhere – and may perhaps return.”
Nur Jahan, 78, has no idea what her son Bilal looks like. The last time she saw him was in 1976, when he was just six months old; a small baby with big eyes and a dimpled cheek. “I would carry him around everywhere with me … but now he lives inside this photograph,” says Nur, holding up a photo of a group of Bangladeshi children arriving at Schiphol airport in Amsterdam in 1976; an air steward holds up a baby in a basket, and though the photo is not clear, Nur is convinced the baby is hers.
Nur Jahan has kept all the documents relating to her son Bilal; the photograph of Bangladeshi children at Schiphol airport in Amsterdam, one of whom she believes to be her son
Like the other mothers, Nur too claims she was visited by people claiming to work for TDHn. After handing her baby over for care, Nur was able to visit him the week after. “Everything seemed normal at first, I even saw other parents and children I recognised.” But a week later, she was not allowed in. “I started shouting. There was a broom nearby and I picked it up and threatened them with it,” recalls Nur. Two guards came out and aggressively pushed her away. She fell to the ground crying.
Nur would never see her baby again. Later, she filed a police report and approached local media for help but nothing came of it. “I still pray he comes back to me,” she says, tucking the photo away into a small cabinet. It’s one of the few possessions she owns, but certainly her most cherished.
A spokesperson for TDHn described the women’s stories as “heartbreaking”, but that “the underlying allegation of wrongdoing by Terre des Hommes Netherlands is therefore wholly incorrect. Terre des Hommes Netherlands did not run any school with boarding facilities. The suggestion that the children stayed at a Terre des Hommes-school or home therefore is wrong.”"
CKM6JY1EXR_FJ75IPZ7GXW48ZZ,Labor launches review into how justice system deals with sexual violence cases,Sarah Basford Canales,_,20230122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2024/jan/23/labor-launches-review-into-how-justice-system-deals-with-sexual-violence-cases,"A review into how the criminal justice system approaches sexual violence cases will take place over the next year as the federal government looks for ways to limit further trauma for victim-survivors.
The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, has appointed the former Victorian supreme court judge Marcia Neave and the South Australian district court judge Liesl Kudelka to lead the 12-month review to be undertaken by the Australia Law Reform Commission.
Dreyfus said the inquiry will examine how the experiences of victim-survivors in the justice system can be improved, such as through extra supports for victims.
“All too often, seeking justice adds to the trauma experienced by victims and survivors,” he said.
The review will look at training and development options for judges, police and legal practitioners to enable trauma-informed and culturally safe justice responses.
It is due to report back to the attorney general by 22 January 2025.

Supporting the new review is an expert advisory group made up of victims and survivors of sexual violence, as well as their advocates.
The social services minister, Amanda Rishworth, said it was critical victims and survivors were kept at the centre of the government’s response.
“We know one in five women in Australia has experienced sexual violence since the age of 15. We want to ensure they are not re-traumatised by [the] processes and systems in place they access when seeking justice,” Rishworth said.

At the weekend the federal government launched its new consent framework in an effort to offer more consistent messaging for young Australians.
The framework is underpinned by five key concepts, including that consent is voluntary and free, specific and informed, affirmative and communicated, ongoing and mutual, and reflects the capacity of individuals involved.
One in five women and one in 16 men have experienced sexual violence since the age of 15, with one in two women in their 20s having experienced sexual violence, according to the 2021-22 personal safety survey.
The review’s launch and the consent framework are part of the Albanese government’s national plan to end violence against women and children, which aims to end violence within one generation.
More than 60 women were violently killed in Australia last year, many at the hands of intimate partners.
There were 2,102 intimate partner homicides between 1989 and 2021, according to the Australian Institute of Criminology’s latest homicide in Australia report.
Three in four (1,589) of the victims were female.
In Australia, support is available at 1800Respect (1800 737 732). In the UK, Rape Crisis offers support on 0808 500 2222. In the US, Rainn offers support on 800-656-4673"
CMJZ151DB2_UNZKTEIW8HPCLV0,"Engraving on 2,000-year-old knife thought to be oldest runes in Denmark",Miranda Bryant,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/jan/22/engraving-on-2000-year-old-knife-thought-to-be-oldest-runes-in-denmark,"An engraving on an almost 2,000-year-old knife believed to be the oldest runes ever found in Denmark has been discovered by archaeologists.
The runic inscription – the alphabet of Denmark’s earliest written language – was etched into an 8cm iron knife found in a grave below an urn near the city of Odense on the island of Funen. The five characters, each about 0.5cm tall, followed by three grooves, spell out hirila, which means “little sword” in Old Norse.
Along with an inscribed bone comb found nearby in 1865, they are the oldest runes ever found in Denmark. Jakob Bonde, the city’s museum curator and archeologist who made the discovery, said he at first thought it was an ordinary knife, as the runes were not visible, but after it was cleaned by conservators it became clear that it contained a word.
“It’s like getting a note from beyond, from the past. It’s an extraordinary find for us and it says something about the development of the earliest Scandinavian language,” he said. “And for me personally it’s fantastic to have made this discovery.”
The inscription is believed to refer to the knife as opposed to the owner, about whom nothing is known other than that they were probably someone with high status in society.
Bonde said such people were highly influenced by Romans.
“We are in a period of time where we in Denmark had a lot of connection with the Romans and the ones who were high[ly] placed in society tried to look Roman, so to speak, by importing things and making a Roman display of themselves. Everything Roman was very in.”
The knife, which will go on display at Museum Odense in Møntergaarden from 2 February, will be shown alongside other artefacts found at the site.
It is believed to be 800 years older than the Jelling stones in Jutland, which include one erected by King Harald Bluetooth in about 965 in memory of his parents. The stone’s inscription, often referred to as “Denmark’s birth certificate”, describes Harald’s achievements and contains Scandinavia’s oldest image of Christ.
Lisbeth Imer, a runologist from the National Museum of Denmark, said the discovery could help to reveal more about Danish history.
“It is incredibly rare for us to find runes that are as old as those on this knife, and it offers a unique opportunity for us to gain more knowledge about Denmark’s earliest written language – and thereby about the language actually spoken during the iron age,” she said.
“During that period of history, proficiency in reading and writing was not particularly widespread, which means that to be able to read and write was connected to both special status and power.
“In the early days of runic history, those able to write constituted a small intellectual elite, and the first traces of such people is to be found on Funen.”"
CO2BKPCFXP_ZACELP7IP9J22AL,Murder Trial: The Killing of Dr Brenda Page review – all true-crime shows need this level of drama,Jack Seale,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/jan/24/trial-the-killing-of-dr-brenda-page-review-all-true-crime-shows-need-this-level-of-drama,"Nuance and subtlety? In a true-crime documentary? Murder Trial: The Killing of Dr Brenda Page shows it can be done. In a genre awash with lurid exploitation, this programme makes a convincing case for respectful diligence.
Brenda Page, a geneticist at the University of Aberdeen, was found bludgeoned to death in her flat in the city in July 1978. She was 32. The only suspect was her ex-husband, research scientist Christopher Harrisson, but at the time there was insufficient evidence to pursue him. The case was reopened in 2015, with the hope of utilising advances in DNA technology; Harrisson was duly charged, and his trial took place in February 2023.
Murder Trial simply follows those court proceedings. Of course, we visit the relevant locations, peruse archive reporting and see documents and photographs that played a part in the investigation. There are interviews with the prosecution and defence counsel, too, and with Page’s family. But those embellishments are kept to a minimum – we base ourselves inside the high court in Aberdeen.
In a compact grey room that no crime drama would ever choose as a setting, fixed cameras and basic lighting do nothing to make the judicial process more involving. Nor do the programmemakers try to reel us in by strategically timing when revelations hit us. There are only two episodes, so there’s none of the manipulation seen in so many Netflix true-crime documentaries, where a cliffhanger twist at the end of one instalment pulls us into the next. Murder Trial permits itself an opening flash-forward to Harrisson in the witness box, refusing to accept the prosecution’s characterisation of him as a Jekyll and Hyde figure. Apart from that, the chronology of the trial is the chronology of the programme. Its only other bow to sensationalism is the use of a camera aimed at the public gallery, where the emotions of Page’s nephew, wincing at every new piece of disturbing evidence, are intruded on perhaps a few times too many.
It takes time for a show as demurely presented as Murder Trial to reveal its worth. There are hints that it will be an instructive look at domestic abuse and how hard it can be to prove, and that it will examine how the media can obstruct the course of justice by focusing on supposedly salacious details, especially where the victim is a young woman. Although both issues are present, in the end this is something more prosaic, but no less engrossing for that.
The case proves to be one of circumstantial evidence, where every arrow points towards Harrisson, but without any one fact proving guilt on its own. In the back and forth between prosecution and defence as the crown presents its case, we experience the very essence of an adversarial justice system, as every accusation is dutifully tested, sometimes to destruction. Family members and acquaintances testify, for example, that Page said she was scared of and hurt by Harrisson during their marriage, and that he had expressed an intention to kill her following their divorce. Hearsay, says the defence.
More convincing are the written words of Page herself. She filed for divorce in 1976, citing a pattern of accusation, intimidation and aggression that we would now recognise as coercive control – and chillingly expressed a fear of what could come next. “If I do depart this earth rather suddenly,” she wrote, “do please make sure I get a good PM.” What do those initials stand for? Postmortem. The defence continues to do what it must, arguing that these are still mere accusations. We hang on every thrust and parry, thinking that surely the latest allegation will be the clincher, only to be confounded.
The biggest test comes with the evidence about the night before Page was found. It suggests Harrisson broke into her flat and lay in wait, raging with jealousy after following her to a hotel and seeing her dining with men from the oil industry. That she did this regularly, having signed up to work with an escort agency, was the aspect of her life that got the tabloids excited, but Murder Trial accords it no more attention than the legalities demand.
Now, though, we can enjoy one of the staples of a good true-crime documentary: a fascinatingly eccentric chief suspect. The climax is the cravatted, octogenarian academic Harrisson taking the stand, introduced by the prosecution with footage of a bizarre police interview in which, when asked to describe his temper, he replies: “Even. Like the snow in Good King Wenceslas.” As the accused tries to use calm articulacy to rebut incriminating DNA evidence, Murder Trial delivers the sort of drama that other crime documentaries have to manufacture.

CQ3XHGO2TE_M4UYOU06OUM7IQK,Tory donors deny funding poll for group working to oust Sunak,Rowena Mason,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/jan/26/tory-donors-poll-oust-sunak,"Conservative donors have been rushing to deny funding polling for a group working to oust Rishi Sunak, as David Frost was warned he could lose the whip if rival party backers were involved.
Senior Tory figures are scrambling to figure out the mystery donors behind the Conservative Britain Alliance, which funded a £40,000 poll, fronted by Lord Frost in the Telegraph, that predicted a Labour landslide.
Afterwards, Simon Clarke, a Conservative MP, publicly called for a change of leadership, and it has since emerged that a group of former Tory aides are suspected of working on a plot to replace the prime minister. One of them has been revealed as Will Dry, a former No 10 adviser, who devised the YouGov polling questions.
Donors close to Boris Johnson, including Anthony Bamford and Peter Cruddas, as well as a spokesperson for Paul Marshall, the hedge fund boss and political donor behind GB News, said they had no involvement in the polling and group behind it. An aide for Alexander Temerko, who this month gave £5,000 to Clarke, said he had no links to the polling or the Conservative Britain Alliance.
With No 10 taking the plot seriously, Frost was warned by Nicholas True, the Conservative whip in the Lords, that he could lose his party affiliation if the donors behind the Conservative Britain Alliance have given money to Nigel Farage’s Reform party.
Frost is believed to have said that he did not think Reform figures were involved but refused to give names of the donors behind the mysterious group.
There are several big donors who have given to Reform and the Conservatives who this would eliminate, including Jeremy Hosking, who also gives to Laurence Fox’s Reclaim. Hosking said he was not making any comment when asked if was involved in the Conservative Britain Alliance or the funding of the poll.
Other Tory and Reform donors include Christopher Harborne, who donated £1m to Boris Johnson’s office, and Terence Mordaunt, who gave to the leadership campaigns of Suella Braverman and Penny Mordaunt.
Meanwhile, senior government figures are concerned that aides working with the anti-Sunak rebels are attending meetings in parliament on visitors’ passes to avoid having to declare their funders.
At least two former political advisers have been seen at meetings with rebel MPs wearing visitors’ passes. These are meant to be used only by tourists visiting the parliamentary estate and not for work purposes.
One Tory source said: “The suspicion is they’re avoiding a pass so as not to declare their donors – who may be the same who are behind the David Frost polling.”
Another senior Conservative source said that during one rebel meeting, a Tory MP questioned what two aides were doing there. Parliamentary staff passes must be sponsored by a member of the Commons or Lords and those in possession of them must declare their interests and pass security vetting.
A rebel source said: “Anyone wondering why Sunak is 20 points behind in the polls should look no further than the fact those running No 10 are focused on this nonsense.”
Last week’s YouGov poll suggested the Tories were heading for a crushing election defeat, accompanied by an op-ed from Frost arguing that their only hope was to take a harder line on immigration.
A new Tory leader would be the fourth Conservative prime minister in 18 months. Boris Johnson departed in September 2022 and was briefly succeeded by Truss before Sunak took charge.
It prompted Labour’s national campaign coordinator, Pat McFadden, to say the Tories were forming “another circular firing squad”.
“There are many good reasons for getting rid of this clapped-out Conservative government, and liberating the British people from endless bouts of Tory infighting is certainly one of them,” he said."
CR02FBP0BK_OIYHJR41NRD54FE,Tories hire coordinator to get expat supporters to vote in general election,Pippa Crerar,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/jan/22/tories-hire-coordinator-to-get-expat-supporters-to-vote-in-general-election,"The Conservative party has hired an overseas voter registration coordinator to mobilise thousands of supporters who live abroad to vote in target seats the party needs to win at the next general election to stay in office.
The job description from party headquarters, seen by the Guardian but no longer online, said the role would focus on boosting the turnout of Tory expat voters in crucial electoral contests.
It suggests the operation would coordinate UK-based proxy voters to increase Tory support in the so-called 80:20 contests. These are 80 seats, including many of those in the red wall, that the party needs to retain and 20 it wants to win.
The ad, from last August, said the job included “managing the coordination of a UK-based proxy voter campaign focused on ensuring maximum turnout of Conservative supporters in key 80:20 contests”.
An extra 2.2 million overseas voters who have lived abroad for more than 15 years regained the right to vote in UK elections last Tuesday, after a statutory instrument that was approved by parliament in late December almost unnoticed came into force.
The expansion means they will be able to register in the constituency of the last address at which they were resident if they are able to provide relevant documentation, or failing that, through local records or on the word of an eligible British resident.
They will then be able to vote by proxy, with one proxy voter able to vote on behalf of as many as four overseas voters.
The Electoral Commission raised concerns in response to an earlier consultation in 2016 that voters “might be tempted to choose a marginal seat they had once lived in rather than a safe seat even if it had not been the last address they lived at before leaving”.
Concerns were also raised about the difficulty of checking information and the potential for fraud. The Association of Electoral Administrators noted it would be challenging to enforce penalties for supplying false information or falsely attesting to applications from people overseas.
Tory HQ has already stepped up extra support for the 80 seats, including surveys of local voters, profiling the makeup of constituencies, and money to fund campaigning and create literature such as bespoke newsletters.

Last week’s change means British expats will now have a “vote for life”, delivering on a Tory manifesto promise, regardless of how long they have lived overseas and whether they have used any services or paid any taxes in the UK in recent years.
The government has said the change represents the biggest increase of the franchise since full female suffrage in 1928.
The holder of the new role also organises engagement between UK politicians and expat voters, working with sister party organisations such as the Republicans in the US and collaborating with the network of Conservatives Abroad supporters.
From 1989 Britons who had lived abroad for up to 20 years were eligible to vote; then in 2001, Tony Blair’s Labour government introduced a new rule to end the right for those who had been overseas for more than 15 years. The Lib Dems stymied Tory efforts to expand the franchise again during the coalition years.
The change, which brings the UK into line with countries including the US, France, Italy and New Zealand, also means that overseas residents with more tenuous links to the UK can donate to British political parties.
A Tory spokesperson said: “As promised in the 2019 manifesto, the government is making it easier for British citizens living abroad to vote in parliamentary elections. Overseas voting is a mainstream democratic practice as seen in France, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and the United States.”
The change in voting rights is the legacy of the late Harry Shindler, who fought a battle of almost 20 years. He challenged the 15-year rule in the high court in 2016. When successive governments failed to deliver on their manifesto promises he brought the case to the European court of justice.
He remained sceptical but never gave up hope his campaign would finally bear fruit, and in March 2022 he declared his battle was “nearly over” when legislation was finally drafted. He lived to see it pass through parliament.
This article was amended on 26 January 2024. An earlier version said that all Britons who lived abroad were eligible to vote until 2001. In fact, before 1985 British citizens were unable to register to vote in UK elections if they moved abroad, unless they were service voters. From 1985 they were allowed to register as overseas voters for five years, and from 1989 to 2001 this allowance was extended to 20 years. This has been clarified."
CRAMU742RH_ELKNDGUUZJ8JPGT,How to spot a liar: 10 essential tells – from random laughter to copycat gestures,Zoe Williams,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/jan/24/how-to-spot-a-liar-10-essential-tells-from-random-laughter-to-copycat-gestures,"Twenty-two people in a castle, Claudia Winkleman hamming it up like crazy, a number of silly challenges, a chunk of money sitting at the centre, almost glowing, and human nature laid bare. To try to pick apart exactly what makes The Traitors so compelling would be to miss the point, like trying to analyse the ingredients in a Krispy Kreme doughnut.
As enjoyable as it is, though, the show gets more infuriating with each episode. I don’t want to point fingers, still less give spoilers, so let’s keep this broad: why are they (the Faithful) all so stupid? Why can’t they tell when they are being lied to? It’s so obvious!
I asked three experts how to spot a lie – and why most people can’t. First, Dr Linda Papadopoulos, a psychologist, author and broadcaster, whom people of a certain vintage may remember as the standout discovery of the first season of Big Brother. Reality TV was in its infancy, so watching ordinary people interact under a microscope was fascinating in itself, but Papadopoulos, the show’s resident psychologist, added an almost superhuman level of insight into the contestants’ feelings; she was like a mind-reader.
Second, Joe Navarro is the author of What Every Body Is Saying, insights into non-verbal cues and tells gleaned from his career as an FBI agent. Gabrielle Stewart, the third, is a retired insurance investigator who works as a fraud consultant for the industry.
This trio don’t always agree but, seriously, you wouldn’t want to lie to any of them. Here are their 10 tips for spotting a liar.
“The problem with the myth of detecting deception is that since the groundbreaking work of Paul Ekman [a psychologist whose visual test, Pictures of Facial Affect, was published in 1976] and all the researchers that came after him, we know that humans are no better than chance at detecting deception,” says Navarro.
But that doesn’t mean you can’t read anything into people’s expressions and behaviours. “What the human body does – and it does it exquisitely – is display psychological discomfort in real time,” he says. “King Charles – he’s always playing with his cufflinks. This is how he deals with social anxiety. Prince Harry – he’s always buttoning the button that’s already buttoned – another comforting behaviour.”
Facial touching is known as a pacifier – a way to soothe yourself under stress. “Right now, you are covering your suprasternal notch,” says Navarro as our video call starts. Protecting my neck, in other words, “which is because there’s a man right in front of you”. That makes me chortle, because I love men. But he is right in the sense that I have always keenly felt the jeopardy of the first few seconds of an interview – if you make a mess of that, the whole thing is ruined. So, there is the first principle: everything someone does with their hands and their face says something. Now, you have to figure out what.
Navarro recalls a search for a fugitive during his FBI days. Interviewing the man’s mother, he asked if she had seen her son. She said no and was plainly nervous, but there was no way to connect the anxiety to the answer; she could have been telling the truth and simply been unsettled by the appearance of two FBI agents on her doorstep.
He changed tack and asked if it was possible that her son was sneaking in to the house while she was at work. “She said: ‘No, that’s not possible at all,’” displaying a nervous tell – covering her neck, in this instance. “But there was no reason for that, right? All she had to say was: ‘I don’t know.’” So the non-verbal show of nerves combined with the illogical answer hinted at deception. Sure enough, the man was in the house.
Some striking non-verbal tells are rooted in archaic human self‑preservation. We cover our mouths when we see something shocking or horrible, because “it prevents the casting of our scent, which predators can pick up on,” Navarro says.
The problem is that the more obvious the gesture, the easier it is to plan for and mimic. So, every time they vote out an innocent player on The Traitors, all the Faithful cover their mouths in horror, but so do the Traitors. Big, set-piece events, where everyone is making the same face or gesture, probably won’t tell you very much.
Papadopoulos picks up on the space between the non-verbal and the verbal – the incongruity between words and gestures: “You’re nodding, but saying no.” Stewart listens for acoustic variance in speech, where pitch and tone change. Lying people will pad a story with elements of truth, which is probably smart, except that, when they come to the falsehoods, “they speed up and speak at a higher pitch”, says Stewart. “The voice is saying: ‘I’m in cognitive overload.’”
“The ability to actively listen, which is what psychologists do, is surprisingly rare. A lot of people are thinking of what they’re going to say next, rather than listening,” Papadopoulos says. We also forget how much of ourselves we bring to the interaction; if we are stressed or anxious, it’s harder to detect or decode stress in others.
Papadopoulos describes falling for a scam when she was in the middle of a family crisis: “I write about these things – I know my stuff – but, in that moment, I was duped. If I was on my game, that would have been much less likely. That’s the whole basis of psychology: we think through our emotions and that moderates the quality of our thinking.”
Don’t ignore the impact your tone is having on the conversation (memo to The Traitors’ Diane): “If you come across as accusatory, that affects how people react,” Navarro says. “I never did that, as it puts people on the defence and it begins to mask behaviours that I need to observe.” Don’t jump to conclusions, either. Classic ways to spot a liar – such as vagueness, or buying time, Papadopoulos says – might mean something completely different. “It might just mean they weren’t really listening,” she says. If you decide too quickly that you have uncovered deception, it gates off other possible explanations.
Stewart, who did her insurance investigation work by phone, says: “The structure of the account is key. You wouldn’t necessarily do this in person when you’re speaking to somebody, but any story will have a beginning, a middle and an end. It’s normally 30% buildup, 40% content, 30% afterthoughts and reflections. An untruthful account won’t stick to that structure, because they don’t really want to tell you that 40%. The most common structure of a lie will be 80% buildup, then they’ll tell you what happened really, really quickly, then they’ll want to get it over with.
“I would record an event using timelines and bullet points on landscape paper, then draw a line where I believe I’ve gone from beginning to middle to end. Almost every fraudulent account will have a very long beginning, bugger-all middle and bugger-all end.”
Memory-blamers are a flag: when something significant happens, it’s very unusual to forget it. Even if it has been misremembered or misperceived, there won’t be a big hole in the memory where that detail should be.
“We use completely different language when we’re telling lies,” says Stewart. “A really famous example is President Nixon. He was asked straight out: ‘Did you know about Watergate?’ and his answer was: ‘The president would do no such thing.’
“First, he’s got disociation, which is very common. In an untruthful account, there’s a lack of ‘I’ and ‘my’, because we want to push the lie away from ourselves. Then, he’s slipped tenses.” A truthful person whose car has been stolen, for example, will say: “I left it here, came back an hour later and it was gone.” An untruthful account might slip into the present continuous: “I’m walking down the path and I’m looking for my car, thinking …”
Stewart talks about “emotional leakage”. A liar might randomly start laughing, but it won’t sound like mirth. Time-filling sounds are common. “It’s an additional cognitive load, saying untruthful things,” she says. “It’s like patting your head and rubbing your stomach at the same time. So, they’ll be on high alert and they can’t bear silence. You’ll hear coughing, or strings of words that don’t need to be said.” Allied to this is non-committal language, or “linguistic hedging” – words such as “probably” and “possibly”. “They’re like disclaimers: ‘I don’t want to commit myself with this language.’”
In the 80s, my dad, who was a prison psychologist, devised some recruitment tests for the police that were designed to establish whether candidates were honest. One of the progressions was: “Are you married? Have you ever had an affair? Have you ever thought about having an affair?” If you answered yes to the first, it didn’t matter what you said to the second, as long as you didn’t answer no to the third, because everyone’s thought about it. To apply this to The Traitors, a player could ask of another: “Do you find Zack annoying?” If they say no, it doesn’t prove that they are a Traitor, but they are certainly the kind of person who lies.
Every one of these clues – verbal, non-verbal and in between – relies on something: the liar’s discomfort. Not everyone will feel discomfited by mendacity; some people will enjoy it. “We know that 1% of any given population – here in America it may be way more – are psychopaths,” says Navarro. “These people can lie all day long. There are structures in their prefrontal cortex that just don’t function.” Added to that, “4% of the population is antisocial; these are people who live by criminal activity”, he says. Even if they weren’t born to deceive, they will be habituated to it.
Many people have to lie for their jobs. Navarro mentions spies and doctors, but makes the broader point that we all use lying “as a tool of social survival”. Inevitably, some of us will end up quite good at it. But what are we trying to survive? We want to remain members of the group and we fear expulsion. In a culture where lying is prized – politics, The Traitors – the act of lying might make you come across as more confident, rather than less.
So, if you cross-referenced the verbal and non-verbal cues, then reverse-engineered the tests to become reasonably good at identifying an honest nervous person, you could figure out who was lying by a process of elimination; even if they were psychopathically good at it, that wouldn’t matter.
In The Traitors – and in life – what will undo you is letting yourself become certain on the basis of too little information or ambiguous evidence. “I looked at 261 DNA exonerations in the US,” Navarro says. “All the police officers thought that they could detect deception, but not one of them could detect the truth. In fact, none of the men were guilty.”

CT5OD0NSJS_OLS38R1S7GSV5Y5,Trump downplays Nikki Haley as rival in New Hampshire primary,Lauren Gambino,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/23/trump-haley-new-hampshire-primary-predictions,"Donald Trump turned up at a polling site in New Hampshire on Tuesday afternoon, insisted Nikki Haley wasn’t a threat to his campaign for the Republican nomination for president and predicted a “big loss” for his rival in the state.
“I think she’s worked very hard, but I couldn’t care less, if she drops out that’s fine,” said the former US president.
Turnout for the first primary contest in the nation ahead of the 2024 election was expected to be high, with the polls set to begin closing at 7pm local time.
The Make America Great Again (Maga) base of voters for Trump appear unswayed by his losing record after one term in the White House, four criminal cases underway against him and two civil cases.
Jessica Bastien, an undeclared voter in Derry, about 13 miles south-east of Manchester, New Hampshire, showed up to cast her ballot for Trump wearing a top with his mugshot and the words in upper case: NOT GUILTY.
In her view, each of the 91 felony counts Trump is facing in the four cases is baseless and she was hopeful he will ultimately be acquitted.
“I support his love for the country. His policies. His truthfulness and always sticking by what he says and protecting the US citizens first,” she said.
Asked what would happen if Trump becomes the Republican nominee but loses to the incumbent president and shoo-in for the Democratic nomination, Joe Biden, she said Biden was too weak to win and wouldn’t contemplate any other outcome. In the unlikely event Trump is dethroned in the primary, she is not sure what she would do in November.
“I think both parties are corrupted and have their ways of lying to us,” she said, adding that Trump’s movement doesn’t need the support of anti-Trump Republicans to win.
Trump is in the middle of defending himself in a defamation trial in New York, where he is expected to testify when court is due to resume on Thursday – having been delayed so far this week. The civil case is set to award damages against him after he denied, while he was president, having sexually assaulted New York writer E Jean Carroll in the 1990s. An earlier jury found him liable for the abuse.
He is also awaiting a ruling from the judge in another civil case in New York where the attorney general, Letitia James, sued him and his family business, the Trump Organization, for fraud and has argued for $370m in penalties.
Later, a few hours before polls closed in the Granite state, Mark Harris, a top strategist for a pro-Haley Super Pac, vowed to support her for as long as she was in the race.

Speaking from the lobby of the DoubleTree hotel in Manchester, an election day gathering spot for politicians and politicos, Harris predicted Haley would far exceed her goal of doing better than she did in the Iowa caucuses, when she finished third with 20% of the vote.
“We have a clear path to victory,” he said and pushed back on any suggestion that Haley would drop out before her home state primary in South Carolina next month. “We’re ready to fight that full fight with her,” he said.
On Monday night at a Haley event, a young man shouted to the former US ambassador to the United Nations, during the Trump administration, and ex-South Carolina governor: “Will you marry me?”
She shot back: “Will you vote for me?” He said no, he was voting for Trump.
“Get outta here,” she said."
CWGI2NBUTN_UJ3D88A8HDHG1KL,World first: malaria vaccine rollout begins in Cameroon,Kaamil Ahmed,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/jan/22/world-first-malaria-vaccine-rollout-begins-in-cameroon,"The rollout of the world’s first malaria vaccine began in Cameroon on Monday, which is said to be a “transformative chapter in Africa’s public health history”.
The RTS,S vaccine – 662,000 doses of it – will be administered to children in the west African country, the first to be vaccinated after successful trials of the drug in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi between 2019 and 2021.
It marks a scaling up of the fight against malaria in Africa, where 95% of deaths from the disease occur, most among children under five.
“We are not just witnessing but actively participating in a transformative chapter in Africa’s public health history,” said Dr Mohammed Abdulaziz, the division head at the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, headquartered in Ethiopia, at a joint online briefing with the World Health Organization. “For a long time we have been waiting for a day like this … it brings more than just hope, it brings a reduction in the mortality and morbidity associated with malaria.”
Public health experts say communication with the public will be crucial to the vaccine’s success – to ensure that it is trusted, that people bring their children back for all four doses, and that people understand it will be most effective when combined with other measures, such as sleeping under insecticide-treated bed nets.
“We need messaging, we need communication, and we need to use trusted voices,” said Abdulaziz. “We need to use health workers who are very close to the community. We need to listen to the community, to what they are saying and also monitor how we are being received.”
Kate O’Brien, the director of the WHO’s immunisations and vaccines department, said that based on the trial data, RTS,S – also known as Mosquirix – would saves tens of thousands of lives.
Another 19 African countries plan to introduce the vaccine this year, with hopes that 6.6 million children could be reached. Deliveries are due for Burkina Faso, Liberia, Niger and Sierra Leone.
Mbianke Livancliff, from the Cameroon nonprofit Value Health Africa, said there has been excitement in the country since the vaccines were delivered in November. The organisation has held community meetings and open discussions to introduce people to the vaccine and its approval process, to deal with people’s concerns and stave off any potential hesitancy.
“It has been an exciting moment. Families are excited, they are happy to have this major development and they are saying this is effective and this is what we have been waiting for,” Livancliff said.
In the Cameroon city of Douala, at the private Angels Clinic, six-month-old Nobah Adel screamed as she was scratched by the needle administering her first dose of the vaccine on Monday morning.
“Even if she cries, I’m very happy today,” said her mother, Dani Widal, who heard about the vaccine campaign a week ago. “I have three children and all are always sick with malaria. I hope that the vaccine will finally help her not to be sick like her brother and her sister.”
Widal had queued with her daughter for three hours to get the vaccine. “I live in a neighbourhood where there are a lot of mosquitoes. I spend more than 30,000 francs [£39] every three months because of malaria.”
Kamela Isabelle Madjouwou, a nurse at the centre, said a malaria vaccine was “essential”. Cameroon recorded more than 6m cases in 2022 and malaria accounted for 12% of deaths among children under five in 2021. “The vaccine will reduce mortality and the consequences of this terrible disease,” she said.
Thomas Breuer, the chief global health officer at GlaxoSmithKline, which produced the vaccine said it was a significant development: “After more than 35 years of dedicated work with our partners to develop the world’s first malaria vaccine, Mosquirix, it’s rewarding to see it in routine use for the first time. We’re excited that more malaria-endemic countries are preparing to introduce the vaccine over the coming months.”
A second malaria vaccine, R21/Matrix-M, produced by the University of Oxford, is due to be rolled out later this year."
CY7HWADG9C_WI9L1H8VNC1D0YY,Polish president says he has pardoned two jailed opposition politicians,Jon Henley,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/23/polish-president-pardons-two-jailed-populist-former-politicians,"Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda, said he had pardoned two jailed politicians from the opposition populist Law and Justice (PiS) party, which lost its majority in October elections, and called for their immediate release.
The former interior minister Mariusz Kamiński and his ex-deputy, Maciej Wąsik, were imprisoned this month after being detained in the presidential palace. Their arrests sparked large protests by PiS supporters and both began hunger strikes claiming to be “political prisoners”.
Originally convicted in 2015 for abuse of their authority while working at Poland’s Central Anticorruption Bureau nearly a decade earlier, the pair lost their appeals against the verdict last December and were sentenced to two years in prison.
Duda, who is closely aligned with the national-conservative PiS, originally pardoned them in 2015, allowing them to serve in the last government, but his decision was overturned by the supreme court on the grounds that it had been granted before a final appeal court ruling.
The president said soon after their imprisonment that he had started the process of pardoning them for a second time. “The decision regarding the pardon has been issued. Both men are pardoned,” he said in a statement on Tuesday.
“For me, they have always been pardoned, but taking into account the social unrest, I decided to initiate the new proceedings,” Duda added. “I appeal to the justice minister for the immediate release of both gentlemen from prison.”
Earlier on Tuesday the new justice minister, Adam Bodnar, who is also the prosecutor general, said the pair should not be pardoned, but his opinion is not binding on the president. Both were found guilty of masterminding a fake graft case to discredit a high-level rival politician.
PiS faces numerous accusations of subverting the rule of law, and Poland’s new prime minister, Donald Tusk, who has promised to restore EU democratic norms and unblock tens of billions of euros in EU funding over charges of democratic backsliding, is fighting an uphill battle to undo eight years of the party’s rule.
The new government’s early efforts to evict loyal nationalists from key roles and restore neutrality in the judiciary, media and other core state bodies have been criticised as illegal by leaders of the former government, with some Polish and international legal experts also expressing doubts.
The row over Kamiński and Wąsik highlights the judicial chaos in which Poland now finds itself, with PiS’s changes to the system – many of which have been ruled illegal by Polish and European judges – having resulted, in effect, in a dual legal regime.
Different courts – and sometimes even different chambers of the same court – have delivered contradictory rulings in the same cases.
Duda said his decision to pardon Kamiński and Wąsik for the second time was made out of concern for the health of the two jailed politicians, but also in response to the sentiment of a part of Polish society that supports PiS.
This article was amended on 24 January 2024. The headline of an earlier version said the two pardoned men were former politicians, rather than current politicians."
CZJGNIC6PE_EKR0IFX5WM3P2UD,First Thing: Alabama executes Kenneth Smith using untested nitrogen gas method,Clea Skopeliti,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/26/first-thing-alabama-executes-kenneth-smith-using-untested-nitrogen-gas-method,"Good morning.
Alabama has carried out the first execution of a death row inmate in the US using the untried method of nitrogen gas.
Kenneth Smith’s lawyers had argued the execution would violate constitutional protections against cruelty, but it went ahead and Smith, 58, was pronounced dead at 8.25pm on Thursday. It was the state’s second attempt at executing him. The execution lasted about 22 minutes.
Reporters present described Smith’s death as appearing to have been inhumane. Smith had warned that his case could introduce a new killing method: “I fear that it will be successful, and you will have a nitrogen system coming to your state very soon.” The execution was condemned by UN experts on arbitrary executions and torture, as well as Jewish clergy and community leaders.
Why did his first execution fail? In November 2022, Smith spent four hours strapped to a gurney while being punctured with needles that couldn’t find a vein to administer the lethal injection. He was later diagnosed with PTSD.
Why was he on death row? Smith was convicted of the 1988 murder-for-hire of a pastor’s wife, Elizabeth Sennett.
Israeli officials are preparing for an interim ruling from the UN’s top court on South Africa’s allegation that the war in Gaza constitutes genocide against the Palestinians.
The Hague-based body could order Israel to stop its war; but while the international court of justice’s (ICJ) rulings are unappealable, they are unenforceable. However, such an interim ruling from the ICJ could serve as a pretext for international sanctions against Israel, experts say.
The decision expected on Friday is just an interim ruling on South Africa’s request for emergency measures to protect Palestinians from potential violations of the genocide convention – the full ruling is likely to take years.
What are South Africa’s allegations? Israel’s campaign has led to the “destruction of Palestinian life” and pushed people toward famine.
What is Israel arguing? That it has a right to defend itself after the 7 October attack that killed 1,400 people, and that it is targeting Hamas, not Palestinian people as a whole.
The ruling is expected at 1pm (7am EST) – follow on our live blog.
Fears that anti-Nato Donald Trump could be reelected and that Russia may win in Ukraine are causing a wave of anxiety to ripple across Europe, with Nato’s military committee chair warning it was “not a given that we are in peace”.
The tension comes amid growing hostilities in the Middle East. Grant Shapps, the British defence secretary, said the UK and its allies were moving towards “a prewar world” and re-armament was needed to shield Europe from “Putin’s fury”.
It comes as US Congress appears unlikely to vote through a new $61bn military aid package for Ukraine. Without US aid, experts fear Russia could gain the upper hand, while Trump increasingly appears set to win the Republican nomination.
Who else is worried? Germany, Norway, and Sweden have made similar warnings about the military situation in Europe. Countries including Latvia and Sweden have been bringing back forms of military service.
Thousands of people across Australia attended Invasion Day events on Friday, where speakers called for Australia Day to be abolished. The rallies come months after Australia voted overwhelmingly against an Indigenous voice to parliament. Police arrested six neo-Nazis wearing balaclavas and waving Australian flags in Sydney.
The US swimmer Lia Thomas, the first transgender athlete to win a NCAA college title, is launching legal action as she hopes to compete again. In 2022, World Aquatics introduced new rules banning anyone who has undergone “any part of male puberty” from competing in the female category, whereas before trans women could race if they lowered their testosterone levels.
The UK foreign secretary, David Cameron, has U-turned to rule out the resettlement of Chagos Islanders, only months after his predecessor was discussing their potential return. Chagossians, whom the British government forcibly displaced in the 1960s and 70s, strongly criticised Cameron’s intervention.
Ingenuity, Nasa’s 4lb chopper on Mars, has completed its final mission after three years – but the helicopter, which was intended as a short-term tech demo, hugely “surpassed expectations” to travel 11 miles, 14 times further than expected. Ingenuity proved powered flight was doable in Mars’s atmosphere.
While in Bangladesh on behalf of an organisation aiming to reunite children adopted abroad with their birth relatives, Kana Verheul met a woman in a cafe from the area in which she was born. With some matching details, they compared similar birth marks: two weeks later, a DNA test confirmed they were sisters. Then Verheul heard about the shocking story of how she was adopted.
In a move hailed as “monumental” by activists, the White House has said it is pausing all pending export permits for liquified natural gas (LNG) until the Department of Energy presents updated approval criteria considering climate impacts. The pause is significant; one analysis found that if all proposed export projects are green lit, they will create 3.2bn tons of greenhouse gases – equivalent to the entire emissions of the European Union.

CZRCD5RRIY_KKKTDDH40YW04XB,"Oscars nominations 2024: Oppenheimer eclipses Scorsese, Poor Things – and Barbie",Catherine Shoard,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/jan/23/oscars-2024-nominations-oppenheimer-barbie-poor-things,"Christopher Nolan looks set to secure his first ever Oscar at next month’s ceremony after his latest film, Oppenheimer, was revealed as the movie with the most nominations.
A biopic of Robert Oppenheimer, the scientist behind the atomic bomb, the film is shortlisted in 13 categories, including best film, director and adapted screenplay. Stars Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr and Emily Blunt are also in contention for awards. This tally means it has the most nominations garnered by a single film since 2018’s The Shape of Water, which went on to win four, including best picture and director.
Nolan, who has previously been nominated for five Oscars, is also frontrunner at next month’s Bafta awards – where he has likewise always come away empty-handed.
Meanwhile, Martin Scorsese secures a 10th best director nomination for true crime epic Killers of the Flower Moon. Following their snubs at the Bafta nominations last week, stars Lily Gladstone and Robert De Niro were revealed to be in the running for Oscars – although Leonardo DiCaprio has been shut out.
Gladstone’s inclusion makes her the first Native American actor to ever be up for the award and reignites the race between her and Poor Things star Emma Stone, who also won a best actress Golden Globe earlier this month.
Poor Things performed better than expected at Tuesday’s nominations, securing surprise nods for Mark Ruffalo as best supporting actor and Yorgos Lanthimos for best director. Lanthimos will now compete against Nolan, Scorsese, The Zone of Interest’s Jonathan Glazer and Justine Triet’s Anatomy of a Fall.
Triet, who won the Palme d’Or at Cannes last year for her courtroom thriller, is therefore the only female director in the category, with Barbie’s Greta Gerwig and Past Lives’s Celine Song both shut out.
Barbie instead had to make do with eight nominations, including adapted screenplay, supporting actor for Ryan Gosling, two separate entries for best song and a surprise supporting actress nod for America Ferrera.
Yet Barbie and Past Lives are nominated alongside Anatomy of a Fall in the 10-strong best picture shortlist, as well as Oppenheimer, Killers of the Flower Moon, Past Lives, and alongside American Fiction, The Holdovers, Maestro and The Zone of Interest.
Glazer’s film, a radically experimental look at the domestic lives of Helga and Rudolph Höss just outside the walls of Auschwitz, where he was camp commander, is now in the running for five Oscars, including best international film.
Shot in Poland in the German language, The Zone of Interest is the first British film in 24 years to be in contention in the category (when Paul Morrison’s Welsh-language Solomon and Gaenor was nominated).
Its star, Sandra Hüller, was not named in the supporting actress shortlist, but her work on Anatomy of a Fall means she will compete against Stone, Gladstone, Annette Bening (for Nyad) and Carey Mulligan (for Maestro) for leading actress.
Maestro, Bradley Cooper’s take on the personal and professional dramas of Leonard Bernstein, scored recognition in seven categories, including sound and makeup and hair, while Cooper himself is up for original screenplay and best actor.
Colman Domingo (for Rustin) and Jeffrey Wright (for American Fiction) were popular surprise inclusions in that race, although it is widely predicted to be a straight fight between Murphy and Paul Giamatti, who plays a curmudgeonly teacher in The Holdovers.
Alexander Payne’s comedy – one of four comedies on the best picture shortlist, the most since 2013 – missed out for best director, but is a strong contender for original screenplay and almost a certainty for supporting actress. Da’Vine Joy Randolph has won every previous award going for her performance in the film, but there were some surprises among her competition.
As with Barbie’s Ferrera, Jodie Foster was an unexpected inclusion; the quintet was rounded out by Danielle Brooks – the sole representative from The Color Purple after Fantasia Barrino was overlooked for leading actress. Foster and Rustin’s Domingo are both out LGBTQ and play LGBTQ characters – this is the first time that has happened twice on the Oscars shortlist.
Meanwhile, Wright and Sterling K Brown’s nominations for American Fiction mark another first: Black lead and supporting actors being nominated for the same film.
There was disappointment for acclaimed British romance All of Us Strangers, which came away with no nominations, meaning snubs for writer-director Andrew Haigh and stars Andrew Scott, Paul Mescal, Claire Foy and Jamie Bell. Michael Mann’s Ferrari also stalled, with stars Adam Driver and Penélope Cruz among those cold-shouldered.
Similarly ignored was Emerald Fennell’s much-watched and discussed Saltburn, with supporting actress Rosamund Pike and leading actor Barry Keoghan the most glaring omissions from the nominations.
Past Lives would have also hoped for recognition beyond its best picture and original screenplay nominations, with stars Greta Lee and Teo Yoo also ignored alongside director Song.
The Oscars are voted for by almost 11,000 voters of industry professionals from 93 countries. This year’s ceremony will take place in Hollywood on 10 March, in a ceremony hosted by Jimmy Kimmel."
D11F5N8KW5_09O3EQNKAH1WKXL,Rise in measles cases prompts vaccination campaign in England,Nicola Davis,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/jan/22/rise-in-measles-cases-prompts-vaccination-campaign-in-england,"A national campaign to boost uptake of a vaccine that protects against measles has been launched in England after a rise in cases of the potentially deadly disease.
Measles outbreaks have occurred around the country, including in London, with the West Midlands experiencing cases at their highest level since the mid-1990s.
The situation has led the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) to declare a national incident, with health experts warning further outbreaks could occur in other towns and cities unless uptake of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine increases in areas at risk.
Figures from NHS England suggest more than 3.4 million children under the age of 16 years are unprotected against this trio of serious, and preventable, diseases.
The new campaign will encourage parents and carers of children aged from six to 11 to make an appointment with their child’s GP practice so they can receive missed MMR vaccinations, and just over a million people aged 11 to 25 in London and the West Midlands will also be encouraged to catch up on missed jabs.
“People who are unvaccinated can get catch-up jabs at MMR pop-ups in schools and other convenient places, while GPs, teachers and trusted community leaders are encouraging groups that are less likely to get their jab to come forward,” said Steve Russell, NHS England’s director of vaccinations and screening.
“All this builds on the national MMR catch-up campaign the NHS rolled out at the beginning of winter, with text, email and letter reminders sent out to parents and guardians of children up to five who have yet to get full protection.”
Measles is a highly infectious virus that can cause serious illness and even death in children and adults. If measles is caught during pregnancy it can lead to stillbirth, miscarriage and low birth weight.
While there is no specific treatment for measles, it can be prevented.
Experts have stressed the MMR vaccine is not only safe but highly effective, with about 99% of people protected against measles after two doses.
MMR jabs are given twice, typically at the age of one and subsequently at three years and four months. Protection against measles after two doses is lifelong.

Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters
after newsletter promotion
In 2016 the UK was declared measles-free. However, that status has since been lost.
NHS data has revealed a decline in uptake of the MMR vaccine in recent years, with figures for 2022-23 showing only 84.5% of children in England had received the second MMR vaccine dose by five years of age.
However, there is considerable variation in uptake around the country, with figures as low as 74% in London, compared with 90% in the south-west.
Uptake matters for individuals and the wider community: vaccination rates of 95% would stop measles spreading completely, protecting those unable to be vaccinated, such as young babies.
It is not the first time concerns have been raised about MMR uptake. Andrew Wakefield’s now comprehensively debunked 1998 claim that the MMR jab is linked to autism led to a decline in vaccinations that left a generation of young people at increased risk of measles, mumps and rubella.
The current decline in uptake is thought to be down to a number of factors, including the influence of vaccine misinformation, some parents erroneously not considering measles to be serious, people experiencing difficulties accessing appointments, and the impact of the Covid pandemic.
The UKHSA consultant medical epidemiologist Dr Gayatri Amirthalingam said the continuing downward trend in the uptake of routine childhood vaccinations was a serious concern.
“The diseases that these vaccines protect against, such as measles, can be life-changing and even deadly. No parent wants this for their child, especially when these diseases are easily preventable,” she said.
Prof Helen Bedford of UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health welcomed the campaign.
“By targeting six- to 11-year-olds they will be targeting the age group where we are seeing most cases. In addition, 11- to 25-year-olds in areas with low uptake where we are seeing the outbreaks will also be targeted,” she said.
But, Bedford added: “It is also important to remind parents of  all children, older teenagers and young adults that they too should and can be vaccinated.”"
D2RIVTREI2_G7R2XNO9NBA1NY6,Twenty-four soldiers killed in deadliest day for Israeli forces of Gaza war,Jason Burke,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/23/deadliest-day-for-israeli-forces-gaza-war,"Twenty-four Israeli soldiers were killed in Gaza on Monday, by far the biggest single-day Israeli death toll in the three-month war against Hamas, as talks about a ceasefire intensified and Palestinian casualties continued to climb.
The deaths came amid fierce fighting around the southern city of Khan Younis, with dozens of Palestinians killed and wounded. The Israeli casualties are likely to increase domestic pressure on Benjamin Netanyahu over his leadership and handling of the war effort.
An Israeli military spokesperson said 21 soldiers were killed in Maghazi refugee camp in central Gaza when two buildings they had mined for demolition collapsed after militants fired grenades at a nearby tank. Reports in local media said explosives set by the soldiers detonated prematurely.
Earlier, the military said three soldiers were killed in a separate attack in southern Gaza. A total of 221 soldiers have been killed in the offensive, which some analysts in Israel have said could continue for many months, even into next year.
The high toll of Israeli troops in fighting comes at a time when Israel is beginning to see stirrings of discontent with Netanyahu’s war strategy, which aims to “crush” Hamas but which has not involved detailed discussion of what would come next for Gaza.
Israel’s forces have encircled Khan Younis, where it believes Hamas leaders are sheltering in tunnels. The recent Israeli advances have taken them close to areas sheltering a million or more Palestinians forced out of other parts of the territory by fighting or the destruction of their homes and all essential infrastructure.
Aid officials say Israeli blockades and the storming of hospitals in Khan Younis in the last 48 hours have left the wounded and dead beyond the reach of rescuers. The dead were being buried inside the grounds of Khan Younis’s main Nasser hospital because it was unsafe to leave to reach the cemetery. Footage filmed by the Palestinian journalist Hamdan El-Dahdouh showed persistent gunfire hitting the top of the main building.
At the European hospital in southern Khan Younis, a resident brought in five corpses, piled on a mattress on a donkey cart, Reuters reported. “I found them face-down in the street,” Ahed Masmah said.
Israeli officials say Hamas fighters operate in and around medical facilities, making them legitimate targets. Hospital staff and Hamas deny this.
The Israeli offensive began after Hamas’s attacks into Israel on 7 October, when the group killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted about 240 hostages. About half of these remain in Gaza, and dozens are thought to have died there.
At least 25,295 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been confirmed killed in the Israeli offensive, according to Palestinian authorities, and thousands more dead are thought to remain unidentified in the rubble. Almost 200 Palestinians were killed in the space of 24 hours, Palestinian officials said.
Egypt and Qatar, which have brokered past agreements between Israel and Hamas, have been developing a proposal involving a series of phased ceasefires and releases. White House spokesman John Kirby on Tuesday said US Middle East envoy Brett McGurk was in Cairo for “active” discussions on securing the release of Israeli hostages and a humanitarian pause in the fighting, which he said the Biden administration would back.
A total of 110 Israelis and other nationals were freed in return for 240 Palestinian women and children held in Israeli prisons as part of a week-long truce at the end of November. Several attempts at a ceasefire since have failed.
On Sunday, Netanyahu rejected Hamas’s conditions for ending the war and releasing the hostages, which included the Islamist group retaining control of Gaza and Israel withdrawing completely. In response, a Hamas official in Qatar said Netanyahu’s refusal to end the military offensive in Gaza meant there was “no chance for the return of the captives”.
A senior Egyptian official said Israel had proposed a two-month ceasefire in which the hostages would be freed in exchange for the release of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel, and senior Hamas leaders in Gaza would be allowed to relocate to other countries.
The official, who was not authorised to brief media and spoke on condition of anonymity, said Hamas had rejected the proposal.
Asked about media reports that a ceasefire deal was being discussed, an Israeli government spokesperson, Eylon Levy, said the war’s goals were unchanged.
“The destruction of Hamas’s governing and military capabilities in the Gaza Strip and the return of all the hostages,” he said. “There will be no ceasefire that leaves the hostages in Gaza and Hamas in power.”
Support for the war remains high among Israelis, but opinion polls show support has cratered for Netanyahu and his far-right coalition. Weekly Saturday night rallies demanding the release of hostages still held in Gaza have been supplemented in recent weeks by growing calls for elections.
Humanitarian officials made new appeals for further aid to be allowed to reach Gaza.
“The situation in Gaza is of course slipping every day into a much more catastrophic situation,” Abeer Etefa, the World Food Programme’s senior Middle East spokesperson, told a press briefing.
“I think the risk of having pockets of famine in Gaza is very much still there.”
The conflict in Gaza has been accompanied by an escalation in violence elsewhere in the Middle East, especially where armed groups allied to Iran operate, including Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen."
D51Y3IQ7AI_TU82W2TRYRS8WR8,Christopher Eccleston says A-lister falsely accused him of ‘copping a feel’,Nadia Khomami,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/jan/23/christopher-eccleston-says-a-lister-falsely-accused-him-of-copping-a-feel,"The actor Christopher Eccleston has claimed an A-lister falsely accused him of inappropriately touching her while filming a sex scene.
The star of Doctor Who and True Detective said he feared the accusation from the unnamed actor could have caused the end of his career.
“I did a sex scene with an A-list actress – not Nicole Kidman, who was brilliant – and she implied, in front of the crew, that I was copping a feel because she didn’t like me,” Eccleston, 59, told the Independent (the actor starred alongside Kidman in the 2001 film the Others).
“I’ve never felt more betrayed by a fellow actor than I did that day. I have to say to you that I would sooner have put my hands in a food blender than copped a feel of that person.”
Eccleston said he believed the incident would not have happened if there was an intimacy coordinator on set (a professional who choreographs intimate scenes) and called the accusation an “abuse of power” by his co-star.
He added: “I could have been accused of all manner of things … that’s about what passes between actors, with trust and the abuse of it.”
He said he was “fortunate that happened to me before the Harvey Weinstein stuff came to light, so I wasn’t put in the stocks for it”.
Eccleston stars alongside Jodie Foster in the highly anticipated new season of True Detective. He called Foster “a heroine of mine for many years” and said he had “never have taken such a small role if it wasn’t” for the actor.
The pair worked with an intimacy coordinator on the show, which Eccleston called “a wonderful innovation in the industry. Not just because it protects people, but to creatively decide how a scene should be played.
“If I were a writer, that would be very important to me – because the way people have sex is how they communicate.”

Eccleston said he and Foster discussed “how we’d gone through the mill with sex scenes in the past, when you just had to fend for yourself”.
He said over the years he had come to realise he is more vulnerable than he once thought. “As a bloke, as a young man, you walk on to the set and see the majority of people in the crew are male. Then there’s a beautiful woman who’s naked. So unless you are a complete arsehole, you just continually ask her: “Are you comfortable? Is there anything I can do?”
But the intimacy coordinator told him she was there to protect him too, he said. “I’d not thought about that. You don’t think that maybe somebody’s copping a look at you. You just don’t, not from a working-class northern British background. I was born in 64, when men were really not the objects of desire as far as I knew.”"

DCWJ8UYPPZ_MNX7QLSQ1029Q1L,Rob Peace review – Chiwetel Ejiofor’s moving fact-based tragedy,Benjamin Lee,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/jan/23/rob-peace-chiwetel-ejiofor-sundance-film-festival,"How do you tell the story of Rob Peace? He was an exceptionally smart Black kid living in New Jersey, the product of a hard-working mother and a father who was convicted of murder when he was seven. His intellect and interest in science took him all the way to Yale on a scholarship, but circumstance took him back home and to a period of dealing drugs, a bright star crashing to earth, shot to death at the age of 30.
It’s a horrible, haunting tale, told by his old roommate Jeff Hobbs in the book The Short and Tragic Life of Robert Peace, and now adapted to the big screen by Chiwetel Ejiofor, in his sophomore feature as director. Trying to find a way to sensitively bring it to life, to weave a way through a maze of assumptions and cliches, is an unenviable trek. And while Rob Peace, premiering at Sundance, isn’t without missteps, it’s a film made with enough tact and empathy to offset alarm, a robust follow-up to Ejiofor’s debut, the moving Malawi-set drama The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind. Like that film, it’s earnestly told and full of big emotion, sometimes to a fault, and further legitimises Ejiofor as a dedicated director with a sweeping commercial eye. The film might be for sale at the festival, but it comes with what seems to be a substantive budget and some small roles for big names – Mary J Blige as Peace’s mother, Camila Cabello as his girlfriend, Ejiofor himself as his father – and with an enthused and reactive premiere in the bag, it surely won’t be on the shelf for long.
While pre-publicity might have focused on those juicier names, it’s the relative newcomer Jay Will as Rob, in one of the festival’s most indelible star-making turns, who should have everyone talking after. He’s a total knockout, brightening every room he enters, easily convincing us of the buoyant charm that those around him were so spellbound by. Rob is shown to be intimidatingly intelligent, using science to make sense of the senseless world around him, as well as an enduring, often naive, optimist. He carried the weight of his father’s sentence on his shoulders, trying to find ways, and funds, to prove his innocence while working his way through a college that already demanded so much from him. Will shows us how he manoeuvred through these trials, knowing how to fit in without ever forgetting who he was, an astonishingly confident performance from someone who ably carries a difficult film on his untrained shoulders.
But as much as we, as audience members, might trust Will’s ability to guide us through, Ejiofor’s writing doesn’t often feel as confident of him. He scatters some mostly unnecessary bits of voiceover that frequently tell us either what we already know or what Will’s absorbing face can already convey. Other scraps of dialogue feel similarly extraneous or overstated, clumsily vocalising the film’s themes and Rob’s struggle in ways that feel inelegant, too much telling over showing. The script sees characters repeatedly reminding us of Rob’s innate goodness, something we already see not only in the raw facts of his story but again in Will’s unending charisma. Ejiofor is a mostly impressive director but he overcooks at times – the sun shining between an overscored, Nicholas Sparks-esque first kiss, some graceless sped up or slowed down scenes of action – and like with his writing, sometimes the direction could have benefited from a bit less blare and bit more subtlety.
Because for a lot of the film, he actually displays a knack for knowing when to pull back. Will’s time at Yale avoids an excess of conflict, with microaggressions shown in brief but effective bursts, and his final descent told plainly without exploitation, Ejiofor knowing by then that the story will tell itself without a heavy hand. While Blige is a little flat, Ejiofor makes for an effectively conflicted father, never becoming the bad dad cliche he could have been, wanting the best for his son while also demanding so much of him. Cabello is fine but underserved, the film far too busy to spend enough time on their romance, leaving a final stroke of emotion between the pair a little underpowered.
A finer movie would have seen a more delicate touch employed throughout but Rob Peace still avoids enough traps for it to land its final blow, Ejiofor tracing his downfall as the result of grander forces at play, the result of living in a country where true social mobility is close to impossible. Rob is turned from stereotype to person, thanks to Will’s incredible work and Ejiofor’s unwavering commitment to capturing a full life, supported by Rob’s mother off screen. It’s an involving yet troubling tribute.

DCYVNCTA1P_5FIQ4MO3H2RVOQ6,Why 2024 will be a crucial year for climate litigation,Dharna Noor,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/22/climate-change-cases-2024-lawsuits,"Amid record domestic oil and gas production in the US and broken promises from fossil fuel companies, climate champions are increasingly looking to the courts to bring about accountability for climate damage.
More than two dozen local and state governments are challenging oil companies on these grounds, while youth plaintiffs have seven pending lawsuits targeting state and federal lawmakers.
Last year brought landmark victories for these complaints, including a groundbreaking ruling in Montana that could force the state to alter its environmental policies. Supporters hope that pattern continues.
“We might look back and say 2024 is the year that climate lawsuits really took off,” said Richard Wiles, president of the Center for Climate Integrity, a non-profit that tracks and supports climate complaints.
But obstacles lie ahead. Last week the Biden administration filed a motion indicating it aims to have a major youth-led suit against the federal government dismissed.
Here are eight things to watch for this year.
In a stunning August 2023 win, a judge ruled in favor of young Montana residents who claimed the state’s pro-fossil fuel policies violated their right to a clean and healthy environment.
The order, which followed the first-ever youth-led constitutional climate trial, represented “the strongest decision on climate change ever issued by any court”, Michael Gerrard, founder of Columbia’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, told the Guardian at the time.
The state appealed the ruling to Montana’s supreme court, which said it would review the case. Arguments will be held in spring or early summer, with a final decision expected later in the year, according to Our Children’s Trust, the law firm that brought the suit.
The state’s attorneys called on the court to freeze the ruling in the meantime, which the court denied.
“For the time being, what this means is that the state agencies in Montana have to follow the ruling,” said Mat dos Santos, general counsel at Our Children’s Trust.
To comply with the order, the state will be expected to review its environmental policies, such as energy permitting processes, to ensure they account for climate damages, said Dos Santos. The decision also bodes well for a possible favorable final order from the court, Dos Santos added.
In Hawaii, a judge is set to hear a youth-led case in June.
The lawsuit claims that the state’s transportation agency failed to cooperate with other regulators to slash carbon pollution.
“This trial will give us keiki a voice to advocate for our rights and to protect our environment,” said Taliya N, one of the 14 young plaintiffs in the case, using a Hawaiian word for youths. Plaintiffs have begun to report for their depositions, which they claim have been unnecessarily aggressive.
Late last year, a judge cleared the path for a trial in Juliana v US, the first youth-led case against the federal government. The plaintiffs’ lawyers have asked for a trial date to be set for December.
However, the Biden administration has indicated it will attempt to get the case thrown out: on Thursday, the justice department asked a US circuit court to stay the case, pending a forthcoming executive petition from the White House.
That petition will argue that “the government will be irreparably harmed” if it is forced to spend time and resources litigating the Juliana case, the Thursday filing said.
It’s a move pulled “straight from the Trump playbook”, said Philip Gregory, a lawyer affiliated with Our Children’s Trust. The previous administration made similar arguments, unsuccessfully, on six different occasions.
Gregory said that Our Children’s Trust would ask the court to deny the justice department’s request for a stay, and called on supporters to urge the Department of Justice to refrain from using executive powers to block the case. The true “irreparable harm” is the climate harms children are facing, he said.
In December, Our Children’s Trust brought another federal lawsuit on behalf of a group of California youth. The suit, which targets the Environmental Protection Agency, will proceed toward discovery unless the agency files a bid to throw it out this spring.
Youth plaintiffs have pending litigation in Florida, Utah and Virginia, too. And Rogers said Our Children’s Trust will file “exciting” new complaints this year.
Last year delivered wins for the two dozen cases brought by states and municipalities against fossil fuel companies for allegedly deceiving the public about the dangers of global warming.
For years, defendants have insisted these lawsuits should be heard in federal courts instead of the state courts where they were filed, which are seen as more favorable to the plaintiffs. But in rulings issued in April, May and January, the US supreme court shot the companies down.
It was a major win from a judiciary that does not always champion climate efforts. (Environmentalists, for instance, are concerned that the supreme court will soon overturn a doctrine that helps agencies tackle the climate crisis.)
Defendants are attempting to dismiss the cases in other ways, including by claiming that federal policy preempts plaintiffs’ claims.
The plaintiffs face challenges – this month, a court ruled that Delaware must limit the scope of a climate deception lawsuit it filed in 2020. But Wiles said he is “very optimistic” overall.
None of the 20-plus ongoing climate deception cases are expected to go to trial this year, but some could enter the pre-trial discovery phase. During this process, plaintiffs’ lawyers can request information about oil companies’ attempts to sow climate doubt.
“Discovery is the second most important part of the trial other than the actual decision”, said Wiles. The information will likely remain private this year, but could be made public as the cases move closer to trial.
Three lawsuits brought by Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Honolulu, Hawaii, have already begun the process, and more could soon join that list.
State and local governments are expected to bring new suits against big oil, with new kinds of plaintiffs potentially entering the arena.
California’s Gavin Newsom became the first governor to sign onto a climate case last year, while the Makah Indian Tribe and the Shoalwater Bay Indian Tribe became the first tribal governments to do so.
Twenty of 26 climate deception lawsuits have been filed by the law firm Sher Edling. But new firms – some with little or no previous experience in climate litigation – have begun to file similar cases in jurisdictions ranging from Multnomah county, Oregon, to San Juan, Puerto Rico. That could indicate a tipping point for the wave of lawsuits, experts say, as it shows the suits are becoming commercially viable.
Cases will also likely go after new defendants. Last year’s Multnomah county complaint was the first to target the consulting firm McKinsey – a sign of a burgeoning focus on firms that are said to enable oil companies.
New legal theories are also gaining steam. In recent years, governments have alleged that fossil fuel companies have broken racketeering laws by conspiring to sow doubt about climate crisis. It’s an ambitious claim more plaintiffs will likely make, said Wiles.
Last year, the non-profit Public Citizen suggested companies could be tried for homicide – a legal theory that has yet to be tested.
“There’s so much more potential here,” said Wiles. “We’re still at the beginning stages of climate litigation, there’s so much more that’s still to come.
This year could bring big news in other kinds of climate litigation, too. A wave of suits are attempting to hold corporations such as Delta Airlines, Nike and Etsy accountable for greenwashing.
Other complaints are attempting to hold plastic producers accountable for environmental damages, in part due to climate impacts. Last year, the California attorney general Rob Bonta called for a comprehensive legal strategy to take on plastic pollution and launched an investigation into the fossil fuel and petrochemical companies that produce plastics.
“We could see a whole new flank of plastic cases,” said Wiles.
Companies are fighting back against climate advocates with their own suits. On Sunday, Exxon filed a lawsuit to block a vote on a climate resolution brought by Follow This, a Dutch green activist investor group.
Conservation groups are also continuing to target specific polluting initiatives, such as the massive oil drilling project in Alaska that the US approved last year.
Meanwhile, climate lawsuits abroad face major hinge points. This year, a Dutch court will consider an appeal of a ruling against Shell that for the first time in history required a private company to curb its greenhouse gas emissions. The suit was brought by the Dutch arm of advocacy organization Friends of the Earth, which on Friday also sued ING bank over accusations that it is fueling the climate crisis.
Canadian youth plaintiffs will amend a constitutional climate case against their national government at the request of a federal court which said a narrowed version could be legally viable. The European court of human rights is expected to rule on major challenges, including one brought by six Portuguese youth who allege that 33 nations have not enacted strong enough climate policy.
Last year, Senator Bernie Sanders and other Democratic lawmakers urged the Biden administration to file its own lawsuit against big oil, something Wiles said would be “historic” and “huge”.
The Department of Justice declined to comment on potential suits of this kind.
If Joe Biden takes that advice, he could win back the support of some climate voters and inspire action from other countries, said Wiles.
“It would be the biggest news in the world in climate litigation,” he said. “Hands down.”"
DG1O1IX50O_W5F1QGUDR1Z9WS9,"Winner review – snappy, I, Tonya-esque take on Reality Winner",Adrian Horton,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/jan/23/reality-winner-movie-review-susanna-fogel,"Reality Winner has the perfect name for a digital-era martyr – memorable and freighted, seems fake but isn’t, deeply ironic. Late-night shows had a field day in 2017 with that moniker, for a whistleblower who tried to expose the truth about Russian interference in the 2016 election and was made into a bogeyman by cable news and a meal by the Trump administration.
The name (and those late-night bits) is acknowledged a lot in Winner, the second film about her in less than a year (the other being HBO’s Reality, taking the other obvious title option). The film, directed by Susanna Fogel (Cat Person, Booksmart) from a screenplay by the essayist Kerry Howley, seems to relish saying what it assumes the audience is thinking. What the straight-up biopic would imply, Winner outright says – this a story about what happened when she leaked evidence that the government was lying to its citizens, Reality (Coda’s Emilia Jones) explains in voiceover in the introduction. “Yeah, they don’t like it when you do that.”
Such jazzy flourishes – fourth-wall breaks of cheeky voiceover confessionals, the subject building a snappy rapport with the audience – are now an expectation unto themselves, echoing the peppy blend of fact, interpretation and personality employed in such loose biopics as Molly’s Game and I, Tonya. As in those films, Reality is an infamous woman with more of a story to tell. Ironically enough, Winner’s forthrightness sometimes gets in the way of its ability to show it.
To be clear, Winner, which premiered at the Sundance film festival, is not a retread of Reality, the film adaptation of Tina Satter’s critically acclaimed play that dramatized the transcript of Winner’s grueling interrogation by the FBI in May 2017. That film, starring Sydney Sweeney, was a tense, effective thriller, underscoring law enforcement’s insidious ability to break a person down. Winner takes a wider view, barreling through definitive scenes of her life from childhood through her four-year prison sentence, explaining the how and why behind her political act that even she ruefully acknowledges didn’t make people care.
Which is running theme: Reality has always had hills to die on and battles to fight, she explains, encouraged by her father Ron (Zach Galifianakis), an aspiring author with a cynical political bent who was unemployed for most of her childhood. It was Ron who imparted the definitive lesson from the most definitive event of her youth, 9/11: violence could be avoided if people just understood each other. A bizarrely mature and whip-smart iconoclast even as a child, she starts teaching herself Arabic as a teenager in Texas – a fact later used in court to argue that she harbored terrorist sympathies – to the bafflement of her straight-arrow mother Billie (Connie Britton), a social worker, and her more normal sister Brittany (an underused Kathryn Newton).
The film zips through the necessary information with movie-crisp dialogue and loose, plucky narration presumably derived from the subject herself, whom Howley profiled for New York magazine in 2017. Targeted by the military for her preternatural language skills, Reality skips college and directly enlists in the US air force, where she learns Dari and Pashto and seeks a deployment to Afghanistan. Instead she ends up at Fort Meade, in Maryland, translating intercepted conversations between people – sometimes families with children – thousands of miles away, so that drone operators would know whom to target.
Winner’s narrative interludes effectively relay her mental distress. To offset the punishing guilt and the mishmash of terrible news in her head, she embarks on a relationship with a bartender, Andre (Danny Ramirez), and a grueling exercise routine. (One of the film’s great successes is Anastasia Magoutas’s costume design of Reality’s tomboyish anti-fashion fashion, which feels distinctly mid-2010s.) Eventually, she ends up as a private contractor for the National Security Agency. Even at 103 minutes, Winner feels brisk; we summarily learn her disillusionment, motivation for and the execution of her crime, which feels shockingly banal and, in context, completely understandable. Her treatment by the government, on the other hand, truly appalling.
Howley is a bewitching and darkly funny nonfiction writer, and her screenplay crackles with the type of conspiratorial asides and frank admissions of a friend; her rendering of Winner, coupled with Jones’s capable performance of an endearingly brusque bleeding heart, makes for a good companion. And yet it’s hard to shake the feeling that this story is a little too neat, a little too snazzily contorted into a conventionally unconventional biopic. While Reality’s relationship with her father and Andre are movingly rendered in short bursts, there’s a confusing thinness to Brittany and Billie. In the puzzle of the real Reality Winner, there are conspicuous missing pieces, more background to sketch in.
Still, as far as zeitgeisty nonfiction goes, Winner is one of the better ones, at once entertaining and illuminative. Reality Winner may have lost, unfairly, for far too long, but in this rendition, she ends up on top.

DHIHE8W6IQ_QND1OV9R6OBQ2PE,For generations Britain has taken peace for granted. But a belligerent Putin could change all that,Gaby Hinsliff,_,20240119,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/26/britain-peace-belligerent-putin-russia,"How long could you survive without your mobile phone? Not just for idle scrolling to fill a boring commute, but for the life you carry precariously around on it without even thinking. For managing your bank account, navigating an unfamiliar neighbourhood, connecting to the outside world; for a torch in the dark, for checking in with friends, and potentially also in the worst-case scenario for frantically trading information about the safest place to run.
If the old rule of thumb is that any society is only four missed meals from anarchy, then what would be the equivalent in hours of telecommunications blackout caused by a cyber-attack on mobile networks, a sudden catastrophic power outage, or even – given Taiwan is the world’s leading supplier of the tiny computer chips on which your smartphone possibly relies – a Chinese invasion of Taiwan? How thin, exactly, is the veneer of a civilised life?
Such questions might sound ridiculously overdramatic. But they are one way of thinking about resilience in the kind of barely imaginable crisis that startled citizens across Europe are suddenly being asked to prepare for, and not just by stocking up on battery-operated radios and torches. The Swedish government, which is about to join Nato, has just reintroduced a form of national service. Last week, the Dutch head of Nato’s military committee, Admiral Rob Bauer, warned of the possibility of a war with Russia within the next 20 years where “it is the whole of society which will get involved whether we like it or not”.
Later, Germany’s defence minister, Boris Pistorius, suggested it might be sooner: maybe five to eight years. By comparison, this week’s call from army chief Gen Sir Patrick Sanders, for “preparatory steps to enable placing our societies on a war footing” sounded positively modest. Although he warned civilians would have to volunteer for the frontline if Russia began invading Nato countries, at least he stopped short of calling for the reintroduction of conscription.
Perhaps some will hear in his words just another attempt to squeeze cash from the Treasury, or even some shadowy deep state plot to rescue flagging western economies with a war. But Sanders is a man with little to lose from speaking candidly, given his term as chief of the general staff is almost up, and the fact that his call to build a significantly bigger regular army clearly irritated Downing Street is all the more reason to take it seriously. He may be mistaken in raising the alarm about a war that might never happen but if so, he’s not alone.
What happened this week looks like a pan-European conversation until now held mainly behind closed doors spilling into the open, with consequences worth exploring not just for defence spending but potentially for everything from the green energy transition to manufacturing, food production and the regulation of social media platforms through which Russia has repeatedly tried to whip up extremist political sentiment and manipulate democratic elections.
But it is also, more broadly, about how Britons see themselves. Sanders has been quietly arguing for months that we are no longer a postwar country – one for which world wars are the stuff of history lessons and nostalgic Hollywood blockbusters – but a prewar one that should be braced for trouble ahead. What is pushing these fears to the fore across Europe now is the prospect of Donald Trump returning to the White House and pulling the plug on US military support for Ukraine, effectively handing victory to Vladimir Putin.
Can’t take Sanders seriously? Then listen to former Trump chief strategist Steve Bannon, telling ITV’s Peston show this week that his base “does not want one more penny” going to Kyiv’s war effort – no empty threat when Republicans last month blocked President Biden’s latest military aid package. Bannon suggested his old boss could cut a deal with Putin in 48 hours, abandoning eastern Ukraine to its grisly fate. And if that happened, no Baltic state could feel safe from Putin’s dreams of a resurrected Russian empire.
As the former Downing Street national security adviser Kim Darroch points out, a Putin victory in Ukraine would not necessarily mean tanks rolling immediately into neighbouring Nato countries. But it might start with the systematic destabilisation of countries such as Latvia and Estonia, which have sizeable Russian-minority populations, with Moscow funding and fuelling separatist movements to create a fake pretext for invading and “rescuing” them.
Nobody is really sure whether a politician as chaotic as Donald Trump would stand by the US’s commitments to its Nato allies, if a show of force were needed to deter a full invasion, or not. But would you bet lives on him doing the right thing? Or would you plan for a scenario everyone hopes can still be avoided, sending a public message both to Moscow and to potentially hostile powers from China to Iran that might want to take advantage of a newly fragile world order, that Europe is prepared to stand up for itself with precious little help from across the Atlantic? For anyone used to seeing the US as an aggressive imperial power, forever trying to drag a reluctant Britain into its ill-advised wars, it’s a big mental leap to see US withdrawal from the battlefield as anything but a relief. But the chaos and betrayal of the 2021 retreat from Kabul was an early warning sign of the suffering an abruptly retreating superpower can leave in its wake.
Adopting a prewar mindset in this context almost certainly means spending more on defence than a Labour government inheriting crippled public finances would find comfortable. But it also strengthens the case for things Britain frankly should be doing anyway, from putting rocket boosters under the transition to renewable energy – why be any more vulnerable to oil price shocks than necessary? – to cleaning up social media platforms riddled with bad actors and systematic political disinformation. A prewar mindset wouldn’t let the British steel industry die, given steel’s critical role in defence manufacturing, or indulge the kind of pointless political infighting and kneejerk anti-European sentiment to which this government is prone.
What Sanders describes may seem an implausibly big ask of a squabbling country that currently seems incapable of facing down some light resistance to housebuilding in Surrey, never mind mobilising for war in Europe. But if nothing else, we should take from his words a warning not to get complacent, and the more comforting message that preparing for the worst can be a means of ensuring it doesn’t happen. For what might a nation that suddenly sensed danger start to work for, more than anything else? Not war, but the peace we have too long taken for granted.

Appen employs 1 million skilled contractors who speak more than 235 languages and are based in 170 countries.

Appen’s employees work from home to manually review the content to train the AI that makes it easier for the public to search, or use voice recognition technologies such as Google Assistant.
The company said its revenue from Google was US$82.8m (A$125m) in the 2023 financial year.
“The news is unexpected and disappointing, particularly considering the progress made against Appen’s transformation and performance in November and December 2023,” the company said, adding it was focused on cost management, business turnaround and delivery of “high-quality AI data for its customers”.
The company’s share price dropped 40% off the back of the announcement.
A spokesperson for Google said the decision to end the contract “was made as part of our ongoing effort to evaluate and adjust many of our supplier partnerships across Alphabet to ensure our vendor operations are as efficient as possible”.

The quality rating work undertaken by Appen contractors will be transitioned to new suppliers, Google said, indicating Appen is one of dozens of contractors affected by the company’s review to find savings and efficiencies in its processes across the board – not just AI work.
However, the union representing Google employees in the United States, the Alphabet Workers’ Union, said since Google accounts for one-third of Appen’s business revenues, the move would have a “devastating impact” on subcontracted workers, and was a wake-up call for tech sector employees on the impact of AI on working people.
“As subcontractors for Google we have been a canary in the AI coalmine calling out the precarious labor conditions we face being the human workers standing between large language models and their end users,” said Toni Allen, the executive board secretary of Alphabet Workers Union-Communications Workers of America.

“This is what AI work looks like when workers have no say in the process. It is time that the world heard our voices before this situation repeats itself far and wide,” said Toni Allen, executive board secretary and member of AWU-CWA.
A spokesperson for Appen said the company’s priorities would be adjusted as a result of the contract termination, and more details would be provided when the full year financial results were released on 27 February.
Wired reported in October that contractors for Appen, working to train AI systems for Google and other companies, were paid as low as 2.2 US cents for each task. One Colombia-based worker told Wired she was paid approximately $US280 a month, just below the minimum wage in Colombia of $US285.
The company reiterated previous statements that it ensured contractors are paid above the minimum wage of the location they are operating in, but rates varied depending on the project, difficulties or expertise required.
In 2021, a Black woman’s post about applying for a contractor role with the company went viral after the application asked her what her complexion was, from light to brown to black. The company at the time said the question was about gathering data from contractors to help improve the AI but removed the question from the application form."
DKSNEL9ETP_9NTJZZE9SDHDCV2,Labor MPs endorse changes to stage-three tax cuts,Paul Karp,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/24/stage-three-tax-cut-changes-endorsed-labor-albanese-government,"The Albanese government faces fierce opposition to its changes to stage-three tax cuts, which have been endorsed unanimously by Labor’s caucus, with the Coalition vowing to repeal them if elected.
The Liberal deputy leader, Sussan Ley, promised on Wednesday to “fight this legislation” in parliament and said it was “absolutely” the opposition’s position when asked if it would roll them back if returned to power at the next election.
The comments came ahead of the Labor caucus meeting to discuss the economic plan agreed at cabinet on Tuesday evening and the prime minister, Anthony Albanese’s speech to the National Press Club on Thursday defending the change in direction on income tax cuts.
Treasurer Jim Chalmers, speaking on ABC’s 7.30 program on Wednesday, claimed the government’s tax changes would be “superior to the tax reform that it replaces”, but downplayed prospects of any further cost of living relief – for instance, for pensioners or those who don’t pay tax – beyond the stage three changes.
“The proposal that the prime minister will put forward tomorrow means more help for more people, it means a tax cut for every taxpaying worker, and it will be better for middle Australia,” Chalmers said.
“We’ve changed our view because we’ve found a better way to provide more cost-of-living relief to more people in a way that doesn’t add to inflation.”

The Labor caucus meeting concluded in a bit over an hour and a quarter, with MPs voting unanimously to endorse the plan despite some questioning how the government should sell the changes and deal with accusations of breaching an election promise.
The meeting confirmed key details of the package including that low income earners will pay a new tax rate of 16%, down from 19%, and the government will retain the 37% tax rate, which will now apply from $135,000 to $190,000.
Together the changes are expected to provide a benefit of up to $800 to low income earners, and halve the benefit of stage three to those earning $200,000 or more from $9,000 to about $4,500.
Chalmers on 7.30 noted the Coalition’s opposition to the changes, pointing toward a fierce political fight where the government will accuse the opposition of prioritising high income earners.
“The deputy opposition leader [Ley] said that if they are elected, they will unwind these changes. That means the Liberals and Nationals are going to the election with a policy to increase taxes on middle Australia in order to fund even bigger tax cuts for people on the highest incomes,” he said.
Labor MPs including Julian Hill and Graham Perrett used doorstop interviews on the way in and out of the meeting to argue that the job is now for opposition leader, Peter Dutton, to defend why the Coalition supports taking tax cuts away from low and middle income voters.
One MP said the stage three revamp is the “moral” choice but “maybe not the correct political one”, although it’s not clear yet how the electorate will respond to breach of “repeated promises”.
Chalmers defended the change in stance on the stage three tax cuts by noting that in the five years since they were legislated by the Coalition government, developments such as the Covid pandemic and global conflicts had changed the economic circumstances. The treasurer said treasury analysis would also be released alongside Albanese’s speech, which he claimed would show that the tax changes would “be better for the economy as well.”
Earlier, shadow ministers targeted the Albanese government for breaking its election commitment and the long-term effect of bracket creep caused by retaining the 37% income tax bracket which was to be abolished by stage three.
But one former Liberal, the independent MP Russell Broadbent, said the new proposal “hasn’t gone far enough”.
“It’s a very good step in the right direction,” he said. “People like me don’t need a … tax cut, but I accept the Labor proposal.”
The Greens, who are likely partners to help pass the reform in the Senate, also continued to argue high income earners should not get cuts at all, but have reserved their position until they see the full proposal.
All taxpayers earning less than $150,000 will benefit from the Albanese government’s plan, including workers earning less than $45,000 who were slated to miss out on stage-three cuts. Caucus was told 84% of Australians will be better off.
The Liberal Senate leader, and former finance minister, Simon Birmingham, said the proposal to retain the 37% tax rate “will see bracket creep remain in place as a tool of government budget policy in Australia”.
“Our government previously and this legislation tried to eliminate bracket creep for the vast majority of working Australians,” he told Radio National.
Birmingham argued that without addressing bracket creep, all Labor’s reforms “will be doing is possibly giving some people a little bit more today, but many of those people will be pushed up into those higher tax brackets tomorrow and in the years ahead”.
“It could be dressed up as a short-term giveaway, but it will come with long-term consequences of a government relying on even more income tax.”
On Wednesday Albanese sought to justify the change in policy by noting the “considerable events” that had occurred since the tax cuts were passed in mid-2019.
“My job isn’t to say I’ll just wring my hands about cost of living pressures that people are feeling,” he told reporters in Canberra. “My job is to respond … to make a difference, to make the right decision, not the easy decision.”
Albanese said his “opponents have not waited to see any detail to see what the proposal is … they’re just against it”.
He argued the Coalition was against “everything” Labor had done to improve cost of living including cheaper childcare and energy price relief.
Liberal MP Bridget Archer continued to reserve her position on the tax changes.
“As I’ve previously said I’m open to discussing changes where circumstances may have changed,” she said.
“As always I will consider any legislation that comes before me on its merits and make decisions in the interests of my community.”"
DN94AF3XF7_6Y140AK6GMMWR3R,How Belgian MP turned sleuth to solve London Ulez fine mystery,_,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/26/how-belgian-mp-michael-freilich-turned-sleuth-to-solve-london-ulez-fine-mystery,"My surprising journey began two years ago when friends and acquaintances who had visited London received hefty fines, some amounting to thousands of euros, for allegedly contravening London’s emissions zone regulations.
The letters accompanying the penalties accused them of entering the city’s low emissions zone (Lez) without paying the daily charge. The Lez primarily targets heavy, large commercial vehicles, and non-compliant users can be fined up to £2,000 a day. The twist? My friends were in family cars. Furthermore, their vehicles complied with the sister scheme for cars, the ultra low emissions zone (Ulez). Since Belgium has longstanding Ulez schemes of its own, most people own emissions-compliant cars.
I discovered that overseas drivers have to register their vehicles with Transport for London’s (TfL) debt collections agent, Euro Parking Collections, 10 days before entering London. Otherwise they face the £12.50 daily charge levied on older, more polluting vehicles. Yet, foreign drivers were not informed of this – either when booking their travel tickets or at key entry points into the UK or London. A perfect trap was set for unwitting overseas motorists who would now face fines, even if their vehicles met the Ulez standards. Adding insult to injury, these fines, issued by Euro Parking, often arrived months after their date stamp, well past the 28-day window for a 50% discount.
Initially, I doubted my influence over the UK’s traffic charging system. But as complaints escalated, so did my resolve. The situation reached a tipping point when a friend was fined an astonishing £4,500 for a three-day visit to London. I posed a question to the Belgian parliament, regarding the legality of these fines after Brexit. The minister for transport’s response was startling: post-Brexit, there’s no legal basis for sharing personal data with the UK for non-criminal offences such as Ulez breaches.
My attempts to engage with Euro Parking through emails and letters were met with silence. They must have hoped it would go away, but they chose the wrong man to mess with.
I contacted the EU privacy commissioner and the Belgian data protection authority, only to find they were powerless against a UK company. Similarly, the UK Information Commissioner’s Office stated its remit was only to protect UK citizens’ data.
The tale took a significant turn when I submitted a freedom of information request to Belgium’s vehicle licensing agency, the DIV. The findings were staggering: Euro Parking, denied direct access to Belgian driver details, had employed a local court bailiff who accessed the database more than 26,000 times and passed drivers’ names and addresses to Euro Parking.
Court bailiffs can collate specific driver details in order to enforce a court judgment; they are not allowed to search the database. They are certainly not allowed to share the information with a UK company.
In a quest for hard evidence, on my next visit to London I deliberately failed to pay the toll on the Dartford crossing. Six months later, I received the expected penalty. This gave me the leverage I needed to solve the mystery.
I made a “subject access request” to the DIV asking who had asked for my details and thus confirmed the bailiff’s illicit collaboration with Euro Parking.
Following my investigation, action was taken by the Belgian authorities: the bailiff’s access to the driver database was suspended and a criminal complaint was filed against it, and the Belgian embassy warned TfL about the data breaches on its behalf. Belgian drivers were informed that they need not pay these invalid fines and I wrote to the mayor of London, but received no reply.
However, a continuous stream of fines is still being sent to Belgian drivers. Euro Parking has now found a new way to access Belgian motorists’ data, this time via an agent in Italy who has access to the EU licence plate sharing system, Eucaris. Again, the UK is no longer party to this and cannot legally receive the driver details for civil enforcement. The Italian authorities have been notified and the agent’s access barred. It’s become a relentless game of cat and mouse.
Since Belgium currently holds the presidency of the Council of the EU, I’ve asked my government to seek a pan-European solution and claw back the hundreds of thousands of pounds of fines that I believe have been collected unlawfully.
It’s easy to dismiss data protection issues as a niche concern, but the human cost of this abuse is significant. Many Belgians are now reluctant to visit family in the UK in case they incur a fine. Others have had Euro Parking’s bailiff knocking on their door over unpaid, unlawful penalties. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, says London is open for business – but it’s at a very high price as far as Belgium is concerned.

DNDU685DKW_IIBQG96PMOKISEX,First Thing: Boost for Biden as United Auto Workers union endorses his re-election,Jem Bartholomew,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/25/first-thing-boost-for-biden-as-united-auto-workers-union-endorses-his-re-election,"Good morning.
The United Auto Workers (UAW) formally endorsed Joe Biden’s re-election campaign on Wednesday at the union’s national community action program conference in Washington DC.
Both Biden and the former president, Donald Trump, who won the New Hampshire primary this week, have courted the union and supported its successful strike action against the big three automakers last year. Biden became the first sitting president to walk a picket line in support of the union.
“Joe Biden bet on the American worker while Donald Trump blamed the American worker,” the UAW president, Shawn Fain, said. “If our endorsement must be earned, Joe Biden has earned it.”
“Donald Trump is a scab. Donald Trump is a billionaire and that’s who he represents,” Fain said. “This election is about who will stand up with us and who will stand in our way.”
How influential is the UAW? It has 40,000 members. It is based in Detroit, Michigan, a key swing state where, according to one poll conducted at the end of 2023, Trump is edging out Biden 39% to 37%.
How did Trump try to court the union? In September, Trump said Fain was “a good man … he’s got to endorse Trump”. He also attacked electric vehicles and claimed, in office, “we will drill baby drill” and support gas engines.
What did Biden tell the UAW conference? On Wednesday, Biden talked up his pro-labor credentials, saying: “The union movement in America is important because it produces the best skilled workers in the world”. He added: “During my presidency, we opened 20 auto factories and more than 250,000 auto jobs all across the country.”
A poll from the Economist/YouGov found 35% of Americans say Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians, with 36% saying it is not and 29% undecided. The figures were even higher when accounting for age and politics, with 49% of people aged 18-29, and 49% of Democrats, seeing Israel’s actions as genocide.
The polling, taken from 21 to 23 January, comes as the international court of justice (ICJ) prepares to deliver on Friday an interim ruling on South Africa’s genocide case against Israel, and a separate lawsuit against Joe Biden’s administration for “failing to prevent genocide” advances.
Meanwhile, the US state department was forced on Wednesday to “deplore” the attack on the UN’s Khan Younis training centre, after the UNRWA building sheltering about 800 people was hit by Israeli tank shelling, killing at least 12 and injuring 75.
What is the latest in Gaza? The Israeli army says it has “encircled” the southern city of Khan Younis after two days of heavy fighting. The city is crowded with 88,000 residents and about 425,000 displaced people, with many trapped sheltering in hospitals. “Everyone in Gaza is hungry,” the UN secretary general said Wednesday.
How many Palestinians have been killed? More than 25,700, health officials in Hamas-run Gaza say, since the 7 October attack that saw 1,200 in Israel killed. About 85% of the 2.3 million people in Gaza have been displaced and face hunger and disease.
What is happening off the coast of Yemen? Two ships owned by Maersk’s US subsidiary sought US navy support after hearing explosions. Houthi militants are continuing their attacks on commercial shipping – which they say is in solidarity with Palestinians.
Russia has accused Kyiv of shooting down a large military transport plane carrying Ukrainian prisoners of war to an exchange on Wednesday, after a crash in the Belgorod region that killed everyone onboard.
Ukraine has neither confirmed nor denied that it hit the plane but said Moscow had created a “deliberate threat to the life and safety” of its PoWs by failing to warn Kyiv to deconflict the airspace before the swap.
Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, called for full clarity over the crash, accusing Moscow of “playing with the lives of Ukrainian prisoners of war”.
Meanwhile, fighting continues with 58 combat clashes on the frontlines, Ukrinform reports. A drone attack on Ukraine’s Black Sea port of Odesa injured one person and started a fire, the regional governor said.
What are the details of the crash? Russia says the Ilyushin Il-76 aircraft, which was filmed crashing and exploding, was carrying 65 Ukrainian PoWs, six crew and three Russian servicemen. Russia says all were killed.
How is funding for Ukraine’s war effort going? The UK defence secretary and Germany’s finance minister have called on other countries to increase funding to support Ukraine.
What has been the impact on Russia since its invasion? According to Ukrainian figures, Russia has suffered almost 380,000 killed or injured as the war enters its 701st day.
Argentinian demonstrators staged their largest show of opposition to far-right president Javier Milei’s radical attempt to reshape the South American country, with a nationwide strike and tens of thousands of marchers hitting the streets on Wednesday.
Ohio was accused of inflicting “great pain” as it blocked trans youth from receiving gender-affirming care, with the state senate overturning a gubernatorial veto on Wednesday.
The French parliament is debating plans to enshrine abortion as a constitutional right, with several parties pushing to protect the voluntary ending of pregnancies after Roe v Wade was overturned.
Boeing’s embattled chief executive said the company’s planes fly only when “100% confident” of safety, after a wheel falling off a 757 passenger jet while awaiting takeoff added to Boeing’s troubles.
Saudi Arabia will allow its first alcohol sales in 72 years, available in the capital’s Diplomatic Quarter in the teetotal kingdom.
The European Union pushed fossil fuel CO2 emissions down to their lowest level in 60 years, after pumping out 8% less in 2023 than 2022. That is according to an analysis from the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (Crea). More than half of the drop in emissions came from the use of cleaner electricity, such as dams and nuclear power – and with record levels of solar panels and wind turbines built in 2023. The CO2 fall “should be celebrated” but “more must be done to wean the EU off fossil fuels”, said a Crea analyst, Isaac Levi.
Up to one in five known pregnancies end in miscarriage, but despite its ubiquity, the experience is rarely discussed, writes Ava Macha. A recent Guardian callout asked readers about having a miscarriage in the US. Almost all indicated that understanding the statistical frequency of miscarriages – they occur in 10%-20% of known pregnancies – did not lessen the trauma they felt iafterwards. We selected five of those testimonies – from women in Montana, Illinois, Washington, New Jersey and Wisconsin.
The climate crisis turned the drought that struck the Amazon rainforest in 2023 into a devastating event, a study by the World Weather Attribution team found. Decreasing rainfall and increased heat in the Amazon made the drought about 30 times more likely than pre-industrial times. The drought was the worst recorded in many places and hit the maximum “exceptional” level on the scientific scale. Without planet-warming emissions from the burning of oil, gas and coal, it would have been far less extreme, analysts said.
From Hello Kitty toys to silly emojis, contemporary culture has fallen hard for all things adorable. A London exhibition opening today explores how cuteness has become such a dominant force.

DRTAVEMADO_437U8IQW4SMOQPS,UN agency investigates staff suspected of role in 7 October attack on Israel,Jason Burke,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/26/unrwa-investigation-staff-7-october-attack-israel,"The UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) has launched an investigation into several employees accused of taking part in Hamas’s 7 October attacks in Israel, and has severed ties with those staff members, its head said on Friday.
“The Israeli authorities have provided UNRWA with information about the alleged involvement of several UNRWA employees in the horrific attacks on Israel on 7 October,” the agency’s commissioner general, Philippe Lazzarini, said.
“To protect the agency’s ability to deliver humanitarian assistance, I have taken the decision to immediately terminate the contracts of these staff members and launch an investigation in order to establish the truth without delay.”
The US state department said it would provide no additional funding to the agency until the allegations were addressed.
In a statement, Matthew Miller, a state department spokesperson, said Washington was “extremely troubled by the allegations that 12 UNRWA employees may have been involved in the 7 October Hamas terrorist attack on Israel.”
Lazzarini did not disclose the number of employees allegedly involved in the attacks, nor the nature of their alleged involvement. He said, however, that “any UNRWA employee who was involved in acts of terror” would be held accountable, including through criminal prosecution.
A spokesperson for UNRWA would not provide further detail.
Information leading to the investigation is thought to have been gathered by Israeli intelligence services, which are also reported to have found evidence that the agency’s vehicles and facilities may have been used during the 7 October attack.
UNRWA has been under pressure since the beginning of the conflict, with Israeli officials alleging complicity with Hamas. The prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and others have accused the agency of fuelling anti-Israeli sentiments, allegations it denies.
Lazzarini told journalists in Jerusalem earlier this month that he would be appointing an independent third party to investigate both the veracity of the charges and why they were being made. Establishing the integrity of agency was essential to its continued work and funding, he said.
The Israeli government spokesperson Eylon Levy accused UNRWA of announcing the news while the world’s attention was focused on the international court of justice ordering Israel to prevent acts of genocide against Palestinians and do more to help civilians in Gaza.
“Any other day, this would have been a major headline: Israel submits evidence of UN employees’ complicity with Hamas,” Levy wrote on X.
The secretary general of the UN, António Guterres, has been briefed about the allegations was horrified by the news, his spokesperson, Stéphane Dujarric, said.
Dujarric also said Guterres had asked Lazzarini to conduct a investigation to ensure that any UNRWA staff shown to have participated in or abetted the 7 October attacks has their employment terminated immediately and referred for potential criminal prosecution.
“An urgent and comprehensive independent review of UNRWA will be conducted,” he said.
UNRWA, whose biggest donors in 2022 included the US, Germany and the EU, has repeatedly said its capacity to render humanitarian assistance to people in Gaza is on the verge of collapse.
The US state department said UNRWA played a critical role in providing lifesaving assistance to Palestinians, including food, medicine, shelter and other vital humanitarian support.
“Their work has saved lives, and it is important that UNRWA address these allegations and take any appropriate corrective measures, including reviewing its existing policies and procedures,” its statement read.
The EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said it would “assess further steps and draw lessons based on the result of the full and comprehensive investigation”.
UNRWA, which established in 1949 after the first Arab-Israeli war, provides services including schooling, primary healthcare and humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.
The agency has provided aid and used its facilities to shelter people fleeing bombardment and a ground offensive launched by Israel in Gaza in response to the 7 October attacks, in which 1,200 people were killed and 240 taken hostage. Before the war, it ran 700 schools and 140 health centres in the territory.
Israel’s offensive has reduced swathes of the densely populated Gaza to ruins and killed more than 26,000 Palestinians."
DSW9O77K50_3WNBG38HCV6R7KD,Light and floral or intensely orange-y? 10 summer spritzes beyond the obvious,_,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/jan/27/light-and-floral-or-intensely-orange-y-10-summer-spritzes-beyond-the-obvious,"While spritzes are synonymous with Italy’s aperitivo culture, they have evolved into one of the world’s most loved cocktails.
The beauty of the spritz, aside from its versatility, is its lower than average alcohol by volume (ABV).
Compared with other cocktails, it’s a much lighter option. Designed to quench your thirst and stimulate your appetite, spritzes complement pre-dinner snacks and can come in a multitude of varieties. While they’re typically made using the classic 1-2-3 formula (one part soda water, two parts bitter liqueur and three parts prosecco) they can be easily tweaked to suit your palate, budget and food pairing.
And with many more Australian distilleries now making aperitifs and liqueurs, they can also be given a local flavour. Here are 10 to try at home this summer.
Select Aperitivo, Italy, RRP $35
Select Aperitivo, the star of this classic cocktail, was once described to me as an “in-betweener”: not as bitter as Campari and not as sweet as Aperol.
They call Select the “spirit of the spritz” and, with a long history dating back to Venice in 1920, it’s not hard to see why. Herbaceous, with flavours of orange citrus, red fruit and vanilla, it’s a great starter spritz. To make the original Venetian spritz, follow the 1-2-3 formula and serve over ice with a green olive.
Bass and Flinders Distillery, Limoncello, Australia RRP $59
Limoncello is a classic Italian liqueur made by steeping lemon peel in alcohol and, while it’s synonymous with the Amalfi Coast, you’ll find it served as a digestivo right across Italy. Highly concentrated with an almost syrup-like consistency, sipping on limoncello is akin to drinking lemon candies.
While it’s perfect on its own, it makes for a delicious spritz. Refreshing, zippy, lemony, sweet yet tart, it will instantly transport you to the island of Capri, on the deck of a gozzo boat as the sun goes down. To make, follow the 1-2-3 formula and serve over ice.
The limoncello from Bass and Flinders on Victoria’s Mornington Peninsula uses organic, Victorian lemons that are hand-zested at their distillery, so a lot of love goes into this sweet, yet tart, juicy lemon liqueur. Holly Klintworth is not only their distiller, she is the first female to ever be elected president of the Australia Distillers Association and her liqueurs are delicious.
Autonomy, Davo Plum Aperitivo, Australia, RRP $42
Davidson plums are one of the most talked about native Australian ingredients in recent years, and the hero of Victorian distillery Autonomy’s Davo Plum aperitivo. While they’re too sour to eat fresh, the addition of sweeteners to this liqueur allows your palate to better appreciate their intense fruit flavour, with aromas reminiscent of stewed rhubarb, rosella jam and fresh beetroot.
Balanced beautifully with the flavours of pepperberry, sweet orange, rosella flower and raspberry, this Australian drink is everything you want in a bitters. It’s complex, aromatic and makes for the perfect spritz. Stick to the classic 1-2-3 formula, garnish with orange peel, plenty of ice, a green olive and a dash of brine if you’re feeling adventurous.
Lillet Blanc Aperitif, France, RRP from $39.99
Made from a blend of white wines from Bordeaux, primarily sémillon and sauvignon blanc, fortified with a blend of citrus liqueurs, Lillet Blanc has been a fixture in my bar cart for several years. A French aromatised aperitif wine, Maison Lillet was founded in Podensac, a small village south of Bordeaux, in 1872.
It has this gorgeous mouthfeel with flavours of candied orange peel, honey and passionfruit – and while it’s lovely on its own, it’s even better in a spritz. To make, combine equal parts soda water and Lillet Blanc in a glass over ice and garnish with a slice of orange. Simple, clean and incredibly refreshing.
St-Germain Elderflower Liqueur, France, RRP $78
Bright, zesty and floral, St-Germain Elderflower Liqueur is the star of this Italian spritz.
A lighter alternative compared with its counterparts, the Hugo is the perfect summer beverage, with a lower ABV. With notes of citrus, stone fruit, pear and, of course, elderflower, it’s a great option for those who are not fond of classic bitter liqueur-based spritzes.
To make this glorious little number, mix 40ml St-Germain Elderflower Liqueur, eight mint leaves, 60ml prosecco and 60ml soda water in a glass with ice. Garnish with a wedge of lime and a sprig of mint.
Silvio Carta, Sard Orange Ricetta Originale, Sardinia, RRP $120
I only recently discovered this orange liqueur from Milis in Sardinia, and it was love at first taste. Milis is said to be home to Italy’s finest oranges and this little bottle of sunshine is living proof. Infused with whole organic oranges and orange peel, the flavour of this liqueur is juicy, bright, acidic and intensely orangey. It makes for a killer spritz.
Following the 1-2-3 formula (one part soda, two parts orange liqueur, three parts prosecco) this orange spritz, for me, is reminiscent of Cottee’s cordial. It’s absolutely delicious and far too easy to drink.
Campari Aperitif, Italy, RRP $45
A simple alternative to the spritz you know and love, a Bicicletta uses dry white wine in lieu of prosecco. While you can switch up your bitter liqueur, typically you’ll see it made with Campari, which has a more bitter bite compared with Aperol.
While there are several formulations for a Bicicletta spritz, I like a 1:1:1 ratio. One part Campari, one part Italian white wine and one part soda water, but you can adjust the ratio depending on your palate. Pinot Grigio is my go-to for this particular drink and I like to garnish with a slice of orange.
Cynar Ricetta Originale Liqueur, Italy, RRP $41.99
An artichoke-based liqueur enriched with 13 herbs and plants, Cynar is a bit of a dark horse.
Sporting a complex flavour profile that is both slightly bitter and slightly sweet, this dark brown amaro offers up a distinctly earthy, herbal profile with notes of fennel, caramel and anise.
Considered both an aperitivo and digestivo, it’s versatile, bold and has a relatively low ABV, which makes it the perfect candidate for your summer spritz lineup. In Italy, I heard someone refer to a Cynar spritz as an “adult Coca-Cola” without the intense sweetness, and I have to agree.
Follow the 1-2-3 formula and be intrigued by its medicinal, herbal vibe.
Sutherland Estate, 2022 Sparkling Tempranillo, Australia, RRP $40
For a local take on the Lambrusco Spritz, opt for a sparkling red wine from Victoria’s Yarra Valley.
While you could use just about any sparkling red here, there’s something about this Tempranillo that hits the mark. Notes of dark cherry, chocolate, liquorice and spice partner beautifully with the vibrant orange flavours synonymous with Aperol. The result is a spritz that’s rich, savoury and still keeps you cool.
For my palate, I stick to the 1-2-3 rule (one part soda, two parts Aperol and three parts sparkling red) however feel free to dial back the Aperol if you want the flavours of the wine to hero the drink. I prefer to use Aperol over Campari, purely for the touch of sweetness it brings.
Saison Aperitifs, Red Vermouth, Australia, RRP $60; Applewood Distillery, Okar Island Bitter, Australia, RRP $54.99
Italian for “wrong negroni”, the sbagliato was invented in 1972 as a lighter alternative to the much-loved negroni. To make, simply add one part bitter liqueur, one part sweet vermouth and one part prosecco to a glass, over ice, and finish with a slice of orange. Bittersweet with an effervescent, fruity lift from the addition of prosecco, this easy-drinking aperitif will convert just about any negroni lover looking for a lower ABV alternative.
A good quality vermouth and bitter liqueur will make all the difference here and there are some stellar Australian options. Applewood Distillery’s Okar Island Bitter shines here, offering a level of complexity you just don’t get from Campari. Utilising ingredients native to Australia, it’s layered with flavours of strawberry gum, riberry, mint, thyme, blackcurrant and citrus.
As for vermouth, you can’t go past Saison’s Red Vermouth, made in Melbourne by chef Dave Verheul, from Melbourne institution Embla. This fruit-forward vermouth is made from Victorian moscato and shiraz, with infusions of vanilla, over-roasted hazelnut, smoked blood orange, fig leaf and saffron.
Both are absolutely delicious."
DVBAT7ORRN_H6L5K9JKHJEXKGM,‘I felt deep rage’: Sarah Grochala on her prize-winning play about snubbed computer genius Ada Lovelace,Anya Ryan,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/jan/23/sarah-grochala-interview-ada-lovelace-intelligence-womens-prize-playwrighting,"It is the day after Sarah Grochala heard her name called as the winner of this year’s Women’s prize for playwriting, and we’re back at the London Library, where the ceremony took place. She still can’t believe it: “It was a complete shock, my poor dad was getting ready to commiserate me.” But her play, Intelligence, which begins with the Victorian computing pioneer Ada Lovelace in the 1840s and then moves through a series of unexpected reincarnations, is a truly original, illuminating epic – and as one of the prize judges, I’d know.
The idea for the prize originated with producer Ellie Keel in 2019. After noticing the low number of plays by women being produced on national stages, Keel came across some research that revealed the extent of the problem: in 2018, only 26% of new main-stage plays in the UK had been written by women. With this information, she approached Katie Posner and Charlotte Bennett of Paines Plough and pitched them the idea of a prize for female playwrights. Now in its third year, it comes with a £12,000 prize fund. The five plays shortlisted this year grappled with the climate crisis, the home office, culture wars and AI.
Writing Intelligence, Grochala felt “deep rage and frustration”. “Ada probably died thinking she was a failure because she couldn’t get people to listen to her.” The play jumps across eras – into the lives of Steve Jobs and the US computer scientist Grace Hopper – and hurtles through years of technological development. “I had this real sense that Ada could be propelled into the future, because I feel like she belongs there,” she says. “There is something fascinating about the way people used to view women’s brains, and what they were capable of.”
Reading Intelligence, I was blown away by its detail and knotty arguments. It’s no surprise that it took eight years to write. “There were about a million drafts,” says Grochala, and she admits she used the Women’s prize closing date as a deadline to help her finish it. But, in its questioning of modern technology, the play’s currency is striking. “As a writer, you just have to write about the things that interest you and hope that by the time you’ve finished, people will still be interested.”
Grochala is a thorough researcher – it seems as though she’s eaten up all the information on Lovelace that is out there. “The danger with research is that you can spend so much time reading, and not actually write the play,” she says. But her obsession with science and logic underpins much of our conversation: “I was totally going to be a scientist, I was good at numbers as a kid.”
In the end, Grochala, who is 51, chose the artistic route. She studied acting, went on to do an English degree, then trained as a playwright at Birmingham University. Now she also teaches at the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama in London, and is studying towards a professional programme in TV drama writing in Los Angeles. “I’ve been around for a long time,” she says. Her play S-27 won a competition in 2007, but “it feels like a long time since I’ve had a play on in the UK”, she says.
Nonetheless, Grochala has big dreams for Intelligence. “In my head there is a kind of big, commercial production of it.” But in the short term, it is the prize money that may have the biggest impact: “Right now there isn’t a financial model that makes writing something you can live off on its own,” she says. She talks candidly of her fears about the state of new writing post-Covid: “I’m scared. It feels like we’re at a real point of crisis … there’s so much talent out there and so many stories that an audience would really revel in seeing, but they aren’t being given the chance.”
She may be disheartened by the industry, but Grochala’s desire to write is almost a compulsion, and a passion for theatre is in her bones. “I love how visceral it is. You’re literally making a world, time and space in front of people.” She talks of the plays she has shut away in drawers, and her years writing angsty poetry as a teen, all as markers of learning. “But when you’re writing a script that doesn’t get a production on any level, there is a sense that it never got the chance to grow up,” she says.
So yes, Grochala has had moments of doubt. “I tell my students, ‘If you can do anything but this job – do it,’” she says plainly. But today seems like a turning point. Her victory might not have sunk in yet, but there is a sense that her future itches with promise. “It sounds crazy, but I’d love just to be able to write. To have a play on would be amazing. To write more would be even better.”"
DW2BPI4PJP_P2PYHCCG9VJBKM6,Louisiana court upholds air permits for petrochemical complex in Cancer Alley,Dharna Noor,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/22/plastics-plant-louisianas-cancer-alley-air-permits,"A Louisiana appellate court has upheld air permits for a giant proposed petrochemical complex in a region known as Cancer Alley, enraging local advocates.
The decision, issued on Friday, will help clear a path for Formosa Plastics to build the nation’s largest petrochemical complex of its kind. The project has long faced staunch opposition from local and national environmental justice groups.
“Once again the state of Louisiana is putting polluters before people,” Sharon Lavigne, a plaintiff in the case against the proposal and founder of the local grassroots organization Rise St James, said in an emailed statement.
Friday’s ruling overturns a 2022 decision that vacated air permits for the $9.4bn project.
Those air permits, which the new decision affirmed, will authorize the plant to spew out more than 800 tons of air pollution each year – including carcinogenic ethylene oxide, as well as fine particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide, which have been linked to respiratory and cardiac illnesses.
The new permits could triple the levels of cancer-causing pollutants in the region, whose population is majority-Black, one analysis found. “For the court to uphold these permits is really disappointing,” said Michael Brown, an attorney at Earthjustice who represents Rise St James and other environmental groups that have challenged the project. “This area is already heavily overburdened by cancer-causing and lung-harming pollutants, including from existing petrochemical plants.”
When a court threw out the permits in 2022, it found that Formosa failed to demonstrate that the new facility’s emissions would not contribute to violations of the Clean Air Act and other regulations.
The appellate court on Friday affirmed that finding, but said some of those violations predated the plant and therefore cannot solely be attributed to it.
“Our position is that doesn’t matter under the Clean Air Act, because the Clean Air Act forbids any new source from tipping the area into a violation or contributing to a violation,” said Brown.
In a statement, Formosa said the permits are “sound” and that the state “properly performed its duty to protect the environment in the issuance of those air permits”, adding that it intends to comply with all state and federal standards throughout construction and operation.
Activists say the decision, though disappointing, will not stop them from continuing to fight the proposed 2,400-acre petrochemical complex, which would include 10 chemical plants for manufacturing plastics, in addition to several support facilities.
“While this ruling is a setback in our work to protect Louisiana from this disastrous project, it is only one part of the battle,” Anne Rolfes, director of local environmental justice organization Louisiana Bucket Brigade, said in a statement.
In order to begin constructing the plant, Formosa Plastic must obtain a federal wetlands permit from the US army corps of engineers, a process that could take years.
“Despite this ruling, we have power, and we will use it,” said Rolfes. “Formosa Plastics will not be built.”"
DXET85T26F_PP2ERSQO6QT5UM8,CIA chief to discuss fresh Gaza hostage deal and ceasefire with Israel and Qatar – reports,_,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/26/gaza-hostage-deal-israel-hamas-cia-chief-william-burns,"The director of the Central Intelligence Agency and his Israeli counterpart will meet Qatari officials in coming days for talks on a second potential Gaza hostage deal and pause in fighting, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday.
William Burns and the head of Israel’s Mossad intelligence service, David Barnea, will meet Qatari prime minister and foreign minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani in Europe this weekend, one official briefed on the meeting told the news agency.
Egyptian intelligence chief Abbas Kamel will also participate, a second source said.
Reports in the US media also said Burns would travel to Europe for meetings with Israeli and Qatari officials about a ceasefire.
The administration of Joe Biden has been trying to facilitate the release of the more than 100 remaining hostages taken during Hamas’ 7 October attacks on Israel, in which 1,200 people were killed, mostly civilians, igniting the war in Gaza. However, there remains a considerable distance between the two sides’ demands.
The US and Israeli intelligence chiefs have previously met Qatari and Egyptian officials, helping to broker a short-lived truce in November that saw more than 100 hostages freed.
Burns has been “involved in helping us with the hostage deal that was in place and trying to help us pursue another one,” White House national security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters travelling with Biden aboard Air Force One, referring specific questions to the agency.
The CIA, which has a policy of not disclosing the director’s travel, declined to comment on the meeting, first reported by the Washington Post.
US ally Israel has vowed to eradicate Hamas, unleashing a torrent of strikes that have flattened most of Gaza and killed at least 25,700 people, Palestinian health officials say.
A third source with knowledge of the talks said that Israel has proposed a 60-day pause in the fighting during which more than 100 hostages would be released in phases, beginning with civilian women and children.
That would be followed by the release of civilian men, female soldiers and the remains of hostages who died after being abducted by Hamas, according to the source.
That plan, however, is at sharp odds with Hamas’ last proposal, raising a question of whether the gap could be bridged. According to the source, Hamas last week proposed an end to the war, international guarantees that it would not start anew and the release of all detainees held by Israel, including those who participated in its 7 October onslaught.
Israel has consistently opposed a permanent ceasefire, a position backed by Washington. Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that Israel rejected Hamas’ conditions.
After the planned weekend talks, Qatar’s Al Thani is expected to be in Washington next week. On Monday, he is scheduled to speak at the Atlantic Council, according to the thinktank’s website."
DXS7G6TY7W_II2VAMB3RKQ3QRD,India’s courts to rule on who invented butter chicken,Hannah Ellis-Petersen,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/25/indias-courts-to-rule-on-who-invented-butter-chicken,"It’s one of India’s most beloved dishes and can be found bubbling on kitchen stoves or served on silver in restaurants across the country.
But exactly who came up with the recipe for rich and creamy butter chicken has long been a matter of dispute – one that has now reached India’s courts.
Two Delhi restaurants both claim to have the right to call themselves the home of the original butter chicken recipe.
The lawsuit to decide the matter was brought by the family who run Moti Mahal, a storied Delhi restaurant that counted India’s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, among its customers.
According to the Gujral family, the dish was the creation of their grandfather Kundan Lal Gujral who founded the restaurant in Peshawar, in what is now Pakistan. After India was split during partition in 1947, they moved the restaurant to Delhi.
They say the recipe, an indulgent curry that involves tender pieces of chicken cooked in a tandoor oven mixed into a rich tomato gravy laden with butter and cream, was invented by Gujral in the 1930s to use up leftover tandoor chicken.
“You cannot take away somebody’s legacy … The dish was invented when our grandfather was in Pakistan,” Monish Gujral, the managing director at Moti Mahal, told Reuters.
But rival restaurant Daryaganj has also staked its claim to butter chicken’s origins. The restaurant owners say that their relative, Kundan Lal Jaggi, had worked with Gujral when he moved his restaurant to Delhi in 1947 and it was there that butter chicken was created. This, they say, gives them the right to call themselves home to the first serving of the dish, a claim they say they trademarked in 2018.
As well as seeking rights to the title of butter chicken inventor, the Gujral family is seeking $240,000 in damages.
Given the slow pace of India’s courts, the pressing question of butter chicken’s origins may not be solved for months or even years. The next hearing of the case will be in May."
DYL3IJ7TJS_B7NLLIJJEDBUIEO,Israeli hostages’ families storm Knesset meeting to demand their return,Bethan McKernan,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/22/families-israeli-hostages-storm-knesset-meeting-netanyahu-rejects-hamas-offer-fighting-gaza,"Family members of Israelis held hostage in the Gaza Strip have stormed a parliamentary meeting in Jerusalem to demand that Israel’s government does more to return their loved ones, as fighting in Khan Younis reached unprecedented levels.
About 20 relatives of people seized as captives by the Palestinian militant group in the 7 October attack disrupted a Knesset finance committee meeting on Monday, chanting: “Release them now, now, now!”
One woman, who has three family members taken by Hamas, cried: “Just one I’d like to get back alive, one out of three.” Other protesters held up signs reading: “You will not sit here while they die there.”
On Sunday, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, rejected new Hamas conditions for ending the war and releasing the hostages including the Islamist group retaining control of Gaza and Israel withdrawing completely. In response, a Hamas official in Qatar said Netanyahu’s refusal to end the military offensive in Gaza meant there was “no chance for the return of the captives”.
A total of 110 Israelis and other nationals were released in return for 240 Palestinian women and children held in Israeli prisons as part of a week-long truce at the end of November. Several attempts at a ceasefire since have failed.
The families of the remaining 130 hostages, worried that their relatives’ plight now comes second to Israel’s objective of destroying Hamas, appear to be turning to more drastic measures in pursuit of another release deal, including further demonstrations outside Netanyahu’s private home.
An admission from the Israel Defense Forces last week that three hostages, whose bodies were recovered in the Jabaliya area in December, may have been killed by an airstrike on a Hamas tunnel, has also stoked relatives’ fears. At least 27 hostages are believed to have died in Gaza, including three men who were shot and killed by Israeli soldiers after escaping captivity and approaching the troops for help.
In a meeting with 15 of the hostage families after the Knesset protest on Monday, Netanyahu’s office said that contrary to reports of growing consensus on a ceasefire agreement, there was “no real proposal from Hamas”.
In a statement, an official said: “I say this as clearly as I can, because there are so many untrue [reports] that are surely torturing you. On the other hand, there is our initiative, which I will not detail.”
In Gaza, Israel’s nearly four-month-old offensive has accelerated during the past week in Khan Younis, southern Gaza’s largest city, in what Israeli officials have described as the last large-scale ground assault before a shift to lower-intensity, more targeted operations to eradicate Hamas, as demanded by US allies.
Ground manoeuvres in the south and west of the city began in earnest overnight, with local authorities reporting that approximately 50 people were killed and 100 others wounded in airstrikes and shelling. More casualties are believed to be trapped beneath the rubble.
Israeli tanks reached the gates of two Khan Younis hospitals on Monday, residents in the area said, in the bloodiest fighting of 2024 to date and the worst violence in the south of Gaza since the war began on 7 October, when Hamas killed 1,200 people in its attack on southern Israel.
More than 25,200 people in Gaza have now been killed in the fighting, the majority women and children, the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory says.
The Palestinian Red Crescent Society said on Monday it had lost all contact with its staff at Khan Younis’s al-Amal hospital, adding that tanks had surrounded both al-Khair hospital and the nearby al-Aqsa University, where thousands of displaced people were sheltering.
“It’s very difficult to leave the [hospital] complex and go to any cemetery and bury bodies because we’re under siege and anyone who leaves the complex is targeted,” Abdelkarim Ahmad, who was helping burying the dead, told Reuters.
At Nasser hospital, the only big hospital still accessible in Khan Younis and the largest still functioning in Gaza, witnesses said the trauma ward was overwhelmed with wounded being treated on the floor and in hallways.
The majority of Gaza’s 2.3 million residents are now penned into two towns: Deir al-Balah, north of Khan Younis, and Rafah, on the border with Egypt. Most are crammed into public buildings and vast camps of makeshift tents as disease and hunger stalk the trapped population.
Israeli plans for the two areas remain unclear, but Israel has said it will not stop fighting until Hamas is completely eradicated, a goal analysts say is unrealistic given the group’s deep-rooted presence in Gaza and elsewhere.
Israel blames the offensive’s high civilian death toll on Hamas, which it says uses the population as human shields. Hamas denies the allegation.
Rising tensions and violence across the Middle East sparked by the war in Gaza have stoked fears of a wider conflagration involving Iranian-backed groups in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen, as well as the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem.
The biggest fear is of a new conflict with the Lebanese group Hezbollah on Israel’s northern border, where clashes that began in October have intensified in recent weeks.
Netanyahu has also been criticised for reiterating his opposition to an independent Palestinian state, a stance at odds with the US, Israel’s most important ally. Joe Biden has expended vast amounts of international and domestic political capital in defending Israel’s war effort, despite a growing global outcry over the conflict’s devastating humanitarian toll.
Support for the war remains high among Israelis, but opinion polls show lagging support for Netanyahu and his far-right coalition. Weekly Saturday night rallies demanding the release of hostages have been supplemented in recent weeks by growing calls for elections."
DZ9BA52ZNC_Y4PGQWWCKPBI4HN,Pocock wants to boost Centrelink payments using savings from stage-three tax cuts overhaul,Paul Karp,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/27/pocock-boost-centrelink-payments-savings-stage-three-tax-cuts-overhaul,"The independent senator David Pocock has called on the Albanese government to use $28bn of savings from its new tax-cuts package to increase welfare payments and urged Labor to trim other tax concessions.
With the Greens signalling that they will press Labor to recoup even more from high-income earners, Pocock has suggested the revamp of stage three should be a springboard to other tax reforms in the too-hard basket including capital gains tax.
Labor’s new tax cuts, unveiled by the prime minister on Thursday, would give back $359bn over 10 years to Australians, delivering bigger savings to all taxpayers earning less than $146,486 and doubling tax relief for those on the average income, while reducing the benefits for high-income earners.
The tax cuts are broadly budget neutral over four years, but collect $1.3bn more than the Coalition’s stage-three plan in the first year and $28bn more over 10 years.
Pocock said Labor’s changes ensure “those who need more cost-of-living relief get a bigger tax break”, responding to community desire for cuts that are “fairer and better fit for purpose for the current economic environment”.
“I would also like to see the government use the current and expected future surplus to lift the safety net for those doing it hardest and further increase Austudy, jobseeker and other income support payments,” the ACT senator said.
“Most importantly this needs to be the beginning of much-needed tax reform of everything from how we tax resources through the [petroleum resource rent tax] to capital gains tax discounts on investment properties to multinationals who seem to be able to not pay much tax here.”

Anthony Albanese was asked on Saturday if he would dedicate the surplus to increasing welfare payments following Pocock’s calls. But the prime minister said there was no surplus money from the package, and said the changes were about doubling the benefit for the average worker.
“We know that low and middle income Australians are under financial pressure,” he told reporters. “It’s a responsibility of the government to do something about it. We’re determined to do something about it. We have made the right decision for the right reasons, and this will help particularly middle Australia.”
On Friday the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, was asked about further changes to negative gearing and franking credits, two reforms that Labor proposed in opposition but ditched after losing the 2019 election.
“We haven’t changed our view on that,” Chalmers said. “We have changed our view on the income tax cuts … We haven’t changed our view on those other proposals.”
On Thursday Anthony Albanese was similarly asked about other tax concessions including negative gearing. “The only consideration that we have had here is cost-of-living pressures,” the prime minister told reporters in Canberra. “None of the things you refer to will go anywhere near any of that.”
Albanese said he was “confident” of the package passing parliament. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, said Labor had broken its election commitment to maintain the stage-three tax cuts and argued the new plan should be taken to an election. But on Friday Albanese noted that Dutton “wasn’t even saying necessarily that they will vote against it”.
“We’ll wait for them to go through their mechanisms as well,” Albanese said. “We’ll talk with all of the crossbenchers.”

On Friday the Greens leader, Adam Bandt, suggested that despite the changes to stage three, the new package did not provide enough cost-of-living relief.
“We now have the chance … to really tackle inequality and the cost of living and housing crisis in this country,” he told Radio National.
“If we’re going to change the legislation, then we should do it in a way that really supports low- and middle-income earners.”
The Labor package gives a tax cut to every taxpayer, including the cohort earning between $18,200 and $45,000 who were due to miss out under stage three.
The Australian Council of Social Services chief executive, Cassandra Goldie, said the Labor plan was a “better deal for people earning low, modest and middle incomes” but it “does not yet help people on the lowest incomes facing the most severe crisis: people whose incomes are below the tax [free] threshold and pay no tax”.
“People receiving income support payments are worst affected by the cost-of-living crisis,” she said.
“Jobseeker and related payments must be urgently raised and without further delay. Our unemployment payment is just $54 per day, or $19,000 per year. The government must not leave behind the people already in poverty.”
Albanese has said tax cuts “will not be the end” of cost-of-living relief, but on Thursday did not commit to further improvements for those receiving government payments.
He noted previous measures such as increases to rent assistance and jobseeker had been “targeted at people outside the tax system”."
E1E4MUGKHI_N6OUMFV6TXE606U,"Benjamin Netanyahu’s denial of Palestinian statehood undermines prospects for peace, Labor MP says",Daniel Hurst,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/22/benjamin-netanyahu-israel-gaza-palestine-state-rejection-labor-mp-tim-watts,"The Australian government has said it is deeply disappointed by comments from the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, in which he rebuffed international calls for a pathway to a Palestinian state.
The assistant foreign minister, Tim Watts, said the remarks undermined prospects for peace. He also urged Israel to “live up to” its commitment to uphold international law in its military operations in Gaza, where the death toll has passed 25,000 Palestinians.
Speaking to Sky News, Watts said the Australian government still believed “that in a post-conflict world there can’t be any reduction in the size of the territory of Gaza and there can’t be any permanent Israeli presence within Gaza”.
The Australian government has long backed a two-state solution in which Israelis and Palestinians “can live side by side in security and prosperity within internationally agreed borders”. The foreign minister, Penny Wong, in a trip to the region last week, renewed calls for a “pathway to a Palestinian state”.
But Netanyahu said on Sunday that Gaza “must be demilitarised, under Israel’s full security control” and that he would “not compromise on full Israeli security control of all territory west of the Jordan River”.
The comments followed Netanyahu’s declaration on Thursday that his stance on Israeli security control over Gaza and the West Bank “collides” with the idea of Palestinian sovereignty, adding: “What can you do?”
Watts said Netanyahu’s comments were “deeply disappointing” because the Australian government “supports the aspirations of the Palestinian people for self-determination and ultimately for a state of their own”.
“We’ve called out comments, frankly, like these recent comments from Mr Netanyahu that undermine these prospects for a long-term negotiated settlement to this ongoing dispute,” Watts told Sky News on Monday.
“We’ve also called out other obstacles to peace like illegal settlement activity in the West Bank.”
Watts said the Australian government had been “clear and consistent since the outbreak of this conflict in saying that Israel has a right to defend itself against the appalling terrorist attacks committed by Hamas on October 7”, when about 1,200 people were killed in southern Israel.
Watts cited “the appalling sexual violence, the appalling murders, the appalling kidnapping of hostages that are still held in Gaza more than 100 days after those terrible attacks”.
“We’ve also said that the way Israel exercises its right of self-defence matters, and that while Hamas has flagrantly trashed international law [and] international humanitarian law, Israel as a democracy is held to a higher standard, as all democracies bring on to themselves,” he said.
“So we’ve made it clear that principles of international law like proportionality, distinction, precaution must be upheld by Israel.”
He said the loss of innocent lives in Gaza had been “harrowing” and “needs to stop”. Watts said any enduring ceasefire must include the return of hostages and “a cessation of rocket fire from Hamas into Israel”.
The Labor backbench MP Maria Vamvakinou, who is a co-chair of the Parliamentary Friends of Palestine group, said no one should be surprised by Netanyahu’s stance as he had made similar comments in the past.
“Someone like Benjamin Netanyahu is not a partner for peace, and hasn’t been for some time,” Vamvakinou told Guardian Australia.
“I reject his assertions outright, as do most people who recognise lasting support for peace for Israel and Palestine by recognition of Palestinian statehood.”

Vamvakinou backed calls from her Labor colleague Julian Hill for a crackdown on violence by Israeli settlers in the West Bank. She said she had been to the region several times and seen the “friction” that settlements caused.
Vamvakinou pointed to support in the Labor party platform for recognition of Palestinian statehood, and said this should be accelerated. “Step forward, step up and recognise Palestine,” she said.
The Greens said the Albanese government “must wake up to the fact that there is no military solution to the conflict in Palestine”.
“These comments are the latest example of why Prime Minister Netanyahu is one of the biggest blockers to a just peace,” the Greens’ foreign affairs spokesperson, Jordon Steele-John, said.
“Our government must call for what our community has been calling for months now: an end to the State of Israel’s illegal occupation and blockade of the Palestinian territories, a permanent ceasefire in Gaza, the release of all hostages and the prosecution of the perpetrators of war crimes.”
Wong and the shadow foreign minister, Simon Birmingham, did not respond to detailed questions on Monday, with their offices pointing to their remarks from last week.
Wong’s spokesperson said on Friday that her visit to the region had “reaffirmed the foreign minister’s view that achieving long-term peace and security for Israel in its region requires the establishment of an independent Palestinian state”.
Birmingham told ABC News Radio on Friday that a two-state solution was bipartisan policy in Australia, but this would require negotiated terms “that are acceptable to both parties”.
He said Israel must have “security and safety from terrorist attacks and obviously, that’s the current priority in the wake of the atrocities of October 7”.
The US president, Joe Biden, said after a call with Netanyahu on Saturday that different models for a two-state solution were available and they would continue to discuss the issue. Biden alluded to the possibility of a demilitarised Palestinian state.
Comment is being sought from the Israeli embassy and the general delegation of Palestine to Australia."
E1ND8SSRT7_8N4C3AE6BHLRLYK,Finland presidential frontrunner says its foreign policy is ‘existential’,Miranda Bryant,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/26/finlands-ex-pm-alexander-stubb-ukraine-invasion-inspired-him-back-into-politics,"Finland’s leading presidential candidate has said foreign policy and security are “existential” issues for the Nordic country, as it prepares to head to the polls for the first time since joining Nato.
Speaking on Friday at a breakfast event in Helsinki two days before Finland’s presidential election at a cafe named after him, Alexander Stubb, who was prime minister from 2014 to 2015, said he had thought he was finished with national politics. But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had changed his mind.
Debates between the nine candidates hoping to take over from Finland’s two-term president Sauli Niinistö in March had been “very constructive”, said Stubb, of the centre-right National Coalition party. He said all candidates were qualified for the role.
He remains the frontrunner but polls have recently tightened between the top three candidates. Stubb’s lead over the former foreign minister and Green candidate Pekka Haavisto has slimmed and Jussi Halla-aho, of the far-right Finns party, is catching up in third. The top two candidates will move to an expected second round.
Stubb, 55, said: “The debates have been very constructive, and there’s a reason for that. For Finland, foreign policy, security policy, is existential, so it’s very consensual.” Discussions have centred around foreign policy, the president’s role as commander-in-chief and the candidates’ values. “So you get a lot of questions about Russia, Ukraine, Gaza, US-China, US elections, Finnish Nato membership,” he added.
After eight years in government – as highlighted by his campaign posters, which are emblazoned with the figure in a big yellow font – Stubb said his return had been spurred by Vladimir Putin’s invasion.
“Having been in government for eight consecutive years and having held all the key portfolios, I felt in 2016 that I had very much done it for God and country, as they say. My plan was not to return to politics, or certainly not to national politics … but Putin’s attack on Ukraine changed it.”
After joining Nato at record speed last April, he believes Finland is entering “a new age in Finnish foreign policy”.
“When it became evident, right at the beginning of the war, that our path towards the alliance would begin, I felt strongly that this is a new age in Finnish foreign policy and perhaps I could throw my hat into the ring once again.”
Stubb said he was approaching the campaign like an endurance event, with preparations that started six months ago. “Now we’re in race season,” he added. “A couple of more days to go. I’ve visited 120 different towns and cities, I’ve given about 170, plus or minus, interviews, we’ve had 44 public debates, televised or streamed. So we [the candidates] know each other’s jokes quite well.”
He said he followed a “trinity of nutrition, rest and exercise” to maximise his energy levels and had taken an ice bath before Thursday’s televised debate. “I go and take an ice bath and go straight into the studio. So I’m full of beans when the debates begin,” he said.
The strengthening of the Finns party before the first round vote had added an extra dimension to the campaign.
Hanna Wass, a vice-dean at the faculty of social sciences at the University of Helsinki, said that, as a result of broad consensus between candidates on security policy, Russia and Ukraine, the context of the election consolidated early on in campaigning. But despite this, she added, the Finns party, which earlier this year was elected into the Finnish government’s ruling coalition, was increasingly grabbing the public’s attention and creating a polarising atmosphere.
“The Finns party once again showed its ability to twist the electoral agenda by activating themes related to socio-cultural issues or even nativism, as well as playing with the narrative that national media hold systematic bias against them, demonstrated, for instance, by reluctance to publish polls showing gains for Halla-aho.”
This, she said, could open up a push for tactical voting to prevent Halla-aho from making the second round.
On the streets of Helsinki many appeared undecided about who to vote for.
Yacquub Moalim Ali, 28, a consultant from Helsinki, said he was still making up his mind – probably choosing between either Li Andersson of the Left Alliance or Stubb – but he definitely would not be voting for Halla-aho.
“If you go through his comments it’s really brutal to read as a son of immigrant parents,” he said."
E61V8WI62E_LWG9P4GOPATAO2E,Ex-US army soldier convicted of Iraq manslaughter held over Capitol attack,_,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/23/ex-army-soldier-january-6-rioter-iraq-manslaughter,"A former United States army soldier who was convicted of manslaughter for shooting a handcuffed civilian in Iraq to death was arrested on Monday on charges that he assaulted police officers with a baton during the US Capitol attack.
Edward Richmond Jr, 40, of Geismar, Louisiana, was wearing a helmet, shoulder pads, goggles and a Louisiana state flag patch on his chest when he attacked police in a tunnel outside the Capitol on January 6, according to an FBI agent’s affidavit.
Richmond was arrested in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and was scheduled to make his initial court appearance on Tuesday on charges including civil disorder and assaulting, resisting or impeding police with a dangerous weapon.
Richmond’s Louisiana-based attorney, John McLindon, said he had not seen the charging documents and therefore could not immediately comment on the case.
Aged 20, Richmond faced a court-martial panel which convicted him of voluntary manslaughter and sentenced him to three years in prison for killing a handcuffed Iraqi civilian near Taal Al Jai in February 2004. Richmond also received a dishonorable discharge from the army.
Richmond initially was charged with unpremeditated murder, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. But the panel of five officers and five enlisted soldiers reduced the charge to voluntary manslaughter.
The army said Richmond shot Muhamad Husain Kadir, a cow herder, in the back of the head from about 6ft away after the man stumbled. Richmond testified that he didn’t know Kadir was handcuffed and believed the Iraqi man was going to harm a fellow soldier.
During the January 6 riot, body camera footage captured Richmond repeatedly assaulting police officers with a black baton in a tunnel on the Capitol’s lower west terrace, the FBI said. Police struggled for hours to stop the mob of people supporting Donald Trump from entering the Capitol through the same tunnel entrance.
A witness helped the FBI identify Richmond as somebody who had traveled to Washington DC with several other people to serve as a “security team” for the witness for rallies planned for January 6, according to the agent’s affidavit.
More than 1,200 people have been charged with Capitol riot-related crimes. About 900 have pleaded guilty or been convicted after trials.
More than 750 have been sentenced, with nearly 500 receiving a term of imprisonment, according to data compiled by the Associated Press."
E6DFVRQPT7_AA3WAG2IYTNUNY1,Trump-Biden rematch increasingly inevitable after New Hampshire primary,Lauren Gambino,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/24/trump-biden-2024-election-new-hampshire-primary,"A sweep of the first two nominating contests in the 2024 primary season left Donald Trump in a strong position to seize the Republican party nomination, and made a rematch with Joe Biden even more inevitable.
Trump’s Republican rival, Nikki Haley, vowed to fight on despite her second-place finish in New Hampshire, a state where she had hoped for an upset, and her third-place finish in the Iowa caucuses. But she faces long odds. There is no precedent for a candidate winning the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary and losing their party’s nomination.
There was record turnout in Tuesday’s primary; the more than 300,000 votes cast exceeded the previous high, set in the 2016 primary.
In his victory night speech, Trump previewed the crudeness of the campaign rhetoric to come if Haley does not accede to his calls for her to drop out. In his remarks, which were more angry than celebratory, Trump suggested that Haley would find herself under investigation if she became the nominee, but then declared that she had no chance of dethroning him.
“This is not your typical victory speech,” he said, surrounded by all of his vanquished Republican rivals. “But let’s not have someone take a victory when she had a very bad night.”
Haley’s campaign dismissed Trump’s speech as a “furious and rambling rant” and asked: “If Trump is in such good shape, why is he so angry?”
“This is why so many voters want to move on from Trump’s chaos and are rallying to Nikki Haley’s new generation of conservative leadership,” her campaign said.
Haley was more gracious in her speech. She conceded to Trump and congratulated him on his victory. But she said she would not be pushed out of a contest that had just begun. “New Hampshire is first in the nation,” she told supporters in Concord, the state’s capitol. “It is not the last in the nation. This race is far from over.”
Haley insisted that she could parlay her second-place showing in New Hampshire into an even stronger finish in her home state of South Carolina, where she was twice elected governor. But polls show Trump leading Haley by roughly 30 percentage points in South Carolina, which holds its Republican primary election on 24 February. New Hampshire’s demographics also made it a state where Haley was primed to do well.
Haley’s loss underscored Trump’s strength among Republican voters, who looked past his false claims of a stolen election and a web of legal troubles amounting to 91 criminal charges. More than half, or 54%, of New Hampshire voters said they would consider Trump fit for the presidency even if he were convicted of a crime, according to a CNN exit poll. Meanwhile, 86% of New Hampshire voters who supported him said they did not believe Biden was legitimately elected, according to the survey, while 77% of Haley supporters acknowledged the legitimacy of the 2020 result.
Overall, 47% of New Hampshire voters said Biden was legitimately elected, while 51% said he was not.
Trump and Haley also received vastly different levels of support among college degrees. Sixty per cent of those with a college degree supported Haley, the exit poll found, while nearly two-thirds of those without a college degree supported Trump.

Haley has said “chaos follows” Trump and argued Republicans would lose the presidency again if he was their nominee. “A Trump nomination is a Biden win and a Kamala Harris presidency,” she said, suggesting that the 81-year-old president would not be able to complete his term.
While Trump is dominating the Republican primary so far, he has yet to show strength among the kind of swing voters who will be crucial in winning the general election, the New York Times noted on Wednesday. Sixty per cent of self-described independent voters backed Haley in New Hampshire, according to CNN exit polling.
Biden was not on Tuesday’s primary ballot in New Hampshire, but won the contest thanks to a homegrown write-in campaign.
“It is now clear that Donald Trump will be the Republican nominee. And my message to the country is the stakes could not be higher,” Biden said in a statement on Tuesday. “Our Democracy. Our personal freedoms – from the right to choose to the right to vote. Our economy – which has seen the strongest recovery in the world since Covid. All are at stake.”"
EA0UEK04MC_ZNEMJY2D5YFTWKZ,Israel-Gaza war: what is the two-state solution and is it possible?,Oliver Holmes,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/22/israel-gaza-palestine-war-what-is-the-two-state-solution-and-is-it-possible,"Benjamin Netanyahu repeated his rejection of a Palestinian state last week but diplomats are pushing to resurrect the idea of a two-state solution.
At its simplest, the two-state solution is the idea that the creation of a Palestinian state next to Israel would end the crisis. There would be two states on the land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea.
The two-state solution has become the most widely accepted policy internationally, even as Israelis and Palestinians increasingly see it as an impossibility.
The Israeli occupation is the key issue that prevents Palestinians from forming their own state. Israel took control of the Palestinian territories – Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem – in 1967 and Palestinians have lived under military rule ever since. Internationally mediated efforts from the 1990s onwards have failed to change the status quo.
Even if the occupation were to end, there is little land on which Palestinians could build a state. An Israeli settlement movement in the Palestinian territories now numbers about 700,000 people.
Even if Israel were to be pressured to end its military rule, Palestinians themselves are deeply divided, with groups such as the internationally recognised Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) endorsing the two-state solution, while the Islamist movement Hamas seeks the destruction of Israel.
No. Israel’s longest-serving prime minister has never accepted the idea of a genuine Palestinian state.
In 2009, Netanyahu said a “Palestinian state” could in theory exist alongside Israel, but the conditions were so stringent that it would not be considered a sovereign state, with no military or control of its own airspace. In 2017, he said Palestinians could have a “state minus”. Israeli politicians talk about maintaining “security control” of all the land, which Palestinians see simply as control.
It is partly due to the devastating Gaza war, which has provided renewed momentum for governments and diplomats who seek to address the Israeli-Palestinian crisis.
But the words have also put Israel’s allies, such as the US and the UK, in a difficult position. Washington and London have long shielded Israel from international pressure by repeating that a negotiated two-state solution – no matter how impossible it seems – is a workable plan to end the crisis.
Netanyahu’s comments exposed the failures of that policy, and diplomats are now considering how Israel might be forced, possibly through sanctions, to end the occupation.
Many Palestinians and some Israelis now advocate a “one-state solution” in which a binational secular state is created. Israel’s government sees this as unacceptable as it would in effect be the end of the Jewish state, as they would not have a demographic majority.
Palestinians and their supporters – and even some Zionists who want Israel to change its policies – say the current situation is in effect a “one-state reality”, but one in which Israel has ultimate control by enforcing an apartheid regime, with unequal rights based on race. Israel has denounced claims of apartheid as “fictitious”."
ECGZMUD9ND_HRBQXI05143T33V,Conservative hostility to net zero proves the party has turned its back on British capitalism,David Edgerton,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/22/conservative-net-zero-british-capitalism-decarbonisation-rishi-sunak,"Of all Rishi Sunak’s blunders and policy decisions in 2023, perhaps the most consequential was his move to delay key milestones on the way to net zero. Sunak postponed the banning of sales of petrol and diesel cars and domestic boilers two months after the government authorised more carbon extraction from the North Sea. Cue outrage from the capitalists to the greens, from greens to even some Tories. What on earth was he doing?
There is perhaps some sense in his decision to slow down. If net zero by 2050 is the final target, then the means of getting there must be realistic. But as our climate becomes more inhospitable, affecting food imports, infrastructure and ultimately living standards, the goal must instead be to reduce global emissions as quickly as possible, not meet a distant date for net zero. Yes, realistic means to decarbonise the British economy are needed, but he has not provided them. On the contrary, he is willing away the means, as he admits they are lacking.
The reality is that this delay is not about realistic decarbonisation, but about the further Faragisation of the Conservative party, which is now a hard-right party of a sort familiar from the US. The core programme of this party is Brexit and all the fantasies this entails, and it is being further radicalised with a culture war and denial about anthropogenic climate change.
Net zero is the new Brussels. This is all too clear in the oil and gas bill, to be debated in the House of Commons on Monday, which will compel the government to do annually what it can already do and has done – licence new North Sea oil and gas production. Shrouded in irrelevant mendacities about emissions and energy security, this is a performative bill throwing a bone to the Faragists and forcing Labour to tack and twist some more. Again, the Tories set the agenda for their own purposes, quite deliberately undermining what consensus there has been on climate policy – to the despair of Tories who have been concerned with the issue, notably Alok Sharma and Chris Skidmore.
The Tory party is a party of rentiers for rentiers; its electorate is old and propertied. Once the party of British national capitalism, of big business, before it undid the very bases on which it depended, it no longer acts as the agent of productive change. Its aim is essentially to transfer resources from young to old, from workers to rentiers, from poor to rich; to support the landlord, the property developer and the extractive monopolies. Far from being incompetent, it has been extraordinarily successful in pursuing its agenda. It has no interest or competence in promoting a successful, transformative, decarbonised capitalism; indeed it shows a remarkably inadequate understanding of the dynamics of modern capitalism.
Significant sections of global capitalism have noted that they will be forced to decarbonise. Massive investment programmes are under way that require corresponding actions by states to complement and support them. That is why there was so little support from capitalists operating in the UK for Sunak’s net-zero U-turn. Car investors need to know when new petrol and diesel cars cars will be banned, and have confidence that they will be. And they need confidence that there will be an infrastructure to support electric cars, as the car industries, and others, have made clear.
This is not to say that the British government has not supported elements of decarbonisation. Such is the pressure generated by subsidies offered in the US, the EU and China, that even free-market Tories have already been forced to pour subsidies of various kinds into nuclear reactors, battery plants, car factories and steelworks (as well as subsidising oil companies).
Handing out subsidies to foreign companies to keep them operating in the UK does not equate to a coherent industrial policy that will lead to adequate decarbonisation. But the policy does at least recognise that the fantasies of world-beating British green tech are dead; there is no realistic prospect of creating a new British electric car or battery industry. The focus should not be on manufacturing new technology, but creating a domestic infrastructure that can provide clean energy to people cheaply.
In fact, a whole new way of thinking about the economy is needed to decarbonise successfully, something that Labour has not yet embraced. It will involve thinking in new ways about the foundational economy, or everyday economy, as proposed by the five authors of a vital new book When Nothing Works: From Cost of Living to Foundational Liveability. These authors – Luca Calafati, Julie Froud, Colin Haslam, Sukhdev Johal and Karel Williams – rightly argue that instead of the economics of fantasy growth, we need a political economy of improvement. Instead of wishful thinking about science and entrepreneurship, we need to change things. We cannot think of decarbonisation as a green industrial revolution, or as a tool for new R&D programmes and entrepreneurial startups or industrial policy. Instead we face a systemic issue that must be dealt with as such; at the centre of this needs to be a multi-dimensional analysis of the households nearly all of us live in. Whether the change needed can be achieved with private, barely regulated utilities extracting huge profits needs to be discussed.
Furthermore, we will need to restrict certain things – including subsidies to air travel, airport expansion, new oil and coal production. All this will require a creative and competent state, and popular consent and engagement.
Labour has shied away from all this, letting the Tories set the agenda, and is now seemingly confining its promises to a strangely unrealistic programme to decarbonise electricity by 2030 rather than the much more expensive and ambitious general decarbonisation that will be needed. It has been reluctant to think through what might need to be done, or to mobilise and campaign for the political support that will be necessary. Decarbonising will take much more than evoking Bidenomics, indulging fantasies of “world-beating” British green tech, or liberalising planning and de-risking the investment of rentiers.

EHHSGPPHBD_TEA0855B160HJTU,Science fiction awards held in China under fire for excluding authors,Amy Hawkins,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/jan/24/science-fiction-awards-held-in-china-under-fire-for-excluding-authors,"A prestigious literary award for science fiction, which was hosted in China for the first time, has come under fire for excluding several authors from the 2023 awards, raising concerns about interference or censorship in the awards process.
The New York Times bestseller Babel by RF Kuang, an episode of the Netflix drama The Sandman and the author Xiran Jay Zhao were among the works and authors excluded from the 2023 Hugo awards, which were administered by the World Science Fiction Convention (Worldcon) in Chengdu in October.
Babel, which won fiction book of the year at the British book awards in 2023, is a speculative fiction novel by Kuang, a Chinese-American author also known for her novel Yellowface.
No reason was given for the exclusions, which were revealed only on 20 January when the Hugo awards published the full nomination statistics for last year’s prize. Certain titles were listed as having been given votes, but were marked with an asterisk and the words “not eligible”, with no further details given.
The Hugo awards are the premier accolade for sci-fi and fantasy fiction. They are administered by the World Science Fiction Society, a loose collective of sci-fi fans who vote for their favourite works or authors across more than a dozen categories before the annual conference, Worldcon, which is held in a different city each year. Last year’s event was the first time it had been held in China.
Recently released documents showed that several works or authors – some with links to China – had been excluded from the ballot despite receiving enough nominations to be included on their respective shortlists. The excluded nominees include Kuang and Zhao, authors who were born in China but are now based in the west.
Concerns have been raised that the authors were targeted for political reasons, connected to the fact that the ruling Chinese Communist party exerts a tight control on all cultural events that take place inside its borders.
Dave McCarty, the head of the 2023 Hugo awards jury, wrote on Facebook: “Nobody has ordered me to do anything … There was no communication between the Hugo administration team and the Chinese government in any official manner.”
McCarty did not respond to a request from the Guardian for comment, but shared what he said was the official response from the awards administration team on Facebook: “After reviewing the constitution and the rules we must follow, the administration team determined those works/persons were not eligible.” He declined to elaborate on what the rules were.
“I can only guess to why I was excluded, but it probably has something to do with my critical comments about the Chinese government in the past,” said Zhao. “You would think that as a big, powerful country, China would be graceful about criticisms, but they in fact take it very personally, and doubly so when it’s from Chinese diaspora.”
Kuang debuted as an author with the Poppy War trilogy, an award-winning fantasy series inspired by modern Chinese history that imagines Mao Zedong as a teenage girl.
Episode six of The Sandman, which is based on a comic book written by Neil Gaiman, was excluded from the best dramatic presentation category, despite receiving enough nominations to be on the final ballot. Gaiman has publicly criticised the Chinese authorities for imprisoning writers.
In an Instagram post published on 22 January, Kuang wrote: “I wish to clarify that no reason for Babel’s ineligibility was given to me or my team. I did not decline a nomination, as no nomination was offered … I assume this was a matter of undesirability rather than ineligibility.”

Paul Weimer, a hobbyist sci-fi writer, discovered last week that he was excluded from the best fan writer category, despite receiving enough nominations to be shortlisted. “I had the highest of hopes for Chengdu,” said Weimer, who has been nominated for Hugos in previous years. “I thought it was amazing that a number of Chinese fans had got together to get this bid together.”
The organising committee of Chengdu Worldcon did not respond to requests for comment. Some people in the sci-fi community had raised concerns about the event being hosted in China when Chengdu won the bid to host the event in 2021.
“My Hugo acceptance speeches would have gotten me arrested in China. I have said things on record that are just illegal,” said the writer Jeannette Ng in 2021.
The Worldcon organisers “should have taken our concerns about the awards being held in China seriously from the beginning. We knew something like this was going to happen,” said Zhao.
Writing on Facebook, Gaiman said: “Until now, one of the things that’s always been refreshing about the Hugos has been the transparency and clarity of the process … This is obfuscatory, and without some clarity it means that whatever has gone wrong here is unfixable, or may be unfixable in ways that don’t damage the respect the Hugos have earned over the last 70 years.”
This article was amended on 25 January 2024 to change references, after the first mention of Xiran Jay Zhao, from Xiran, to their family name Zhao."
EMPEZWLPE1_QHOJIK8UBEXXSPD,Judge unseals divorce case as conflict of interest claims threaten Trump Georgia trial,Hugo Lowell,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/22/fani-willis-divorce-case-allegations-unsealed,"A Georgia judge on Monday unsealed the divorce case involving a special prosecutor at the center of allegations concerning an improper relationship with the Fulton county district attorney who brought the racketeering case against Donald Trump over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results.
The judge also stayed the deposition of the Fulton county district attorney Fani Willis in the divorce, until the special prosecutor Nathan Wade – whom she hired for the high-profile Trump case – had first testified about his relationship and financial conditions himself.
Trump’s co-defendant and 2020 campaign elections day operations chief, Michael Roman, has put forward a motion seeking to have the district attorney’s office disqualified from bringing the case because the alleged relationship between Willis and Wade was a conflict of interest.
The judge vacated the consent order sealing the divorce proceeding because no court hearing had been held at the time to shield the records. Roman and a coalition of media organizations, including the Guardian, had separately filed to unseal the case.
The allegations made by Roman threaten to undercut one of the most complex and high-profile criminal cases against Trump that could go to trial before the 2024 election. Trump, who won the Iowa caucuses last week with a 30-point margin, is the frontrunner for the Republican nomination.
Trump and his allies, including Roman, were charged last year with violating the Georgia racketeering statute over their efforts to reverse the outcome of the 2020 election in the state, including by advancing fake Trump slates of electors and pressuring state officials to toss vote totals.
The complaint about the relationship inside the district attorney’s office surfaced in January after Roman sought the dismissal of Willis, alleging that she personally profited from hiring Wade because he billed at least $653,000 in fees and used that money to pay for vacations together.
The reasoning from Roman, as it goes, suggests that even though Wade could spend his earnings as he liked, it was a conflict of interest when the money was being used to benefit Willis.
Roman’s filing included no concrete proof that Willis personally benefited from hiring Wade. Roman’s lawyer Ashleigh Merchant, a respected local attorney who once endorsed Wade to be a judge in 2016, said the claims were based on sources and records from Wade’s divorce proceeding.
But in a court filing submitted by Joycelyn Mayfield Wade in the divorce case last week, Wade’s bank records attached as exhibits showed that he had paid for at least two trips to Miami, Florida, and to Napa Valley, California, with Willis as the listed travel companion.
The first trip, dated 4 October 2022, showed Wade paid for flights from Atlanta to Miami for himself and for Willis. Separately, on the same date and without names listed, Wade made two purchases with Royal Caribbean Cruises, for $1,248 and $1,387.

The second trip, dated 25 April 2023, showed Wade paid for flights from Atlanta to San Francisco for himself and for Willis. On 14 May 2023, Wade made two purchases, for $612 and $228, at a Doubletree hotel in Napa Valley.
Willis has not directly addressed the allegations. A spokesperson has said the district attorney’s office would speak through its court filings.
The allegations are scheduled to be addressed next month after the Fulton county superior court judge Scott McAfee, who is presiding in the Trump case, set an evidentiary hearing for 15 February. The date comes two weeks after the judge in the divorce case holds a hearing on whether to unseal.Wade started divorce proceedings the day after he was hired as a special prosecutor on the Trump case. The divorce turned contentious last year, after Joycelyn Mayfield Wade complained that her husband had failed to disclose his finances, including income from working on the Trump case.The complaint resulted in Wade being held in contempt by the Cobb county superior court judge and, in January, Willis herself was subpoenaed for information relating to Wade’s work.
The subpoena ordered Willis to sit for a taped deposition on 23 January. At the hearing on Monday, the judge also stayed the subpoena until after Wade himself had been deposed by his wife about his financial situation.Willis accused Wade’s wife of “conspiring with interested parties in the criminal election interference case to use the civil discovery process to annoy, embarrass and oppress District Attorney Willis” in a motion to quash, and sought a protective order to avoid the deposition."
ETXQ2C2VLY_JGPO8ENXE24UPC7,Grenfell survivors to confront executives of firms blamed for disaster,Robert Booth,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/22/grenfell-survivors-to-confront-executives-of-firms-blamed-for-disaster,"Grenfell Tower survivors will this week confront executives from companies blamed for the disaster, after they said that in the wake of the Post Office scandal it was increasingly clear that “those in power have lost their moral compass”.
Over four days in central London, dozens of the bereaved and survivors of the 2017 fire will tell leaders from the construction industry and the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea of the “horror” of the fire and its “devastating personal impact”.
It is an attempt to deliver “restorative justice” after the blaze that killed 72 people and comes amid public concern over issues ranging from the wrongful convictions of post office operators to the infected blood scandal.
The Grenfell community remains angry that there have still been no criminal prosecutions and the public inquiry is yet to report in full, but the testimonial week was arranged as part of a £150m high court compensation settlement arbitrated by the former president of the supreme court, Lord Neuberger.
Behailu Kebede, the minicab driver in whose flat the fire started, will be among the first to speak, with a statement voiced for him by an actor, followed by others including Sandra Ruiz, whose 12-year-old niece, Jessica Urbano, was killed on the 21st floor. She said she hoped the process would be “cathartic”.
“‘I don’t recall’ and ‘I don’t remember’ seems to be a default position for people in power that have messed up – the postmasters, contaminated blood, Covid,” Ruiz said ahead of her appearance. “Those in power have lost their moral compass and we as a society are seeing it way too often. We are not holding them to account enough.”
Hanan Wahabi, who escaped the tower but lost her brother, her sister-in-law and their three children, will also address the corporate representatives. She said she would “share some of the devastating personal impact that night has had on me and my family – and to try to give some of the organisations that I hold responsible an insight into the horror faced by my brother and his family”.
“It is a chance to reflect on the magnitude of the ongoing impact of that night, and the many failings that happened. What happened that night shows the worst of the built environment, housing, emergency services and central and local government. It is symbolic of a total lack of humanity and compassion, of putting profit before people, of a refusal to learn and change.”
The event, at the headquarters of the Church of England in Westminster, comes as Grenfell survivors are drawing comparisons between their own fight for justice and that of the convicted, jailed and bankrupted post office operators.
“We had Grenfell seven years ago and the Post Office rumbling on for 20 years,” said Ed Daffarn, who escaped from his 16th-floor flat eight months after posting a blog that warned of the risk of “an incident that results in serious loss of life”. “What is ever going to change for the little people who become victims of injustice and profiteering?”
Daffarn said he has been “filled with anger” that it took the ITV docudrama Mr Bates v the Post Office to push the government into taking meaningful action. Considering the similarities, he said: “You have a company putting their own interests and profits above the wellbeing of the postmasters, and with Grenfell we had Celotex and Kingspan putting their profits ahead of us.

“I described our tenants’ management organisation as a mini-mafia, and that’s how the Post Office acted. That was chilling. It got me thinking about the other injustices, like infected blood, Windrush, that haven’t had that kind of drama and are therefore languishing in inaction and indifference, which is my experience from Grenfell.”
The writer and director Peter Kosminsky has been researching a docudrama about Grenfell for the BBC, but it is not yet in production.
“As the Post Office TV drama shows, it is vital we keep Grenfell in the public consciousness through Steve McQueen’s art installations, [Gillian Slovo’s] play [at the National Theatre] and Peter Kosminsky’s programme, otherwise it’s forgotten,” Daffarn said. “Without them Grenfell disappears.”"

Age: Still in its infancy for men (it was first sighted in 2021).
Appearance: Mainly on TikTok.
TikTok, you say? Yes, and fandom generally.
Another rigorously intellectual conversation beckons, I see. You know you love it, babygirl.
Go on then, enlighten me. What is “so babygirl”? It’s a gen Z term of endearment, sort of.
Why are we talking about it now? Well, Jacob Elordi (he of Euphoria, Saltburn, extreme tallness and cheekbones fame) hosted the most recent episode of the US topical comedy show Saturday Night Live and one skit involved his co-host, Renée Rapp, and SNL cast member Bowen Yang describing him as “so babygirl”, to Elordi’s comic confusion.
If Elordi is babygirl, I suppose it means attractive? It’s a bit more complicated than that. There is a conventional usage that does mean cute, but also slightly naive: “A man who is very cutesy in a slightly submissive way,” says Rolling Stone. Other classic “so babygirl” candidates include Harry Styles and the South Korean superstar Jimin.
Isn’t that a bit demeaning? Yes, but it’s also a way of celebrating the softer side of these men. “It actually is being used in a positive way, like you’re highlighting favourable qualities in a man,” Prof Sylvia Sierra of Syracuse University told Grazia.
And is it … sexual? It can be? There’s a BDSM usage of babygirl.
So what’s the other usage of “so babygirl”? Well, you know gen Z; they like to subvert a trend as soon as they invent it, meaning “so babygirl” has also been used to compliment the “miserable antihero in his 40s” you find attractive. Think Walter White from Breaking Bad, Kendall Roy from Succession or Joel (Pedro Pascal’s character) from The Last of Us. I wouldn’t say there is a consensus about who gets to be so babygirl, despite the SNL skit; the term seems able to accommodate layer on layer of irony and self-referential silliness.
Those gen Z scamps. They contain multitudes. It’s elusive, applied to Keanu Reeves, 59, one of the blue guys from Avatar and, er, Godzilla. I’ve also seen it explained as having “passenger princess vibes” or being the same as “cinnamon roll”.

I’m so tired. It’s almost as if the confusion is the point? Yes. There is a genre of conventionally babygirl TikTokers posting “What does that mean?” videos in response to “so babygirl” comments.
Is there anyone who can’t be a babygirl? Maybe a female infant? But at this point, I’m going to say no: babygirl is whatever you want it to be.
Do say: “You’re so babygirl.”
Don’t say: “You’re so baby shark doo doo doo.”"
EWX68AGM1D_MH3IMYBCAZGGX6X,"SUVs drive trend for new cars to grow 1cm wider in UK and EU every two years, says report",Ajit Niranjan,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/22/cars-growing-wider-europe-report,"New cars in the EU and UK have grown 1cm wider every two years, the Guardian can reveal, driven by large luxury SUVs whose sales show no sign of slowing.
“It’s unrelenting,” said James Nix, an analyst at the Transport and Environment (T&E) campaign group and author of the report. “Spurred on by sales of the largest SUVs, vehicles are getting wider every year.”
New cars have become so bloated that half of them are too wide to fit in parking spaces designed to the minimum on-street standards in many countries, the report found. The average width of a new car in the EU and UK passed 180cm in the first half of 2023, having grown an average of 0.5cm each year since 2001.
“That may not sound like a huge figure,” said Nix. “But the reality is that – unless there is reform – a cohort of large luxury SUVs and pickups will become as wide as trucks and buses.”
Big cars are more likely than small cars to kill people in crashes because they weigh more and have tall front ends that trap victims beneath them instead of knocking them to the side. They also pump more toxic gas into the air and eat up more space on roads and pavements.
For some cars that were originally designed decades ago, the need to incorporate safety features like airbags and crumple zones are part of the reason that newer models have grown bigger. But the recent trend is driven by consumers buying far larger cars that make roads more dangerous.
In the mid-1990s, the EU banned vehicles wider than 2.55 metres to stop trucks and buses from growing too large. But the legislation did not create separate limits for cars, which analysts say have started to cross key thresholds for which roads and cities were not designed.
Ahead of a planned revision of EU vehicle rules, campaigners have called on lawmakers to support a clause that would make the European Commission review the width limit. They argue that the trend towards bigger cars has reduced the space for other road users and increased the danger.
Crash data from Belgium from 2017 to 2021 shows that a 10cm increase in the height of vehicle fronts raises the risk of death by 30% when a car hits a pedestrian or cyclist, according to a study by the Vias Institute, previously the Belgian Institute for Road Safety.
Nix, who is based in Brussels and has two young children, said: “I have three- and five-year-old kids and we’re all about encouraging them to cycle. But I – as a man in my mid-40s – am becoming ever more intimidated by particularly large oncoming vehicles in streets in Brussels.”
The growth in car size also causes issues for their drivers. The report found that large luxury SUVs, which are around 2 metres wide, no longer fit in off-street parking. They also leave too little space for passengers to get in and out of vehicles in typical off-street spaces, which are around 2.4 metres wide, the report found.
Giulio Mattioli, a transport researcher at Technical University Dortmund, said: “Too much urban space is allocated to cars in cities – including free parking at the taxpayers’ expense for which little justification exists.”
Even in trailblazing capitals such as Paris and Barcelona, which have fought hard to reclaim roads for people to walk, bike and relax, more than half of street space is reserved for cars. On top of that, said Mattioli, cars in many cities are sometimes parked illegally, with little enforcement of parking rules.
“The fact that cars are getting bigger is likely to make the situation even worse,” said Mattioli. “It could also lead policymakers and planners to increase the standard measures of parking spaces, which could result in a vicious circle of ever-increasing size of cars.”
Paris may become the first big European capital to tackle this trend next month when it holds a referendum on higher parking charges for heavier cars. A similar scheme is set to start in Lyon in the coming months.
France has fought the trend towards heavier cars more than most of Europe’s big economies. Since 2008, it has provided a financial bonus to people buying a cleaner car and a malus, or penalty, to people buying a dirtier one. In 2022, the government extended the system to apply penalties that cover the weight of a car.
“That’s definitely one way to go because it could be budget-neutral,” said Gracia Brückmann, a transport policy researcher at the University of Bern. “[That] makes it easier to sell it to the public or taxpayer.”"
EZM4SKJ2WH_2JLSE1TKZSRNOUK,Ireland kickstarts vote on constitution’s wording about women and family,Rory Carroll,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/25/ireland-kickstarts-vote-on-constitutions-wording-about-women-and-family,"Ireland has fired the starting gun on two referendums to widen the constitution’s concept of family and the role of women in society.
The Irish Electoral Commission launched an independent information campaign for the twin votes on 8 March, which, if passed, will remove the constitution’s reference to women’s “duties in the home”.
Marie Baker, a supreme court judge who chairs the commission, expressed hope on Thursday that people would study and debate the issues.
“The worst thing that could happen is that nobody cares about this,” she told a press conference. “I would say everybody should care about what’s in the constitution. Everybody should care as to what it says. And everybody should care as to what they think about it.”
The government has cast the referendums, to be held on International Women’s Day, as an opportunity to embed inclusivity and equality in a constitution dating from 1937.
Voters will be asked whether they wish to delete article 41.2, which reads: “The state recognises that by her life within the home, woman gives to the state a support without which the common good cannot be achieved.
“The state shall, therefore, endeavour to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home.”
The government has argued the language is outdated. “A woman’s place is wherever she wants it to be, whether that is in the workforce, in education, or in the home,” said the equality minister, Roderic O’Gorman.
The other referendum would expand a reference to family by adding “whether founded on marriage or on other durable relationships”. The existing wording offers constitutional protection only to married families. Same-sex marriage has been legal in Ireland since 16 November 2015.
An eight-page booklet to be sent to 2.3m homes, states that a “durable” relationship means “a family based on different types of committed and continuing relationships other than marriage”.
At the campaign launch, Baker said one indicator of durability was treatment by other people. “Are you invited as a couple to weddings? Do people send your postcards, Christmas cards to both of you? These are indicators of your commitment to one another.”
The referendums were recommended by a citizens’ assembly on gender equality in 2021. Despite misgiving about the wording, Sinn Féin, the main opposition party, has signalled it will join other opposition parties in calling for a yes vote in both referendums.
The National Women’s Council is also calling for yes votes, saying “sexist, stereotypical language has no place in our constitution and is representative of a time when women were treated like second-class citizens”."
F4ICJUKK69_J4694DCSBKC8ZG2,George Carlin’s estate sues over AI-generated standup comedy special,_,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/26/george-carlin-lawsuit-ai-standup-comedy-special,"The estate of George Carlin is suing the media company behind a fake, hour-long comedy special whose creators boasted of using artificial intelligence to re-create the late standup comic’s style and material.
The lawsuit filed in federal court in Los Angeles on Thursday asks that a judge order the podcast outlet Dudesy to immediately take down the audio special, George Carlin: I’m Glad I’m Dead, in which a synthesis of Carlin delivers commentary on current events. Carlin died in 2008.
Carlin’s daughter, Kelly Carlin, said in a statement that the work is “a poorly-executed facsimile cobbled together by unscrupulous individuals to capitalize on the extraordinary goodwill my father established with his adoring fanbase”.
The Carlin estate and its executor, Jerold Hamza, are named as plaintiffs in the suit, which alleges violations of Carlin’s right of publicity and copyright. The named defendants are Dudesy and podcast hosts Will Sasso and Chad Kultgen.
“None of the defendants had permission to use Carlin’s likeness for the AI-generated ‘George Carlin special,’ nor did they have a license to use any of the late comedian’s copyrighted materials,” the lawsuit says.
The defendants have not filed a response to the lawsuit and it was not clear whether they have retained an attorney. They could not immediately be reached for comment.
At the beginning of the special posted on YouTube on 9 January, a voiceover identifying itself as the AI engine used by Dudesy says it listened to the comic’s 50 years of material and “did my best to imitate his voice, cadence and attitude as well as the subject matter I think would have interested him today”.
The plaintiffs say if that was in fact how it was created – and some listeners have doubted its stated origins – it means Carlin’s copyright was violated.
The company, as it often does on similar projects, also released a podcast episode with Sasso and Kultgen introducing and commenting on the mock Carlin.
“What we just listened to, was that passable?” Kultgen says in a section of the episode cited in the lawsuit.

“Yeah, that sounded exactly like George Carlin,” Sasso responds.
The lawsuit is among the first in what is likely to be an increasing number of major legal moves made to fight the regenerated use of celebrity images and likenesses.
Josh Schiller, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said in a statement that the “case is not just about AI, it’s about the humans that use AI to violate the law, infringe on intellectual property rights, and flout common decency”."
F8CXQACKQ8_EXFISXAOFRM60LU,Judge rebukes Trudeau for ‘not justified’ use of Emergencies Act to break convoy,Leyland Cecco,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/23/canada-trudeau-emergencies-act-trucker-protest-covid,"A Canadian court has ruled that Justin Trudeau’s government was not justified when it used sweeping powers to break up what the prime minister called “illegal and dangerous” protest blockades across the country two years ago.
A federal court found on Tuesday the government’s invocation of the Emergencies Act in response to the so-called freedom convoy protests “was not justified in relation to the relevant factual and legal constraints that were required to be taken into consideration”.
In his decision, Justice Richard Mosley wrote that the move was “unreasonable” and led to infringement of Canada’s charter of rights and freedoms.
In February 2022, truckers and their supporters occupied Ottawa, the Canadian capital, for nearly a month in a protest over public health orders related to the coronavirus pandemic. Protesters also blockaded key border crossings with the US.
Trudeau responded by invoking the 1988 Emergencies Act for the first time in Canada’s history, granting the federal government sweeping powers, including the ability to ban gatherings at certain locations and stop crowdfunding efforts to support the protest.
The prime minister said the measures would be time-limited and only apply to specific geographic regions. “We are not preventing the right of people to protest legally,” he said, adding that the military would not be deployed. “The act is to be used sparingly and as a last resort.”
A public inquiry in February last year found that the government acted appropriately when it invoked the Act.
But the Canadian Civil Liberties Association (CCLA) and the Canadian Constitution Foundation applied for a judicial review, arguing the government’s use of the Emergencies Act breached the country’s charter of rights and freedoms.
Ewa Krajewska, the lawyer for the CCLA, acknowledged before the federal court’s decision that for many the protests and the government’s moves to break them up were a “distant memory”.
“But when the act can be invoked is important,” she wrote.
The federal court’s decision is meant to give clarity to when future governments might invoke the act, but the ruling was quickly pounced on by Trudeau’s political rivals.
“Judge rules Trudeau broke the highest law in the land with the Emergencies Act. He caused the crisis by dividing people. Then he violated Charter rights to illegally suppress citizens,” the Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, who met with protesters during the convoy, posted on social media.
The Conservatives are currently polling far ahead of Trudeau’s Liberal party ahead of an expected election next year.
In his decision, Justice Mosley admitted he had more information at his disposal than government officials had when they made the controversial decision. But he nonetheless found Trudeau’s government lacked sufficient justification.
Following the court’s decision, Chrystia Freeland, the deputy prime minister, said the federal government would appeal the court ruling, adding the government stands by its decision to invoke the act.
“The public safety of Canadians was under threat, our national security, which includes our national economic security was under threat,” she said. “It was a hard decision to take.”"
FAMHDSORFL_S4B6T2AS9UMLTI6,Germany unearths pro-Russia disinformation campaign on X,Kate Connolly,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/26/germany-unearths-pro-russia-disinformation-campaign-on-x,"Digital forensic experts in Germany have uncovered a vast, pro-Russia disinformation campaign against the government using tens of thousands of fake accounts on the social media platform X.
The German foreign ministry, which commissioned the study after suspecting it was being targeted by bots, said the findings highlighted the need for governments to systematically tackle the growing number of disinformation campaigns and recognise the effect they could have on elections.
Using specialised monitoring software, the experts uncovered a huge trail of posts over a one-month period from 10 December, which amounted to a sophisticated and concerted onslaught on Berlin’s support for Ukraine. More than 1m German-language posts were sent from an estimated 50,000 fake accounts, amounting to a rate of two every second.
The overwhelming tone of the messages was the suggestion that the government of Olaf Scholz was neglecting the needs of Germans as a result of its support for Ukraine, both in terms of weapons and aid, as well as by taking in more than a million refugees.
Der Spiegel, which had access to the findings, reported that the fake accounts had matching comments attached to them, often using hashtags popular at the time, such as #Oktoberfest or #Bundesliga, in a concerted effort to reach as wide an audience as possible.
In one of the most impactful fake messages, in terms of the number of people it reached and the amount of feedback it generated, Annalena Baerbock, the foreign minister, appeared to be declaring from her own account on X that government support for Ukraine was crumbling. A small Cyrillic figure that had crept into the post apparently mistakenly was the only obvious factor immediately identifying it as fake.
The posts are typically linked to well-known media sites, using a link shortener so that the false domain names are not immediately obvious.
The analysts said they were convinced the source of the campaign was in Russia, making a connection to the Russian-led Doppelgänger campaign that first emerged in 2022, affecting the UK, France and Italy. Among the faked posts then were mock-up versions of reports from the Guardian and Daily Mail, among other publications.
The discovery of the Doppelgänger campaign led to the imposition of sanctions by the EU last summer on two Russian IT companies, Structura National Technologies and Social Design Agency, over their involvement in it. According to US authorities, the two companies are believed to be responsible for a similar Russian disinformation campaign in Latin America.
Facebook’s parent company, Meta, spoke at the time of the “largest and most persistent” Russian online operation to date and blocked numerous accounts involved as a result.
The analysis showed that the operators of the message-sending system appeared to take breaks at the weekends and on Russian holidays, when the number of posts noticeably reduced.
The concern in the German government, which has already been the target of misinformation campaigns and computer hacks, is how this method might be used to affect the outcome of the upcoming European elections, as well as three state elections in eastern Germany where the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) is leading in the polls.
Analysts were struck by the similarity in tone of messages reacting to the fake posts and the rhetoric used by the AfD. The party is highly critical of the government’s Ukraine policy as well as its management of everything from energy policy to education. The AfD has known links to the Kremlin and has taken a sympathetic approach towards Vladimir Putin."
FC7P8UUNCU_7HG95PX76DXSLKL,"Shooting ‘deviant’ wolves with paintball guns is legal, Dutch court rules",_,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/24/shooting-deviant-wolves-with-paintball-guns-is-legal-dutch-court-rules,"Dutch authorities can shoot “deviant” wolves that could pose a danger to the public with paintball guns, a court has ruled, as debate rages in Europe over protecting the animals.
After a lengthy legal battle, the court in Utrecht, central Netherlands, decided on Wednesday that the behaviour of some of the wolves in a national park was “a serious threat to public safety”.
One female wolf was known to approach cyclists and walkers and show no fear when photographers moved close to her, the court said.
“The fact that the wolf seems to be less and less afraid of people does not mean that the animal can no longer become aggressive and bite,” the court said in its ruling.
Other methods of scaring off the wolves at De Hoge Veluwe national park, such as shouting, had been ineffective, the court noted, and pepper spray was deemed dangerous for the animals. “There is no other satisfactory solution than shooting the wolf with a paintball gun and … it is necessary in the interest of public safety,” said the court.
The decision came as Europe grapples with its wolf population, which has bounced back from near extinction.
The European Commission said in December it wanted to change the animals’ protected status – allowing them to be hunted – after data showed they were posing a rising threat to livestock.
Brussels is asking EU member countries to revise the protection status for wolves from “strictly protected” to just “protected”, which would authorise them to be hunted under strict regulation.
The commission estimates there are about 20,300 wolves across the EU, and says that “damage to livestock has increased as the wolf population has grown”.
A commission study said wolves had killed at least 65,000 head of livestock in the EU each year: sheep and goats in 73% of cases, cattle in 19%, and horses and donkeys in 6% of cases.
The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, lost her beloved elderly pony, Dolly, last September to a wolf that got into its enclosure on her family’s rural property in northern Germany."
FCD50AWY8M_Y0XMU22IFW9N17H,World court’s interim ruling on genocide in Gaza: key takeaways,Oliver Holmes,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/26/world-courts-interim-ruling-on-genocide-in-gaza-key-takeaways-icj-israel,"The world’s court has ordered Israel to prevent genocidal acts in Gaza, including by its forces on the ground, and allow humanitarian aid into the territory.
Here are some of the key takeaways:
The international court of justice (ICJ) has not ruled on whether Israel has committed genocide – that will be decided at a later date – but its provisional ruling provides the clearest indication yet of which direction the judges are leaning.
Its 29-page court order, released on Friday, is long, convoluted and filled with legalese, but it does hint that a majority of the judges see a credible risk to Palestinians under the genocide convention.
In paragraph 74, it states that “there is a real and imminent risk that irreparable prejudice” will be caused to the rights of Palestinians in Gaza under the genocide convention.
In the order, the ICJ said Israel’s military operation “had resulted in a large number of deaths and injuries, as well as the massive destruction of homes, the forcible displacement of the vast majority of the population, and extensive damage to civilian infrastructure”.
Critically, it said it had “taken note” of a number of statements made by senior Israeli officials. These included the country’s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, saying Israel was fighting “human animals” and “we will eliminate everything”, and its president, Isaac Herzog, saying: “It’s an entire nation out there that is responsible.”
Paragraph 54 of the order stated it was the court’s view, in light of the above statements, that “at least some” of South Africa’s claims that Palestinian rights needing protection under the genocide convention were “plausible”.
Further down, it ordered Israel to “take all measures within its power to prevent and punish the direct and public incitement to commit genocide in relation to members of the Palestinian group in the Gaza Strip”.
The court agreed with most of the requests made by South Africa, including ordering humanitarian access, but notably absent was its demand for an immediate halt to Israel’s military operation. Friday’s court order did not mention the word “ceasefire”.
In a partial explanation of its decision, the court said the measures it took did not need to “be identical to those requested” by South Africa.
It could take years for the court to rule on whether Israel has committed genocide. Another genocide case, brought to the ICJ in 2019 by the Gambia against Myanmar for its mass killing and forced displacement of its Rohingya Muslim minority, is still continuing.
However, that is not to say the case will go quiet. As well as the political battle that will now be fought on how to enforce the court orders, the judges told Israel to submit a report “on all measures taken to give effect to its order” within a month.
Given that the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, criticised the court for its “willingness” to discuss the case at all – which he said was a “disgrace that will not be erased for generations” – it is unclear how the country will respond.
A cabinet minister in Netanyahu’s coalition government, Itamar Ben-Gvir, provided a shorter response to the ICJ ruling, tweeting: “Hague Shmague.”"
FGEY64VDSF_RTABXCCFWF1L6Q4,Flash floods inundate homes in San Diego: ‘It’s never been that bad’,Gabrielle Canon,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/23/flash-floods-inundate-homes-in-san-diego-its-never-been-that-bad,"A furious rainstorm unleashed record levels of rain on communities across San Diego county on Monday, inundating homes and overturning cars. Hundreds of people had to be rescued from flooded areas as the San Diego River surged over its banks, fueled by downpours that left the city grappling with the fourth wettest day in history.
States of emergencies have been declared across the county by local officials, and hundreds of unhoused people were displaced when water rushed into homeless shelters. Residents described harrowing escapes from Alpha Project’s Bridge Shelter that was quickly overtaken by waist-deep water, which had also previously flooded in 2018, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported.
California has been ravaged by storms this week, but San Diego’s aging stormwater system was overwhelmed by the heavy rain and quickly reached capacity according to the city’s stormwater department.
Eddie Ochoa, a resident of San Diego, said it was just sprinkling when he and his sister went out for breakfast on Monday morning. When they returned to their family-owned autobody shop, the entire block was flooded and his sister’s parked car had been washed away.
“All that happened within an hour,” Ochoa said, guessing that the sewers had backed up. They later found his sister’s car about three miles (4.8km) down the street.
“It’s never been that bad, ever. It’s crazy,” he said.
A whopping 4.25in of rain was dumped on nearby National City according to reports from the National Weather Service and more than 3in fell at the San Diego international airport.
During the winter, the region averages about 2in of rain a month.
Deputies pulled people to safety after water rushed into homes in the Spring Valley and Casa de Oro neighborhoods, said the San Diego countysheriff’s Lt Zee Sanchez. Other residents escaped by wading through waist-high water carrying their cats and dogs.
“Flooding is pretty widespread out there,” Sanchez said. The department aided in a swift-water rescue near Santee, he said.
No injuries were reported.
The San Diego River was flooding, the National Weather Service said, warning that crossing roads would be unsafe. The city fire department said it had rescued at least 24 people from the rushing San Diego and Tijuana rivers.
In the city’s Southcrest neighborhood, hundreds of people had to be rescued from their homes as water rushed in at about 11am, the Los Angeles Times reported.

San Diego mayor, Todd Gloria, declared a state of emergency and the city set up shelters to house displaced residents.
The clouds were beginning to clear by Tuesday morning, returning the southern Californian city to its typical balmy conditions, but more storms may be on the way next week. Still, the receding waters have left behind big messes as impacted residents begin the daunting task of clearing mud from homes.
Despite the destructively wet weather, California water officials are still concerned with below-average snowpack levels, a key component of the state’s water supply. California has seen large swings between wet and dry in recent years, and the storms were a welcome sign for those watching snow accumulations across the Sierra Nevada range. Some mountainous areas received up to 2ft of snow during last weekend’s storms.
There was also an avalanche warning through Tuesday morning for the backcountry in the mountains around the Lake Tahoe area, which might see more than a foot (30cm) of snow, according to the Sierra avalanche center in Truckee, California. The storm was expected to bring up to 8in (20cm) of snow to the lake’s shores and up to 14in (35cm) with winds gusting up to 60mph (95km/h) in the highest elevations beginning late Monday.
Forecasters believe there’s more wet weather on the way. The NWS Climate Prediction Center has logged a high chance of above-average precipitation in California and the south-west through the start of February.
Extreme weather has wreaked havoc across the US this week, after a deep freeze enveloped large parts of the country and killed dozens of people, many in road deaths or from hypothermia. A warm air reprieve is on the way for the eastern half of the country though, according to the National Weather Service, which said “a few locations may have daily high temperatures as much as 20F above seasonal average by Wednesday”."
FM3OGP88YU_YU3K8AEJSLZ9FX1,Women in Japan allowed to take part in ‘naked festival’ for first time,Justin McCurry,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/25/japan-naked-festival-hadaka-matsuri-women-allowed-inazawa-fertility-festival,"Women in Japan have been permitted to take part in an ancient ceremony, known as the naked festival, for the first time in the event’s history, albeit with modifications.
Every February, thousands of men dressed in next to nothing take part in the hadaka matsuri at a Shinto shrine in Inazawa, a town in central Japan, to drive away evil spirits over the coming year.
The festival has been regarded as off-limits to women since it was first held in the town about 1,250 years ago, but organisers will allow a group of about 40 women to take part on 22 February, according to Japanese media reports.
The women, who will be fully clothed, will make ritual offerings of bamboo grass but will not be part of the festival’s momiai climax, in which men dressed only in fundoshi – a type of traditional loincloth – tabi socks and hachimaki bandanas clash with each other as they attempt to transfer their bad luck to a “chosen man” by touching him before he is withdrawn to the safety of the shrine.
Ayaka Suzuki, who campaigned for the unofficial ban on women to be lifted, said she had wanted to take part in the festival since she was a child. “I could have participated had I been a boy,” she told reporters, according to the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper.
Suzuki added that she would use the opportunity to pray for her family’s safety and for people affected by the recent deadly earthquake on the Noto peninsula.
Organisers of Japan’s myriad festivals have come under pressure to open them up to all-comers amid concern that rural depopulation could put an end to events traditionally dominated by local men.
This month, women took part in the Katsube fire festival in Shiga prefecture for the first time in its 800-year history.
But organisers of the Somin-sai – which also features minimal clothing – in the north-east town of Oshu announced last month that the event would be held for the final time this year.
Daigo Fujinami, chief priest at the temple that hosts the 1,000-year old festival, told the Mainichi Shimbun that the decision had been prompted by the advanced ages of many local men and a lack of people to oversee the event.
Fujinami dismissed suggestions that the festival be opened up to people living outside the town, saying it would not be in keeping with “core rituals” that had been handed down by generations of locals.
While some have welcomed the revamped naked festival as a modest step forward for gender equality, other areas of traditional life in Japan are still off limits to women, including the dohyo ring used in the country’s sport of sumo.
While women compete in amateur sumo, they cannot fight professionally and are banned from even stepping on to the dohyo – a dirt-covered circle marked out with half-buried rice-straw bales – used in the six main tournaments held every year.
The rule has occasionally caused embarrassment to organisers of the centuries-old sport.
Sumo authorities battled allegations of sexism in 2018 after several women, including a nurse, rushed on to a sumo ring to administer first aid to a local mayor who had collapsed after suffering a stroke. Using the public address system, the referee repeatedly ordered them to leave the ring, but the women refused."
FR8T4IJ8YL_LL9TZV737BQPLVD,Andrew Cuomo found to have subjected 13 women to ‘sexually hostile work environment’,Martin Pengelly,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/26/andrew-cuomo-sexually-hostile-work-environment,"The former New York governor Andrew Cuomo subjected at least 13 female government employees “to a sexually hostile work environment” and retaliated against four who complained, a formal agreement between the state executive chamber and the US justice department said.
“Governor Cuomo repeatedly subjected these female employees to unwelcome, non-consensual sexual contact; ogling; unwelcome sexual comments; gender-based nicknames; comments on their physical appearances; and/or preferential treatment based on their physical appearances,” read the agreement, which was released on Friday.
Cuomo, a Democrat and son of the former New York governor Mario Cuomo, rose to national prominence during the Covid pandemic in 2020 and was widely believed to hold presidential ambitions.
He denied accusations of sexual misconduct, but Cuomo resigned in August 2021 after the New York attorney general, Letitia James, said she found 11 such claims credible. He was replaced by his lieutenant, Kathy Hochul.
Now 66, Cuomo is fighting civil lawsuits from two accusers and, in the words of the New York Times, “slowly manoeuvring toward re-entering political life”. But, the paper added on Friday, such “efforts may be sharply compromised by the justice department findings”.
The investigation by the federal civil rights division and the US attorney for the eastern district of New York opened in August 2021.
The settlement released on Friday said Cuomo “subjected at least 13 female employees of New York state, including executive chamber employees, to a sexually hostile work environment”.
The executive chamber was aware of the governor’s conduct but did not “effectively remediate the harassment on a systemic level”.
“When employees attempted to raise concerns about Cuomo’s conduct to his senior staff,” the agreement said, “Cuomo’s staff failed to follow equal employment opportunity policies and procedures to promptly report those allegations to the appropriate investigative body.
“Indeed, the executive chamber’s response was designed only to protect Cuomo from further accusations.”
The investigation “also found that Cuomo’s senior staff were aware of his conduct and retaliated against four of the women he harassed”.
The agreement listed reforms to be implemented and some undertaken under Governor Hochul, beginning with the removal of employees held to have “facilitated Cuomo’s misconduct and/or engaged in unlawful retaliation against women who raised concerns”.

Rita Glavin, a Cuomo lawyer, told the Times: “This is nothing more than a political settlement with no investigation. Governor Cuomo did not sexually harass anyone.”
But Kristen Clarke, assistant attorney general in the civil rights division, said: “Executive chamber employees deserve to work without fear of sexual harassment and harsh reprisal when they oppose that harassment.
“The conduct in the executive chamber under the former governor, the state’s most powerful elected official, was especially egregious because of the stark power differential involved and the victims’ lack of avenues to report and redress harassment.”
Hochul said: “The moment I took office, I knew I needed to root out the culture of harassment that had previously plagued the executive chamber and implement strong policies to promote a safe workplace for all employees, and [I] took immediate action to do so.”
Breon Peace, US attorney for the eastern district of New York, said: “We appreciate the governor’s stated determination to make sure that sexual harassment does not recur at the highest level of New York state government.”"
FRAFB3U49E_5QY3FV6OJZGNB9O,Is this the year of meong – a wellbeing trend I can actually master?,Emma Beddington,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/22/year-of-meong-wellbeing-trend-i-can-actually-master,"I subscribe to Vittles online magazine, because reading evocative writing about food I’m too lazy and incompetent to prepare or seek out is one of my favourite hobbies, and because I always learn something. In a recent edition, I discovered a captivating Korean suffix. “There are no thoughts, just meong, the suffix in Korean used for activities of staring into stillness, like bull meong – staring into the fire,” wrote the author, Songsoo Kim, in a beautiful article with recipes about preparing a feast that I would dearly love to eat, but absolutely will not cook.
As a black belt starer into stillness – it’s my other favourite hobby – this spoke to me deeply. I asked Kim about it and she explained meong (also written mung) is colloquially used to describe zoning out, but without a negative connotation. This, she explained, was “an organic linguistic development, as more and more people started mentioning how staring at the fire at campsites or fireplaces together is rather healing.” There are also forest, foliage and water versions of quiet, empty staring and cafes where you can “hit mung”. “It’s a moment we all need,” Kim said.
We do. I’ve always been a big fan of that Blaise Pascal saying: “All of humanity’s problems stem from man’s inability to sit quietly in a room alone,” (often whispering it crossly to myself as my husband embarks on another self-imposed DIY challenge that involves him turning off the water and wifi). If Pascal had met a smartphone, I feel like he would have added “without his phone”. We’re overstimulated and our whirring and clicking brains desperately need quiet no-thoughts time.
It’s almost irresistible to look to other places for life philosophies that can be condensed into one, usually misunderstood, word. South Korea is also home to an annual “space-out” competition, where people try to do nothing for the longest time, suggesting a desire to address mental overload and our collective need for mental stillness. And despite a brief flurry of interest, niksen – a sort-of similar Dutch term, meaning “doing nothing”, never quite achieved hygge-like global traction. So if we’re looking to adopt (and probably misunderstand) another word to improve our lives, could this be the year of meong?

FSTKVEE15A_FGPHXI3USH9D2NE,Eat early or wait for a bottomless brunch – how to dine out on the cheap,Shane Hickey,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/jan/22/eat-early-or-wait-for-a-bottomless-brunch-how-to-dine-out-on-the-cheap,"Many restaurants, usually high street chains, offer two-for-one deals and money off for holders of discount cards. The best known of these is Tastecard, which offers you 25% off the total bill, two-for-one deals and 50% off food deals, depending on the chain. However, there are conditions such as being limited to certain days of the week and having to ring ahead. Zizzi, for example, offers two-for-one deals from Sunday to Thursday, while Beefeater offers 25% off the total bill on the same days. The card costs £79.99 a year or £7.99 a month, although they are often given for free, packaged with some bank accounts, such as NatWest’s student one.
Dine (£49.99 a year or £4.99 a month) operates in a similar way – again, you need to mention the card when booking. The Gourmet Society (£34.99 a year or £5.99 a month) gives you 25% off food and drinks at participating restaurants, including chains such as Prezzo and Banana Tree, and has a 60-day free trial.
Often it is when you eat out rather than where that can shift the bill up or down. Restaurants that might be pricey for an 8.30pm à la carte can be much more reasonable if you eat before 7pm or at lunchtime.
This can especially be the case with high-end restaurants. Trishna, a Michelin-starred Indian restaurant in London, has a lunch and pre-theatre menu for three courses at £45, although it stops at 6.15pm. Eating any later and the same food can cost £70. The Peruvian restaurant Lima in Fitzrovia has a two-course menu for £28 (£36 for three) that runs between noon and 5pm – after that and the bill will be much more. The Michelin-starred Elephant in Torquay offers a two-course lunch for £29.50, well below the £95 tasting menu.
Restaurants with “all you can eat” and “bottomless brunch” options are increasingly common in the UK. Even high-end places are getting in on the act: the Nobu hotel’s £90-a-head weekend brunch gives you unlimited sushi, sashimi and ceviche, and a main course.
At more regular prices, the chain Ping Pong offers unlimited dim sum at four of its London restaurants for £26.95 on Sundays and bank holidays. Pizza Hut has a lunchtime buffet promising all-you-can-eat pizza and pasta, priced at between £7.99 and £19.99 depending on what time of the week you eat, whether you include drinks and whether it is for an adult or child.
Bottomless brunches typically offer unlimited booze, albeit often for a limited time period. The Revolution Bar chain charges between £25 and £35 for two hours of drinks and a brunch dish. TGI Fridays charges £29.95 a person for food and “unlimited” prosecco or TGI Fridays American Pilsner and some other options – again within a maximum of two hours.
Before a restaurant officially opens, it sometimes has a soft launch, where customers can taste what will be on offer, often at reduced prices. These are usually held to spread the word and resolve any problems with the menu or service before they officially open.
The Soft Launch London site has details of what launches are coming up and how to get the discounts. Some listings are established restaurants trying out a new menu or even fast food chains with a new outlet. SquareMeal, a reviews site, also features deals as well as a list of restaurants that are due to open in the near future.
Buying a qualifying product through Compare the Market (that is, all insurance apart from temporary policies and a few others) entitles you to Meerkat Meals – 25% off the whole bill or two for one at participating restaurants (Harvester and Toby Carvery among them) although sometimes only on certain days of the week.
O2 customers using the company’s Priority app have been able to get a free pint at an O’Neill’s, Ember Inn or Sizzling Pubs on Thursday evenings. Vodafone’s VeryMe Rewards programme gives a one year membership to Eat Local, which gives two for one meals and 25% off at a network of independent restaurants.
Apps from fast food restaurants such as McDonald’s, Greggs, Burger King, Subway and Chopstix sometimes have giveaways of free mains, sandwiches and hamburgers. For example, Burger King offers a free whopper with your first click-and-collect order.
Many restaurants and chains employ market research companies to send mystery diners in and report back their findings. In some instances, you can get fed and get paid for sharing your thoughts.
You can sign up with one of the companies online and then get assigned a venue, reporting back, along with pictures, when done. Mystery Dining by HGEM works with chains such as Dishoom, Pret and Itsu, among others, and says volunteers can do as many or as few assignments as they want. When applying, people are asked to write a sample report on a restaurant visit, commenting on the food, cleanliness and venue. The expenses that have been agreed for each visit will be repaid to you three or four weeks after your meal.
Service Scan covers restaurants, bars and hotels in cities around the UK and abroad and operates in a similar style.
Restaurants at catering colleges are where the chefs of the future start their career, and can give you good food at a reasonable price. The Pillars Restaurant in Ealing is the University of West London’s training restaurant, serving up a three-course dinner for £25 with dishes such as pot roast guinea fowl and chestnut gnocchi on the menu. City of Glasgow College has the Scholars’ restaurant on its campus with themed lunches at £23 a person – there is a small plates day and a seafood tasting menu on another.
The training restaurants usually have set times when you can book and can be limited to term-time openings."
FTNJA901S9_ZIR3152PXS7XSFI,Nuclear power output expected to break global records in 2025,Fiona Harvey,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/24/nuclear-power-output-expected-to-break-global-records-in-2025,"Nuclear power generation is likely to break records in 2025 as more countries invest in reactors to fuel the shift to a low-carbon global economy, while renewable energy is likely to overtake coal as a power source early next year, data has shown.
China, India, Korea and Europe are likely to have new reactors come on stream, while several in Japan are also forecast to return to generation, and French output should increase, according to a report on the state of global electricity markets published by the International Energy Agency (IEA) on Wednesday.
Electricity demand is also expected to increase around the world, fuelled largely by the move to a low-carbon economy. Electric vehicles and heat pumps, as well as many low-carbon industrial processes, require electricity rather than oil and gas.
Continuing rapid growth in renewable energy supply means these additional demands are likely to be covered in full by generation from wind, solar and other clean energy sources. Renewables will make up roughly a third of total electricity generation globally by early next year.
Dave Jones, the insights director at energy thinktank Ember, said the findings marked a potential turning point. “It’s the beginning of the end of the fossil fuel era,” he said. “Finally, the world seems like it is past peak fossil power, a crucial milestone in the energy transition. [This report] shows that 2023 will mark the end of fossil power growth. As of this year we are likely to be in a new era of declining fossil power.”
But he added: “Peaking is not enough – we need deep and rapid CO2 cuts to keep within our vanishingly small carbon budget. We are doing the right things, we just need to do them even faster.”
Fatih Birol, the IEA’s executive director, hailed the developments as a positive sign for the fight against climate breakdown, though he said far more effort was needed.
“The power sector produces more carbon dioxide emissions than any other in the world economy, so it’s encouraging to see that the rapid growth of renewables and a steady expansion of nuclear power are on course to match all the increase in global electricity demand over the next three years,” he said.
“This is largely thanks to the huge momentum behind renewables, with ever cheaper solar leading the way, and support from the important comeback of nuclear power. While more progress is needed, and fast, these are very promising trends.”
The IEA’s annual analysis of market developments and policies, Electricity 2024, published on Wednesday, showed that global electricity demand increased by 2.2% in 2023, and was likely to reach about 3.4% from 2024 to 2026. Most of the increase was expected to come from rapidly emerging economies:chiefly China, India and south-east Asia.
However, the IEA also warned that the growth of power capacity was still uneven around the world. For instance, while electricity supply has increased overall in Africa, on a per capita basis power use across the continent has remained stagnant for more than three decades.
This is a brake on economic and social development, as people in poverty turn to polluting sources of energy such as biomass and paraffin. A lack of readily available electricity also holds back children from education and imperils health whenever hospitals experience blackouts.
Birol said: “The international community needs to work with African governments to enable the urgent progress [in electricity access] that is needed.”
Africa has some of the world’s greatest potential for solar and wind generation, and many of the vital minerals needed for renewable generation components, but would-be generators face large obstacles in the form of a high cost of capital for renewable energy projects. Many governments are urging institutions such as the World Bank to adjust their practices to make such development easier."
FWQ6HWB6AM_13S21R7QZ6324MC,"More than one-third of Americans believe Israel is committing genocide, poll shows",Richard Luscombe,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/24/americans-believe-israel-committing-genocide-poll,"More than one in three Americans believe Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians, a poll published on Wednesday has found.
According to the Economist/YouGov poll, roughly equal numbers of adults believe Israel’s military campaign against Palestinians, which is estimated to have killed more than 25,000 people since 7 October, amounts to genocide: 35% say it is, 36% say it isn’t, with 29% undecided.
Among younger Americans, and along political lines, divisions are more prominent. Almost half of those surveyed aged 18-29, 49%, say Israel is committing genocide, with 24% disagreeing and 27% uncertain.
The figures are broadly similar for registered Democrats, who believe 49%-21% in the genocide characterization, while 30% are undecided. Republicans are far more supportive of Israel’s actions, with 57% of respondents saying there is no genocide, only 18% saying there is, and exactly one-quarter unsure.
The polling, which took place between 21 and 23 January, comes as the international court of justice (ICJ) in The Hague prepares to deliver on Friday an interim ruling on South Africa’s genocide case against Israel, and a separate lawsuit against Joe Biden’s administration for “failing to prevent genocide” advances.
The ICJ case, which was heard over two days earlier this month, is seen as an important gauge of international sentiment over Israel’s campaign in Gaza. South Africa claimed that more than 50 countries agreed with its assertion Israel had shown “chilling” and “incontrovertible” intent to commit genocide in Gaza during its military response to the Hamas attacks of 7 October.
“This court has the benefit of the past 13 weeks of evidence that shows, incontrovertibly, a pattern of conduct and related intention that justifies a plausible claim of genocidal acts,” the South African lawyer Adila Hassim said.
Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said the allegation was false. “We are fighting terrorists, we are fighting lies. Israel is accused of genocide while it is fighting against genocide,” he said.
Meanwhile, a first hearing is scheduled on Friday in a federal lawsuit brought by the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) claiming the Biden administration failed to carry out its duties under US and international law to stop Israel from killing civilians in Gaza.
“The US has the means available to have a deterrent effect on Israeli officials now pursuing genocidal acts against the Palestinian people in Gaza,” the complaint says.

The US outright rejects the claim that Israel is violating the UN convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide.

FXHWULQ7XE_3D1HVG8O3K4CL8N,UK airports’ scanner delays mean 100ml liquid limit will remain,Gwyn Topham,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/22/uk-airport-scanner-liquid-limit-heathrow-gatwick-manchester-ban-summer,"Britain’s biggest airports are to miss the June deadline to install new security scanners, meaning the government will not be able to relax the ban on passengers carrying liquids in their hand luggage this summer.
Heathrow, Gatwick and Manchester Airports Group said that they hope to complete the upgrade of their scanners by 2025.
The next generation of security equipment – whose computed tomography (CT) scans provide clearer, more accurate 3D images – is already fully in use at some UK airports.
At London City and Teesside, where the scanners are in use, passengers are not required to remove laptops or liquid containers from hand luggage and can take larger bottles in their carry-on cases – although they may not be able to bring them back from their destination, where other rules apply.
However, in most airports liquid can only be taken through security in containers of 100ml or less under UK legislation, despite the capability of the new scanners. The Department for Transport is not expected to change its rules to allow up to 2l bottles until all airports are fully compliant.
The technology should, however, speed up security, with fewer rules to delay passengers who may not be travelling with checked-in bags. Currently even small tubes of toothpaste or other toiletries have to be removed from hand luggage and put in another clear bag.
Restrictions on liquids were introduced in 2006 after a plot to blow up a transatlantic flight was uncovered.
The government had originally set a deadline of 2022 for the new CT scanners to be introduced, which in 2022 was pushed back to June 2024.
Most UK airports have started implementation, but the weight, size, cost and training requirements for the new equipment has made it a lengthy process. Some smaller airports, many of which nearly went out of business during Covid, initially struggled to meet the multimillion-pound cost of new scanners. Other airports have had to expand buildings or replace floors to bear the weight of the substantially heavier machines.
Security staff, who were in short supply in the UK during a chaotic post-pandemic recovery, also need time off to be trained, and bigger airports have struggled to find time and space to install and implement scanners while still running busy operations.
Heathrow is spending about £1bn on the new equipment, having to upgrade a total of 146 security lanes across four terminals – more than all other UK airports combined.
MAG, which owns Manchester, Stansted and East Midlands airports, said the scanners would be introduced “lane by lane” at its airport. A spokesperson said it was making good progress, but it was “a complex programme of work requiring the expansion of terminal facilities, while at the same time maintaining operations during construction”.

It expects to have many scanners in place by June, but not complete the programme until 2025.
A spokesperson for Gatwick said the airport “will have made significant progress installing state-of-the-art next-generation security scanners by June 2024 in both terminals”, and expects to complete work by spring 2025.
While the government could sanction airports for non-compliance after June, it is understood to be preparing to grant extensions for businesses struggling to meet the deadline.
A DfT spokesperson said: “The UK has some of the most robust aviation security measures in the world and this cutting-edge technology will enhance security and boost the passenger experience.
“We are in regular contact with airports as they move towards June 2024 deadline for upgrading their screening equipment and processes. For security reasons we don’t talk in detail about aviation security measures.”"
G000R77JFE_NL870FW9IVJWXGU,‘Our contribution to a cleaner world’: How Kenya found an extraordinary power source beneath its feet,Peter Muiruri,_,20240118,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/25/our-contribution-to-a-cleaner-world-how-kenya-found-an-extraordinary-power-source-beneath-its-feet,"The Kenyan stretch of the Great Rift Valley is breathtaking. Vast plains between the two escarpments teem with wildlife, creating one of the world’s largest animal migrations – the Mara-Serengeti wildebeest migration. The alkaline lakes in the east African rift system are home to elegant and graceful flamingos, pink wonders that reels in visitors from around the world and are a vital cog in Kenya’s thriving tourism industry.
But it is what lies beneath the valley floor that has had a literally seismic impact on Kenya in recent years – vast geothermal resources that have made the country a world leader in clean energy.
Peketsa Mangi is the general manager in charge of geothermal development at KenGen, the country’s energy generating company. “We are lucky the African rift runs through Kenya,” he told me when I visited last week. “We just happened to be in the right place with several volcanic centres. Olkaria is one of these centres.”
Mangi and I are sitting in a gazebo overlooking a spa pool that uses brine, the byproduct of the geothermal development process. Visitors from all over Kenya come to enjoy the pool’s “healing” properties. With a power plant humming away nearby, my first visit to the heart of Kenya’s geothermal power generation turns out to be a lesson on what is going on below our feet.
According to the Geological Society, the Somalian and Nubian tectonic plates pulled away in opposite directions about 25m years ago, with the surface between the two fault lines sinking and bringing magmatic fluids closer to Earth’s surface and creating the famous rift, a vast valley that stretches 6,400km from Jordan to Mozambique. Under the valley, water percolates easily and comes into contact with hot rocks found 1-3km beneath the surface, creating a mix of superheated water and steam at 75% and 25% respectively, with temperatures averaging 300C (572F) and pressures of 1,000 PSI. These are, it turns out, the perfect conditions for generating geothermal energy.
“This is the steam we are tapping to run the turbines that generate electricity. It is rough down there, and that is where we go,” says Mangi. “A dangerous but necessary mission.”
Mangi has observed the behaviour of the valley for 27 years and knows exactly where to drill a well that will yield geothermal power. “Kenya has developed the capacity for precision geoscientific studies that help us to identify potential areas to drill. Exploration and drilling are cost-intensive endeavours and investors don’t want to go to a greenfield without confirmed viable resources,” he says.
Geothermal energy had its start in the small settlement of Larderello, Italy in 1904. The small plant provided a mere 10kW of energy, just enough to power five lightbulbs. Since then, a number of countries have dug deep in order to exploit similar resources. The US, Indonesia, the Philippines, Turkey and New Zealand are the top five geothermal power producers in the world.
In Kenya, the search for underground energy began nearly 70 years ago, but stalled almost immediately. In 1956, the government drilled two wells specifically to harness geothermal power, at a depth of 950 metres and 1,200 metres respectively. “Temperatures averaged 235C (445F) but the wells failed to discharge due to poor permeability as the surrounding area was a bit solid,” says Mangi.
Then the oil crisis of the early 1970s happened and, once again, Kenya peered beneath the ground for an answer. Global organisations including United Nations Development Programme, The World Bank and Japan International Cooperation Agency stepped in to provide financial and technical support for further exploration. In 1971, a well was drilled and discharged. Everybody got excited again, Mangi says. Between 1981 and 1985, Kenya had an installed capacity of 45MW through the first three power plants in Olkaria.
“We don’t know where the country would be had the oil crisis not hastened this process,” Mangi says. “Geothermal is available 24/7 for 365 days. It is not affected by climate fluctuations since we are using water that has accumulated deep in the ground over the millenniums. The alternative would have been the installation of diesel generators that pollute the environment. This is our contribution to a cleaner world.”
Now, here at Olkaria, near the flower-growing town of Naivasha 56 miles (90km) from Nairobi, there are close to 300 geothermal wells providing steam that runs turbines in five geothermal power plants operated by KenGen.
The power plants and 15 wellheads have a combined capacity of 799MW. With additional geothermal power generated by independent power producers, Kenya’s total geothermal power capacity is 988.7MW, putting the country in sixth position globally (and first in Africa) in terms of geothermal power development.
As a result, Kenya sources up to 91% of its energy from renewables: 47% geothermal, 30% hydro, 12% wind and 2% solar. The country hopes to transition fully to renewables by 2030, with KenGen saying the country has the potential to increase its capacity to as much as 10,000MW of geothermal energy. That would more than match peak demand in Kenya, currently about 2,000MW. Peak time consumption in the UK is about 61,000MW.
Several wells sit within Hell’s Gate national park, the location that inspired the movie The Lion King. The park is patrolled by antelopes, giraffes, zebras and buffaloes, all roaming freely and oblivious to the immense energy trapped beneath their hooves and delivered to the power plants through a labyrinth of a high-pressure piping system averaging 74 miles (120km).
“Geothermal power is clean and poses no harm to the wildlife as the animals have adapted to this system,” says Gastone Odhiambo, a safety officer at the power plants. “These pipes are delivering steam to the turbines at 180C (356F) to produce 11 kilovolts of electricity that is then stepped up to 220 kilovolts to travel long distances. You need a sober mind since a single mishap can bring the country to a halt.”
Odhiambo’s childhood home in western Kenya did not have electricity. “I grew up in darkness,” he tells me at the plant’s control room full of switches, dials and strobe lights. “It is a heavy responsibility to help in generating clean energy that can go for ages. When you understand the process, how your tasks affect the day to day running of the economy, you remain humble.”
The Kenyan president, William Ruto, is now spearheading an African campaign to wean the continent off fossil fuels. In September last year, a declaration was signed, which called for reform of international finance and castigated the global north for the skewed global financial system that makes it difficult for Africa to harness its vast renewable energy resources.
“Despite Africa having an estimated 40% of the world’s renewable energy resources, only $60bn or 2% of $3tn renewable energy investments in the last decade have come to Africa,” read the declaration.
While Kenya and the rest of Africa await the financial reforms, it is a fulfilling assignment for the team that works at the geothermal plants in Olkaria, as Mangi sums it up: “A good day here is when the whole process works like clockwork. When all scientific studies and financial resources are poured into the ground, a well is drilled and it discharges, that is power to the country. You feel the investments are well used. And such good days are many.”"
G3VMVX57UP_WVOG12P193UKM0A,"Nearly 65,000 US rape victims could not get an abortion in their state, analysis shows",Jessica Glenza,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/25/abortion-after-rape-laws-bans,"Nearly 65,000 rape-related pregnancies likely occurred in the 14 US states with near-total abortion bans following the US supreme court’s 2022 Dobbs decision – yet just 10 legal abortions are performed monthly on average in these states, researchers found in a new analysis.
The data demonstrates that abortion bans likely make it impossible for most victims of rape to obtain abortions in their home states, even for the minority of people who live in states with exemptions for rape, researchers said.
The figures come as rape exemptions have fallen out of favor among anti-abortion activists and politicians, despite the fact that most Americans, including Republicans, believe that victims of assault should have access to abortion, and that most Americans believe abortion is “morally acceptable”.
“The large number of estimated rape-related pregnancies in abortion ban states compared with the 10 or fewer legal abortions per month occurring in each of those states indicates that persons who have been raped and become pregnant cannot access legal abortions in their home state, even in states with rape exceptions,” researchers wrote in a research letter in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine.
Although the observational nature of the study might draw criticism, it is part of an important and growing number of analyses documenting the effect of abortion bans on women’s lives, health and fertility. This growing body of evidence crosses disciplines, with contributions from clinicians, economists and researchers.
In July 2022, the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, a nearly 50-year-old precedent that provided a constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy, in a case called Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization (or simply “Dobbs”).
The decision caused a seismic change in reproductive rights in the US – states were suddenly permitted to ban the procedure. Fourteen moved to do so immediately and almost totally, with five of those providing exemptions for victims of rape. Twenty-five million women of childbearing age now live in states that ban the procedure.
In JAMA Internal Medicine, researchers estimated the number of women who are likely victims of “completed” vaginal rape – forced and/or drug/alcohol–facilitated vaginal penetration – using estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of intimate partner violence. They then determined the fraction that were likely to be of childbearing age (15-45) using Bureau of Justice Statistics data, arriving at a figure of roughly 520,000 total rapes. (Importantly, as noted by JAMA, data from BJS undercounts rapes.) Finally, they apportioned assaults to the 14 US states that ban abortion using the Federal Bureau of Investigations’ uniform crime statistics, which include rapes reported to law enforcement in 2019.
The estimate found that the overwhelming majority of rape-related pregnancies, 58,979, likely occurred in states without exceptions to their abortion ban. Texas alone accounted for as much as 45% of that number (26,313) because of its large population and total ban without exceptions.

An estimated 5,586 rape-related pregnancies occurred in states with exceptions for victims of rape. Although not all women who become pregnant from a rape want an abortion, those who do are likely confronted with the reality that their state offers no access to abortion. Researchers found that even states with exemptions likely fail to provide any meaningful opportunity to terminate a pregnancy, given the low number of legal abortions per month in these states.
At least in part, researchers surmise this is driven by requirements for victims to report rape to law enforcement, which few feel comfortable doing. It would likely be worsened by the near total lack of providers who would be willing to perform an abortion in a state with severe criminal and professional penalties for doing so.
The analysis stops short of estimating the number of women who might have been forced to carry a rape-related pregnancy to term.

Warning that urgent action was required to ensure they would back the government in a crunch vote next month, the MPs from all wings of the party said extra financial support was needed to prevent more councils going bust amid a £4bn funding shortfall.
Growing numbers of councils across England warn they face effective bankruptcy amid soaring costs and rising pressure on services, compounded by years of austerity-driven cuts and local missteps. Among the biggest casualties so far are Birmingham and Nottingham, as well as Woking in Surrey and Thurrock in Essex.
The letter, coordinated by the County Councils Network and the county all-party parliamentary group, warned millions of people in traditionally safe Tory seats were facing a “double whammy” of cuts to local services and higher council tax rates.
Senior figures who have signed the letter include the former immigration minister Robert Jenrick – who voted against the government over its Rwanda bill – and former cabinet ministers Priti Patel, Thérèse Coffey, Damian Green and Brandon Lewis.
As a local government secretary under Boris Johnson, Jenrick had been responsible for council funding before he was replaced by Michael Gove in 2021. Four former local government ministers were also signatories, including Jake Berry, the former Tory party chair.
Ministers are now consulting on a financial settlement for local government funding, which will determine how much support councils in England will receive for 2024-25, with a vote due in parliament in early February.
In December, ministers announced a £64bn funding package for English councils, an increase of 6.5% on the amount a year earlier. However, local government leaders warn the plan is insufficient to prevent more councils from going bust, and is reliant on authorities pushing through 5% council tax increases.
Representing 37 county and unitary authorities across England, the County Councils Network said its members were facing “extreme financial pressure” and were on track to overspend by £650m this year, with these councils facing a total £4bn funding deficit over three years.
Writing in the letter to Sunak, the 44 Conservative MPs, alongside one Liberal Democrat and one Labour MP, threatened to vote against the government. “There is still an opportunity to rectify the situation and ensure MPs are able to support the vote on the local government settlement within the House of Commons in early February.
“We would therefore urge you to do all you can to use the final local government finance settlement to provide additional funding for local government to ensure that the councils in our areas can continue to provide the services that our residents depend upon on a regular basis.”
A spokesperson for the government said it was “now considering the responses carefully” to its consultation on the funding settlement. “Councils are ultimately responsible for their own finances, but we remain ready to talk to any concerned about its financial position.”"
G8PRJ3YG42_DGB26DDTVKMOY20,Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 702,_,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/26/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-702,"Russia and Ukraine continue to dispute the circumstances surrounding the crash of a Russian military transport plane in the border region of Belgorod on Wednesday. The crash killed all 74 people on board. Russia claims the plane was carrying 65 Ukrainian PoW who were to be swapped, and that Ukrainian forces shot it down. Ukrainian officials on Thursday did not explicitly deny shooting down the aircraft but said they could not confirm that Ukrainian soldiers on their way to a prisoner exchange were onboard the plane. Ukraine’s human rights commissioner, Dmytro Lubinets, told Reuters the passenger list shared in Russian media of Ukrainian prisoners of war had discrepancies in it. “We found Ukrainian citizens in the list who have already been previously exchanged,” he said.
Andrey Kartapolov, who heads Russia’s Duma defence committee, told lawmakers on Thursday: “The Ukrainian side was officially warned, and 15 minutes before the plane entered the zone they were given complete information.” Ukraine’s military intelligence spokesperson Andriy Yusov insisted that Kyiv had not received either a written or verbal request from Russia to secure airspace around the area of Belgorod, and that two other Russian military transport planes, an An-26 and an An-72, were simultaneously in the airspace.
A Moscow court has jailed Igor Girkin, a prominent ultra-nationalist critic of Vladimir Putin. A former officer for Russia’s FSB security service, Girkin was arrested last summer in his apartment and charged with “calls for extremism” after months of public criticism in which he accused Putin of failing to pursue the war in Ukraine with enough vigour.
Darya Trepova, 26, has been jailed for 27 years for delivering a bomb that exploded in the hands of a pro-war military blogger last year, killing him on the spot. The Russian woman was convicted by a St Petersburg court of charges including terrorism in connection with the death Vladlen Tatarsky. He was killed by a bomb concealed inside a statuette that Trepova had presented to him as a gift during a talk he was giving in a St Petersburg cafe.
Several major Ukrainian state organisations reported cyber attacks on their systems, in the latest wave that a source close to the government blamed on Russian intelligence. Ukraine’s state-run energy company Naftogaz said one of the data centres had been hit by a “large-scale cyberattack.”
The Council of Europe’s parliamentary assembly (Pace) in Strasbourg has unanimously adopted a resolution about the fate of Ukrainian children forcibly transferred and deported by Russia. It calls on national parliaments to adopt resolutions “recognising these crimes as genocide” and asks the international community to collaborate with Ukraine to trace and repatriate missing children. The international criminal court (ICC) in The Hague issued an arrest warrant in March 2023 for Vladimir Putin for overseeing the abduction of Ukrainian children.
Lithuania’s foreign minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis, visited Kyiv, while Vladimir Putin was in Russia’s Baltic Sea exclave of Kaliningrad, which borders Lithuania. The Kremlin said the visit had not been intended as a message to Nato members.
Sweden’s prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, has responded to Hungary’s Viktor Orbán wanting more talks between the two nations over Sweden’s application to join Nato by suggesting the pair meet in Brussels. Orbán had extended an invitation for the discussion to take place in Budapest. The speaker of Hungary’s parliament, László Kövér, has said there is no urgency to resolve the situation, and that attempts by opposition parties to convene an emergency session of parliament to debate it are likely to fail."
GE93T0Y0SR_549UOA9764EN47E,Off the charts: how a Polynesian canoe inspired a renaissance in traditional seafaring,_,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/25/hokulea-ocean-canoe-hawaii-traditional-polynesian-seafaring-navigation,"A double-hulled Polynesian sailing canoe glides up to a busy dock in San Diego, California. Hōkūleʻa’s two short wooden masts are dwarfed by the historic schooner that escorted the boat into the harbour. Dozens of small outrigger canoes trail in its wake, honouring the crew’s arrival.
Once the docklines are secure, Hōkūleʻa’s 13 crew members put on ceremonial leis – floral garlands – and request permission from the local Indigenous tribe to come ashore. In response, 30 members of the Kumeyaay Nation sing and dance to welcome them to their native lands. Hundreds of onlookers snap photos before joining the festivities at a nearby park.
The celebration in San Diego is partly to honour Hōkūleʻa’s 2,800-mile voyage down the west coast of North America with no compass, charts or GPS (not to mention no galley or toilet).
It is also about honouring this small craft’s leading role in inspiring a cultural renaissance in traditional sailing that has rippled well beyond the Hawaiian shores where it was launched 49 years ago.
“The fact that it’s possible to conduct navigation across thousands of miles of open ocean without instruments is inspirational for all of us,” says Ray Ashley, director of the Maritime Museum of San Diego, where Hōkūleʻa docked.
“The ability to solve problems in ways that rely on logic and intelligence and courage and all the things this canoe [crew] embodies is something that’s sorely needed now, which is why this vessel and the voyage she’s embarked on are crucially important.”
Last June, Hōkūleʻa left the Alaskan port of Juneau on the Moananuiākea voyage, a four-year circumnavigation of the Pacific Ocean. So far, it has visited 35 communities and had nine crew changes. It still has 37,000 miles (60,000km) and three years to go before the voyage is complete.
“We’re trying to learn as much as we can about who we are and who our ancestors were, and looking for the balance between science and Indigenous cultures,” says Bruce Blankenfeld, voyaging director of the Polynesian Voyaging Society (PVS) and a master navigator who has sailed all over the world onboard Hōkūleʻa.
Standing on the boat’s deck with the lights of San Diego behind him, Blankenfeld adds that practising and teaching traditional navigation “is how we keep validating it as a living culture”.
At the helm, manoeuvring Hōkūleʻa’s long wooden steering oar, is the captain, Tamiko Fernelius. “This canoe connects people from all different countries and islands,” she says.
Fernelius, 45, has worked on ships most of her adult life and began learning traditional navigation 14 years ago. “Navigation is observing nature and paying attention to your surroundings and yourself. The more you understand and make sense of these things, the more you will respect them and want to take care of them,” she says.
First launched in O‘ahu in 1975, Hōkūleʻa means “star of gladness” – the Hawaiian name for the zenith star used in celestial navigation, better known as Arcturus, which appears directly over Hawaii. PVS constructed the replica of an ocean-voyaging canoe to disprove the theory that ancient Polynesians drifted across the Pacific instead of purposefully navigating to their desired destinations.
This idea had been popularised by the Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdahl, who crossed the ocean on a balsa-wood raft named the Kon-Tiki in the late 1940s in support of his notion that the inhabitants of the Polynesian Islands originally came from South America.
Archaeological evidence suggests that Polynesian voyagers can be traced back to the Indigenous people of Taiwan between 3,500 and 5,000 years ago. But until Hōkūleʻa demonstrated otherwise, many western historians and anthropologists believed that Pacific islands were populated by “people drifting downwind on rafts from South America, or fishermen being blown out to sea, or people just accidentally running into islands”, Ashley says.
In 1976, PVS asked Mau Piailug, a master navigator from Satawal in Micronesia, to guide Hōkūleʻa on a 2,400-mile test voyage from Hawaii to Tahiti without modern instruments. When they successfully arrived in Papeete a month later, more than half the island’s population came out to greet them.
“We tend to think of great cultural achievements in terms of paintings or works of literature or buildings like pyramids or temples. But I think all of those things pale in comparison to what was accomplished more than 1,000 years ago by Polynesians,” says Ashley.
Wayfinding is an ancient and highly complex skill. For instance, for Hōkūleʻa’s ocean voyages to Tahiti, the canoe’s navigator must memorise the relative positions of about 200 different stars and watch where they rise and set to ensure the boat arrives safely at a small island in a vast sea.
But when it is cloudy at night, wayfinders must find their position and direction of travel using other clues, such as the direction of the waves or the flight path of certain birds.
While Polynesians travelled further than most early explorers, they are not the only example of cultures that used impressive methods to navigate. For instance, the Inuit of Greenland carved driftwood in the shape of coastlines to create tactile maps for their journeys over Arctic ice. In Siberia, the Evenki use rivers as landmarks when hunting reindeer. The Pitjantjatjara in Australia use the smell of plants and seasonal changes to identify their routes.

The revival of wayfinding in Hawaii is “delightful”, says Hugo Spiers, a professor of cognitive neuroscience at University College London, who has researched traditional methods of navigation.
However, he also emphasises that a few pockets in the Pacific never lost “their original, traditional knowledge that has been maintained and passed on”, such as on Taumako, in the Solomon Islands, and the atoll of Satawal in Micronesia.
“As society has gone on, we’ve mostly lost that connection to the natural landscape,” says Spiers. He believes that traditional navigation fosters an appreciation of the landscape, including the need to stem habitat loss and the climate crisis. “It’s a real mistake if we jettison some of these powerful methods developed in the past,” he says. “We will regret it.”
The first voyages on Hōkūleʻa sparked a renaissance of many Hawaiian traditions that had disappeared after Europeans colonised the islands. Today, Hawaiian children learn the native language in school, along with hula dances, traditional chants and celestial navigation.
Having covered more than 140,000 miles, Hōkūleʻa has inspired other revivals of seafaring traditions around the world. Indigenous communities in Aotearoa (the Māori name for New Zealand), Tonga, Samoa, Tahiti and the Cook Islands have all built their own voyaging canoes and sail them using traditional navigation techniques.
Yarrow Vaara, a member of the Tlingit clan in south-east Alaska, saw how the Hawaiians were building voyaging canoes and co-founded the One People Canoe Society in Juneau to “bring back the tradition of using our waterways as a mode of transportation for our communities”. When Hōkūleʻa last visited San Diego in 1995, it inspired the local Chamorro community (a group indigenous to the Mariana Islands) to build their own outrigger canoe.
One of the ways the Hawaiians have so successfully revitalised their voyaging traditions is by fostering a community where everyone is welcome onboard – regardless of ethnicity, age or gender – as long as they are willing to share in the work.
Fernelius is a perfect example: born in Okinawa, Japan, she moved to Hawaii in 2009 and began volunteering for PVS to learn about wayfinding. She has always felt welcome.
“Everybody has a different background but once you come on deck, you’re ‘ohana, you’re family,” Fernelius says.
But this inclusive atmosphere was not part of traditional Polynesian sailing customs. In most Polynesian cultures “women couldn’t even touch the shadow of the canoe”, much less sail, captain or navigate the boats, says Nainoa Thompson, master navigator and president of PVS. But PVS has changed that because “in our world, equality matters”.
About a third of the crew on the Moananuiākea voyage are in their early 20s. Most learned traditional sailing and navigation at Hawaii’s private Kamehameha high schools, which teach children of Native Hawaiian ancestry in traditional culture and practices.
Today, some children on the islands are learning these skills even earlier. “Little preschoolers are chanting the star compass faster than I could,” says Jonah Apo, 23, a watch captain and protocol officer onboard Hōkūleʻa.
Apo believes that the Moananuiākea voyage will serve as a call to action for more people of all ages to help heal the oceans and the wider environment. This is especially relevant with the effects of the climate emergency.
“Record-breaking temperatures, an increase of storms – it makes our ability to voyage a lot riskier. It has changed sail plans for this voyage and raises the alarm even more that change needs to happen.”"
GGGHR0LVT1_06I86K0T0P3G2EP,‘Artists don’t do it for money’: Pacific Island creative wins Artes Mundi prize,Steven Morris,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/25/pacific-island-creative-wins-artes-mundi-prize-taloi-havini,"An artist from a small Pacific island who has found unexpected resonances with her work in the mountains, post-industrial landscapes and people of Wales has won the Artes Mundi prize, one of the UK’s most important contemporary arts awards.
Taloi Havini, who is from Buka Island in Bougainville, picked up the £40,000 prize at a ceremony in Cardiff, the home of the biennial exhibition and prize on Thursday evening.
Havini admitted that before becoming one of the seven artists nominated for the prize, which is in its 10th iteration, she knew very little about Wales. “I had no idea about it. I had certainly never been to Wales,” she said.
But it has turned out there was common ground between her work and the two places her pieces are being shown – Mostyn in Llandudno, north Wales, and Chapter Arts Centre in Cardiff.
Mostyn is hosting her immersive video installation, Habitat, which explores the devastation caused by Australia’s exploitation of the copper reserves in Bougainville.
Havini said after visiting the coastal town of Llandudno, she ventured inland to view the impact slate mining had had on north Wales on the landscape and local people.
“I saw the importance of the mountains, the waterways. I was taken to the slate museum and saw how those communities depended on mining – and then it ended,” she said. “In strange ways there were similarities to Bougainville. It’s why I do what I do, speak to the human experience.”
Havini talked to the Guardian before the prize-giving in front of another of her works, Hyena (day and night), which dominates the wall of the bustling cafe at Chapter Arts Centre. It consists of a 1970s slide blown up to giant proportions showing women from her father’s family collecting shells from a reef and on top of it three light boxes featuring images of bright coral.
She was tired after a trying journey from the Pacific involving five flights and two train trips but was delighted to see the work again in a communal space where people were going about their business – parents looking after babies, cinema fans waiting before a film, people having coffee and cakes. It is about themes such as community and cycles of life so she felt the setting was appropriate.
For the first time this year, the Artes Mundi showed the work across five venues in four towns and cities almost the length and breadth of Wales. The Guardian art writer Jonathan Jones said the exhibition “plunges you into a polyglot assembly of artists from all over the world dealing with problems and projects” – and pointed out that spreading it across the country meant you would have to take a week off to see it all.
Nigel Prince, the director of Artes Mundi, said taking the exhibition across the country had proved popular with nearly 100,000 people seeing the work.
He said there had been lovely moments of unexpected serendipity. For example, a piece by the Colombian artist Carolina Caycedo featuring a salmon narrator was being shown at the Oriel Davies Gallery in Newtown, mid-Wales, which turned out to be close to UK salmon spawning grounds.
When she was in Llandudno, Havini was introduced to a woman in north Wales, Bethan Mair Williams, whose parents had taught in Papua New Guinea for half a century and happened to know members of the artist’s family. Williams is doing guided tours of Havini’s work at Mostyn.
Havini said she had not expected to win the prize and found it humbling. “I’m interested in conversation and dialogue. To be even nominated was amazing. Artists don’t do it for the money, they do it for other things but it enables an artist to keep going.
“I think it’s going to mean a lot for Bougainville. It means a lot to me that my people’s Indigenous ancestral stories have had a presence in Cardiff and Llandudno.”
The exhibition runs until 25 February 2024."
GGHC798592_OZ3QTEM4JCI8YAI,The Guardian view on Modi in Ayodhya: an alarming new era for India,Editorial,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/22/the-guardian-view-on-modi-in-ayodhya-an-alarming-new-era-for-hindu-nationalism,"Monday’s inauguration of the new Ram Mandir in Ayodhya by India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, was a moment decades in the making. Yet it also came too early. Despite the grand spectacle of the ceremony, with celebrities, tycoons and politicians in attendance, the temple is still incomplete. There is an obvious explanation for this rushed endeavour, and it is not religious. India will go to the polls in late spring and while Mr Modi is all but guaranteed to win a third term, he wants a large majority for his Bharatiya Janata party (BJP).
Mr Modi rode to power, and has entrenched it, on the back of rightwing Hindu nationalism. On Monday he went beyond the exploitation of ethno-religious sentiment. He did not merely attend the ceremony; he carried out rituals. Religion and authoritarianism have proceeded hand-in-hand in recent years. But few strongmen have melded the political and religious to quite this degree. As his biographer, Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, observed, the event cast him as “the high priest of Hinduism”, disquieting some religious leaders.
The constitution still calls India a secular republic. But the facts on the ground suggest otherwise. Mr Modi’s supporters treat the idea of secularism as a foreign imposition on a grand civilisation, and as camouflage for the mistreatment and suppression of Hindus. In reality it is their aggressive chauvinism that has cost Indian society dearly, and it is Muslims who are treated as second-class citizens. Human Rights Watch warned last year of the government’s “systematic discrimination and stigmatisation of religious and other minorities, particularly Muslims” and of increasing violence by BJP supporters against targeted groups.
The new temple is not just a symbol of these political struggles, but part of them. It stands on the site of the 16th-century Babri Masjid mosque, built by the Mughal emperor Babur, and razed in 1992 by a Hindu nationalist mob who believed a temple previously stood there; Ayodhya is said to be the birthplace of the deity Lord Ram. The BJP had inflamed sentiment and BJP politicians stood and watched as thousands tore down the mosque. Its destruction sparked communal violence in which more than 2,000 people died. Then, in 2019, the supreme court ruled that the demolition of the mosque had been illegal – but that nonetheless the site belonged to Hindus, allowing the new building’s construction.
Ayodhya’s story was central to the BJP’s rise. But while Congress and other opposition parties boycotted the ceremony, they have failed to mount an effective challenge to Mr Modi’s dangerous majoritarianism and have at times succumbed to its dominance. The message is not simply of Hindu triumph, but of grievance and revenge. “We must not bow down any more. We must not sit down any more,” Mr Modi said on Monday.
Despite the lengthy history of the Ayodhya dispute, he described the consecration as “the beginning of a new era”. It is not merely that thousands more mosques are being targeted nor that Muslims in Ayodhaya and beyond feel more vulnerable than ever. Many believe that the prime minister will rewrite the constitution if he gains a sufficient majority, though he has dismissed such speculation. Monday may mark another fateful step towards that moment. It may also indicate that he does not need to change the words on paper when he has reshaped his country so effectively already."
GJGVONLHYH_5AJMTKFSMN807DB,Proud Boys member gets six years in prison for Capitol riot after insulting judge,_,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/24/proud-boys-capitol-rioter-sentenced-marc-bru,"A man who stormed the US Capitol with fellow Proud Boys far-right extremist group members was sentenced on Wednesday to six years in prison after he berated and insulted the judge who punished him.
Marc Bru repeatedly interrupted chief judge James Boasberg before the sentence was handed down, calling him a “clown” and a “fraud” presiding over a “kangaroo court”.
The judge warned Bru that he could be kicked out of the courtroom if he continued to disrupt the proceedings.
“You can give me 100 years and I’d do it all over again,” said Bru, who was handcuffed and shackled.
“That’s the definition of no remorse in my book,” the judge said.
Prosecutors described Bru as one of the least remorseful rioters who assaulted the Capitol on 6 January 2021 when extremist supporters of Donald Trump, encouraged by the then outgoing US president broke into the Capitol to try to stop the certification by a joint session of Congress of Joe Biden’s victory over Trump in the 2020 presidential election.
Lawmakers were chased out of the Capitol amid threats to their lives, as law enforcement came under siege and were physically attacked. Biden’s win was certified in the early hours of 7 January 2021, after the Capitol was cleared, and he was sworn in as president, peacefully, later that month after Trump left the White House but refused to attend the inauguration of his successor.
Prosecutors said Bru planned for an armed insurrection – a so-called “January 6 2.0” attack – to take over the government in Portland, Oregon, several weeks after the deadly riot in Washington DC.
“He wanted a repeat of January 6, only he implied this time would be more violent,” prosecutors wrote in a court filing ahead of his sentencing.
Bru has been representing himself with an attorney on standby. He has spewed anti-government rhetoric that appears to be inspired by the sovereign citizen movement. At the start of the hearing, Bru demanded that the judge and a prosecutor turn over five years of their financial records.
The judge gave him a 10-minute break to confer with his standby lawyer before the hearing resumed with more interruptions.
“I don’t accept any of your terms and conditions,” Bru said. “You’re a clown and not a judge.”
Prosecutors had warned the court that Bru intended to disrupt his sentencing. On Tuesday, he called in to a nightly vigil outside the jail where he and other rioters are being held. He told supporters of the detained January 6 defendants that he would “try to put on a good show” at his sentencing.
Trump has taken to calling such defendants “hostages”, while out on the campaign trail as he aims to win the Republican nomination and take on Biden again in the 2024 presidential election.
Boasberg convicted Bru of seven charges, including two felonies, after hearing trial testimony without a jury in October.
Bru flew from Portland, Oregon, to Washington a day before Trump’s “Stop the Steal” rally near the White House. Before Trump’s speech, he joined dozens of other Proud Boys in marching to the Capitol and was one of the first rioters to breach a restricted area. Bru grabbed a barricade and shoved it against police officers. He later joined other rioters inside the Capitol and entered the Senate gallery, where he flashed a hand gesture associated with the Proud Boys as he posed for selfie photos. He spent roughly 13 minutes inside the building.
More than 1,200 people have been charged with Capitol riot-related crimes.

GK2CT0Y4T9_CZ9MH49Q3BLJR2Y,ABC denies sacking Antoinette Lattouf and attempts to have termination case thrown out,Caitlin Cassidy,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/jan/22/antoninette-lattouf-abc-firing-sacking-unlawful-termination-case-details-update-fair-work,"The ABC has claimed it did not sack the journalist Antoinette Lattouf from her casual radio role, paving the way to attempt to have her termination case thrown out.
It comes as pressure mounts on the broadcaster’s management, with union members passing a vote of no confidence in the managing director, David Anderson.
On 15 January, the broadcaster filed its defence in the Fair Work Commission (FWC), in which it asserted Lattouf’s employment was terminated on 20 December, and took effect the same day.
The ABC claimed Lattouf was warned about posting on social media about controversial topics before she was dismissed from her role. The ABC also objected to Lattouf’s claim her firing was unlawful, writing “with respect, the application is fundamentally and entirely misconceived”.
Lattouf has claimed unlawful termination on the grounds of “political opinion or a reason that included political opinion” and later expanded the claim to include race due to her Lebanese heritage. She is seeking a detailed public apology and compensation for harm to reputation and for distress and humiliation. She will also seek an order that the ABC offer her a commensurate role back on air.
In its submission, the ABC wrote it decided “not to require” Lattouf to perform the last two of her five shifts as a casual presenter of Sydney’s Mornings because she had “failed or refused to comply with directions that she not post on social media about matters of controversy during the short period she was presenting”.

The ABC later advised Lattouf’s lawyer, Josh Bornstein, that it was now claiming it did not terminate her employment and she was not entitled to make an unlawful termination application.
The ABC has requested the FWC dismiss Lattouf’s case after mediation last week in the unlawful termination case reached a stalemate.
In a statement, a spokesperson for the ABC said it was “clear on the evidence provided in the ABC’s response to Lattouf’s claim that she had not been terminated”.
“The jurisdictional objection was formalised as soon as it became clear the matter had not resolved,” they said.
“If the ABC is successful in its application the unlawful termination claim will not proceed”.
The broadcaster also alleges Lattouf should not be permitted to proceed because she was entitled to make a general protections court application, rather than an unlawful termination application.
On Tuesday morning, the FWC deputy president Gerard Boyce issued directions for the matter, confirming the ABC would have until 2 February to file documents supporting its amended response.
Lattouf will have until 16 February to do the same, with replies due on 23 February.
The matter is next listed for hearing in Sydney on Friday, 8 March.

Bornstein described the public broadcaster’s latest stance as “very strange”.
Lattouf was hired by the ABC to fill in on Sydney’s Mornings radio slot as host for a week from 18 December.
She was told by the acting station manager Mark Spurway on 20 December that she was “sounding great” and the audience was “responding very well”.
The same day, she was summoned to a meeting with senior management and told she was terminated immediately because she had reposted on Instagram a post from Human Rights Watch that said: “The Israeli government is using starvation of civilians as a weapon of war in Gaza.”
The ABC covered the claim at the time, as Lattouf noted in her submission.
Lattouf said the ABC’s claim she was not terminated was “a taxpayer funded legal game of recent invention”.
“If I wasn’t sacked, what was it? I’m keen to hear all the creative euphemisms that will be used to try and explain this backflip to me,” she said.
If the is not successful in making either of its objections, Lattouf will be able to take her claims before the Federal Court of Australia.
At a meeting of more than 200 of the ABC’s union members on Monday, members alleged leaders at the ABC had failed “to defend the integrity of the ABC and staff from attacks”.
In its adopted statement, staff told management if it didn’t begin to address the “ongoing crisis” by next Monday, further action would be considered.
Anderson issued a statement after the union meeting, saying he was proud of the ABC’s journalism and its journalist.
“On behalf of ABC staff and in the interests of the Australian public, I have and will continue to robustly defend the work of our journalists, who often face significant external pressure themselves,” Anderson said.
“Any suggestion I would not defend our position when external pressure is applied – regardless of where that pressure is coming from – is offensive and incorrect.”
Anderson said he had “listened to and heard the concerns” of staff and would meet with them in the coming weeks.
The acting chief executive of the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance, Adam Portelli, said staff had felt unsupported by the ABC’s senior management when they had been criticised or attacked.
“The message from staff today is clear and simple: David Anderson must demonstrate that he will take the necessary steps to win back the confidence of staff and the trust of the Australian public,” he said."
GKF9691TBL_NVD1NR12G2E33WT,"Cameron broke convention when he made Michelle Mone a peer, says Tory MP",David Conn,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/jan/25/david-cameron-broke-convention-when-he-made-michelle-mone-a-peer-says-tory-mp,"David Cameron breached “proper process” when he appointed Michelle Mone to the House of Lords in 2015, David Mundell, who was the Scotland secretary at the time, has said.
Mundell, the Conservative MP for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale, said Lord Cameron appointed Mone without Downing Street consulting the government’s Scotland Office, which is standard practice before awarding peerages to Scots.
Cameron, recently appointed to the Lords himself, and other Westminster Tories had been impressed by Mone when she backed the union in the Scottish independence referendum. She was already well known in Scotland through her lingerie business, Ultimo.
Mundell, who was the secretary of state for Scotland from 2015 to 2019, said some Scottish businesspeople were unhappy with Mone’s peerage, but he did not have an opportunity to discuss it until after Cameron had confirmed the appointment.
“The peerage was a fait accompli by the time we heard about it,” Mundell said. “I was unhappy that the proper process was not followed and that the Scotland Office was not asked to provide any background or input. And I wasn’t at all surprised to find that Scottish businesses were very, very unhappy about the appointment.
“I did communicate with Downing Street that Scottish business figures were unhappy because they did not consider Michelle Mone to be a substantial businesswoman.”
Shortly before giving her a peerage in August 2015, Cameron made Mone his “entrepreneurship tsar”, and she was appointed to lead a review for Iain Duncan Smith, then the work and pensions minister, on supporting people in deprived areas to set up businesses.
The government’s announcement described her as a “leading entrepreneur and businesswomen [sic]”. Later the same month, Cameron made her a Conservative life peer in his 2015 dissolution honours list, the official citation describing her as a “leading entrepreneur”.
The peerage, carrying the title Baroness Mone of Mayfair, was controversial at the time and the subject of outspoken criticism by some Scottish businesspeople.
Douglas Anderson, the managing director of the Glasgow-based plant hire company Gap Group, gave his views in strong terms in a letter to Cameron after reading initial press reports that a peerage was being considered. Anderson pointed out that published financial accounts of the Ultimo company showed it had been making losses and been in financial difficulties, and that in 2013 it had been rescued by a Sri Lankan clothing manufacturer, MAS Holdings.
“Ms Mone is not a successful entrepreneur, she is a small-time businesswoman with a PR exposure far in excess of any actual success,” Anderson wrote. “Awarding her a peerage for a very mediocre business performance brings the awarding of titles into disrepute by rewarding failure.”
A spokesperson for Mone said she “came from a working-class family in Glasgow’s East End and worked hard to become a successful entrepreneur, building one of the biggest independent lingerie brands in the world”. She was “proud of her achievements”, the spokesperson added. “Michelle was honoured to be asked to join the House of Lords by David Cameron after her role in the Scottish referendum campaign. Her appointment was duly vetted by Holac [the House of Lords appointments commission] at the time.”
Holac’s role is to vet people nominated as peers “for propriety”, and can withhold support if there are legal or regulatory issues, such as an outstanding tax investigation.
Cameron did not respond to an invitation to comment. A Cabinet Office spokesperson pointed out that all peerages were vetted by Holac.
Mone, 52, with her husband, Doug Barrowman, 58, is facing a National Crime Agency investigation into the procurement of £203m of government PPE contracts during the Covid pandemic for PPE Medpro. Both now admit involvement in the company but deny any wrongdoing.
The PPE Medpro contracts were awarded in 2020 via the government’s “VIP lane” for politically connected people, including Tory peers, after Mone approached the Cabinet Office ministers Michael Gove and Theodore Agnew, offering to supply personal protective equipment."
GKGN97A1YS_4BEG6RZ3YA35RQ4,"UK less prepared for pandemic than pre-Covid, former vaccine chief warns",Ian Sample,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/jan/24/uk-less-prepared-for-pandemic-than-pre-covid-former-vaccine-chief-warns,"The UK is less prepared for a pandemic than it was before the Covid crisis after driving away jab manufacturers and relying on a narrow range of shots, according to the country’s former vaccine chief.
Dr Clive Dix, who chaired the UK’s vaccine taskforce, told MPs on Wednesday there had been “a complete demise” of work to ensure the UK was better equipped with vaccines for the next pandemic, noting that all the activities were “literally gone”.
The vaccine taskforce is widely regarded as a rare highlight in Britain’s Covid response. It was led by the venture capitalist Kate Bingham and Dix, who took over as chair in December 2020, when Britain became the first country to roll out Covid jabs.
Speaking to the Commons science, innovation and technology committee, Dix said he and Bingham gave ministers a set of “strong recommendations” to make sure Britain was better prepared when the next pandemic hit, but these were not adopted or published. “[There were] activities already going on that were stopped,” he added.
Another big concern, Dix said, was the UK’s reliance on mRNA vaccines, the approach behind the Pfizer and Moderna Covid shots, to tackle future outbreaks. “That’s really scary,” he told the hearing. “The mRNA vaccines are not the be-all and end-all. They will only work if we know what the virus is and know the antigen,” he said, referring to the part of the virus that triggers the immune system.
Beyond failing to invest in a range of vaccine technologies, the UK also drove vaccine manufacturers away by treating them so poorly, Dix added, leaving the country in an even worse position than before Covid.
“What we’ve seen is a whole list of incompetent decisions,” Dix told MPs. “We have less resilience now because a lot of the manufacturers have walked away from the UK because of how badly they were treated at the tail end of the vaccine taskforce.”
He raised the case of Valneva, a French firm that mothballed a vaccine facility it had built in Scotland after the government cancelled its contract during final stage clinical trials. On scrapping the deal, former health secretary Sajid Javid said the UK would not have approved the vaccine, but the medicines regulator duly approved the shot. Dix called the comments “incompetence at the highest level”.
A statement read to the MPs from the Pandemic Sciences Institute at Oxford University echoed concerns about a lack of resilience, noting that Britain was not prepared for the recent mpox outbreak and “remains unprepared for an avian influenza outbreak”.
Prof Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, who gave evidence alongside Dix, said the danger was in preparing for a future pandemic exactly like Covid. While Covid vaccines took nearly a year to develop, they built on years of crucial research on coronaviruses. Work on dozens of other potential pandemic pathogens lagged far behind, he said.
“For me, we are really unsafe at this moment for future pandemic threats because we just don’t have that knowledge base that you need to even start the gun as we did in 2020,” he said. “And even then it took 11 months to have a vaccine.”"
GOI8YSMPBD_WTEL9ZPDH322R5R,‘We have to overcome it’: one month on from the mass shooting in Prague,Ashifa Kassam,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/22/one-month-on-from-mass-shooting-in-prague-charles-university,"They marched silently through the heart of Prague, coming to a halt beneath the stone arches of the imposing building. Linking arms, the crowd of more than 1,000 people encircled the building where, two weeks earlier, the country’s worst mass killing took place.
“It was a hug for the building,” said Jakub Jirsa, who heads the department of philosophy and religious studies at Charles University. “An evil thing happened there and we have to overcome it. The whole tragedy should not take it away from us.”
A fire was also lit which, tended to by a rotating roster of volunteers, was to keep burning day and night until the end of this month.
Sunday marked one month since a 24-year-old student opened fire at the university, killing 14 people and injuring more than 20. Police said the shooter killed himself as they closed in on him.
As police in the Czech Republic continue to piece together what happened, the staff and students of Charles University have grappled with the question of how to move forward from a tragedy that left 50,000 students, 10,000 staff and many others in the city reeling.
“Everybody was affected by it,” said Jirsa. “There’s this unity, but at the same time [the experience] is extremely plural.”
About 700 people were in the building on the day the shooter entered; some were trapped with him on the fourth floor, frantically erecting barricades in classrooms or attempting to hide along the building’s ledges, while others were evacuated as gunfire cracked through the building.
Some, like Jirsa, left the university just moments before the shooting began, others were miles away, watching the events unfold on the news.
Within hours, Jirsa began receiving updates from his students. “Dear Mr Jirsa,” read the first email. “The first year students managed to contact everyone via social networks from our year, we can say we are all fine.”
Minutes later another email came in, letting him know that the second year students had also contacted everyone in their year to confirm that nobody had been injured.
“It was amazing,” said Jirsa. “And immediately they went on, organising talks, organising meetings among themselves and being together and helping each other.”
The same spirit has reverberated across the institution, as initiatives, some organised by students, others by staff and the wider community, seek to carve out a space for people to work through what happened before classes resume in mid-February, said Martin Pehal, a vice-dean at the university.
On Sunday, those affected were invited to gather at the university for activities including art performances and a workshop to create a memorial using wax from the scores of candles left by mourners.
In the past weeks, several departments have held informal walks through the parks of Prague with students, while a concert for the university community and those who intervened in the shooting is also being organised for the end of the month.
“The idea, the rationale behind everything that we’re doing, is taking back agency in various areas,” said Pehal. “We’re sort of getting together in the square, opening up and trying to overcome this trauma that the communities went through, through creative work.”
Since the shooting, staff at the university contacted institutions in the US, Norway and Germany that had dealt with similar incidents, asking them for advice.
“They were quite explicit, you have to reopen the building as soon as possible,” said Pehal. “However, during the police operations, [the police] broke down almost 140 doors, they’re just destroyed.”
Even so, the university came together to offer limited access to students and lecturers to the building on Sunday. “The narrative that we want to provide is that of hope and healing,” said Pehal.
On Sunday, the one-day arts faculty opening was described by its dean, Eva Lehečková, as a “huge step in the healing process”. Speaking to reporters, she added: “The building has been rather quiet for a month and we are looking forward to the usual hustle and bustle.”
One month on from the tragedy, Jirsa said “most of the student body” appears to be coping quite well.
“There’s quite a lot of talk nowadays about how fragile the young generation is, you know the snowflakes and all this discussion about the fragility and oversensitivity of the generation,” he added. “But I think that this situation has shown how incredibly strong of a student body we have. Our students have shown courage, empathy, sympathy and [have been] there for one another. And that’s amazing.”"
GTBHL04GDZ_UPNMJDS7APG07O0,The Picnic by Matthew Longo review – the party that pulled down the iron curtain,Houman Barekat,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/jan/24/the-picnic-by-matthew-longo-review-an-escape-to-freedom-and-the-collapse-of-the-iron-curtain,"On 19 August 1989, some 20,000 people gathered in a field near the Hungarian city of Sopron, close to the border with Austria, for an outdoor party. “A brass band boomed across the field. Goulash cooked in giant pots over open flames; beer and wine were there for the taking. People danced around a bonfire.” The festival, jointly organised by several Hungarian opposition parties, was billed as a pan-European picnic, a celebration of brotherhood between nations. The revellers included a large contingent of refugees from the communist German Democratic Republic (GDR), who had entered Hungary in their thousands earlier that summer. During the picnic, an estimated 600 East Germans breached the border and made their way to the West German embassy in Vienna. Crucially, the border guards never opened fire.
As Matthew Longo explains in The Picnic, the event would come to be seen as a harbinger. Three weeks later, the Hungarian government formally opened the border. The GDR leadership appealed to the USSR to step in, prompting fears of a repeat of 1956, when Soviet tanks rolled into Budapest and brutally crushed a popular uprising. However, the Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, declined to intervene, saying the policing of the border was a matter for Hungary. Within days, around 30,000 East German refugees entered West Germany; just a couple of months later, on 9 November 1989, the Berlin Wall came down. That day, too, the border guards opted not to use force.
The Picnic is a brisk and engaging account, told in a lively blend of novelistic narration and reportage and featuring interviews with a number of people closely involved in these historic events. They include Ferenc Mészáros, the pro-democracy activist who conceived the picnic; Miklós Németh, Hungary’s last communist prime minister; Árpád Bella, the commanding officer in charge of border security that day; and Harald Jäger, the East German border guard who famously opened the gates of the Berlin Wall on the day it came down. Longo, who teaches political theory at Leiden University, is interested in the obscure alchemy of that period of transition, and the philosophical quandaries faced by individual citizens: “What do you do when you lose faith in the moral force of the law? How do you weigh the demands of conscience against personal risks, when the ramifications of your actions might hurt the ones you love?”
Németh’s reformism had laid some of the groundwork: earlier that year, he signed an official decree declaring his intention to dismantle the barbed-wire fencing along the border; a section of it was snipped in a symbolic ceremony in May. “From one day to the next,” writes Longo, “the border guards went from being respected standard-bearers of the state, to being told (loosely) to turn a blind eye to border transgressors.” But that “loosely” is key: change was gradual and piecemeal – there was nothing certain or inevitable about it: “This was a period of indeterminacy, beset with risk.” The border with Austria was very much in force on the day of the picnic, and the guards would have been technically within their rights to open fire. “They chose to look away. This is a moral stand too.”
It’s an uplifting tale, but Longo takes care not to oversentimentalise it. He situates Hungarian anti-communism within a broader tradition of nationalism that extends to the xenophobic politics of the incumbent prime minister, Viktor Orbán, who features in these pages in his youthful iteration as a liberal upstart. Indeed, the internationalist idealism that inspired the picnic’s organisers feels almost quaint today. Though Hungary joined the EU in 2004, pan-Europeanism, as a political project, has gained little purchase in the former Soviet sphere: anti-Brussels resentment has fuelled the popularity of Orbán’s Fidesz party as well as Germany’s far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), which is particularly strong in former GDR states.

GUSO2C8CZ7_RND536WSXLWXT5P,South African man confesses starting fire which killed 76 to conceal murder,_,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/23/south-african-man-confesses-starting-tower-block-fire-to-conceal-murder,"Police in South Africa have arrested a man who claimed responsibility for starting a fire that killed 76 people last year, after he said he ignited the blaze while trying to dispose of the body of a man he had strangled.
The shocking and unexpected confession came when the man was testifying at an inquiry into the causes of the fire in August at an apartment building in downtown Johannesburg, which was one of South Africa’s worst disasters.
The man, whose identity was not disclosed, had said at the inquiry that he had killed another man on the night of the fire by beating him and strangling him, according to South African media reports of the testimony.
He said he then poured gasoline on the man’s body and set it alight with a match, according to the reports.
He testified that he was a drug user and was told to kill the man by a drug dealer who lived in the building.
Police said later they had arrested a 29-year-old man after he had confessed to being involved in the fire at the inquiry. The man, who was not named, was facing 76 counts of murder, 120 counts of attempted murder, and a charge of arson, police said in a statement.
The inquiry he was testifying at was established to look into the possible causes of the fire. The panel in charge of the inquiry ordered that he not be identified after his testimony, and a lawyer leading the questioning of witnesses said that it could not be used against him, because it was not a criminal proceeding.
South African media referred to him as “Mr X” when reporting on his claim that he believed he caused the fire that ripped through the dilapidated five-storey building in downtown Johannesburg, killing dozens, including at least 12 children. More than 80 people were injured in the night-time blaze.
South African police said the man would appear in court soon, but did not give a date.
The fire drew the world’s attention to downtown Johannesburg’s long-running problem with “hijacked buildings,” structures that have become rundown and taken over by squatters and are abandoned by authorities. There are hundreds of them in the old centre of the city, officials say.
The city of Johannesburg owned the building, but it had been taken over by illegal landlords, who were renting out space to hundreds of poor people desperate for somewhere to live. Many of the building’s occupants were immigrants suspected of being in South Africa illegally.
Mr X also testified that the building was a haven of criminality and was effectively run by drug dealers.
Emergency services officials at the time said that most of the fire escapes in the building had been locked or chained closed that night, making the blaze even deadlier.
Many people jumped out of windows – some as high as three floors up – to escape the inferno, according to witnesses and health officials.
Some said they had to throw their babies and children out, hoping they would be caught by people below. Many of the injured suffered broken limbs and backs from jumping out the windows.
South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, ordered the inquiry into the disaster, which started in October by hearing testimony from emergency services personnel who responded to the fire in the early morning hours of 31 August.
Johannesburg’s acting chief of emergency services testified at the inquiry last year that the building was a “ticking timebomb”, because it was crowded with people living in wooden structures, while fire hoses and fire extinguishers had all been removed."
GV2HQGP7UE_OIPYOZNXJGZOCW6,Immersive exhibitions based on artists such as Van Gogh and Dali derided as ‘money grab’,David Batty,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2024/jan/24/immersive-exhibitions-based-on-artists-such-as-van-gogh-and-dali-derided-as-money-grab,"From animated floor-to-ceiling paintings to giant fluorescent ball pits, immersive art experiences have proliferated in warehouses, often costing £25-£40 a head. Now experts have claimed that many are overpriced gimmicks.
Leading digital artists have claimed that some of the most popular commercial immersive experiences, particularly those based on the work of deceased artists, such as Van Gogh and Dalí, are a money grab that provide little reward to visitors beyond Instagrammable moments.
The proliferation of these shows, which often use relatively old technology, is diluting public perception of what immersive experiences could be and risks sidelining more innovative work, the artists have claimed.
Lucy Hardcastle, a designer and digital artist who runs her own studio in London, said the commercialisation of immersive experiences did not leave room for many original ideas.
Hardcastle, who has made work for the Victoria and Albert Museum and Chanel, drew a distinction between commercial experiences like the Van Gogh, Monet and Dalí exhibitions, which are primarily screen- or projection-based, and more cutting-edge shows where artists have created physical and digital environments from scratch.
For example, the work of studio DRIFT, which is led by Dutch artists, includes creating an autonomously moving group of illuminated drones, programmed to fly using an algorithm derived from years of research into starling murmurations. The post-digital art group Random International created Rain Room – where visitors entered a downpour without getting wet – which attracted tens of thousands of visitors to the Barbican and the New York Museum of Modern Art. These kinds of projects often take years to develop.
In contrast, some of the most popular commercial experiences that opened since these pioneering shows primarily used projection mapping – where displays are projected on to real-world objects or spaces to simulate environments or augment reality – which they had not created and dated back to the 1990s.
“I think things like the Van Gogh experience, and that price point, definitely warps the perception of the craftsmanship that goes into these types of events,” said Hardcastle, who also teaches at Chelsea School of Art.
Hardcastle said she thought the word immersive had become “a gimmicky tagline”. Whereas it was once associated with shows that engaged all the senses, it was often now more about creating something that looks good on Instagram.
“It’s almost like our expectations or standards have just continued to become lowered [by these experiences]. And therefore there’s less demand to make something that’s truly outstanding.”
Ralph Nauta, the co-founder of studio DRIFT, also said it was comparatively easy for commercial ventures to make a projected animation of a dead artist’s work. But their own projects, such as Drifter, which involved a floating concrete block, took years of original research. ‘To physically – and with the laws of nature – have a block of concrete fly, that’s 15 years of work for that one piece,” he said.
Nauta described popular screen-based immersive experiences as “a money grab”, arguing they did not provide the audience with contemplation or value. “The visitor walks out and feels, oh, I’m $50 lighter, but I’ve not experienced anything, I’ve just been put in front of a screen.”
He also questioned whether the dead artists whose work has been turned into immersive experiences would approve of how their work was being displayed. “It’s like, oh, we do a Van Gogh show, we do a Dalí show. Nobody knows if he wanted this. I think it’s very disrespectful.”
“It gives the whole industry a bad name and it can be so, so, so much more.”

The artists said the industry needed organisations like the Serpentine and arebyte galleries in London, which has supported emerging artists who work with immersive technology.
Claudel Goy, the managing director of arebyte, said the expansion of commercial shows like the Van Gogh experience had attracted new audiences to immersive art and raised its public profile. But she said there was a need for public institutions to support more cutting-edge work.
Goy said the prices of commercial immersive experiences reflected the high overheads of the technology and the cost of spaces in prime locations of cities like London. Arebyte hopes to open an immersive art museum in east London, with ticketed exhibitions costing up to £15. She said: “We’re definitely not going to charge £25. Who can afford it? As a family of four, [that’s] £100 – that’s not accessible at all.”
Hannes Koch, a co-founder of the German Random International said artist-led immersive displays could not compete with their more commercial peers because it was far more complicated to create something bespoke than simply use big screens.
He said the ideal price point for immersive experiences was between £8 and £15. “I don’t think it’s criminal to charge for something that is of high quality. But I think it’s good to keep accessibility high on the radar.”
Sana Ali Aamir, the UK’s general manager for Fever, the company behind Van Gogh: The Immersive Experience, defended the pricing of its most popular exhibitions, which she said helped fund the development of their other newer and more innovative shows, such as such as Dopamine Land and Bubble Planet, which cost about £15-20.
She said that the while the technology involved in the Van Gogh experience was now old, the storytelling in the experience, which takes visitors inside some of his most famous paintings via two-storey, 360-degree digital projections, was still powerful and value for money. It was arguably a richer way to experience his work because audiences learned more about the artist, she added.
She added: “The value has been taking that innovation and making it into something that’s more accessible. There’s something for everybody in this market. You can use those expensive things to then drive the more affordable things, which is about giving access to more people and culture.”"
GYU4LA3EJT_QF0UI3Y07037XSD,German court ruling sparks calls to stop state funding for far-right AfD,Kate Connolly,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/23/german-court-ruling-sparks-calls-to-stop-state-funding-for-far-right-afd,"A court decision to cut state funding to a minor far-right political party in Germany has sparked calls for similar rules to be applied to the much more significant rightwing populist Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), which is at the centre of a storm over immigration policy.
The constitutional court ruled in favour of stopping public funding to the party Die Heimat (the homeland), successor to the National Democratic party (NPD), from 2023.
The Karlsruhe institution said its decision was justified because the NPD and Die Heimat were explicitly out to undermine or even overthrow German democracy.
It is the first ruling of its kind, coinciding with a debate over whether the AfD, founded in 2013, could be legally banned, and over whether to remove the basic rights of its more radical members.
The chancellor, Olaf Scholz, who has spoken of his scepticism over the efficacy of banning the AfD, welcomed the ruling, calling it a “confirmation of the pathway to not offering much space to the enemies of freedom”.
Markus Söder, the conservative leader of the southern state of Bavaria, said before the ruling that withdrawing funds from Die Heimat could be a “blueprint” for managing the threat from the AfD.
According to Tuesday’s ruling, the NPD/Die Heimat would no longer receive state funding and tax relief would no longer be available to it or its donors, the court said.
An application was made to the court in 2019 by the lower house of parliament (Bundestag) and the upper house (Bundesrat), calling for the party to be deprived of funding, after a change was made in Germany’s basic law to stop radical parties from receiving the state funds to which other parties are entitled.
In its ruling, the court said Die Heimat “aims to replace the existing constitutional system with an authoritarian state based on an ethnic “people’s community”. It said the party’s policies contravened and were disrespectful of the human dignity of minorities and migrants.
It added that Die Heimat had sought to “eliminate the free democratic order” and had a “racist, in particular anti-Muslim, antisemitic and anti-Gypsy, attitude” that was in contravention of Germany’s constitutional principles.
In 2017, an attempt to outlaw the NPD was stopped by the court which argued that although the party resembled Adolf Hitler’s Nazi party, it was too weak and therefore not a threat to democracy.
A previous attempt to ban the party at the start of the 2000s failed after it was discovered the intelligence agency had planted its own moles in the party leadership, making the bid unlawful.
The ruling is being pored over in detail since some AfD members were recently revealed to have attended a meeting discussing a masterplan to expel those of foreign origin including those in possession of a German passport.
Politicians are under pressure to examine the feasibility of banning the AfD, even as political and legal figureheads warn of the possibility of such a move backfiring.
Over the past week hundreds of thousands of Germans have taken to the streets to campaign against the rise of the party.
The AfD has responded by saying the policies discussed at the meeting are not party policy, and accusing the government of manipulating the protests in order to divert attention from its own poor record of dealing with migration and other pressing matters.
The AfD is polling second nationwide and, ahead of three state elections in eastern Germany this autumn, is leading in each one. It has been classified as rightwing extremist in each of those states by state intelligence agencies, on the grounds that it undermines democracy and deploys anti-immigrant rhetoric.
A firewall policy by mainstream parties preventing them from going into coalition with the AfD has so far ensured it is kept out of power. As it rises in the polls, the question is for how long this firewall can be maintained.
On Thursday, a fresh poll showed that support for the AfD was down by about two percentage points to 20%, in what some observers said was the first sign that the immigration meeting exposé may have damaged its poll ratings.
Reacting to Karlsruhe’s ruling, the interior minister, Nancy Faeser, said it sent an unambiguous signal to anti-democratic powers in Germany.
“The decision comes at a time when rightwing extremism is the greatest extremist threat to our democracy,” she said in a statement. “We are taking decisive action against all those who are preparing the ground for rightwing extremist violence.”
She added: “The forces that want to dismantle and destroy our democracy must not receive a cent of government funding.”
She said that withdrawing public funding was “yet another instrument” helpful in the efforts to defend democracy.
For Die Heimat, the court’s decision is of little real consequence, owing to its failure to achieve enough support in European, federal and state elections to make it eligible for funding.
In recent years its influence has been confined to the municipal level, with representation in local councils across the country. However, its support has largely switched to the AfD.At the last federal election in 2021 Die Heimat/NPD got 65,000 votes or 0.1% of the vote. At the last European election it got 100,000 votes, or 0.3% of the votes.
Public money is accessible by any party in Germany scoring a minimum of 0.5% in national or European elections, or 1% in regional polls.
The tax relief clause will be the biggest blow to Heimat and its supporters, however, which is believed to have amounted to about €200,000 since 2020.
Frank Franz, the head of Die Heimat, called the court ruling a scandal, saying the party would “cling to life” as the far right was currently doing “in every nook and cranny”."
H2QA7CEJWB_GKX4ROQP4LAY3LX,Far-right AfD leader vows to campaign for Brexit-style EU exit vote in Germany,Kate Connolly,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/22/germany-far-right-afd-leader-alice-weidel-eu-exit-campaign,"The leader of Germany’s far-right Alternative für Deutschland has said her party will campaign for a Brexit-style vote on EU membership if it comes to power, calling the UK’s departure from the bloc a model for its largest member.
Alice Weidel told the Financial Times in an exclusive interview that the UK decision would be “dead right” for Germany, and that a “Dexit” would boost the country’s self-determination.
“It’s a model for Germany, that one can make a sovereign decision like that,” she said.
It was one of the party’s first public pronouncements since the beginning of a wave of nationwide protests against the AfD, triggered by revelations that leading members had attended a covert meeting at which a “masterplan” for mass deportations of foreigners and German passport holders was discussed, with a view to the party implementing the plans if it came to power.
Weidel called the exposé “scandalous” and said it had misrepresented her party, which only wanted to use the law to repatriate people who had no right to remain in Germany. “The AfD is the party that stands for enforcing this country’s laws,” she said.
Street protests in Germany against the AfD in reaction to the revelations only grew in momentum over the weekend, with more than a million people estimated to have participated in 90 different demonstrations across the country.
Police were forced to order at least two events, in Hamburg and Munich, to come to a premature halt due to the large numbers, with turnouts far greater than predicted either by authorities or organisers.
In Berlin, where more than 100,000 people braved icy winds to gather at the square in front of the Reichstag parliament building, a march due to move through the government quarter was called off because of the sheer numbers of people.
Weidel, a former investment banker who has led the party since 2022, said that before moving to a Dexit referendum an AfD-led government would aim to reform the European Union and do away with its “democratic deficit”, by, among other things, reducing the powers of the European Commission, an “unelected executive”.
“If a reform isn’t possible, if we fail to rebuild the sovereignty of the EU member states, we should let the people decide, just as Britain did,” she said. “And we could have a referendum on Dexit, a German exit from the EU.”
The AfD is currently enjoying its highest standing in the polls since its formation in 2013. It is between 20% and 23% on a federal level, ahead of all three of the parties which make up the chancellor, Olaf Scholz’s beleaguered coalition.
In three eastern states where elections are due to take place in the autumn, it is scoring into the 30s, with around 36% in Thuringia, and overshadowing the mainstream parties.
But it is being kept out of power by other parties ruling out any form of coalition with the party. Because of that the AfD is not in power in any of the country’s 16 states.
German public support for membership of the EU is very high, with recent polls showing it at around 80%. It is weakest among AfD voters, however.
But the ambition and the fact Weidel is willing to express it points to the fact the AfD’s goals are very long-term, with political scientists often referring to the party’s extreme patience about gaining power.
A debate is currently under way in Germany as to whether the party could be banned on the grounds it is unconstitutional, on the back of the domestic intelligence agency having classified large parts of the party as rightwing extremist and put some of its higher-ranking members under surveillance.
However, legal and political opposition to pursuing such a ban, including from Scholz, and his deputy, the economics minister, Robert Habeck, is high, due to the dangers of it backfiring and galvanising more support for the party, should it fail.

Pressure is on Scholz and his government to get more of a grip on the challenges currently facing Germany, over Ukraine, the cost of living crisis, a skills shortage, and climate reform, all of which has been compounded by a budget crisis. Disgruntlement over government management has in part helped the surge in support for the AfD, as the party has fed off the growing unease.
But the AfD has struggled to contain the backlash over the revelations.
Weidel was forced to sack her senior aide Roland Hartwig over his attendance at the meeting, which she says she knew nothing about. She did not attend herself and denies that the party plans to implement the measures discussed. She has reportedly faced disagreement internally for the decision to sack Hartwig.
At a closed-door meeting of the party leadership at the weekend, the Correctiv exposé was discussed, “briefly and intensely”, according to Carsten Hütter, the party treasurer and leadership member. Members decided to “stay our course” as well as trying to “be better and clearer in our communication”, Hütter told the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
Another major fallout from the exposé is the decision by Hans-Georg Maaßen at the weekend, to turn his WerteUnion – a self-described arch-conservative grassroots movement within the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its sister party, the CSU, two of whose members were at the meeting – to form a new political party.
Maaßen said that the party would be up and running in time for the crucial eastern state election, and that unlike the CDU, it was prepared to work with the AfD.
Friedrich Merz, the head of the CDU, said CDU/CSU members, who make up the vast majority of the WerteUnion’s members, would have to renounce their party membership if they joined the new party.
It marks the further fragmentation of the German political landscape coming in the same month that Sahra Wagenknecht broke from the far-left Die Linke to form her own new leftwing anti-immigrant party."
H3N570RPAQ_QO9FJX3NHXNZSDQ,New clue in hunt for thieves who attacked grave of Melbourne underworld figure’s sister,_,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/22/new-clue-in-hunt-for-thieves-who-attacked-grave-of-melbourne-underworld-figures-sister,"Police believe an overseas crime boss is behind a macabre attack on the corpse of the sister of an underworld figure at a Melbourne mausoleum.
The crime boss ordered the men to remove her corpse but they stopped short, instead stealing an expensive diamond ring, police believe.
Investigators revealed on Monday they believe the pair used a dark-coloured Mini Cooper car during the macabre heist. That type of vehicle was reportedly seen in the area near Preston General Cemetery in Melbourne’s north the same morning.
The thieves targeted the mausoleum that housed the remains of Meshilin Marrogi, the sister of convicted murderer George Marrogi who is serving a 32-year sentence.
Meshilin Marrogi died from Covid-19 in September 2021 at the age of 30 and there was no damage to any other crypts within the mausoleum.
The bandits broke into the cemetery early on the morning of 30 July and moved the casket but did not take it away.
Detective Inspector Graham Banks previously told reporters it was believed interfering with the grave was intended to hurt George Marrogi and described it as a “new low” that caused disdain in the criminal world.
Police said in December they believed the unnamed crime boss who ordered the attack is the head of a syndicate involved in a conflict over illicit tobacco in Victoria linked to more than 30 arson attacks.
Anyone with information about the Mini Cooper believed to have been used in the incident, including its whereabouts, has been urged to come forward.
Investigators were due to set an information caravan at the cemetery on Monday in a bid to encourage members of the public to speak to them."
H5702RV1TH_KMJ5IO1001Z9MVJ,ChatGPT is coming to Australian schools. Here’s what you need to know,Caitlin Cassidy,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/23/chatgpt-in-australian-schools-what-you-need-to-know-law-changes,"ChatGPT will formally be rolled out in all Australian schools for the first time this year after the education ministers’ backing of a framework guiding AI use.
From embracing the technology as a learning tool to blanket bans and returning to pen-and-paper exams, the education sector has grappled with how to respond to the chatbot since it was released in late 2022.
Now that it’s firmly here to stay, here’s what you need to know about schools in the age of AI.
The framework, released in December, outlines principles for the use of emergent technologies including privacy and security standards, equity and accessibility.
It was developed by the national AI schools taskforce, in consultation with school sectors, education unions, experts and First Nations Australians.
As part of the requirements, schools must engage students on how generative AI tools work – including their “potential limitations and biases”, with teachers deferred to as “subject-matter experts” in the classroom.
Student work, including assessments, needs to outline how generative AI tools should or should not be used, including by ensuring appropriate attribution.
The framework also takes note of the ability of AI to support students with disabilities, from diverse backgrounds and in rural and remote communities – provided it is accessible and equitable.
Every state and territory, excluding South Australia, moved to temporarily restrict ChatGPT in public schools last year as concerns mounted about privacy and plagiarism, while some private schools adopted it in their teaching and services.
Since then, the education minister, Jason Clare, has launched an inquiry into the use of generative artificial intelligence, looking into the opportunities and risks it poses to students and teachers.
Clare told Guardian Australia his main focus was ensuring schools shouldn’t use generative AI products that sold student data.

“If we get this right, generative AI can help personalise education and make learning more compelling and effective,” he said. “We will continue to review the framework to keep pace with developments.”
A Department of Education spokesperson, Julie Birmingham, told the inquiry while the technology was developing quickly, Australia had been “leading the way” in its response.
Early research showed AI could provide intelligent tutoring systems, better personalisation, more targeted learning materials and help educate at-risk students, she said.
“The question will be how do we operationalise [the taskforce] and support teachers and schools to deal with the challenges,” she said.
South Australia has been a notable national outlier, opting against banning the technology when ChatGPT was released.
Its minister for education, training and skills, Blair Boyer, told Guardian Australia schools would be doing young people an “incredible disservice” if it didn’t educate students about the appropriate use of AI. “AI will be a part of our work and lives in the future,” he said.
Since ChatGPT’s release, South Australia’s Department of Education has developed a generative AI chatbot app which uses the same language model as the tool with built-in safeguards to protect students’ privacy and avoid inappropriate content.
EdChat, being tested at 16 public schools, doesn’t save students’ input or use it to learn from, unlike ChatGPT.
The trial is being used to inform how AI will be implemented into the state’s curriculum and was shared in the creation of Australia’s framework.
Queensland has also completed a small trial in state high schools that piloted an AI teaching and learning tool called Cerego among 500 students.
The adaptive learning platform, which uses AI to create quiz-based learning that adjusts to the needs of individual students, will be released to all state schools later in 2024.

Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters

Victoria was one of the first states and territories to lift its restriction to access ChatGPT, scrapping it in term two last year.
A spokesperson for the state’s Department of Education said any use of AI in the curriculum would be determined by schools within the “overarching principles” of safe and ethical use.
Tasmania is similarly preparing its own policy, procedures and materials for the 2024 school year, noting the latest version of the Australian curriculum includes means to integrate the teaching of AI.
Western Australia has been considering AI trials held in other states to streamline lesson planning, marking and assessment developments and reduce teacher workloads.
It has pointed out the ability for AI to automate jobs like excursion planning, meeting preparation and writing general correspondence.
The Australian Capital Territory is taking a “cautious approach”, noting the continued risks of algorithmic bias and unauthorised use of student data by tech companies.
“Our current priority is to establish a robust educational framework, to guide teachers in how students use AI tools responsibly,” an ACT education directorate spokesperson said.
The secretary of the New South Wales education department, Murat Dizdar, said the state was committed to national collaboration and actively involved in discussions to prepare learners for a future where “generative AI is part of everyday life”.
Leslie Loble, a UTS academic and former deputy secretary in the NSW education department, said while the “shock” of ChatGPT’s emergence had worn off, the issues surrounding generative AI were “by no means settled and resolved”.
“Going from seven states banning it to now is a sign of how far schools and systems have come in understanding the potential benefits and risks,” she said.
“But we really have to get started on clearer standards and expectations for what AI should deliver and how it should be defined and governed.”
She said the framework was an “excellent foundation” but key risks remained – particularly the persistent problem of equity and the digital divide.
“A lot of students still aren’t getting the basics of computers and wifi,” she said, pointing to funding gaps between government and independent schools in terms of resourcing.
“There’s a clear gap in take-up of these sophisticated generative AI tools between households and schools that have resources and those that don’t.
“To the extent these technologies can have a positive impact on learning – that divide is deeply troubling and will lead to a learning gap getting even worse.”
While Australia’s framework succeeded on a global scale in connecting AI to teaching and learning, Loble said the worst case would be to “set and forget” without consistently anchoring AI in teacher-led programs.
“That means investment in professional learning and support,” she said.
“Teacher workload is enormous and growing but if we don’t start to provide much better information about these tools, AI will end up increasing teacher workload because it will fall to them to decide [how to use it].
“It’s a potential workload shift we can’t afford right now.”"
H6P84KJ0CV_VSI6U6WI3N8M2D4,‘Our god was locked in a US museum’: the heritage hunters bringing home Nepal’s lost treasures,Rojita Adhikari,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/jan/24/our-god-was-locked-in-a-us-museum-the-heritage-hunters-bringing-home-nepals-lost-treasures,"Flicking through a newspaper in 2020, Sanjay Adhikari read a story that changed the direction of his life – a Nepalese statue of gods Laxmi and Narayan, was on display at the Dallas Museum of Art. “I could not sleep. Our god was locked inside a museum in the US,” he says.
Adhikari, from Kathmandu, spoke to conservators, activists, journalists and museum curators, and launched a campaign to see the 10th-century statue returned to Nepal.
“I wrote dozens of emails to the foreign ministry, archaeology department and the US embassy,” he says. The 28-year-old got the mayor of Lalitpur town, in Kathmandu valley, to file a police report about the missing statue, and spoke to priests at Patko Tole temple, from where it was taken 40 years ago. He sent all the documents to the Nepalese and US authorities.
In 2021, the statue was brought home and reinstalled at the temple.

Thousands of centuries-old artefacts have been looted since Nepal opened up to international trade and tourism in the 1950s. Objects have turned up in museums and auction halls in the US, Europe and Asia.
“Kathmandu valley was an open museum,” says Rohit Ranjitkar, director of the Kathmandu Valley Preservation Trust. “There were arts everywhere. Besides temples or monuments, there were centuries-old treasures. I think the local people did not value it or there was less awareness. So many things were knowingly or unknowingly gifted or thrown out or sold by local people.”
The past few years has seen a concerted effort by Nepali heritage hunters to get these objects back where they belong, helped by the changing attitudes of western governments and institutions, which have become more willing to return disputed artefacts.

Buoyed up by his success, Adhikari launched the Nepal Heritage Recovery Campaign (NHRC) and, as one of the country’s leading heritage lawyers now, has helped to recover about 30 pieces of art. These include a 10th-century stone figure of Uma Maheswar from Denver Art Museum and a stone panel of Shiva from the ninth or 10th century from the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. He helped stop an auction of five gilded bronze 16th-century Nepali figures in Paris and the sale of a Buddha statue in Hong Kong, which had an auction guide price of at least 1.5m yuan (£166,000).

The NHRC is working on the return of another 120 objects. The Lost Arts of Nepal, launched in 2015 by an anonymous activist to preserve ancient buildings damaged by a devastating earthquake, has played a key role in tracking down artefacts. The group believes more than 100,000 Nepalese treasures, including sculptures, paintings, manuscripts, and jewellery, are “scattered around the world in museums and private collections”.
It is “a job the government should be doing”, says the activist. When artefacts are identified, details are passed on to Adhikari, who prepares legal documentation to get them back.

Saubhagya Pradhananga is director general of the government’s department of archaeology. She has “limited resources” and applauds the NHRC and Lost Arts. “It’s because of an aggressive campaign by the civil society, and access to social media and awareness in young people,” she says.

“It is essential to our country that all the arts return to Nepal as soon as possible because they are our gods and they have the belief of millions of people. It is important to carry forward our culture and heritage,” says Pradhananga. “This art is not for showcasing in a museum and to buy or sell. We created it to live with it.”
Adhikari has written to the British Museum asking for the return of a missing 12th-century Uma Maheswar stone statue which he says disappeared from Nepal in the late 1960s.
He is also working to retrieve a 17th-century Taleju necklace on display at the Art Institute of Chicago which was loaned to the museum in 1976 by a Chicago art institution.

The NHRC is urging western museums to go through their collections and return items with dubious origins.
“The problem is, the museums ask us to provide evidence [of ownership from Nepal], which is not always easy to find. These things are centuries old and evidence might have been stolen or distorted already,” says Adhikari.
“Why don’t they just return it? They should know that these arts are not made to be showcased. They were made for worship. They belong to Nepali people.”"
H9KPQDYBBJ_NHT3A60Z4WKQB8M,Kenya death cult leader charged after hundreds found dead in forest,_,_,20240116,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/23/kenya-death-cult-leader-charged-after-hundreds-found-dead-in-forest,"A Kenyan court has charged a cult leader and dozens of suspected accomplices with manslaughter over the deaths of more than 200 people.
Self-proclaimed pastor Paul Nthenge Mackenzie and 94 other suspects, including his wife, pleaded not guilty to 238 counts of manslaughter, according to court documents seen by AFP.
Mackenzie, who was last week also charged with terrorism, is alleged to have incited his acolytes to starve to death in order to “meet Jesus” in a case that provoked horror across the world.
He was arrested last April after bodies were discovered in the Shakahola forest near the Indian Ocean. Autopsies revealed that the majority of the 429 victims had died of hunger. Others, including children, appeared to have been strangled, beaten or suffocated.
The 238 victims mentioned in Tuesday’s hearing were killed between January 2021 and September 2023 at Shakahola, court documents said.
Mackenzie pleaded not guilty to terrorism at another hearing last week in the port city of Mombasa. He is due to undergo a mental health assessment to establish if he is fit to stand trial for murder at another court in the coastal town of Malindi.
A largely Christian nation, Kenya has struggled to regulate unscrupulous churches and cults that dabble in criminality.
The grisly case, dubbed the “Shakahola forest massacre”, led the government to flag the need for tighter control of fringe denominations.
Questions have been raised about how Mackenzie managed to evade law enforcement despite having a history of extremism and previous legal cases.
A Senate commission of inquiry reported in October that the father of seven had faced charges in 2017 for extreme preaching. He was acquitted of charges of radicalisation in 2017 for illegally providing school teaching after rejecting the formal educational system that he claimed was not in line with the Bible.
In 2019, he was also accused of having links to the death of two children believed to have been starved, suffocated and then buried in a shallow grave in Shakahola. He was released on bail pending that trial, which is ongoing.
There are more than 4,000 churches registered in the east African country of 53 million people, according to government figures."
H9U50LKJJA_TW8O4UCBYRO6TCM,Angry Trump fumes after $83.3m damages ruling in E Jean Carroll case,Martin Pengelly,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/26/trump-damages-e-jean-carroll-defamation-case,"The $83.3m verdict against Donald Trump in the defamation case brought by the writer E Jean Carroll over her allegation of sexual assault was celebrated by opponents of the former president, analysed by legal experts and excoriated by the presumptive 2024 Republican White House nominee and his loyal supporters.
Trump called the verdict “absolutely ridiculous” and claimed it was part of a Joe “Biden-directed witch hunt” against “me and the Republican party”.
The new damages verdict followed an award of about $10m against Trump last May, when another New York jury found him liable for sexually abusing Carroll in a department store changing room in the mid-1990s.
Immediately after the verdict, Jon Cooper, a Democratic operative and activist, tweeted: “$7.3m in compensatory damages, $11m to repair [Carroll’s] reputation, and $65m in punitive damages. Trump is so screwed!!”
From his plane, having left the courtroom as Carroll’s lawyers spoke, Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform: “Absolutely ridiculous! I fully disagree with both verdicts and will be appealing this whole Biden-directed witch hunt focused on me and the Republican party. Our legal system is out of control and being used as a political weapon. They have taken away all first amendment rights. THIS IS NOT AMERICA!”
President Joe Biden has nothing to do with the Carroll case, which is one of a number involving Trump as he runs to return to the Oval Office.
Trump also faces 91 criminal charges over election subversion, retention of classified information and hush-money payments; civil suits over his business affairs; and attempts to remove him from the ballot for inciting an insurrection with his supporters’ 6 January 2021 attack on Congress.
Regardless, he dominates the Republican party and its presidential primary.
Outside court, Carroll did not comment, simply smiling as her lawyers accompanied her to a waiting car.
Trump’s attorney, Alina Habba, protested angrily, saying: “I’m not having any second thoughts about representing President Trump. It is the proudest thing I could ever do. What I’m having second thoughts about is the [law] license that I stand here with, that the people in there are supposed to have.”
Habba, who was warned by the judge over her behaviour in court, bemoaned a supposed “violation of our justice system” and made unsupported accusations about malpractice and bias.
Among Trump’s allies in Congress, the far-right Florida representative Matt Gaetz complained: “A country where you cannot deny a fantastical, false allegation is not a free country.”
But among Trump’s many opponents, schadenfreude was in ample supply.
Rick Wilson, a former Republican operative turned co-founder of the anti-Trump Lincoln Project, pondered the effect of the verdict on the billionaire former president’s increasingly battered finances – but also his success in raising money from his political supporters.

“Donald Trump’s gonna need to sell some more hats,” Wilson wrote.
Trump won Republican presidential nominating contests in Iowa and New Hampshire this month and has been pressuring his last remaining rival, the former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, to drop out before the primary reaches her state.
New York University law professor Ryan Goodman considered what the new verdict in the Carroll case might mean for Trump’s political fortunes.
“So far Trump has defied gravity,” Goodman wrote, “ … but for how much longer? Social science research suggests a politician will pay a heavy price with voters for sexual assault. Major $83m verdict amplifies that prospect.”
Even on Fox News, a rightwing network generally supportive of the former president, John Yoo, a former deputy assistant attorney general, saw nothing but bad news.
“The whole point of these unprecedented damages is to tell Donald Trump to shut up,” Yoo said. “You could think of it this way: every time Donald Trump wants to insult [E] Jean Carroll, he’s gonna have to write a $40m check for each sentence. That’s how bad this is.
“I can’t believe his lawyers haven’t succeeded in just telling him: ‘campaign for president, run for president, make your accusations about a two-tiered justice system. But leave this alone.’”"
HAA99VT123_OT9H2VAPXBJK10R,Plans to give UK citizens priority for social housing ‘would increase homelessness’,Ben Quinn,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/jan/26/uk-citizens-priority-social-housing-homelessness,"Plans being considered by the government to give UK families higher priority for social housing would force more people into homelessness, Rishi Sunak has been warned.
“We all deserve safe housing. Regardless of where we are from,” the prime minister was told in a joint letter by groups representing councils, housing professionals and charities.
Further rationing of “already scarce resources” would not address the fundamental failures of the past 40 years, theysay, before the expected launch of a consultation on whether British citizens could be given faster access to social housing.
The proposed policy, designed in part to bolster Sunak’s reputation for being tough on immigration, was revealed by the Guardian this week.
But it has prompted anger from some in government, who say it could further fuel support for the populist right, and from housing experts who say it is likely to be either illegal or unworkable, or both.
The letter to Sunak has been sent by more than 12 bodies in the nonprofit social housing sector as well as partner agencies who say they wished to express concern about the proposals.
Signatories include the heads of the Chartered Institute of Housing, the National Housing Federation, charities such as Shelter, Crisis and St Mungo’s, and bodies such as the NFA, which represents England’s council housing management companies.
At the heart of the issue was an “urgent need” for more housing and the fact housebuilding had not kept pace with demand for decades, they added.
There is the legacy from a 63% cut in 2010 in funding for affordable housing while only 9,561 social homes were delivered in England in 2022-23, compared with 40,000 a decade earlier. There is record homelessness and councils and support agencies were under huge pressure.
“We all deserve safe housing, regardless of where we are from. Further rationing of an already scarce resource does not address the fundamental failures of the last 40 years – we have simply not built the homes the UK needs to ensure everybody has a safe and secure place to live,” the letter states.
Social housing was designed to support those in the greatest need, and government data shows that 90% of new social housing lettings go to UK nationals, with long waiting lists in all areas, it adds.
“Imposing extended qualification periods before people can even get on the housing register is likely to force more people into homelessness. If the government’s main concern is to increase the availability of social lettings, it could achieve this far more effectively by building more social housing.”
Gavin Smart, the chief executive at Chartered Institute of Housing, who coordinated the letter, said focusing on the wrong policies will not alleviate an escalating and entrenched housing crisis.
He urged the government to focus on efforts to increase housing supply and described the forthcoming spring budget as a perfect opportunity to provide “the much-needed investment”.
Asked about the proposals, Downing Street declined to comment on “policy speculation”. The prime minister’s spokesperson said: “It’s important that we have a policy that is fair for everyone. We want to build more homes and boost social housing supply and obviously we keep any policies under review.”"
HBUK7RO5QM_VXWKZGCPMD1OEWO,"I took my children to the Caribbean to live free from British racism, and have never looked back",Zoe Smith,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/22/children-caribbean-british-racism-grenada-parents-collective,"As falls from grace go, spending your 38th birthday packing boxes in an Amazon warehouse is pretty high up there. If that sounds terribly snobbish or ungrateful, forgive me. Let’s put it down to being peddled the Thatcherite dream at the home counties girls’ school I attended in the 90s: if I worked hard enough, the message was, I could do anything.
My parents, who arrived in the UK from Grenada in the 1960s, did a pretty good job of making me into the right kind of immigrant. I did well at school, attended great universities (undergrad and postgrad) and was writing for national papers by my late teens. I truly believed the idea that, as a black person, if I just worked twice as hard as my white colleagues, as the old adage goes, success could be mine.
Yet somewhere along the way, the wheels fell off. In 2017, I became homeless after separating from my children’s father. I returned to my parents’ house, where I slept on the same blow-up camping mattress I’d used as a teenager trekking around Europe. I had gone from writing for Rolling Stone and hanging out with rock stars to working minimum wage jobs and having to account for how many times I needed to pee during my shift.
A year later, I’d managed to secure a small terrace house in a not-so-lovely area of Watford; but every night, as I tried to fall asleep in my front room on the sofa I got for free on Gumtree, I couldn’t escape the realisation that life in the UK just wasn’t working for me. As I hurtled towards my 40s as a single mother, relying on benefits to support my three kids did not feel like my life’s assignment. And if I couldn’t make it work in the UK, what chance did my children have in a country in which, on every indicator – from education to employment, health to housing – the odds of success as black citizens were clearly stacked against them?
So I made the decision to quit the UK and “return” to Grenada, the island my paternal and maternal grandparents had left in the 1950s, before sending for their offspring a decade later. The irony did not escape me. My motivation was to raise my children in an environment where they could feel that freedom is their birthright.
One Sunday morning, a few weeks before I flew out, I popped to the shops to pick up some vegetables. As I walked down the street, a middle-aged white man mumbled “fucking n-er” as I passed him. Years ago, I would have been triggered by the interaction, but this time I just smiled, knowing that these sorts of interactions would soon be behind me.
We left the UK in the middle of the pandemic. Our flight to Grenada had been repeatedly cancelled due to Covid, and in the end we waited nine months before we could leave. When we finally arrived, I was filled with a feeling of overwhelming relief and joy that I didn’t have to catch a flight back.
Here, my seven- and eight-year-old girls get woken up by the neighbours’ kids knocking on our front door. They go off exploring for hours on end, running in and out of the adjacent houses. Kids going missing isn’t something to worry about on an island of 126,000 people. In the UK, it felt unsafe for them to even go to the corner shop on their own and whenever we visited our local park we had to walk past a memorial to an 18-year-old who had been stabbed to death in a road rage incident. It’s something that became a core memory for my girls before the age of five.
In education, too, there’s a significant difference. When my children’s grandmother passed away last year, my seven-year-old struggled. I was so touched at how positive and proactive her teachers’ response was. How lucky she was to be in the care of two Caribbean women who had also moved from the UK, who genuinely cared about her wellbeing and took it upon themselves to build her up in a way that will last for life. I doubt she would have experienced anything like that in the UK.
It has been reassuring to meet other black people in this process who are also in search of alternative ways of living. Together with a collective of families from across the globe, we are in the process of buying back part of a former estate in the rural north of the island owned by Ninian Home, a Scottish plantation owner. By forming a community land trust, we can live with others in alignment with nature and removed from the pressures of modernity – at a fraction of the cost of living in the global north.
It hasn’t all been plain sailing. A few weeks ago, my 13-year-old son decided to return to London to live with his father. He missed his friends and family in the UK and our relationship became unsustainably tested. I have never sugar-coated the fact that relocation can be exceptionally challenging. Simple things like not having access to Thai food or consistently working cash machines have been hard to adjust to. But do I miss the UK? Not at all, in fact, when I return now I wonder how I managed to live there for so long.

HHODII5WMZ_1D2W5PT2WTCKM9B,Turkish parliament approves Sweden’s membership of Nato,Miranda Bryant,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/23/turkish-parliament-meets-vote-sweden-membership-nato,"The Turkish parliament has given its long-awaited approval to Sweden’s membership of Nato, bringing the Nordic country significantly closer to joining the western military alliance after months in limbo.
Three months after Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the Turkish president, submitted a bill on approving membership to parliament, MPs voted in favour of ratifying it late on Tuesday night.
After a four-hour debate, 287 of 346 MPs voted yes, 35 against and the rest abstained. Erdoğan is expected to sign the bill into law in the coming days.
The Swedish prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, reacted quickly to the news, saying: “Today we are one step closer to becoming a full member of Nato. Positive that the Grand General Assembly of Türkiye has voted in favour of Sweden’s Nato accession.”
Tobias Billström, Sweden’s foreign minister, said the vote was “of course good”, but that the government was now waiting for the Turkish president to sign the ratification and send it on. “Of course we are not finished with the process until it has happened, on the Turkish side,” he told Swedish broadcaster SVT.
Nato’s secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, welcomed the vote, saying he expected Hungary to ratify Sweden “as soon as possible”. He added: “Sweden’s membership makes Nato stronger and us all safer.”
Turkey’s approval leaves Hungary as the only country still to ratify Swedish membership. Earlier on Tuesday, the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, hinted at progress by inviting Kristersson to visit for negotiations on the question.
In a letter, he wrote: “I believe that a more intensive dialogue could contribute to reinforcing trust between our countries and institutions thus allowing to further strengthen our political and security arrangements.”
A spokesperson for Kristersson said they did not have any comment on the invite for now, but Billström said that before responding the government would need to “think through what the letter signals”.
Sweden applied to join Nato in May 2022, at the same time as Finland, in a historic shift in its security policy prompted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine that February.
The outgoing Finnish president, Sauli Niinistö, congratulated Sweden, writing on X, formerly Twitter, in Swedish: “I am very glad of the Turkish parliament’s vote to ratify Sweden’s Nato membership. Sweden’s membership will improve security in the Baltic region and make the whole alliance stronger. When Sweden is a member, Finland’s membership will also be completed.”
Turkey and Hungary, both of whom maintain better relations with Russia than other members of the organisation, raised objections, holding up a process that requires unanimity among Nato’s member countries.
Finland finally joined last year but Ankara pressed Stockholm to toughen its stance on members of the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK) based in Sweden, which the US and the EU as well as Turkey deem a terrorist group.
Sweden has already signed a deal with the US giving full access to 17 of its military bases and started the Nato integration process.
Paul Levin, the director of the Stockholm University Institute for Turkish Studies, said Sweden’s Nato membership would be very significant for the Nordic country.“Orbán has promised not to delay the process, so Turkish ratification should mean Swedish Nato accession. That will be a huge deal for a country with a long tradition of neutrality and a policy of nonalignment that it only decided to abandon in the face of increased Russian aggression,” he said.
“At the same time, it has been a gradual process that began after the end of the cold war. EU accession in 1995 meant the end of neutrality for Sweden.”However, he warned that the grappling with Ankara over Swedish membership may have a lasting impact. “This has been a trying time for relations between Turkey and Sweden and while it will be good to have it behind us, I suspect that the acrimonious process has done lasting damage to the relationship.”
Sweden’s Turkish community was divided over the issue, he added. “There are many Kurdish Swedes who have been worried that this would mean that Sweden would no longer be the champion of their cause and that Sweden would heed Erdoğan’s demands for extraditions of large numbers of Kurds.
“But there are also many Turkish Swedes, and some Kurds, who are happy that Sweden, as they see it, is finally getting tough on the PKK.”Hungary’s government submitted the ratification of Sweden’s Nato application to parliament in 2022, but a final vote has been delayed repeatedly. While the decision is formally up to parliament, Orbán’s tight grip on his ruling Fidesz party means that the ratification, de facto, is in the hands of the prime minister.Hungarian officials have in the past presented different narratives domestically about Sweden’s application, while insisting to western allies that Budapest would not be last to sign off.A senior European diplomat said: “It is crucial this dossier moves forward sooner rather than later and there are indeed signals all remaining allies understood the importance of having Sweden in Nato as soon as possible.
“Turkey much more than Hungary is looking for specific gains in this game,” the diplomat said, adding that in the case of Budapest, “clearly the rhetoric is only for some political minor gains but cannot be sustained when facing the whole of the alliance”."
HHPRL1LS2Q_MMDAEJYQJ1KQD9P,‘We can lose more freedoms’: Florida braces for Ron DeSantis’s wrath after national rout,Richard Luscombe,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/25/ron-desantis-florida-legislation,"Ron DeSantis has fallen off the national stage and the US will not, after all, become Florida like he once envisaged. But back in his home state, opponents are bracing for the return of the Republican to serve the remainder of his final term as governor following the implosion of his presidential campaign.
Florida is where DeSantis honed his extremist attacks on a wide range of targets from the transgender community to immigrants and Black voters. Although he will no longer be carrying them to the White House, critics here say there’s probably plenty more to come.
“He’s gonna come home with a vengeance. He’s going to try to regain the mantle that he had after [his re-election in] November 2022. And he’s going to try to bring everybody back together and continue on this anti-woke, anti-democratic, anti-freedom platform,” Nikki Fried, chair of the Florida Democratic party, said.
“The question will be: ‘What do the Republicans do?’ Rank-and-file Republicans in Florida, elected as well as grassroots, are not having any of it. But there are those in higher-up elected positions that still have to reckon with the fact that he’s going to be governor for the next few years and are going to have to play ball in order to get their priorities accomplished.”
Fried was referencing the Republican supermajority in both houses of the Florida legislature, which acted as little more than a rubber stamp for DeSantis’s culture war policies that also included the near dismantling of the state’s higher education system and banning face mask and vaccine mandates as the Covid-19 pandemic still raged.
Some analysts questioned if DeSantis would return to Tallahassee chastened by his national humiliation, weaker in the eyes of legislators and unable to replicate the swagger or command the same authority as he did following his 19-point re-election.
Fried, who saw DeSantis in action first-hand when she served in his cabinet as agriculture commissioner, and the only statewide elected Democrat, from 2019 to 2023, has no such doubt.
“We can lose more freedoms,” she said, noting that DeSantis will likely remain in office until he is termed out in January 2027.
“I don’t know what his agenda is for this session, he didn’t lay that out in his state of the state address, which was entirely for Iowa, so we don’t have his legislative priorities. But if he continues to try to rule with an iron fist here in Florida, we’re going to have a lot more of these misogynistic, homophobic policies that are going to come out of this administration.
“And unfortunately, Floridians are going to continue to feel the impact of his wrath and his extreme agenda. That doesn’t work across the country [but] he’s going to take no learning lessons from what he just experienced, that his agenda and his policies don’t work. But he’s going to try to prove otherwise.”
Other senior Democrats share her concern.
Val Demings, the former US congresswoman who lost to Republican incumbent Marco Rubio in the 2022 Senate election, warns the governor will remain “dangerous” with a free rein at home.
“Ron DeSantis is out. All that damage to Florida through bizarre policies, for nothing. Ambition at any costs, with no guardrails, is dangerous,” she said in a tweet.

So it falls to Florida’s Democratic party, written off by DeSantis a year ago as “a dead, rotten carcass”, to form the resistance, Fried says. Buoyed by a string of successes at the ballot box, including Donna Deegan’s victory in Jacksonville’s mayoral race last May, and new state congressman Tom Keen’s ousting of a Republican incumbent earlier this month, Democrats see a momentum shift fueled by anger at DeSantis they hope will carry through to November.
“The balance is making sure we’re holding Republicans accountable for their votes for the policies that were, and are, rejected by Floridians, and by the same respect talking about what we are going to do when we get out of the super-minority and start picking up seats,” Fried said.
“I mean not just in the legislature, but good Democrats elected all the way down to school boards, and city and county commission seats.
“What policies are we looking to reverse or to move forward on? People are tired of the divisiveness. People are tired of the anger and they just want their government to get back to work.”
Ultimately, Fried believes, Republican voters nationwide rejected DeSantis because they saw the same traits, she says, that have become familiar to Floridians.
“There’s nothing there. There’s no soul. There’s no charisma. There’s no ability to connect to a voter or to show true empathy,” she said.
“It turned voters off. They didn’t like his personality and then they didn’t like his policies, so combine the two of them and this is the result, a disaster of a presidential campaign and from all calculations, the most expensive presidential primary bid in American history.
“Americans don’t want to be Florida. They see what’s happened here in our state. And so voters now are going to be walking away, especially independent voters, from a very authoritarian overreaching of Ron DeSantis and this Florida Republican party.”"
HHSFNUAH9K_571ZPITXWAOSO2P,Labour vows to reform ministerial severance pay after Tories handed £1m last year,Aletha Adu,_,20230126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/jan/26/labour-reform-ministerial-severance-pay-tories,"Labour has pledged to reform the rules surrounding ministerial redundancy payments after it emerged that the high turnover of cabinet ministers under the past three prime ministers generated a severance bill worth more than £930,000 in the last financial year.
Since 1991, sacked ministers under the age of 65 have been able to claim thousands of pounds in redundancy pay as long as they have been out of a ministerial post for at least three weeks. The receive the payments irrespective of how long they have stayed in their latest post, or the circumstances under which they left.
Keir Starmer’s party has said it would introduce three changes to the rules. Labour believes it could make savings every financial year of more than 40% if it ensures ministers receive only a quarter of their actual earnings over the last 12 months as a minister, instead of their final annual salary, minus any period covered by a previous severance entitlement.
The party would also ensure that the relevant amount would be taken back from any MP who returns to a ministerial position while still receiving a payout from a previous appointment, to stop ministers receiving a full three-month payout even if they return to the frontbench during that period.
Finally, any minister who left a job while under investigation for allegations of misconduct or breaches of the ministerial code would have their severance suspended and quashed entirely if the allegations were upheld, bringing their treatment into line with the rules for civil servants and special advisers.
If Labour’s rules were enforced over the last financial year, the party says only 76 payments would have been handed out, instead of 98. The severance bill of the last financial year could have been slashed by more than 40%, from £933,086 to £555,093.
Chris Pincher and Peter Bone received severance payments despite being investigated for misconduct. Pincher quit in 2022 after allegations of groping and was handed £7,920 on leaving his deputy chief whip role.
Bone was given £5,593 after he stepped down when voters in his constituency chose to trigger a byelection following a finding by the parliamentary watchdog that he had broken the MPs’ code of conduct on four counts of bullying and one of sexual misconduct.
The former Wellingborough MP was one of five frontbenchers handed payouts in error, as he is six years over the age limit. If the age limit was properly enforced by the Conservatives, Nadine Dorries would not have received £16,876, Deborah Stedman-Scott would not have received £17,742, and both Sir David Evennett and Maggie Throup would not have been handed £10,072.
Rehman Chishti, who spent just two months as a Foreign Office minister in the late stages of Boris Johnson’s premiership (including two days as a candidate for the Tory leadership), would have had his payout cut from £5,593 to £936 under Labour’s rules.
Brandon Lewis, who received two payments totalling £33,572 in just four months after leaving his jobs as Northern Ireland secretary in July 2022 and justice secretary 16 weeks later, would have had his entitlement cut to £13,594.
Alec Shelbrooke, Jackie Doyle-Price and Rob Butler, who had short spells on the frontbench under Liz Truss and left with severance payments totalling £21,433 plus a knighthood, a damehood and an OBE respectively, would have had their payouts reduced to a total of £2,682.
Jonathan Ashworth MP, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, said: “We saw individuals who were never fit for ministerial office in the first place being forced to quit after their shameful conduct was exposed but still walking away with a payout from the taxpayer.“Under the current rules, every single one of those Tory ministers was legally entitled to three months of severance at their final-salary level, no matter how long they had been in post, no matter the circumstances of their departure, and – in most cases – no matter how quickly they returned to the frontbench. These are the glaring loopholes that Labour’s proposed reforms will seek to close.”"
HI1RETZURE_5WOSLA8CWDF3IA1,Documentary uncovers the difficult battle to unionize at Amazon,Adrian Horton,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/jan/22/sundance-film-festival-amazon-documentary,"A new documentary on the formation of the Amazon Labor Union – the first union at America’s second-largest employer and one of the most significant organized labor victories in decades – premiered on Sunday at the Sundance Film Festival, a major distribution festival at which Amazon will be bidding.
Union, directed by Brett Story and Stephen Maing, tracks the Amazon Labor Union (ALU) from its early organizing efforts at the JFK8 warehouse on New York’s Staten Island in spring 2021, through a contentious vote to establish the union in April 2022. The approval by a two-thirds majority, considered a watershed victory in the nascent new labor movement, made JFK8 the first unionized Amazon workplace. The mega-corporation, which currently employs 1.5 million people in the United States, disputed the terms of the election. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) dismissed the complaint, which the company has since appealed.
The 102-minute film, made over of the course of three years, combines verité footage of union activity on Zoom and outside JFK8, as well as footage of Amazon-led mandatory “trainings” to discourage workers from supporting the union, covertly filmed by organizing employees. In one such session, known as a “captive audience” meeting, an anonymous Amazon manager instructs workers: “We’re asking you to do three simple things: get the facts, ask questions and vote no to the union.”
The videos serve as evidence of Amazon’s vigorous anti-union efforts; the company spent $4.2m on anti-union consultants in 2021, and another $14.2m in 2022.
Workers in the film testify to numerous issues at the JFK8 facility, which employs over 8,000 workers. Among them: lunch breaks too short to allow workers time to walk across campus to the cafeteria; minimal vacation time; inhumane treatment such as refusal of bathroom breaks; lack of PPE equipment during the Covid pandemic, resulting in worker illness or death; lack of job security; racial and gender discrimination; and low pay, particularly given the multibillion-dollar company’s wealth. (The film opens with footage of the Blue Origin rocket paid for by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who has a net worth of about $206bn.)
The ALU organizers sought longer breaks, paid time off for injured employees and an hourly wage of $30, up from a minimum of just over $18 per hour offered by Amazon. The estimated average wage for Staten Island is $41 per hour, according to a US Census Bureau analysis of the borough’s $85,381 median household income.
The documentary particularly focuses on the union founder and president, Chris Smalls, a former JFK8 warehouse employee who was fired in 2020, shortly after he helped organize a work stoppage in protest over the warehouse’s lack of protective gear and hazard pay. The film opens in spring 2021, as Smalls was beginning to gain media attention and campus notoriety for his organizing work.
At the time, the ALU was in talks with more established national unions about a partnership. During a closed-door meeting with one major union, the aftermath of which is caught on camera, ALU leaders grew frustrated by what they described as condescension and infantilization by the union representative and decide to go on their own. “I’m tired of people assuming shit – ‘I want to make sure you’re doing it for the people.’ We are the fucking people!” says a fired-up Smalls, imitating the union representative.
The bulk of the film tracks the ALU’s efforts to win legal legitimacy. First, through collecting enough petitions via grassroots campaigning, including soliciting workers with free pizza and cannabis and phone-banking all 8,000-plus employees. Next, winning an NLRB-conducted election without establishment union support, organizing or funding. According to the organizers, the company responded to the election by escalating anti-union propaganda, the personal denigration of Smalls and harassment of unionizing employees, such as writing them up for infractions and threatening to withhold pay. (A judge later found Amazon guilty of illegal anti-union tactics.) In one scene in the spring of 2022, Amazon management call New York City police to arrest Smalls and supporters still employed at Amazon when they refused to leave the warehouse’s visitors’ parking lot. “They’re out here hitting us with 100-year-old techniques. It’s actually hilarious,” says one organizer of the messaging.
The film also touches on internal divisions over future strategy and Smalls’s leadership style, which favored holding elections at other Amazon facilities rather than focusing on a contract at JFK8. (The ALU victory at Staten Island was followed by two resounding losses at other facilities in New York.) In one standout scene, a former ALU organizer named Natalie, who left the union over disagreements with its direction and advocated waiting for an established union with a “no” vote, voiced her concerns to a union leader. “I wanted to be a part of other organizations that actually appreciated what I could bring to the table instead of constantly feeling like I was being fought with every single day or ignored or dismissed or disrespected,” she says. “I can’t leave one boys club at Amazon and work for another boys club in the union.”
Union does not include any interviews with Amazon management or with employees actively fighting the union, a decision Story attributed to the film’s verité mandate. “It was really important to offer this really intimate view of a group of organizers in an observational mode,” she told Variety at Sundance. “We didn’t want to break up that intimacy with interviews that would feel like they were just outside of the vocabulary of the film.”
Despite the ALU’s victory at JFK8, the film ends on a muted note, given the tenuous cohesion of the union, which has led to independent factions within it, and the failure of unionization efforts at other Amazon facilities. Amazon is still appealing the NLRB to dismiss the union’s election, and has refused negotiate with the ALU for a contract at JFK8.
The film is searching for distribution at Sundance, with a potential release date to be announced."
HI81AXIB8S_ZL3QJJU1ZPYA9B4,Thousands trapped in Gaza hospitals as Israeli troops encircle Khan Younis,Bethan McKernan,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/24/thousands-trapped-in-gaza-hospitals-as-israeli-troops-encircle-khan-younis,"Thousands of people sheltering in hospitals in Khan Younis are now trapped by Israel’s assault on the Gaza Strip’s second largest city, even as a delegation from Hamas travelled to Egypt for the latest round of talks aimed at another ceasefire and hostage-release deal.
The Israeli army said on Wednesday that it had “encircled” the southern city of Khan Younis after two days of heavy fighting, in what Israeli officials have described as the last large ground assault in the three-month-old war before a shift to “lower intensity” operations aimed at eradicating the Palestinian militant group.
By Wednesday morning, fierce battles had reached the gates of Khan Younis’s three main hospitals – al-Aqsa, Nasser and al-Amal – making it difficult for civilians to flee, according to Ocha, the UN humanitarian agency.
A building at a training centre in the city run by the UN’s agency for Palestinian refugees, where about 800 people had sought shelter, was hit by tank shelling on Wednesday, according to the agency’s director, who said on social media that nine people had been killed and 75 injured, with medical teams unable to access the building.
The incident drew criticism from the US state department. Spokesman Vedant Patel said: “We deplore today’s attack on the UN’s Khan Younis training centre. Civilians must be protected, and the protected nature of UN facilities must be respected, and humanitarian workers must be protected so that they can continue providing civilians with the life-saving humanitarian assistance that they need.”
After the US criticism, Israel denied that its forces were responsible and suggested Hamas may have launched the shells.
Approximately 88,000 Palestinians live in Khan Younis, which is also hosting an estimated 425,000 people displaced by fighting elsewhere in the tiny coastal territory.
About 18,000 people were believed to be sheltering in the grounds of Nasser hospital alone, Ocha said, along with 850 patients.
“No one can enter or exit [Nasser] due to ongoing bombardments,” the agency added, citing medics who also reported that staff were digging graves in the grounds of the facility “due to the large numbers of fatalities anticipated”.
Nasser hospital is one of only two in the southern half of Gaza that can still treat critically ill patients. The siege reports were also confirmed by Doctors Without Borders and the Hamas-run territory’s health ministry.
Israel has ordered residents to leave a swath of central Khan Younis that includes the three hospitals as it pushes ahead with the offensive against Hamas, triggered by the group’s unprecedented attack on Israel in which 1,140 people were killed and approximately 240 seized as hostages.
More than 25,700 people in Gaza had now been killed in the aerial and ground fighting, local authorities said on Wednesday.
About 85% of the besieged strip’s population of 2.3 million people have been displaced from their homes, and are now dealing with cold, hunger and disease in unsanitary and chaotic makeshift displacement camps.
In a video published by ITV News, a man the reporter had just interviewed, one of a group of five with a white flag, was shot dead by Israeli soldiers despite holding his hands above his head.
The Israel Defense Forces said in a comment that it “categorically denies any existence of ‘field executions’” and says Hamas using Gaza’s population as human shields is to blame for the operation’s devastating civilian death toll. The group denies the allegation.
During November’s week-long ceasefire, 110 hostages were released in exchange for 240 Palestinian women and children held in Israeli prisons, but multiple rounds of US, Egypt and Qatar-led negotiations, also focused on facilitating aid into Gaza, have since failed.
A Hamas delegation that travelled to the Egyptian capital on Tuesday night remained there on Wednesday as talks continued, an Egyptian security source said, but Israeli sources told the Hebrew-language press that the parties were still far from agreeing terms.
The current deal under review is believed to include a pause in fighting that will last 30 days, in which Israeli hostages are to be freed in several instalments, but Israeli spokesperson Eylon Levy said on Tuesday that the country would not agree to any terms in which Hamas remained in power in Gaza.
Hamas has “absolutely” rejected Israel’s offer to end the war if six senior leaders in the Gaza Strip agree to go into exile, Reuters reported, and has reiterated that Israel must agree to a permanent end to the fighting as part of any hostage deal.
Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, was criticised last week for reiterating his opposition to an independent Palestinian state, a stance at odds with the US, Israel’s most important ally, which says it is determined to restart peace talks aimed at a two-state solution to the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Joe Biden has expended vast amounts of international and domestic political capital in defending Israel’s war effort, despite global outcry over the conflict’s devastating humanitarian toll.
Support for the war remains high among Israelis, but opinion polls show lagging support for Netanyahu and his far-right coalition. Weekly rallies on Saturday nights demanding the release of hostages have been supplemented in recent weeks by growing calls for elections.
Tuesday’s killing of 21 Israeli soldiers who were mining buildings for demolition and were hit by grenade fire – the deadliest single incident for Israeli forces in the conflict to date – has augmented public dissent over the war.
The longer the violence in Gaza drags on, the more the risk of regional escalation grows.
The fighting has already drawn in Iranian proxy groups in Yemen, Syria and Iraq, and led to retaliatory US airstrikes around the region. A new conflict with the Lebanese group Hezbollah on Israel’s northern border, where clashes that began in October have intensified in recent weeks, is widely viewed as the most dangerous flashpoint.
On Tuesday, Hezbollah said it had struck the Israeli air control base on the strategically important Mount Meron for a second time in recent weeks, in response to what it said were Israeli “assassinations” and attacks on civilians."
HIPSJU9HFV_PLD0SUC4XFZNW6G,Alabama condemned for nitrogen gas execution: ‘They intended to torture him’,Sam Levine,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/26/alabama-nitrogen-gas-execution-torture,"Alabama faced widespread condemnation after the state executed Kenneth Eugene Smith on Thursday evening using nitrogen gas, the first time the method has been used in the United States to kill someone.
Smith’s execution by “nitrogen hypoxia” took around 22 minutes, according to media witnesses, who were led into a viewing room at the William C Holman correctional facility in Atmore shortly before 8pm local time.
Smith was fitted with a face mask. He used sign language to say “I love you” to witnesses in the viewing room, and in his final statement he said: “Tonight, Alabama caused humanity to take a step backward.”
After the nitrogen gas began flowing, Smith convulsed on the gurney for several minutes. The state had previously said the nitrogen gas would cause Smith to lose consciousness in seconds and die within minutes, according to the Associated Press.
“I’ve been to four previous executions and I’ve never seen a condemned inmate thrash in the way that Kenneth Smith reacted to the nitrogen gas,” Lee Hedgepeth, a journalist who witnessed the execution, told the BBC’s Newsday programme.
Jeff Hood, Smith’s spiritual adviser, was in the death chamber when Smith was killed. In a tearful television interview with CNN, he said Smith “popped up on the gurney over and over and over again. He shook the whole gurney.”
“I have never, ever seen anything like that,” he said. “That was torture.”
“I could see the corrections officers that were in there,” he added. “I think they were very surprised that this didn’t go smoother.”
Volker Turk, the UN high commissioner for Human Rights, said on Friday: “I deeply regret the execution of Kenneth Eugene Smith in Alabama despite serious concerns this novel and untested method of suffocation by nitrogen gas may amount to torture, or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.”
Four independent UN monitors had called on Alabama to call off the execution earlier this month.
The EU diplomatic service also condemned the execution. “According to leading experts, this method is a particularly cruel and unusual punishment, in addition to the fact that the inmate was already subjected to a failed execution attempt in November 2022,” it said in a statement.
John Hamm, the commissioner of Alabama’s department of corrections, said during a press conference on Thursday there was “nothing out of the ordinary” about Smith’s execution. “It appeared Smith held his breath for as long as he could, and struggled against his restraints,” he said. “This was expected.”
Maya Foa, joint executive director of the international human rights group Reprieve, said Smith’s execution was “torture” and disputed the claim that the execution was successful.
“Alabama is predictably claiming that this dangerous experimental method is now ‘proven’. Executing states are constantly looking for ways to pretend that executions are medical and modern, not brutal and violent,” she said in a statement.
“They said lethal injection was humane – that was a lie. They’re claiming this execution was humane, and that is a lie, too.”
Joel Zivot, an expert on execution at the Emory University School of Medicine, said the accounts of Smith’s death were what he anticipated. “He struggled to stay alive as his brain became deprived of oxygen. It is possible he had a seizure at some point and his death was of course slow and agonizing,” he said.
“The Alabama department of corrections claims the execution went exactly as they anticipated. Therefore, it can only be concluded that they intended to torture him to death. Further, the use of torture in execution is the definition of cruelty.”
Smith was convicted in the 1988 murder of Elizabeth Sennett. Sennett’s husband, a pastor, allegedly paid Smith and another man $1,000 each to kill her.
A jury voted 11-1 to sentence Smith to life in prison, but the judge overseeing the case overrode that decision and sentenced him to death. That practice, called judicial override, has since been eliminated in all 50 US states.
Some of Sennett’s relatives attended the execution and told reporters they had forgiven Smith.
“Nothing that happened here today is going to bring Mom back,” sais Mike Sennett, Elizabeth Sennett’s son. “It’s a bittersweet day, we’re not going to be jumping around, hooping and hollering, hooraying and all that, that’s not us. We’re glad this day is over.”
Bryan Stevenson, a well-known lawyer who has fought against the death penalty and founded the non-profit Equal Justice Initiative, also condemned Smith’s execution.
“The threshold question of the death penalty isn’t whether someone deserves to die for the crime they’ve committed. The threshold question is: do we deserve to kill?” he said in an interview on CNN.
“In our society, we don’t rape people who rape. We don’t torture people who torture. That’s because we believe that the integrity of the law means we have to do better than the worst offenders in our society.”
Alabama previously tried to execute Smith by lethal injection in November of 2022. But after strapping him to a gurney for four hours, they called it off after they were unable to find a vein.
Kay Ivey, Alabama’s Republican governor, said the execution was “lawfully carried out by nitrogen hypoxia, the method previously requested by Mr Smith as an alternative to lethal injection”.
“After more than 30 years and attempt after attempt to game the system, Mr Smith has answered for his horrendous crimes,” she said in a statement.
The US supreme court also rejected a last-minute request to halt Smith’s execution on Thursday, with the court’s three liberal justices – Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson – all dissenting.
Sotomayor said nitrogen hypoxia was “untested” and Smith was being used as a “guinea pig”. “With deep sadness, but commitment to the eighth amendment’s protection against cruel and unusual punishment, I respectfully dissent,” she wrote.
Smith spoke to the Guardian days before he was executed. He described suffering from PTSD after the first failed execution attempt and was “sick to his stomach” most days. He said he was not prepared to return to the death chamber. “I am not ready for that. Not in no kind of way. I’m just not ready, brother,” he said.
He also said he feared other states would begin to kill people using nitrogen gas. “I fear that it will be successful, and you will have a nitrogen system coming to your state very soon,” he said."
HJK6FZI4Y2_93D9UY1JS7QHO9Y,My life with Shere Hite: the forgotten feminist who changed sex for ever,Joanna Briscoe,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/24/my-life-with-shere-hite-the-forgotten-feminist-who-changed-sex-for-ever,"Shere Hite was a legend of her time who landed in my small ex-council flat when I was in my 20s. She was two decades older and seemed to me to be an extraordinary, exotic creature transmuted from celluloid into strange reality in my home. To those over 50, Hite – a pivotal figure in the second wave feminist movement – was a much-photographed writer and sexologist: a mix between Germaine Greer and a movie star. To those younger, the name draws a blank. Hence the title of Nicole Newnham’s superb new documentary, The Disappearance of Shere Hite.
I had known about this feminist author from my mother’s bookshelf when I was a child, read about her in Cosmopolitan as a teenager and was quite fascinated by the idea of her by the time I was 25 and went to interview her.
Born in Missouri in 1942, she published The Hite Report in 1976, which has sold more than 50m copies and is by some estimates the 30th bestselling book of all time. It was a landmark that brought her wealth and fame and upended the dialogue on female sexuality, most notably by proving that most women orgasmed through clitoral stimulation rather than penetration. Her later surprising findings about male insecurity in The Hite Report on Male Sexuality (1981), and female marital dissatisfaction in Women & Love: A Cultural Revolution in Progress (1987), were anathema to the increasing conservatism of the US in the 1980s. The backlash against her and her work was so extreme that eventually she renounced her American citizenship.
So there she was, in London in 1989, for the appointed interview, ridiculously beautiful at 46 in a pale, almost unearthly way. She was glamorous, and the 1940s Hollywood style that she had made her own cast her as different from others in the feminist movement, who tended to adopt a more practical aesthetic. She greeted me by pouncing on my burgundy velvet jacket: she loved it, so she sent her poor publicist off to the shops with her credit card to find one – but none were to be found.
We talked about feminism, life, publishing, politics, relationships. I was drenched in her charm, floating on her weird, hypnotic voice as she wove words such as “clitoris” and “masturbation” through her sentences. A bouquet arrived from a newspaper. She decided she wanted to give it to me. I left our meeting floating beneath flowers, my fascination thoroughly reinforced. On my way back to the office, I went into the shop where I had bought my jacket. A single one was left. In the sale. It had to be.
A few days later, Shere’s voice drifted from my clunky tape answering machine, thanking me for the jacket I’d sent and giving me her New York number. Eighteen months later, she was in my flat. Having fled the US, she had been commuting between Paris, the Kensington Hilton and a mattress on the floor of a squat in north London: the ways of her formerly wealthy life clashing with the financial reality of her present. She perpetually swung between spending and thrift.
By the time I got to know her in 1990, she was in trouble. She had been the victim of vicious media attacks, doorstepping, public humiliation and death threats, all of which contributed to the loss of her American publishers and of her ability to make a living. Her findings on sex – now widely accepted – caused outrage, and her appearance was used by critics to detract from the seriousness of her work at a time when there were rigid expectations of what a feminist firebrand should look like. She could also be difficult, it has to be said. Most notoriously, she apparently attacked a limo driver who had called her “dear”.
She became a European citizen before quietly separating from her German husband, with whom she was barely in contact in the years I knew her. We had begun an on-off relationship in Paris, and between 1991 and 1997, she lived largely between France and my home, where she researched and wrote ceaselessly. The royalties from those hit books still came in, but she needed a market for new work and dedicated herself to rebuilding her career with phenomenal focus.
Shere had never known her father and had been abandoned twice by her mother. Then the grandparents who raised her divorced and she was sent to be raised by an aunt. Clearly this was not a stable foundation for life as an activist whose theories caused such fury. In London, after she had begun to lose the wealth and success she had created, she retreated, to hide, recover and restock.
She would write for much of the night, sometimes in pyjamas and curlers, as she worked on new theories. She slept in the day, waking in time for us to go out to dinner. It was her only real leisure activity apart from bouts of high-speed shopping at Harvey Nichols – her personal style was vital to her identity. Occasionally, we crossed in the morning: as I was getting up, she was going to bed. Her somewhat vampiric pallor along with her almost disconcerting beauty could make her seem illusory. Other times, she failed to emerge from behind her piles of papers even into daylight.
I was writing my first novel while supporting myself as a features writer, while Shere, who described herself as a “cultural historian”, was trying to figure out the state of the world, untangle it and capture it in accessible form. She was eternally curious, asking me questions about sex, politics and younger women’s emotional lives. I could offer her a different viewpoint that was useful – but could be discomfiting if it wandered too far from her own theories. She didn’t look like any of my friends. Her skin was whiter than anyone’s I knew, contrasting with scarlet lipstick. Her slenderness and elegance belonged more on screen than real life. She exercised daily, always indoors, once disappearing into a cupboard in a bookshop to complete her stretches before giving a speech.
Shere had an extraordinary effect on people – possessing a strange, delicate charisma that hooked them. “Our team did all fall a bit in love with her, I think,” says Newnham, about making her documentary. At the parties I had in my flat, I could see the gazes, the entrancement, the curiosity. “I thought waists like that only existed in the 18th century,” said one guest, goggling at her in her Norma Kamali jacket. Business cards were pushed into her hands. Dates suggested. Projects proposed. People – including me – always felt the need to help her; taxi drivers would leap out of their car to carry her bags. She took it all in her stride: the cards proliferated on her desk, ignored or Sellotaped to her notes as she worked on. Seemingly never maternal, in some ways she needed mothering herself. Perhaps others sensed this.
The weirdness of having what a friend called “that international diva” ensconced in my flat cannot be underestimated. “What? Shere Hite’s in there?” people would exclaim, glancing up at the unprepossessing block.
People wanted a piece of the feminist femme fatale, yet once my closest friends had got over the novelty – much as I adored her – I needed a break from the intensity an existence with Shere entailed. We would intermittently hide, going for drinks at the nearby Russell Hotel instead of in my flat because we wanted to distance ourselves from what I can only describe as the Shere Show, and giggle and talk twentysomething nonsense without her scrutinising us or correcting us if she detected sexism, fervent young feminists though we all were.
In retrospect, I see that I was out of my depth in trying to steer through life with Shere, exciting though it was. My much-loved father had recently died young; I was in a state of bereavement, working hard, and here was this woman with a whole career established and a marriage behind her, although her otherworldly presence was also a distraction from the grief.
A novelist friend later said about that period: “I thought you were living a kind of dream life.” I gasped at the idea. My youthful neuroses, bereavement, crying fits and self-castigation flourished alongside vanity and daring. I see now that spending so much time with that dazzling trailblazer, with her decades of experience, her sophistication and celebrity lifestyle – aspects of which remained as she flew to Hamburg for a haircut and bought piles of unaffordable designer clothes – was hard to negotiate as a young woman trying to make her own way.
But during this period, she was oddly isolated, and didn’t seem to have kept many friends from her New York years, when she had her Fifth Avenue apartment and went to celebrity parties. I’d come back home amused to find long messages from Ruby Wax for her on my answerphone, yet she was largely a recluse. She was as fragile as she was tough. As guarded as she was flamboyant.
She would stay a month, disappear to Paris and Rome, engage in mysterious activities, the Roman connection vague, then come back and stay for more months. She took over my basement storage locker with her clothes and papers, just as she did in other cities. She took offence freely. It was easy to say the wrong thing and wind up her sensitivity, a kind of narcissistic armour protecting her from the darkness of her earlier years. As her ex-boyfriend, the writer Martin Sage, said: “It was like entering a different universe and not understanding the rules.” She was well known for screaming and losing her temper, getting us chucked out of taxis for it. I was once with her in La Coupole in Paris when she turned against a waiter and started throwing sugar lumps at him while I sat there open-mouthed.
It was also enormous fun. As an impassioned young feminist, full of the revolution, I loved listening to this fighter for the cause, refining my perceptions of patriarchy. We both loved clothes and she took me to hidden secondhand shops in Islington before “vintage” was a concept and was always good for a styling session. We watched the early Hollywood films she loved, the sillier and more music-filled the better, listened to political debates and discussed at length her horror at the rise of the religious right in the US.
She rarely cooked or cleaned the flat, and wrapped up steaks from restaurants to take home in her handbag. I would return home to find my fax machine emptied of paper, piles of work on every surface, some cheap wacky present from her on the table or the most beautiful long-stemmed roses I had ever seen. When I had my first novel accepted for publication, she bought me a velvet heart-shaped Lacroix necklace that now looks as though it came straight from Absolutely Fabulous, yet was much treasured. She once admitted she had thrown her sheets down the rubbish chute in Paris rather than wash them, finding it quicker to buy more. I found all this hilarious – I was much more stimulated by the wildness and naughtiness of others than I was by doing this kind of thing myself.
This was a sentimental education, a rich and frustrating and eye-opening period, and despite all the dramas and demands, I’m glad she was there. This woman was truly ahead of her time. Regardless of her strict religious 1940s upbringing, she somehow thought in a clear-sighted and entirely liberal way, called herself bisexual before it was acceptable and was rarely shocked by anything. A revolution was going on inside her head. She was genuinely passionate about her message.
Time moved on, we formed different lives, but we kept up a friendship, and Shere eventually moved to London full-time. I last saw her when she became ill, in my house with my family and her partner, along with the photographer Iris Brosch, whose portraits had given her so much pleasure. When she died in 2020, the obituaries were widespread to the extent that various film-makers began to wonder why they had never heard of such a significant figure and started to pitch documentaries. Newnham, who, like me, had seen her mother’s copy of The Hite Report, succeeded in the task.
At a time when the fight must be continued, when women’s history is routinely erased, I’m so very happy that Shere is being celebrated as she should be. She deserves to be acknowledged by a new generation. I think of her when I wear a particular velvet jacket she gave me, and recently realised that the story of velvet jackets came full circle. She was a revolutionary; an iconoclast of great tenacity and courage who completely changed the conversation about women and sex. She enhanced all our lives."
HKHUNIEKV8_NCHW5KWQACBQXSI,Andrew O’Keefe avoids jail time for assault and drug possession convictions,_,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/24/andrew-okeefe-avoids-jail-time-for-assault-and-drug-possession-convictions,"The former TV host Andrew O’Keefe has avoided jail despite being found guilty of “violent and degrading” domestic attacks.
The broadcaster was hit with three sets of charges over multiple incidents in 2021, including assault causing actual bodily harm, breaching a domestic violence order and possession of the synthetic stimulant drug mephedrone. O’Keefe denied the charges.
Magistrate Alison Viney on Wednesday found O’Keefe’s actions in kicking, spitting, scratching and otherwise assaulting a woman, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, deserved condemnation.
“Your actions were violent and degrading,” she told Sydney’s Downing Centre local court while describing O’Keefe’s September 2021 assault on the woman during an argument.
“You placed [the victim] in a position of fear, not only for herself but for her children in her own home.”
O’Keefe was ordered to serve 18 months on a community corrections order, which involves supervision and reporting requirements. He was fined $800 for drug offences.
Viney said O’Keefe’s indifference to the domestic violence order in repeatedly contacting the victim was a concern for the court. His behaviour showed “absolute disregard for what is supposed to be an effective tool for the protection of victims of domestic violence in our community”, she said.

The magistrate described his behaviour over multiple incidents in September 2021 as “frightening and degrading” for the victim.
The court heard O’Keefe called the woman a “lying dog” and a “cunt” and assaulted her several times, including striking her with an open hand.
A neighbour’s evidence formed a crucial part in corroborating the victim’s statements during the hearing. They heard the pair fighting on an evening in September 2021 and later saw the victim distressed with scratches to her upper body.
Numerous photographs of the victim’s injuries, including bruising and scratches to her arms and chest, were tendered during hearings in November.
O’Keefe, dressed in a teal-green suit, became agitated and muttered throughout parts of the judgment, shaking his head at times as the magistrate read out her findings.
He denied the woman’s accusations, previously telling the court: “None of this happened.”

O’Keefe earlier pleaded guilty to contravening the domestic violence order and possessing cannabis.
He was found in possession of the synthetic stimulant mephedrone, known as “meow-meow”, after a pre-Christmas party at his Sydney city-centre residence.
O’Keefe’s rehabilitation was noted as a matter of ongoing concern given his guilty plea for drug-driving offences late in 2023. He had previous charges dismissed on mental health grounds after an incident in January 2021, during which he slapped the woman and spat in her face.
“I accept your mental health condition may have contributed to your actions,” Viney said as she detailed his bipolar diagnosis and psychiatric treatment.
But she added a pattern of behaviour was evident in the multiple domestic violence-related incidents. An earlier charge of resisting police arrest was dismissed by the court.
Speaking to reporters outside court, O’Keefe said he intended to appeal against the convictions.

HP66P12873_60YUEY87UUF6V9B,This Blessed Plot review – offbeat docu-drama explores Englishness in Essex,Peter Bradshaw,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/jan/22/this-blessed-plot-review-offbeat-docu-drama-explores-englishness-in-essex,"There’s an eccentric Englishness in this quirky, microbudget feature from screenwriter Adam Ganz and director Marc Isaacs. They have created a kind of docu-fictional guided reality, a weird soap set in the picturesque Essex town of Thaxted, known for its association with the composer Gustav Holst who was entranced by its beauty and established a music festival there with the encouragement of its Christian socialist vicar, Conrad Noel.
Ganz and Isaacs have got some present-day Thaxted inhabitants to play heightened or fictionally modified versions of themselves, in a story interspersed with black-and-white clips from Ripe Earth, the Boulting brothers’ early short film from 1938, also set in Thaxted. Lori (Yingge Lori Yang) is a young Chinese film-maker who has come to Thaxted to record the local traditions, especially the morris dancing, but finds herself drawn into the world of Keith (Keith Martin), a fierce Arsenal fan, devastated by the recent loss of his wife, who looked after his financial affairs, but may not have been faithful to him. Conrad Noel’s ghostly voice speaks to Lori, explaining how socialism grows naturally from the teachings of Christ, and she is also visited by the ghost of Keith’s late wife who is tormented by her need to confess from beyond the grave.
As for Thaxted itself, it isn’t exactly the Shakespearean “demi-paradise” declaimed by Keith. There is what looks like a nasty altercation in the pub, occasioned by Lori’s presence, and Isaacs allows us to glimpse what looks like someone in minstrel blackface in an old photograph of a morris dancing scene. There are, however, no mentions of Brexit. An odd, but diverting modern pastoral scene, which refuses a parochial view of England.
This Blessed Plot is released on 26 January in UK cinemas."
HQ06R1LSWX_F5X2D1MAITMFX9E,Geldof and Colman urge Home Office to reconsider climate activist’s deportation,Sandra Laville,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/26/geldof-coleman-urge-home-office-to-reconsider-climate-activist-marcus-decker-deportation,"Leading actors and musicians including Bob Geldof, Olivia Colman and Emma Thompson are calling on the Home Office to reconsider the “harsh deportation” of a climate activist who is serving one of the longest prison sentences in modern British history for peaceful protest.
Along with the musicians Brian Eno and Jacob Collier, they are among about 600 artists who are urging James Cleverly to withdraw the deportation order issued to Marcus Decker.
Decker is serving a jail sentence of two years and seven months for a protest in which he climbed the Queen Elizabeth Bridge over the Dartford Crossing and unveiled a Just Stop Oil banner in October 2022.
Decker, who is German, was served a deportation order by the Home Office while in prison.
The actors spoke out as the British government was criticised this week by the UN special rapporteur on environmental defenders. Michel Forst said the severe crackdown on environmental protest was having a chilling effect on fundamental freedoms.
In their letter, the actors say: “We believe that punishing him [Decker] with deportation in addition to the 14 months he has already spent in prison is out of proportion to the crime committed and unconducive to the public good.”
They say the protest Decker created was peaceful, adding “no one was harmed” and that it lasted less than two days.
“Consider that just in January of this year police closed both the Dartford Crossing and the Dartford Tunnel due to dangerous weather conditions, causing substantial disruption. Such extreme weather will only become increasingly frequent with escalating climate change.
“It was to prevent horrific disruption and suffering that Marcus took part in this action.”
Their words echoed those of Forst, who said this week that climate activists were acting for the “benefit of us all” and must be protected.
More than 150,000 people have signed a petition against Decker’s deportation.
The letter says: “We urge you to consider what it would look like to the rest of the world if the UK, which prides itself in leading on climate action, were to start deporting human rights defenders like Marcus.”
Decker’s partner, Holly Cullen-Davies, a musician, said he planned to fight his deportation through the courts once he had been released from prison. His release is expected soon.
Decker’s fellow protester Morgan Trowland, who was given a three-year jail term, was released in December.
“Deporting Marcus is the ultimate punishment not just for Marcus but for us his family. It comes on top of one of the longest jail sentences for a climate protester and is a double punishment,” said Cullen-Davies. “Marcus is staying really calm as he waits for his release; it is torture for all of us. He find the prospect of deportation impossible to bear or imagine. I don’t know what we will do if that happens.
“What I would say to the government, though, is you cannot deport dissent and you cannot deport the climate crisis.”
Cullen-Davies said she had had to give up most of her work to campaign against the deportation of her partner and was relying on donations from environmental campaigners to keep herself afloat financially.
Decker is unlikely to be deported immediately on his release as he has filed a legal challenge to the order.
The letter follows a similar appeal to the home secretary from hundreds of scientists including James Dyke, associate professor in Earth system science and the assistant director of the Global Systems Institute at the University of Exeter, and Julia K Steinberger, professor of ecological economics at the University of Lausanne, Switzerland.
Forst, the UN rapporteur under the Aarhus convention, is gathering evidence of what he said was the worrying clampdown on climate protesters and considering what further action to take. The UK government is a signatory to the legally binding treaty and could be found to be acting illegally once his investigations are completed."
HQ2UBJWIOB_E8X994HD8DO2O0B,Can Donald Trump’s courtroom antics be contained?,Cameron Joseph,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/24/trumps-courtroom-behavior-lacking-restraint,"Donald Trump’s defamation trial against E Jean Carroll resumes in New York today after a juror’s illness delayed proceedings. But the biggest question isn’t whether Trump will be found liable (he already was) or even how much he’ll have to pay her (it could be a lot). It’s how he’ll behave – and what, if anything, the judge can do to rein him in.
The last time Trump was in court, he grumbled so loudly from his seat that the judge, Lewis Kaplan, warned him he could be kicked out of court. “Mr Trump has the right to be present here. That right can be forfeited, and it can be forfeited if he is disruptive,” he said. “Mr Trump, I hope I don’t have to consider excluding you from the trial.”
“I would love it. I would love it,” Trump replied, apparently goading the judge to land on him hard so he could use it for political fodder.
It’s hard to think of how Trump could show more contempt (in the emotional, not legal, sense) for the multiple cases against him. He has repeatedly insulted and attacked prosecutors, judges and witnesses, and has clearly decided to make a spectacle of himself showing up unannounced when he isn’t required.
It’s not like the judges in his cases haven’t tried to curtail Trump’s court theatrics. But they are in a bind: treating Trump like any other defendant and enforcing order in their courtrooms plays into his claims of political persecution.
The judge in the New York business fraud case, Arthur Engoron, ordered Trump to pay a $110,000 fine back in 2022 for dragging his feet in responding to a subpoena from the New York state attorney general. (He paid, but appealed the ruling; the money is being held in escrow until a final ruling is made.)
Last October, Engoron placed a gag order on Trump barring him from attacking court staff, fined him $5,000 for violating it when Trump publicly disparaged a court staffer, and warned him that a future violation could result in jail time. Trump ignored the warning and did it again; Engoron responded with a $10,000 fine and a warning of, “Don’t do it again, or it will be worse” – but no jail time. The Trump team’s response was to put out a statement calling Engoron a “Democrat Judge, under control of radical [New York Democratic attorney general] Letitia James”.
In Trump’s pending January 6 case in DC, the judge, Tanya Chutkan, placed a gag order on Trump last fall barring him from attacking prosecutors, court staff and potential trial witnesses after he posted inflammatory statements that called special counsel Jack Smith “deranged” and suggested his former chief of staff and a possible witness in the trial, Mark Meadows, was a coward.
Trump has appealed the order, but the federal appeals court has declined to lift it. The latest decision came on Tuesday, when the full appeals court unanimously refused to reconsider Trump’s request. He’s likely to appeal that to the US supreme court. But so far, there have been few signs he can win this particular fight.
So the judges overseeing Trump’s cases are trying to keep him in line. He just keeps thumbing his nose at their orders – and financial penalties don’t seem to be deterring him.
His claims of a “witch-hunt” have become a staple in his campaign speeches. On Tuesday, during his victory speech after winning the New Hampshire primary, he said: “Just a little note to Nikki. She’s not going to win. But if she did, she would be under investigation by those people in 15 minutes.”

The Georgia case against Trump has taken a sharp turn into tabloid fodder after Trump co-defendant Michael Roman filed a motion earlier this month seeking the disqualification of the Fulton county district attorney Fani Willis and Nathan Wade, an outside lawyer hired by Willis in 2021 to assist with the Trump case, alleging that the two were in a romantic relationship. Roman argues this creates a conflict of interest in the case because Wade used some of the $650,000 he has earned from his work to pay for vacations for the two of them. After Roman’s motion was filed, Wade’s divorce proceedings were unsealed by a judge on Monday, including records showing he had paid for flights for him and Willis to travel to Miami and San Francisco.
The Guardian’s Sam Levine spoke to local legal experts about the potential fallout.
“As a legal matter, I don’t see much of anything as of yet that would make me think that a disqualification is likely,” said Anthony Michael Kreis, a law professor at Georgia State University who has closely followed the case. “In terms of the political bucket, it is an optics disaster, but it’s also been a lot of political malpractice from the office for not responding. So this drip, drip, drip is a problem.”
Willis and Wade have yet to confirm or deny the accusations. But the matter hangs over a case that has been seen as the strongest legal option to hold Trump accountable for his attempts to overturn the 2020 election. If Willis is forced from the case, that would lead to a significant delay that could derail the investigation completely.
Elsewhere, Guardian US opinion columnist Sidney Blumenthal compares Trump’s recent all-caps declaration that he “MUST HAVE COMPLETE & TOTAL PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY” even for “EVENTS THAT ‘CROSS THE LINE’” to OJ Simpson’s If I Did It book – a tacit admission of guilt that belies his and his allies’ attempts to paint himself as something other than an insurrectionist.

A new book reports that Trump ally and South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham threw Trump “under the bus” during private testimony to the grand jury investigating election subversion in Georgia – then gave Willis a hug afterwards, telling her his testimony had been “cathartic”.
The justice department said in a court filing last Thursday that it is seeking a six-month prison sentence for Peter Navarro, a close Trump ally and former administration official who was found guilty of criminal contempt of Congress last fall for ignoring a subpoena from the House January 6 committee.
Trump foe turned endorser and Florida Republican governor Ron DeSantis made clear that he would veto a bill from local Republican lawmakers that would have used taxpayer money to pay $5m of Trump’s legal bills.
Today: the E Jean Carroll trial resumes in New York, and Trump may testify soon.
In the coming days: a judgment in the New York civil fraud trial is expected on the penalty Trump must pay for illegally inflating the value of business assets.
2 February: In the Georgia election interference case, Fani Willis must respond in writing to the allegations from Michael Roman’s attorneys. A hearing is scheduled for 15 February to consider the motion.
It’s looking more and more likely that Trump’s major criminal cases – the DC and Georgia prosecutions focusing on January 6, and the Florida case on his mishandling of classified documents – will continue to slip later in the calendar.
There’s no question that the 4 March start date judge Chutkan previously set for the DC case will be pushed back until an appeals court makes an order on Trump’s immunity claim. The only question is how long of a delay.
Meanwhile, in Georgia, where no trial date has been set by the judge, the drama around Willis’s personal life has made that case’s start date even more uncertain."
HSVCIKVRY9_UTSS1ZBIQB23R7A,Amish family’s horse and buggy stolen outside Michigan Walmart,Gloria Oladipo,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/25/amish-horse-buggy-stolen-walmart,"An Amish family from Michigan had their horse and buggy stolen during an outing to their local Walmart.
Police were called to a Walmart in Sturgis, Michigan, about 93 miles outside the city of Lansing, last Saturday at 5.30pm ET over the stolen buggy, the Sturgis department of public safety said in news release.
The victims told police that they were shopping inside of the store and found their horse and buggy stolen upon return.
Thankfully, a truck driver who was parked in the parking lot witnessed the theft and was able to give a description of the alleged perpetrator to police.
“A truck driver, parked in the Walmart lot, had seen a female steal the buggy,” read the news release. “He gave police a description of the female suspect.”
A 31-year-old woman was arrested at a local motel in connection with the stolen horse and buggy. She is being charged with larceny and larceny of livestock, according to the news release.
The family were eventually reunited with their buggy and horse, which had been discovered unoccupied. The horse was not injured during the theft.
Sergeant Aaron Moore with the Sturgis police department told the Guardian that that the suspect did not provide a motive for stealing the horse and buggy to police, and had prior encounters with officers.
“I don’t know why she did it. We caught up with the female and arrested her for stealing it,” Moore said.
Moore added that the crime was one he had not witnessed in his decades-long career.
“I’ve never had the Amish horse and buggy stolen in my 20 years [as a police officer],” he added.
Reaction to the horse-drawn buggy theft created confusion on social media.
One Facebook user commented: “Who steals a buggy?”
Another wrote: “You can’t make this stuff up.”
Many Amish people rely on a horse and buggy for transportation, rather than a modern vehicle. Amish people also tend to abstain from or selectively use modern conveniences and technologies, including electricity."
HTR0ZHXSJ3_9GLS7AX1WEZMAMN,Doctors like me get the blame when hospitals run out of medicines. Politicians get off scot-free,Ammad Butt,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/26/doctors-blame-hospitals-medicine-politicians-patients,"Medicine shortages in the UK have been a regular feature on newspaper front pages in recent years. As a doctor on the frontline, I see how this instability in our medicine supply chain is playing out on the ground.
I work in a large city hospital and am used to meeting disgruntled patients who have had to wait hours in clinic to receive treatment. But just imagine their concern when I have to explain to them that the medication we would usually treat them with is not available, and that they will have to take an alternative instead or stay in hospital for even longer as a result.
In the past year, I have heard of patients having to go without medication for common conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), diabetes and even acne that would otherwise be easily managed, or being forced to take alternatives that are less appropriate. And new EU plans for its members to work together to stockpile key medicines will only worsen shortages in the UK.
Patients tell me they feel others are receiving better treatment than they are. And they are right, in some ways. What am I supposed to tell them?Healthcare professionals are being put in a difficult situation having to explain why we are making compromises in their care. I worry this will only further increase negativity and abuse towards NHS staff, which has been on the rise in recent years. It all adds to the sense among patients and healthcare professionals alike that the health service is not working for the most vulnerable.
Seeing the tangible outcome of shortages of certain types of medication is worrying. Some patients who rely on medication to manage their ADHD are going weeks without it, despite it being vital for their mental health during what has already been a difficult winter. For some of them, this means they are unable to continue to live their lives in a functional way, being unable to work and even carry out basic day-to-day tasks until their medication arrives at the pharmacy.
The situation is similar for some anti-epileptic medications, shortages of which can be incredibly dangerous. Patients who aren’t on the correct medication can develop seizures requiring them to be put into an induced coma, which can have life-changing implications. Thankfully, I have not yet heard of a case due to shortages but this is something that doctors such as me worry could happen if the supply crisis is not addressed.
The insecticide permethrin, used to treat scabies infection, is another medication that has been in short supply. Scabies is on the rise in Britain and the shortage of permethrin could mean the condition cannot be treated before it can spread. Some patients with suspected scabies are being told to isolate in hospital, which does not kill the parasite and potentially exposes others to infection. It also means a longer stay in hospital for those affected.
With the NHS already in desperate need of beds during the winter months, having to treat patients in hospital when they would normally be sent home with medication comes at a price – both for the NHS and the communities they serve.
There has been a recent shortage of a tablet known as Sando-K, which is prescribed very often in hospital to treat low potassium levels. Doctors in some parts of the country are having to instead prescribe a fluid potassium chloride bag, which is given intravenously and puts elderly patients with comorbidities at a greater risk ofcomplications.
Different issues have been suggested as the root cause for the supply shortages, from Brexit to increased taxes on pharmaceutical companies, to manufacturing issues. But, whatever the ultimate cause, to me, it is becoming crystal clear that political inaction is worsening the situation. Recent figures suggest that since 2022, the number of medication shortages has almost doubled, and it is of no benefit to healthcare professionals or patients for the government to regurgitate the same excuses every time this happens.
We have been weathering this storm for too long, so why are our leaders so afraid to act? It should be an absolute scandal that in 21st-century Britain our medicine supply is so unstable that doctors are having to make compromises to treat patients appropriately.
Patients need to know that it is not the staff, who often work 60-hour weeks or more to look after them, who are at fault.

HYNYVK9L4A_ZE077UYPA3HYK37,UN secretary general says Israel’s rejection of two-state solution is ‘unacceptable’,Patrick Wintour,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/24/un-secretary-general-israel-rejection-palestine-two-state-solution-palestinian,"Israel’s “clear and repeated rejection of the two-state solution” is unacceptable, and could only prolong the conflict in Gaza, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, has said, at the launch of a highly charged security council debate focusing on aid shipments to Gaza.
Gutteres told the meeting in New York on Monday that the denial of a Palestinian state will only embolden extremists everywhere and indefinitely extend the conflict.
“Last week’s clear and repeated rejection of the two-state solution at the highest levels of the Israeli government is unacceptable,” Guterres told the council.
“This refusal, and the denial of the right to statehood to the Palestinian people, would indefinitely prolong a conflict that has become a major threat to global peace and security,” he said.
He said a two-state solution is the only way out of the endless cycle of fear, hatred and violence, adding it is the only way to address the legitimate aspirations of Israelis and Palestinians.
Guterres said: “The entire population of Gaza is being subjected to destruction on a scale and speed unprecedented in history. Nothing can justify the collective punishment of the people of Gaza.”
He also condemned “the deliberate killing, the wounding, the kidnapping of civilians, the use of sexual violence against them,” by Hamas.
He said: “More than half a million people face hunger in Gaza. 2.2 million people are living in inhumane squalid conditions struggling to make it through another day.”
Guterres said that disease was spreading as hospitals collapsed, warning that Palestinians in the embattled territory not only risk being killed by bombardment but by cholera, dysentery and hepatitis.
Despite all the efforts of UN staff and partners, “no effective humanitarian aid operation can function under the conditions that have been forced on Palestinians in Gaza and those doing everything possible to help them”.
Guterres said that 6,000 Palestinians had been arrested and added he was deeply troubled by reports of inhumane treatment of detainees.
He called for an immediate ceasefire to ensure aid gets to where it is needed, to facilitate the release of hostages and to lower the tensions throughout the Middle East.
Guterres warned that the risks of broader regional escalation were now becoming a reality, pointing to violence in Lebanon, Yemen, Syria and Iraq.
Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian ambassador to the UN, said that, from the G77 meeting in Kampala to the EU foreign ministers in Brussels and the UN in New York, the world was calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.
He accused Netahnyahu being driven by only one goal – his own survival – and said there was a dividing line between those that want peace and those that want to deny it.
Speaker after speaker from around the globe but especially the Middle East lined up to call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire and rapid pathway move to a two-state solution.
The Jordanian foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, said: “Stop this massacre. Adopting a binding security council resolution forcing the end of this misery is the least that you can do now. Partial solutions will not achieve this peace.
“All of you support the two-state solution that the Israeli government is undermining.”
He said the future of the region cannot be taken hostage by the political ambitions and radical agendas of Israeli extremists.
Abdallah Bou Habib, the Lebanese foreign minister, urged countries not to fall into an Israeli trap of extending the war to his country. “Have not we learned anything from our past mistakes; is it not high time we acknowledge that we cannot cancel each other out?”
The United Arab Emirates envoy, Lana Zaki Nusseibeh, said: “We will not support a return to the failed status quo. Before, the two-state solution was the end point to where we envisioned our diplomatic efforts would lead. Now it must be our starting point.”
Saudi Arabia’s foreign affairs minister, Waleed El-Khereiji, condemned Israel’s war machine .
The Iranian foreign minister, Hossein Amir Abdollahian, said: “Instead of calling on others to exercise restraint, the US must compel the Israeli regime to stop the war and pull itself out of the trap that the Israeli regime has set to drag the US into direct conflict.”
“Security cannot be achieved by resorting to the use of force and committing the crime of genocide in Gaza. The killing of civilians in Gaza and the West Bank cannot continue until the so-called total destruction of Hamas, because that time will never come.”
Gilad Erdan, the Israeli envoy to the UN, faced a walkout by some Arab ambassadors as he started by saying the world was trying to treat cancer with an aspirin, and said those advocating a ceasefire needed to realise it only meant the terror group Hamas would “remain in power, they would regroup and rearm, and soon Israel would face another attempted holocaust. Is this the outcome you would seek?”
He added: “This is not a war that Israel chose. But we will defend our future just as each of you would defend the future of your country.”
With the Iranian foreign minister attending the security council meeting, Erdan focused on the threat he said Iran posed, saying: “A spillover of the conflict is not happening magically. It was planned and instructed.”
Erdan said the recent US seizure of a boat heading to Yemen containing weapons “is clear proof who is masterminding this spillover. Iran always stands in the shadows and pulls the strings. Every country in the region has been affected by Iran’s tentacles of terror. It will stop at nothing to extend its Shiite hegemony.”"
HZCHJOV6FQ_C6MJLWMJ0238I1V,Man wanted in Brooklyn ‘bling bishop’ robbery killed by US marshals,Sam Levine,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/25/suspect-brooklyn-bling-bishop-robbery-killed,"Law enforcement officials shot and killed a man who was suspected in a 2022 robbery of nearly $1m in jewelry from a Brooklyn bishop that was captured on a live stream.
US marshals attempted to detain 41-year-old Shamar Leggette in a New Jersey hotel on Wednesday afternoon, according to NBC New York. Leggette was killed after shooting at the marshals, two senior law enforcement officials told the outlet. He was listed as one of New York state’s most wanted fugitives.
In July 2022, Lamor Miller-Whitehead, known as the “bling bishop”, was in the middle of a livestreamed sermon in Brooklyn for his Leaders of Tomorrow International Ministries, when three armed thieves walked in and demanded jewelry and other goods.
They reportedly made off with $1m in jewelry, including luxury watches.
Two men were charged in 2022 with the robbery. Leggette, the third suspect, had remained at large. On Wednesday, Miller-Whitehead said in an Instagram video that Leggette had put a gun in the face of his wife and eight-month-old daughter, according to the New York Post. Leggette had a history of robberies: he previously served nearly seven years in prison for robbery, attempted murder and weapons possession, according to the Post.
“So this is the guy that was at large, and he came and put the gun to my head and ripped my clergy collar off and ripped my chains off, and he was just brutal,” Miller-Whitehead said in the Instagram video.
Miller-Whitehead, who is a friend of the New York City mayor, Eric Adams, was himself arrested in December of 2022 for fraud, extortion and false statements. The indictment alleged that he took $90,000 in retirement savings from a parishioner, promised to help them buy a home and then spent the money on luxury items."
I219TAKB2G_KGFYUSIC0GSZDCC,New Zealand’s Red Sea deployment points to a selective concern over international law,_,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/27/new-zealands-red-sea-deployment-points-to-a-selective-concern-over-international-law,"The sudden announcement by the New Zealand government that it would send a six-member defence force team to the Middle East risks undermining New Zealand’s longstanding claim that it pursues a principled, independent foreign policy.
On 23 January, prime minister Christopher Luxon indicated that the small NZDF deployment was part of the US-led coalition effort to uphold maritime security in the Red Sea where Yemeni Houthi rebels, backed by Iran, have been attacking commercial and naval shipping perceived to be linked to Israel.
These attacks, according to the Houthis, are an expression of solidarity with the Palestinians in Gaza and will cease as soon as a permanent ceasefire is achieved in that territory.
The Red Sea is a vital route for global trade and the disruption caused by Houthi attacks has already increased the price of oil and fuelled fears of broader economic fallout for many countries, including New Zealand.
Luxon described the Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping as “illegal, unacceptable and profoundly destabilising” and said the NZDF deployment would contribute to the collective self-defence of ships as “a continuation of New Zealand’s long history of defending freedom of navigation both in the Middle East and closer to home.”
As a small global trader New Zealand is heavily reliant on a well-functioning rules-based international order upheld by institutions like the United Nations and norms such as multilateralism.
However New Zealand’s insistence that its increased support for maritime security in the Red Sea has no connection to Israel’s unrelenting military campaign in Gaza – after the appalling Hamas terror attacks in Israel on 7 October – is incredible.
The US knew from the outset that its unconditional support for the Netanyahu policy of “mighty vengeance” ran the very real risk of spreading conflict in the volatile Middle East region.
Nevertheless, the Biden administration has continued to provide military support to the Netanyahu government in its attempt to eradicate Hamas and used its veto in the UN security council to ensure the continuation of Israel’s massive military assault on Gaza.
This US stance has not changed despite the fact that more than 25,000 Palestinians – 70% of whom are reportedly women and children – have been killed in the course of Israeli military operations in Gaza.
In these desperate circumstances, it was always highly likely that a regional power like Iran and allies such as the Houthis and Hezbollah would seek to take advantage of the carnage in Gaza to advance their own agendas in the Middle East.
The Houthi attacks on shipping in the Red Sea are clearly illegal, but they are essentially part of the fallout from the continuing international failure to stop a conflict in Gaza in which it is alleged that war crimes have been committed.
Thus, the NZDF deployment could be interpreted as New Zealand shifting its weight behind the US blanket support for Israel and confusing the symptoms of escalation in the Red Sea with the major cause of the continuing conflict in Gaza.
At the same time, the US-requested NZDF deployment does not sit comfortably with Wellington’s diplomacy towards the Gaza conflict.
It should not be forgotten that New Zealand was the only member of the Five Eyes partnership to vote for an immediate humanitarian truce in Gaza at the UN general assembly on 27 October.
In addition, New Zealand co-sponsored a resolution in the UN general assembly on 13 December demanding an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.
Despite the disagreement between New Zealand and the US over the need for a ceasefire in Gaza, the Luxon-led government is now prepared to assist US-led efforts to suppress Houthi attacks in the Red Sea.
This is the same US that successfully opposed the Gaza ceasefire that New Zealand had supported.
Not only does the dispatch of the NZDF team to the Red Sea strengthen the impression of a diplomatic U-turn in Wellington, it also points to a selective concern about maintaining international law.
By agreeing to send an NZDF team to the Red Sea without demanding the US end its opposition to a ceasefire in Gaza, the New Zealand government seems to have retreated from an independent foreign policy based on principles and values.

I3CRZVKGXU_Z15NOUHW8WC73W4,Labour would let high-street opticians do glaucoma and cataract checks for NHS,Rowena Mason,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/jan/23/labour-would-let-high-street-opticians-do-glaucoma-and-cataract-checks-for-nhs,"Labour would let optometrists deal with some common eye problems such as cataracts and glaucoma in high-street opticians as it seeks to make the NHS in England more productive, a shadow health minister has said.Karin Smyth told the Institute for Government (IFG) the party’s plan would address the 620,000 patients currently waiting for NHS eye care, with 17,000 waiting more than a year. It has previously been revealed that hundreds of NHS patients lost their eyesight after delayed appointments.The party said it would seek to negotiate a national deal to deliver more routine outpatient care in high-street opticians, using existing funds. This would include cataract pre-assessments and operation follow-ups, glaucoma monitoring, and common diagnostic tests.Smyth said it would free up hospital specialists to treat more serious cases and provide better value for money.
Labour said the plan had support from expert ophthalmologists. Prof Ben Burton, the president of the Royal College of Ophthalmologists, said it was a “positive commitment to supporting eye care patients and we would offer our clinical expertise to shape this policy if delivered in government”.
Smyth was stepping in for Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, who is ill. He told the Sun newspaper on Monday night that the NHS needed reform more than it needed more money, which has provoked a backlash from the left.
In response to Streeting’s comments the independent MP and former shadow health secretary Diane Abbott said: “The population is ageing and growing. It is getting sicker too as the effects of austerity bite. There are also rising costs in the NHS especially with medical equipment and many drugs. Of course the NHS needs more money. Wes Streeting doesn’t know what he’s talking about.”Smyth told the IFG conference that about one in four missed outpatient appointments were due to administration issues, costing £300m a year. She highlighted that the NHS still spent £200m a year on paper and postage, a decade after Jeremy Hunt pledged the health service would go paperless.
She also pointed to the £1.7bn cost of hospital beds for patients who were well enough to leave, but could not because there was no care available in the community, £3.5bn paid to recruitment agencies because of staff shortages and £626m spent by the Department of Health and Social Care on management consultants.
John Glen, a Cabinet Office minister, also addressed the IFG conference on how to reform the civil service to improve productivity.
He indicated that civil servants taking jobs in data, digital and AI were set to get higher pay to help fill shortages, but that this would save money overall on consultants.
The minister said he would review the pay structure for these expert areas as he sought to transform efficiency in Whitehall.
Glen, who has been in the job for 10 weeks, also set out plans to review civil service staff groups known as “networks” to ensure their impartiality, having previously briefed the Telegraph that he was leading a crackdown on “activism” in Whitehall during working time.
He confirmed he wanted to make sure senior civil servants were in the office more than 60% of the time, which is the amount now mandated for all Whitehall workers.

His other ideas to increase efficiency included launching a performance management framework for civil servants to make it easier to get rid of underperforming employees or help them to improve.
Overall, Glen said he wanted to work towards a “smaller, more skilled civil service that is better rewarded”, with numbers cut by about 66,000 to bring last year’s high of about 457,000 back to 2019 levels."
I4QLZ3352R_H2Q0I2A6YL7TFV6,"US single people under 50 having less sex since Roe overturned, study finds",Carter Sherman,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/24/singles-sex-study-match-roe-v-wade,"More than one in 10 single people under 50 say they are having less sex because the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, according to a new study.
On Wednesday, Match Group, which operates Tinder, Hinge and a slew of other matchmaking platforms, released the latest findings from its long-running Singles in America survey, a snapshot of more than 5,000 single Americans’ thoughts and experiences around dating and sex. For the second year in a row, Match has found that the demolition of the national right to abortion is affecting how Americans say they date and have sex with one another.
Since Roe fell, more than 20 states have significantly restricted abortion access. Thirteen per cent of singles under 50 said that they are now more afraid of getting pregnant or getting someone else pregnant, including 21% of gen Z singles between the ages of 18 and 26. Twelve per cent of singles under 50 also said that Roe’s demise has made them more hesitant to date, while 11% said they have casual sex less frequently and the same number reported having less sex overall. Seven per cent said that they are more likely to have sex in ways that lower the risk of pregnancy, such as non-penetrative sex.
“It has become a litmus test for people that it’s too much trouble to date,” one survey respondent said of Roe. Another added: “I’m bisexual, so it makes me think I should strictly date women.”
One in 10 say that, when they do have sex, they are more nervous or anxious.
“Not only is it impacting behavior, it’s also impacting the meaning and the quality of the experience that people are having. It’s really remarkable that legislation is making people feel more nervous or worried or less comfortable with their sexual lives,” said Justin Garcia, the executive director of the Kinsey Institute and a scientific adviser to Match Group.
This kind of anxiety, Garcia said, threatens people’s ability to form partnerships: “You’re not gonna connect that well if you’re feeling anxious the whole time.”
These statistics provide a rare peek into the link between abortion access and people’s sex lives, as there is relatively little research into the connection. Although the Singles in America survey is not longitudinal – new people are surveyed with every iteration – worries about the end of federal abortion protections seem to be on the rise: last year, 78% of survey singles said that Roe’s fall had affected their sex and dating lives. This year, the number jumped to 87%.
Republicans are often vocal about their support for particular kinds of sex – specifically, the heterosexual, married and procreative kind – and have pushed policies to discourage sex among single people, including slashing access to abortion, particular types of birth control, and comprehensive sex ed in schools. The Match survey suggests their efforts might be succeeding.
At the National Pro-Life Summit, held over the weekend, Kevin Roberts, the head of the leading conservative thinktank the Heritage Foundation, urged attendees to build “a culture of life” through “the heroic spiritual adventure of falling in love, getting married and, yes, having lots of kids”. The room erupted in applause.
But Roe’s demise has contributed to more use of birth control, the Singles in America survey found. Thirteen per cent of singles under 50 said that they now use condoms more often. Meanwhile, 7% of women said that they got an IUD and 5% of men said they got a vasectomy in response to the ruling.
The survey arrives at a time when abortion is increasingly on the ballot. The vice-president, Kamala Harris, this week kicked off a tour to spotlight how a Republican administration may further devastate abortion rights, as Democrats believe that outrage over Roe may win them votes in the 2024 elections.

Seventy per cent of singles said that a candidate’s views on abortion will have some impact on their vote. Nearly a quarter said that abortion legislation will completely determine their vote, including 30% of Democrats and 20% of Republicans and libertarians. Women were more likely to say that abortion would determine their vote: 26% of women said so, compared to 18% of men.
“I’m furious and will only vote for Democrats for any elected office,” one respondent said.
Ultimately, many singles may not vote at all. Fourteen per cent said they do not plan to vote in the upcoming election, including 20% of gen Z singles, according to the survey.
There are more than 100 million single people in the United States. They’re an enormous and overlooked demographic, Garcia said.
“Relationships status can impact people’s views and their commitments to certain issues,” Garcia said. “It’s a group that someone can scoop up. Those aren’t negligible numbers in a tight election. That’s a very large group of singles that don’t feel engaged. What an opportunity for politicians to think about relationship status and singlehood and to engage those people.”"
I5OZ5OW8WW_9YCQS0VF1LTSQTZ,"Official advised Humza Yousaf on how to avoid wearing mask, UK Covid inquiry hears",Severin Carrell,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/23/scotland-first-minister-humza-yousef-was-told-how-to-avoid-having-to-wear-mask-covid-inquiry-told,"Humza Yousaf was allegedly advised on how to avoid wearing a face mask in public by one of Scotland’s most senior health officials at the height of the Covid crisis, a public inquiry has been told.
Private text messages show Jason Leitch, Scotland’s national clinical director, told Yousaf he had only to hold a glass in his hand to avoid having to use a mask while he was standing and talking to people at a dinner.
Leitch told Yousaf, then Scotland’s health secretary, that “officially” everyone had to wear a mask when they were standing and talking. “But literally no one does,” Leitch added.
“Have a drink in your hands at all times. Then you’re exempt. So if someone comes over to you and you stand, lift your drink.”
Jamie Dawson KC, the counsel to the UK Covid inquiry, challenged Leitch on that exchange and asked him whether he was offering Yousaf a “workaround” so he didn’t have to wear a mask.
Dawson added that this was what Yousaf “was trying to achieve”. It was “a workaround to try and enable [Yousaf] to attend the function, not wear a mask and get out of complying with the rules”, hesaid.
Leitch denied the allegation and downplayed its significance. “If this were a broader and very important piece of guidance I would not be comfortable with that at all. This was a tiny nuance inside broad guidance about dinners and drinking,” he told Dawson.
It was a “tricky area” that even he had found difficult to understand, Leitch said. The rules said diners were not required to wear a mask while eating and drinking but were not specific about what they should do if they stood up to talk to someone not at their table.
“I told him to have a drink in his hands. He wouldn’t be drinking it the whole time but having a drink in your hands meant you didn’t have to wear a mask,” he added.
Leitch said he himself had been caught out at a different dinner when he was photographed standing without his mask on.
“Strictly speaking, that was breaking the rules, but it was during a dinner and during a social occasion and therefore, I thought it was legitimate, and [Yousaf] is asking [about] precisely that scenario,” Leitch added.
Dawson said these messages were exchanged just as Covid cases had begun to surge in November 2021 due to the Delta variant, and shortly before Omicron caused infection rates to soar, to nearly eight times greater than during the first wave of the pandemic.
“If the cabinet secretary for health and social care didn’t understand the rules, what chance did anybody else have?” Dawson asked.
Leitch was also challenged by Dawson and Heather Hallett, the chair of the inquiry, over whether he had connived with recommendations by another senior civil servant that deleting WhatsApp messages meant they could avoid freedom of information laws.
He was shown messages he exchanged with Ken Thomson, then the Scottish government’s director general for strategy and external affairs, where Thomson said “just to remind you (seriously), this is discoverable under FoI. Know where the ‘clear chat’ button is …”. Leitch replied: “DG level input there” and then “done”.
Hallett said those messages “suggest a rather enthusiastic adoption” of the policy of deleting messages.
Leitch said his response was flippant, but “it certainly wasn’t my position. My position was that I was following the guidance and wasn’t particularly enthusiastic or otherwise about deletion”.
The inquiry also heard that Nicola Sturgeon, then Scotland’s first minister, used her personal SNP email address to conduct government business “privately” during the crisis.
Prof Devi Sridhar, a global health expert at Edinburgh University who advised Sturgeon during the pandemic, shared their direct messages on Twitter, now X, from June 2020 where Sturgeon gave Sridhar her SNP email address as well as her government one.
Sturgeon wrote: “Don’t worry about protocol – tackling the virus more important than that.”
Opposition party leaders said this corroborated their longstanding concerns that Sturgeon used SNP emails to evade scrutiny and freedom of information rules – a claim the former first minister has previously denied.
Craig Hoy, chair of the Scottish Conservatives, said it had already been confirmed Sturgeon deleted all her WhatsApp messages during the pandemic. Avoiding scrutiny in this way “was calculated, secretive and unacceptable”, he said."
I6A5K6OCQ4_M9NBE1Z8FGCA5HS,The Guardian view on Gazan genocide charges: Israel finds itself with a plausible case to answer,Editorial,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/26/the-guardian-view-on-gazan-genocide-charges-israel-finds-itself-with-a-plausible-case-to-answer,"It is a bitter twist of history that 75 years after the horrors of the Holocaust saw the UN adopt the genocide convention, Israel is likely to find itself in the dock of the international court of justice accused of being intent on destroying the Palestinians “in whole or in part”. Hundreds of people – mainly women and children – are dying every day under Israeli bombardment in the Gaza Strip, a death rate reckoned to be the worst of any major conflict this century.
South Africa filed an application instituting genocide proceedings against Israel at The Hague a month ago. On Friday, the world court said it had established that at least some of the acts alleged by South Africa fell within the provisions of the convention. While a final judgment is years away, this was a historic decision by the court. It was not made lightly by jurists in the middle of a war that was sparked by a horrific Hamas attack last October that left 1,200 Israelis dead.
Some may be disappointed that the court did not issue a provisional measure ordering a ceasefire in Gaza. That would be to miss the significance of The Hague’s judgment. The measures it did call for – including directing Israel not to commit or incite genocide – reveal that not only is protection for ordinary Palestinians urgent, but that there is a plausible claim of the Gazan population being decimated. Given the desperate humanitarian situation in the coastal strip, it is a very good thing that the court has reached its decision so quickly.
Israel is a signatory to the genocide convention, over which the ICJ has jurisdiction. It should comply with the court’s ruling immediately, and preserve evidence related to the case. The ICJ rightly did not spare Hamas, demanding that the hostages it holds must be freed. The militant group’s role in death and destruction should not be forgotten. While South Africa welcomed the measures describing the ruling as a “decisive victory for the international rule of law”, Israel’s national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, posted on X saying “Hague schmague”, and the defence minister, Yoav Gallant, said his country did “not need to be lectured on morality”. Such words will see Israel isolated in the world.
Domestic rather than international concerns shape the response of Benjamin Netanyahu’s extreme rightwing government. There is a depressing circularity to its refutation of the court. Since the judges at The Hague only ordered the prevention of genocidal acts, and as Israel denies any genocidal acts are being committed, Mr Netanyahu will probably try to use this rejectionist logic to take no meaningful action. But Israel’s friends and allies, especially those who see themselves as upholding the international legal order, do not have that option.
The court has few powers of enforcement. States that respect international law must ensure the ICJ’s measures are implemented – and report back with Israel’s compliance efforts within a month. Western nations – including the UK and the US – that belittled South Africa’s case ought to swallow their words. There have been efforts to broker a deal between Hamas and Israel to expedite aid deliveries into Gaza, halt the fighting and get hostages out. Governments need to urgently use their leverage to ensure that the ICJ’s order is enforced. The scale and severity of suffering in Gaza demands nothing less.
This article was amended on 27 January 2024. And earlier version referred to Israel as “a signatory to the Geneva conventions”; while that is the case, the intended reference was to the genocide convention. Also, the ICJ ordered the “prevention” of genocidal acts, not the “cessation” of such acts. This has been corrected.

I6VTZ76TVY_PEQBYW0BLU3IIMI,Which ‘crisis tribe’ do you belong to? These five factions will define Europe in 2024,Ivan Krastev,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/22/crisis-tribe-europe-2024-european-elections,"Will the far right be the big winner in this year’s European elections? If so, what would its victory mean for the future of the EU? And who is the far right? Five years ago, Europe’s leaders rightly recognised that Europeans were suffering a vertigo moment. In Milan Kundera’s words, vertigo is not the same as a fear of falling – rather, it is the desire to fall, against which, terrified, we defend ourselves. Then, voters toyed with far-right populists and contemplated collapsing the union, but eventually the majority chose to vote for mainstream parties.
This scenario seems unlikely to unfold this time around. Today, most far-right parties have abandoned demands that their countries leave the EU or the euro and have detoxified their brands. Rather than quitting the EU, they want to remake it and to govern it. After the recent elections in the Netherlands and Slovakia, and regional elections in Austria and in some regions of Germany, a consensus view is emerging that the coming European elections in June are a disaster in the making, and that migration is the only issue that will define the campaign and outcome. But could this picture be wrong?
It is true that Europe is in a crisis mood. But migration is just one of five crises that have shattered the continent in the past 15 years. It came on the heels of a global financial crisis that led Europeans to doubt their children would enjoy living standards better than their own, and alongside a climate crisis that forced them to imagine a world in peril. Meanwhile, Covid-19 exposed the vulnerability of our health systems and triggered fears of new digital authoritarianism. Finally, the war in Ukraine buried the illusion that a major war would never return to the European continent. These five crises have several things in common: they were felt across Europe; they were experienced as an existential threat by many Europeans; they dramatically affected government policies; and they are by no means over. But these five crises are not the same – they triggered different fears and sensibilities and they have simultaneously torn Europe apart but – paradoxically – also kept the EU together.
A new study we conducted helps us imagine Europe populated by five different “tribes” whose political identities have been formed as a response to those crises. These tribes create divisions between and within Europe’s member states.
The term “polycrisis” has emerged to suggest that many crises are taking place more or less concurrently, and that the shock of their cumulative interaction is more overwhelming than their sum. But an underreported feature of the polycrisis is that for different societies, social groups and generations, one crisis usually plays a dominant role above others. Emmanuel Macron captured this well when he contrasted those who worry about the end of the month (economic crisis) with those who worry about the end of the world (climate crisis). That is what we mean when we say that everyone wants a crisis of their own. The climate emergency, the war in Ukraine, Covid-19, immigration and global economic turmoil – each of these five issues has its own sizeable “constituency” of people for whom it is The Crisis.
Interestingly, Germany is the only country where immigration is clearly in the lead when people are asked which crisis bothers them most when they think about the future. Estonians and Poles are focused on the war in Ukraine. Italy and Portugal see the economic crisis as their biggest threat. Spain, Britain and Romania are the countries where Covid-19 is seen as the biggest trauma. And in France and Denmark the climate emergency is considered the most important crisis.
The current preoccupation with migration does not come from the fact that most people in most countries are obsessed with it, nor from the fact that it is the most divisive issue in societies.
In reality, we are witnessing the emergence of a kind of migration consensus all over Europe: support for strengthening external borders has become commonplace among political parties. But what singles out the “migration tribe” - those who define migration as The Crisis - is intensity. They are the angriest of all at EU policies and their anger pushes them to the right. Those who view migration as the biggest crisis will very likely vote for centre-right or far-right parties. In Germany this means a high chance of voting for the Alternative für Deutschland; in France, for Marine Le Pen’s Rassemblement National or Éric Zemmour’s Reconquête.
Climate is the other crisis that leads its tribe in a clear political direction. The climate tribe is the mirror image of the migration one, with its members often supporting green parties or centre-left parties. It is the clash between these two tribes that will define the upcoming European elections.
Interestingly, however, these two tribes have very different attitudes once their preferred parties are in power. When the migration tribe sees rightwing parties in power, its adherents tend to become more relaxed about the issue. In Italy, immigration ranks surprisingly low among the concerns of many voters: just 10% of the country’s population, and only 17% of Brothers of Italy supporters, describe it as their most transformative crisis, regardless of the fact that the Brothers of Italy party was elected on a strong anti-immigration platform, and that in the past year the flow of illegal immigrants has increased.

The climate tribe behaves in the inverse way. Our polling in Germany shows that people continue to worry about the climate crisis even when the Green party is part of the current government, which has a strong climate programme. Even though Germany succeeded in reducing carbon emissions last year by an impressive 20%, they do not consider the problem taken care of. In short, voters may perceive that electing a far-right government is the answer to immigration fears – even if little changes in reality – but they do not consider the climate emergency over after electing the Greens.
This asymmetry – that migration tribe is mobilised by rhetoric while the climate tribe suffers even when it delivers results – goes some way to explaining the real advantage of the right in the coming elections.
Each of Europe’s five crises will have many lives, but it is at the ballot box where they will live, die or be resurrected. What European leaders should realise is that the election will not just be a competition between left and right – or pro-Europeans and Eurosceptics – but also a battle for supremacy between the different crisis tribes of Europe. It is fragmentation, rather than polarisation, that shapes European politics. Many voters will focus on preventing the return of a crisis of their own. Focusing on migration alone would turn out to be the wrong policy.

Mia Janin, a year 10 pupil at the Jewish free school (JFS) in Kenton, north-west London, was found dead at her family home in Harrow on 12 March 2021.
Her father, Mariano Janin, has said he believes she was cyber-bullied by other pupils at JFS.
Mia’s friends said in statements made to police after her death, and read out at Barnet coroner’s court, that she was bullied by other pupils at the school and that their friendship group was nicknamed the “suicide squad” in the months leading up to her death.
One of Mia’s TikToks was shared to a Snapchat group chat run by male pupils at JFS, where they made fun of her, the statement said.
One child said the boys used the group chat to share nude photos of girls. “They took screenshots of girls’ faces on social media and made fun of them. They shared a video of Mia’s TikTok and made fun of her,” the child added.
The child said the boys also Photoshopped girls’ faces on to the bodies of pornography performers. “They used girls faces on porn stars’ bodies to upset us.”
The child also said they had a conversation with Mia the day before she died and that Mia asked: “If you died would people care about you the next day?”
“We laughed it off, that was all she said, it was just in normal conversation,” the child said.
Another child said the TikTok video had been posted by Mia the night before she returned to school after the end of Covid restrictions.
Police believe the TikTok was posted on 10 March, as she returned to school on 11 March.
The child said that Mia had received lots of negative comments on the video from other pupils at JFS. “Mia said she was fine, but I don’t think that she was fine,” she said.
Mia’s father told the inquest his daughter asked if she could move school after coming home on 11 March.
The inquest heard that his wife, Marisa, who has since died, told Mia she could be homeschooled for the rest of the school year, and that they would look into moving her to a new school after. Mia then went to bed. Hours later, she was dead.
Area coroner Tony Murphy said there was no evidence that any images or videos involving Mia had been shared in the group chat, except for the TikTok.
The inquest heard that Rabbi Howard Cohen, former deputy headteacher at JFS, told the boys to close down the group after Mia’s death. JFS’s position is that the school was not aware of the existence of the group chat before Mia’s death.

ICIQ7HC0OF_DECXK8PZ7CK394S,Joe Biden wins New Hampshire’s Democratic primary with write-in votes,Joan E Greve,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/23/democrat-candidates-biden-ballot-new-hampshire-primary,"Joe Biden has won New Hampshire’s Democratic presidential primary, even though the incumbent refused to campaign in the state and had to rely on a write-in campaign powered by his allies and surrogates to secure a victory.
Leading up to election day in New Hampshire, much more attention was paid to the Republican presidential primary, in which Donald Trump easily defeated Nikki Haley. But the results of the Democratic primary could provide additional clues about the general election in November.
In a statement celebrating his win, Biden expressed gratitude toward his many supporters who wrote in his name and underscored the crucial importance of the general election, as it looks increasingly likely that Trump will win his party’s nomination.
“It is now clear that Donald Trump will be the Republican nominee. And my message to the country is the stakes could not be higher,” Biden said. “I want to thank all those who wrote my name in this evening in New Hampshire. It was a historic demonstration of commitment to our democratic process. And I want to say to all those independents and Republicans who share our commitment to core values of our nation – our Democracy, our personal freedoms, an economy that gives everyone a fair shot – to join us as Americans.”
When the Associated Press called the race shortly after the last remaining polling places in New Hampshire closed at 8pm ET, it appeared that a clear majority of voters had cast ballots for write-in candidates. Most of those votes were expected to go to Biden, although some New Hampshire Democrats had planned to write in “ceasefire” to register their outrage over the war in Gaza and criticize US support for Israel’s military.
Biden’s two top rivals in New Hampshire, the Minnesota congressman Dean Phillips and the self-help author Marianne Williamson, trailed far behind. Responding to the New Hampshire results, the Biden campaign made clear that it was turning its attention to the general election in November.

Who’s running for president? The full list of candidates
“While we work toward November 2024, one thing is increasingly clear today: Donald Trump is headed straight into a general election matchup where he’ll face the only person to have ever beaten him at the ballot box: Joe Biden,” said Julie Chávez Rodriguez, Biden’s campaign manager.
The primary followed months of heated disagreement between New Hampshire Democrats and the national party over the primary calendar. The Democratic National Committee decided last year to make South Carolina the first voting state, a move that upended a century-old tradition of New Hampshire hosting the first primary.
Outraged over the voting calendar change, New Hampshire officials chose to hold an unsanctioned Democratic primary on Tuesday, although the DNC has said it will not award delegates based on the results. Biden’s name did not appear on the ballot, which included 21 names in total, but the president’s allies launched a vigorous write-in campaign in support of his re-election.
Phillips and Williamson had hoped to capitalize on Biden’s absence and pull off an upset in New Hampshire. The two candidates held events across the state to make their pitch that the Democratic party needs to move in a new direction, and Phillips continued to hammer that point as he addressed supporters in Manchester on Tuesday night.

“Joe Biden is a good man. He’s a fine man,” Phillips said. “But I’ve got to tell you, everyone, he cannot win. The polls are saying he cannot win; his approval numbers are saying he can’t win.”
Despite his disappointing performance, Phillips showed no indication of dropping out of the race on Tuesday. A member of Phillips’s team told the Guardian that about 12 campaign staffers will travel on Wednesday to South Carolina, which will hold its Democratic primary on 3 February.
Biden’s approval rating has indeed been underwater since 2021, and polls show the president running neck and neck with Trump in a potential general election. However, that electability message ultimately failed to sway most New Hampshire Democrats. Given the large number of write-in votes, it was taking more time for New Hampshire officials to process Democratic ballots, but the AP was still able to declare Biden as the winner just minutes after polls closed.
Biden’s clear win in New Hampshire may help allay concerns about the possibility of decreased enthusiasm among the Democratic base heading into the general election in November.
In an indication of Biden’s potential vulnerabilities, some of the president’s prominent allies, including Congressman Ro Khanna of California, spent time campaigning on his behalf in New Hampshire. Speaking at a house party in support of the write-in campaign on Saturday, Khanna framed Biden’s performance in New Hampshire as the first step toward a strong performance in the general election.
“That’s going to propel him to have a big win in November,” Khanna said. “At the end of the day, I am a believer that Americans love this country and love our democracy.”

ICMEGZ6Y6A_B5GWZERHJW78E2H,Reform UK leader accuses Tories of ‘stealing’ social housing policy,Ben Quinn,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/jan/25/reform-uk-leader-accuses-tories-of-stealing-social-housing-policy,"The leader of Reform UK has accused the Conservatives of trying to mimic his policies by planning a controversial “British homes for British workers” scheme, as the rightwing populist party edges higher in the polls.
Both parties will go into the next general election with the same promise to give British people priority access to social homes, it has emerged.
As Reform hit 13% for the first time in a national poll, its leader, Richard Tice, chided the Conservatives for trying to copy the rightwing party after the Guardian revealed the government is considering a plan to give UK citizens higher priority for social housing.
Officials will launch a consultation in the coming weeks into how they can give British citizens faster access to social housing, a move designed in part to bolster the prime minister’s reputation for being tough on immigration.
Reform UK said it was planning to campaign on a similar policy that would “prioritise local people”.
The policy will state that, in parts of the UK, almost half of all lead tenants in social housing were born overseas. It adds: “Those who have paid into the system for years must come first. Foreign nationals must go to the back of the queue. Not the front.”
Tice said: “The Tories are desperately trying to steal our clothes, whether we are wearing them or not.”
The Conservatives’ move has prompted anger from some in government, who warn it could further boost support for Reform. The latest government figures show that 90% of the lead tenants in social housing are British citizens. In certain areas, however, that figure is much lower.
Olivia Blake, a Labour MP and co-chair of the all-party parliamentary group on migration, described the government’s plans as “vile scapegoating of some of our most vulnerable communities in a desperate bid to hold on to power. The solution to the housing crisis is to build social housing.”
Helen Morgan, the Liberal Democrat housing spokesperson, said: “The Conservative party are stealing straight from the Nigel Farage playbook.
“This policy is not just totally unworkable and baseless, it risks playing into the hands of the far right and those who want to divide our communities.
“Instead of sowing the seeds of division to distract from their own failures, the government should be focusing on building the affordable and social homes the country needs.”
Rules around who can access social housing are already strict. According to guidance set out by Westminster, local authorities should give first priority to people who are homeless, moving from another social home, living in squalid or cramped conditions, or who have medical reasons to need one.
Foreign citizens are not allowed to apply for social housing unless they have been granted indefinite leave to remain, meaning they are permanently settled in the UK. Those seeking asylum are treated like any other foreign citizen: they only qualify if their refugee status is approved and they are granted settled status.

In the final years of Gordon Brown’s government, Labour added a new rule: if a council has to choose between two families of roughly equal need, it could take into account how long they have lived in the area and what local connections they have.
The scheme was billed by critics as “British homes for British workers”, though that was not a term Labour ministers used. Those who were in charge of implementing Brown’s policy said they maintained the guidance stipulating that need should trump local connections, and that they built significantly more social homes than the current government.
If the Tories did want to change the guidance, the simplest way would be to exclude those with refugee status, or even all those with indefinite leave to remain, from accessing social homes.
The prime minister’s spokesperson said he did not want to get drawn into “speculation”, but added: “It’s important that we have a policy that is fair for everyone. We want to build more homes and boost social housing supply and obviously we keep any policies under review.”
A YouGov poll on voting intention for the Times has put seven points between the Tories, on 20%, and Reform UK, on 13%.
Will Jennings, a professor of public policy at the University of Southampton, said it was not clear whether the polls were overstating the support for Reform UK but it was unquestionable that the party was a growing threat to the Conservatives.
“That’s why they [the Conservatives] are doubling down on issues like migration and small boats because that’s where they currently see a real existential threat to their vote,” he said."
IJM4M0SXQC_MWC208KGSIPVLEE,The Frogs review – Spymonkey’s search for ancient comedy and catharsis,Arifa Akbar,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/jan/25/the-frogs-review-royal-derngate-northampton,"This Aristophanes comedy is theatre’s oldest, we are told, but can it still be funny? That is one question – and there are so many others thrown into this picaresque journey into the underworld that you get lost in the darkness.
In ancient Athens, Dionysus (Toby Park) and the enslaved Xanthius (Aitor Basauri) venture into hades in search of the city’s great, recently departed tragedian Euripides. This version, by physical theatre company Spymonkey and Carl Grose, takes huge meta-theatrical detours to become a strange creation, as motley as the underworld monsters they meet on their way.
There are inquiries into the nature of comedy, a plotline involving a Hollywood producer, randomly attached scenes (including from A Streetcar Named Desire) and the story of the theatre company itself, which has come to be seen as the closest thing to Monty Python in the 21st century and which once comprised four core performers.
Now there are only two – Stephan Kreiss died in 2021 and Petra Massey departed for Las Vegas. Park and Basauri are explicitly in mourning. Their characters keep to the original mission to bring back Euripides but it diverts into a search for Kreiss.
Sadness leaks in, and a questioning of whether Spymonkey can continue to exist in this reduced, grieving form. There are songs about creative uncertainty and writer’s block, and it all begins to sound like emo angst. Tragedy and comedy can be twinned to powerful effect, but in this baggy jumble the former is heartfelt and the latter half-hearted. “We thought we could make this 3,000-year-old play funny but we can’t,” says Dionysus. It does makes you smile at least.
Jacoba Williams plays Heracles, as well as various others, and has a natural and magnetic comic confidence. Xanthius is more the fool than in Aristophanes’s original, with his donkey laugh and “arse” jokes. Figures in luminous cagoules and sandals (played by a community cast) form the frog chorus, and a revolving circular dais on Lucy Bradridge’s set provides physical comedy.
In The Frogs, Aristophanes warned against cleaving to the past. Spymonkey are clearly processing their own. They might be reduced, but hopefully they will come back stronger in time.

IOBB6JOZPL_6JNNG1ALZO26OEW,Households across Reading left without water for three days after burst mains,Helena Horton,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/23/households-across-reading-left-without-water-for-three-days-after-burst-mains,"Households across Reading, the UK’s biggest town, have been without water for three days after water mains burst in the cold weather.
An incident at the Pangbourne water treatment works meant that water pressure dropped across the town on Saturday. Thames Water, which has its headquarters in Reading, said that subsequent pipe bursts then made it impossible to increase water pressure to homes, meaning some people have been without water for days. Emergency bottled water stations have been set up in the affected areas. On Monday, some schools and offices were forced to close as the low water pressure meant it was unsafe to stay open.
Hundreds of homes in south London also reported having no water over the weekend after leaks across the network caused shortages. This is despite heavy rain falling over recent days.
Water companies are preparing to announce steep bill price rises for customers. Thames Water, according to reports, wants to raise bills by 20% in the coming years to pay for infrastructure improvements after public outcry over sewage spills and leaky pipes.
Water companies have failed to replace leaky pipes, which are many decades old. Analysis has shown that it would take English water companies 2,000 years to replace their pipes to get them up to standard at current rates. Analysis of Water UK data from 2021 by the Angling Trust found that on average, water companies replace 0.05% of their water and wastewater pipe networks a year. Most European countries replace their water and wastewater pipes at about 0.5% a year.
Alok Sharma, the MP for Reading West, apologised to his constituents and said he was in talks with senior managers of Thames Water. He said: “So sorry that constituents continue to experience problems with water supply. Have just spoken to a senior manager at Thames Water who says they are working hard to restore pressure.”
Jason Brock, the leader of Reading borough council and Reading Labour, said the communication with residents had been poor. He told Reading Today: “Their support to, and communication with, residents has been unacceptably poor. Residents understandably feel that Thames Water simply don’t care about them.”
Lib Dem environment spokesperson Tim Farron MP said: “This is a complete farce. Thames Water’s new CEO should write to every person affected with compensation and a grovelling apology. It begs the question just how bad a state is the infrastructure they get paid to maintain? It’s time they stopped spending millions of pounds on bonuses and dividends, and instead focused on the basics.”
A Thames Water spokesperson said: “We’re really sorry to customers in the Reading, Pangbourne, Tilehurst and nearby areas who continue to experience low water pressure.
“We have over nine tankers supplying water in the area to meet demand and improve water pressure. We also have over 50 engineers in the area fixing leaks and removing airlocks from our network. Teams are also repairing over 10 burst water mains, following the cold weather last week.
“We expect water pressure to improve in the coming days as we carry out repairs and as reservoir levels increase, following a technical issue at Pangbourne water treatment works, which was resolved on Saturday.”"
IP2PYU204L_V5P20Q4OHGJZHDD,Rwanda flights: Britain reminded of obligation to obey ECHR orders,Peter Walker,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/25/rwanda-flights-britain-reminded-of-obligation-to-obey-echr-orders,"The UK would break international law if it ignored emergency orders from the European court of human rights to stop asylum seekers being flown to Rwanda, the head of the court has said.
Síofra O’Leary, the ECHR president, told a press conference there was a “clear obligation” for member states to take account of rule 39 orders, interim injunctions issued by the Strasbourg-based court.
While the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has not definitively said he would ignore any such orders, he has held open the prospect, saying he has been “crystal clear repeatedly, that I won’t let a foreign court stop us from getting flights off”.
It was such an order from the ECHR – they are sometimes termed “pyjama injunctions” because they have been issued late at night – that helped stop initial plans for ministers to deport asylum seekers who arrive in the UK to Rwanda.
It comes as the government faced claims that homes in Rwanda that the former home secretary Suella Braverman had said would house asylum seekers have been sold or reserved for local people. Braverman toured the Bwiza Riverside estate in Rwanda’s capital, Kigali, last year with a select group of reporters from right-leaning newspapers.
An undercover reporter for OpenDemocracy, posing as an international investor, has been told by the property developer’s sales team that asylum seekers would not be housed in the development. A sales adviser reportedly told the undercover journalist: “The houses are for Rwandans and 50% is already sold. So if you say it’s for refugees, I don’t think so.”
The investigative website claimed two other members of staff from Century Real Estate, which is selling properties in the Bwiza estate, said the homes were not intended for refugees.
During her visit to Kigali, Braverman was filmed laying bricks at a development in Gahanga, on the outskirts of the city, which she described as a project “supported” by the UK for 528 homes for asylum seekers. OpenDemocracy said it had been told that construction was on hold.
A Rwandan government source said the OpenDemocracy story was “incorrect”.
“Bwiza Riverside estate is still one of the options under consideration,” they said. “It was never meant to be only for migrants, hence why some have already been sold. The idea is to integrate migrants into Rwandan communities, not create migrant ghettos.”
“Gahanga is also going to be used to house both migrants and Rwandans. The people spoken to for the story misspoke,” the source added.
The Home Office declined to comment.
O’Leary’s comments marked another setback for Sunak in his efforts to resurrect his immigration policy, one which is yet to see a single flight take off and which prompted a significant rebellion among Conservative MPs last week.
O’Leary said: “There is a clear legal obligation under the [European convention on human rights] for states to comply with rule 39 measures.” Such injunctions, she added, were only issued “in exceptional circumstances where there is a real and imminent risk of irreparable harm”.
She added: “Where states have in the past failed to comply with rule 39 indications, judges have found that the states have violated their obligations under article 34 of the convention.”

Article 34 establishes the right of people or groups to apply to the ECHR for redress if they believe their rights under the convention have been breached by domestic courts.
O’Leary noted the UK had “always complied with rule 39 measures”, and had, in 2021, urged Russia to abide by a ruling connected to the detained opposition leader Alexei Navalny, a noted opponent of the president, Vladimir Putin.
Sunak’s government is treading a legal tightrope in seeking to get deportation flights started as early as spring despite the ECHR’s doubts and a damning verdict in November by the UK’s supreme court, which ruled that the scheme could not go ahead.
Since the ruling, which was based on concern for the safety of those deported, Sunak has announced plans for an updated treaty with Rwanda that adds safeguards, and for the safety of Rwanda bill, which in effect seeks to set aside the supreme court decision.
Both of these plans have experienced trouble. On Monday, the House of Lords voted to delay ratification of the treaty so that more protections could be added. Peers will soon begin considering the Rwanda bill, and are expected to seek amendments.
The bill passed its third reading in the Commons last week with just 11 Conservative MPs opposing it, but only after more than 60 rebels attempted to secure amendments to toughen up the bill, including measures to completely set aside ECHR injunctions.
Sunak’s official spokesperson said it “would be bizarre” to make a comparison between the treatment of Navalny and the Rwanda deportations.
He said: “We are confident our legislation is compliant with our international obligations. We’re clear the bill and the treaty address the supreme court’s concerns. There should be no need for Strasbourg to intervene to block flights in the way they did in 2022.”
O’Leary declined to comment on the progress of the bill. She said: “I know there’s a very healthy debate in the United Kingdom relating to the content of the bill. It’s a country which is blessed with many, many international legal experts and a very active civil society. So I am sure that all of those issues can be fully examined.”"
IQ0LNZHP61_46MROZRB68Z1LSW,"Disinformation attacks targeted voters, media and LGBTQ+ groups, EU report finds",Lisa O'Carroll,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/23/disinformation-attacks-targeted-voters-media-and-lgbtq-groups-eu-report-finds,"Disinformation attacks in 2023 targeted European democracy but also media outlets and LGBTQ+ organisations, and involved the malicious manipulation of the images and voices of celebrities such as Margot Robbie and Nicolas Cage, an EU report has concluded.
The research, the EU’s second annual disinformation report, lifts the lid on digital weaponry deployed to undermine Ukraine, but also to spread fake news during elections in Poland and Spain.
It studied more than 750 disinformation attacks involving the strategic spread of false stories and harassment of legitimate sources to reduce trust in public institutions and sow hatred against nations and groups of people.
This new “warfare”, said the EU’s chief diplomat, Josep Borrell, “does not involve bombs that kill you” but words and ideas that “colonise you”.
Researchers found that Ukraine was the most frequently attacked but 149 entities including media organisations such as Euronews, Reuters, Deutsche Welle and the New York Times and LGBTQ+ organisations were also targeted.
Among the digital weapons used to attack media and civil society groups were “bullying, harassment or threats” the report said. “The goal is not only to shape the global narratives, but also to suppress and silence dissenting voices,” it added.
Launching the report, Borrell cited a highly publicised incident in Paris after Hamas’s 7 October attack on Israel – which began the current Gaza war – when more than 200 Stars of David were found daubed on dozens of buildings.
Borrell said tensions in the wake of the incident in Paris had been amplified by more than 1,000 Russian bots that made 2,500 posts on social media attempting to spark division. “The Russian perpetrators identified a faultline in European society and exploited it,” he said.
He added that the World Economic Forum had ranked disinformation and propaganda – called “foreign information manipulations and interference” (Fimi) in the report – as “the second biggest risk the world is going to face this year”.
The report also investigated the cases of 59 targeted individuals including the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, his wife, Olena Zelenska, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and Borrell.
Images and voices of celebrities including Elijah Wood, Cage, Robbie and the author Stephen King were also used maliciously to reach new audiences, the report said.
With about 2 billion voters in 83 elections around the globe going to the polls this year, the report homed in on two 2023 general elections, in Spain and Poland, to illustrate the tactics used by Russia and others.
The researcher said months before the summer election in Spain that ultimately saw Pedro Sánchez returned to power, an official account of the Kremlin on the Telegram messaging app suggested a long list of other Telegram accounts as sources of news and information. This was further promoted in official accounts with a network of fake accounts, building an organic and possibly unsuspecting audience.
With the ground laid, these channels were then put to use in the dissemination of fake news in Spain. Researchers describe a “swarming action”, a battlefield tactic, to saturate social media networks to undermine the credibility of the election with false information from the accounts that had been given a cloak of legitimacy on the Telegram promotion months earlier.
The Russian ecosystem was also then put to work to seed the idea that Spanish voters might not be safe, the researchers said.

Two days before the election, a warning of a possible attack by the former terrorist group Eta on election day was published on a cloned version of the Community of Madrid website. According to EU research, links were traced to private Russian Telegram users residing in Spain.
In Poland, the tightly fought election was also marred by disinformation, with Belarusian state-affiliated media creating Polish-language channels throughout the electoral period.
The fake information, including fake videos, was disseminated on X, formerly known as Twitter, with four accounts responsible for 70% of the amplification of the content.
Two days before the election there was also fake bomb news.
“Accounts belonging to the Russian Fimi infosphere presented the video in a reframed context, alleging that explosions had already occurred,” said the report.
In the 750 attacks investigated, 4,000 channels (websites and social media platforms) had been used, with election attacks prepared months in advance.
“Security is no longer a matter of weaponry, of army, it is a matter of information, how people get ideas and facts that will later determine how citizens will choose their governments,” said Borrell.
“Keep in mind that unchecked malicious content spreads like a cancer and puts the health of the democracy at risk, but we have the tools to fight against this.”"
IRXY0NHD4L_AQC7I11F9VH97MS,Magda Cross obituary,_,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/24/magda-cross-obituary,"My mother, Margaret Cross, known as Magda, who has died aged 99, was a committed teacher, peace campaigner and Quaker, who for decades devoted much of her energy to the pursuit of social justice and disarmament.
Magda trained as a primary school teacher at Whitelands College (now part of the University of Roehampton), taking up her first teaching post, at Tudor Road school in Southall, west London, in 1944. Wartime conditions meant balancing the lure of dances at the Hammersmith Palais against the need to honour the night-time fire-watch rota at the school.
Soon after celebrating VE Day, Magda and her friend Grace secured teaching jobs at Spryfield school in Halifax, Canada. At a local dance hall there she met my Canadian father, Donald Cross. They were married in 1950, both accepting appointments to teach English at secondary modern schools in the West Midlands; my mother at Prestwood Road school in Wolverhampton.
Magda’s political outlook began to move leftwards from her parents’ conservatism. As the abhorrent nature of Thatcherism became clear to her, my mother bristled at the thought that (as a greengrocer’s daughter herself) others might suggest an affinity between her and this other Margaret. In response, she adopted the moniker Magda thereafter. She had been born in Shropshire to Olive (nee Green) and Stephen Jones, who, as well as running their greengrocery business, instilled in their three children the importance of hard work and civic virtue.
In the early 80s, as Conservative funding cuts hit school budgets, Magda volunteered to take early retirement. Donald did likewise and, still in their 50s, they began decades of active non-working life. Committed Quakers, they became the first resident friends at the Charney Manor Quaker retreat in Oxfordshire, later moving to Dundee and then Brighton to remain close to my sister, Jenny, and her family.
As the cold war intensified, Magda grew frustrated at the unwillingness of politicians east and west to grasp the opportunities for de-escalation. She became a passionate advocate for citizen-based peace-making. Through the Mothers for Peace group (later Women to Women for Peace), Magda sought out direct contacts with like-minded individuals in other countries, becoming a fluent Russian speaker in the process.
Bypassing official state bodies, she joined numerous peace-making visits to both Russia and Ukraine, staying with ordinary families whom she would then invite to visit the UK. These endeavours later encompassed exchanges with peace-seeking activists in the US, Cuba, Israel, Palestine and elsewhere.
In her mid-70s, Magda began studying with the Open University, addressing the qualification gap that had capped her teaching career at deputy head at Montgomery school, Exeter. Her delight at graduating with a BA Honours in the social sciences was enhanced when, in 2017, her Whitelands certification was also upgraded to degree level by Roehampton University.
As her health declined, Magda continued her activism online, showing impressive IT skills for a ninetysomething. She displayed characteristic resilience when Donald died in 2005, and then Jenny in 2012.

IT6QTZK62D_N9PQJMB73FSB2XM,Trump seeks to disqualify Fani Willis from prosecuting him in Georgia,Hugo Lowell,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/25/trump-disqualify-fani-willis-georgia-election-case,"Donald Trump accused on Thursday the Fulton county district attorney of inflaming racial animus to distract from allegations relating to an an affair with one of her deputies, as he joined a motion seeking to disqualify her from prosecuting him for 2020 election interference in Georgia.
The filing, submitted to Fulton county superior judge Scott McAfee, adopted and added to an earlier motion to have the district attorney Fani Willis and her entire office thrown off bringing the case.
At issue is an explosive complaint from Trump’s co-defendant and former 2020 campaign election day operations chief Michael Roman, asking Willis to be relieved because her alleged relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade created a conflict of interest.
The filing itself included no concrete evidence that might give rise to a disqualification. But exhibits in related filings – notably Wade’s divorce proceeding – has shown that Wade paid for trips with Willis to California and Florida.
Willis has not formally responded to the complaint to date, though she addressed some of the claims in a speech delivered earlier this month at a historic Black church in Atlanta, suggesting the claims were in part racially motivated.
“How come, God, the same Black man I hired was acceptable when a Republican in another county hired him and paid him twice the rate?” Willis said in her remarks, in a thinly veiled effort to defend the hiring of Wade without specifically naming him.
In the new filing joining Roman’s motion, Trump’s lead lawyer Steve Sadow contended for the first time that Willis’s remarks, in addition to coming outside of proper court channels, were themselves improper.
“The DA’s provocative and inflammatory extrajudicial racial comments, made in a widely publicized speech at a historical Black church in Atlanta, and cloaked in repeated references to God, reinforce and amplify the ‘appearance of impropriety’ in her judgement and prosecutorial conduct,” Sadow wrote.
The district attorney’s office is expected to file a response before 2 February, ahead of an evidentiary hearing set for 15 February before McAfee in Atlanta.
The relationship between Willis and Wade threatens to undercut the Georgia election interference case against Trump and his allies because a finding of a conflict of interest could see the entire district attorney’s office disqualified from continuing with the prosecution.
The transactions from Wade’s credit card statements attached as an exhibit show that Wade paid for at least two trips during the criminal investigation into Trump that named Willis as a travel companion.

The first trip, dated 4 October 2022, involves a flight from Atlanta to Miami. Wade paid for a ticket for himself and for Willis. Separately, on the same date and without any names attached, the statement shows Wade’s credit card was used to make two purchases with Royal Caribbean Cruises, for $1,284 and $1,387.
The second trip, dated 25 April 2023, involved a flight from Atlanta to San Francisco. Wade again paid for a ticket for himself and for Willis. Separately, on 14 May 2023, Wade’s credit card was used to make two purchases of $612 and $228 at a Doubletree hotel in Napa Valley, California.
Roman’s motion claimed Willis personally profited from the contract. Wade was paid at least $653,000 and potentially as much as $1m for legal fees as one of the lead prosecutors on the Trump case, and the filing alleged Wade then paid for trips he took with Willis to Napa Valley and the Caribbean."
IVH57Z833M_NVJNVXLWKUJRNK7,Thousands across Austria take part in protests against far right,Kate Connolly,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/26/thousands-across-austria-to-take-part-in-protests-against-far-right,"Thousands of Austrians have taken to the streets of the country’s three largest cities, in a spillover of protests over the rise of the far right in neighbouring Germany.
Under the slogan “defend democracy”, gatherings organised by a broad alliance of civil society organisations, NGOs, political groups, church communities and trade unions took place in Innsbruck, Salzburg, and in front of the parliament building in Vienna.
The demonstrations follow days of protests in villages, towns and cities across Germany, where more than a million people from a broad cross-section of society turned out over the past two weeks despite the cold weather and a rail strike. They have been demonstrating against the rise of the far right, in particular the populist Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party after its members met the far-right Austrian Martin Sellner to discuss the mass deportation of foreigners and German citizens of foreign origin.
On Thursday, about 500 protesters gathered in Vienna’s city centre at the headquarters of one of Austria’s oldest postwar far-right organisations, Landsmannschaft, which hosted an event with Maximilian Krah, the AfD’s leading candidate for the European elections, and the far-right German publicist Götz Kubitschek, who is a close confidant of Sellner’s.
German authorities are considering whether they can issue a ban to prevent Sellner from entering the country.
The focus of the protests on Friday was on the rise in rightwing extremism, antisemitism and racism. Organisers hoped to form a human chain around the parliament building. Representatives of the Catholic, Protestant, Jewish and Muslim communities as well as figures from the cultural world were set to attend.
The Austrian Nobel prize-winning author Elfriede Jelinek was expected to be present in Vienna and wrote a message that the German-Austrian actor Mavie Hörbiger was to read to the demonstrators. Politicians were to attend but not speak from the stage.
The demonstrations in Germany and Austria were sparked after revelations came to light this month of a secret lakeside meeting outside Berlin in November where the participants, including elected AfD members of parliament and their aides, neo-Nazis, businesses known to support the far right and members of the arch conservative wing of the CDU/CSU parties, met Sellner.
Central to the meeting were discussions around a “masterplan” for a mass deportation, including the practicalities of putting such a plan into action were the AfD to come to power.
Sellner, who has close connections to the German far right, making frequent visits to Germany – most recently to participate in farmer-led protests against the government – has confirmed his participation at the lakeside event. He has made no secret of his plans to push what he calls a re-migration agenda, and his hope for its acceptance across Europe.

It and similar policies have been discussed by and in circles around Austria’s far-right Freedom party (FPÖ) for years. The AfD, which came into being in 2013, quickly morphing into an anti-immigrant party, has modelled itself on the FPÖ – founded in 1956 – among others.
Sellner and Krah are regular guests at Kubitschek’s Institute for State Policy thinktank in Schnellroda, Saxony-Anhalt, which is under observation by German authorities on suspicion of far-right extremism. Kubitschek is viewed as a figurehead of the so-called Neuen Rechten or New Right in Germany, advising far-right groups, and is seen as a political mentor to the identitarian movement.
Protests in Germany were also expected to continue on Friday night and over the weekend."
IZUJBEEJY3_V83BL83RO422RYE,Tutu skirt takes centre stage in Paris as Chanel channels ballet trend,Jess Cartner-Morley,_,20230123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2024/jan/23/tutu-skirt-takes-centre-stage-in-paris-as-chanel-channels-ballet-trend,"Paris fashion has spoken: get ready for the year of the tutu skirt.
Chanel has thrown its might behind 2024’s first breakout look, with tulle dancers’ skirts the stars of the haute couture catwalk. Days after the tutu worn by Sarah Jessica Parker in the title sequence of Sex and the City sold for $52,000 (£41,000) in Los Angeles – outstripping the estimate of $8,000-$12,000 expected by auction house Julien’s – Chanel has confirmed ballet as fashion’s new obsession.
It takes a lot to upstage the revered Chanel tweed jacket, but tutu skirts – some just a wisp of translucent white, some with enough frothy pink lace to fill a bubble bath, others dotted with tiny silk bows – were centre stage at the Chanel show.
Margaret Qualley, who trained as a ballerina before becoming an actor, led a line of models who wore white ballet tights, leotards and dancing-school sandals under featherweight couture embroidery, and wore their hair tied with satin ribbons.
The revival of the ballet flat has opened the door to a wider “balletcore” trend. Rudolf Nureyev was the muse for last week’s Dior menswear show in Paris, by British designer Kim Jones. This year marks the centenary of Gabrielle Chanel’s first ballet costumes, which she designed for Le Train Bleu, performed by Sergei Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes in 1924.
Chanel’s unassuming designer Virginie Viard did not embrace the look herself, taking her bow wearing a simple black sweater and trousers, but said that she wanted “to bring together the power and finesse of bodies and clothes” that ballet represents. Backstage after the show, she added that she wanted “lots of tulle, and legs, and lightness and summer”.
Julie Gayet was guest of honour at the Chanel show, which opened with a short film featuring Qualley as a young woman who travels to Paris on a quest to replace a lost button on her grandmother’s Chanel jacket. The film features a cameo from Naomi Campbell, and is soundtracked with a new song by Kendrick Lamar.
Chanel flexed its muscles in the US last year with a Met Gala celebrating former designer Karl Lagerfeld in New York, a catwalk show at Paramount studios in LA, and a high profile in Hollywood thanks to house ambassador Margot Robbie, who wore Chanel for much of her on-screen role as Barbie, and for the publicity tour.
This year, Chanel is focusing on Europe, with the next destination show, on 2 May, to be held in Marseille, which has been chosen to “make a stopover in a city open to all cultures”, and celebrate “the energy and cultural vitality of one of the most effervescent cities in the Mediterranean”, the house said in a statement.
Chanel has previously held shows in the southern French beauty spots of Monaco and in Provence, but Marseille, with its multicultural population and historic links to north Africa, represents a grittier and less traditionally glamorous setting, echoing the choice of Manchester for Chanel’s Métiers d’Art show in December."

Another statue, of Queen Victoria near the Melbourne city centre, was doused in red paint.
Police said members of the public reported that the Captain Cook memorial near Jacka Boulevard had been vandalised about 3.30am on Thursday morning.

Officers said they understood the statue had been sawn off at the ankles. The plinth had been spray-painted with the slogan: “The colony will fall.”
Several people were seen loitering in the area around the time, police said.
According to the Captain Cook Society, the monument to the British explorer was likely to have been the first major memorial to him in Victoria when it was unveiled in December 1914. Its engraving commemorates the date of the Endeavour’s departure from Plymouth in 1768 on Cook’s first voyage that included charting the east coast of Australia. The statue itself is a replica of one in England.
Cook did not visit Port Phillip.
Meanwhile, a memorial to Queen Victoria standing in the Queen Victoria Gardens near the city centre was also found vandalised early on Thursday. It was sprayed with red paint and reportedly graffitied with the same message “the colony will fall”.
The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, on Thursday condemned the vandalism of the Cook statue.
Speaking to reporters, Allan said “this sort of vandalism has no place in our society”.
“We will be working with the council to repair and reinstate the statue in St Kilda that has been vandalised overnight,” she said.
The opposition leader, John Pesutto, said the incident was “totally unacceptable”.
“There’s no place for acts of vandalism or any other violent acts against people or property in our community,” he said.

“We support the right of people to protest and demonstrate but it must always be done in a peaceful and respectful way.”
The Port Phillip council mayor, Heather Cunsolo, said she was “disappointed by the vandalism” of the statue, adding that the council had supported a dawn “mourning reflection ceremony” held by traditional owners promoting unity and reconciliation on Friday.
“We understand and acknowledge the complex and diverse views surrounding Australia Day,” she said. “We can’t condone, however, the vandalism of a public asset where costs will be ultimately borne by ratepayers.”
Council officers had taken the statue away for “assessment” and the graffiti was being removed, she said. Damage to the plinth stonework would also be repaired.
The memorial has a history of being vandalised, especially in the lead-up to 26 January.
In 2018 the statue had pink paint dumped on it, with the words “no pride” painted beneath the feet, along with the Aboriginal flag.
The council had arranged for a security guard for the statue from later on Thursday, given the prior history, however the latest attack came before they were scheduled to arrive."
J26PXGA57T_VG8JLQWAU28ROAQ,South African charged with 76 murders after shock arson confession,_,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/25/south-african-charged-with-76-murders-after-shock-arson-confession,"A man who confessed to starting a deadly fire at an apartment building in one of South Africa’s worst disasters has been charged with 76 counts of murder and 86 counts of attempted murder.
The suspect was also charged with arson and was ordered to be kept in police custody until a bail hearing next month. He faces a possible sentence of life in prison. South Africa has no death penalty.
Prosecutors said the suspect, Sithembiso Lawrence Mdlalose, made a written confession.
Mdlalose was arrested on Tuesday after making a startling claim at an inquiry that he was responsible for the fire at a central Johannesburg apartment building last August that killed 76 people and injured dozens of others.
He said at the inquiry that he set the fire while trying to hide the body of a man he had killed in the basement of the building. He said he had strangled the man and then poured gasoline over his body and set it alight.
The fire ripped through the five-story building in the early hours of 31 August 2023.
Prosecutors said Mdlalose’s apparent confession at the inquiry could not be used in his trial because the ongoing inquiry is not a criminal proceeding. They said he had since made a written confession in front of a judge."
J4A75T928B_M6VREQYDWDSLNUJ,Liz Cheney: potential Trump running mate Elise Stefanik is ‘a total crackpot’,Martin Pengelly,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/23/liz-cheney-calls-trump-possible-vp-elise-stefanik-crackpot,"Elise Stefanik of New York, a top House Republican and a leading contender to be Donald Trump’s presidential running mate, is “a total crackpot”, the former Republican congresswoman Liz Cheney said.
Cheney threw the barb on Tuesday, in response to a statement in which Stefanik called the House January 6 committee on which Cheney was vice-chair “illegitimate and unconstitutional” and claimed it “illegally deleted records”.
Cheney said: “This is what Elise Stefanik⁩ said, in a rare moment of honesty, about the … attack on our Capitol.”
Cheney posted Stefanik’s statement from 6 January 2021, the day Trump supporters stormed Congress after he told them to “fight like hell” to overturn his defeat by Joe Biden, a riot now linked to nine deaths.
Cheney added: “One day she will have to explain how and why she morphed into a total crackpot. History, and our children, deserve to know.”
In her original January 6 statement, Stefanik lamented “truly a tragic day for America” and “condemn[ed] the dangerous violence and destruction that occurred today”. The perpetrators, she said, “must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law”.
Stefanik also “prayed” that “colleagues on both sides of the aisle, their staffs, and all Americans … remain safe”, and thanked police, the national guard and Capitol staffers for “protecting the People’s House and the American people”.

Trump was impeached for inciting the riot, with the support of 10 House Republicans, but acquitted at trial in the Senate when only seven Republicans voted to convict. He currently faces 91 criminal charges – 17 for election subversion – as well as civil suits and attempts to keep him off the ballot for inciting an insurrection. Regardless, he dominates presidential primary polling.
Stefanik is chair of the House Republican conference, the fourth-ranking Republican position.
Earlier this month, she declined to commit to certifying the 2024 election and told NBC she had “concerns about the treatment of January 6 hostages”, referring to the more than 1,200 people arrested over the riot, of whom hundreds have been convicted.
Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat who sat with Cheney on the House January 6 committee, put the “hostages” remark down to Stefanik’s ambition.
“Does she no longer believe violence is ‘unacceptable’ and ‘must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law’?” Raskin asked. “Does her change of heart have anything to do with wanting to be Trump’s running mate?”
Cheney – Stefanik’s predecessor as conference chair – was one of two Republicans who defied party leaders to join the January 6 committee. The other, Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, retired. Cheney lost her position and then her Wyoming seat to a Trump-backed rival.
Notwithstanding her status as the daughter of the former vice-president Dick Cheney, membership of the Republican establishment and strongly conservative views, she has not come back to the fold.
On Wednesday, responding to Cheney’s “crackpot” remark, a spokesperson for Stefanik said: “Liz Cheney’s only remaining relevance is that she will soon have to answer for her role in deleting and hiding evidence from the investigation into the sham January 6 select committee.”
Cheney has responded to Republican claims that the January 6 committee destroyed evidence.
Earlier this month, in response to a complaint from Trump, she wrote: “You and your lawyers have had the [January 6] committee materials … plus the grand jury info and much more for months. Lying about the evidence in all caps won’t change the facts. A public trial will show it all.”"
J7RV9CDXW4_HGBH0SR6RBWS7T7,‘This is a pandemic’: Ethiopia’s Oromia region gripped by surge in kidnappings,Fred Harter,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/jan/23/im-scared-to-leave-addis-ababa-ethiopias-oromia-region-gripped-by-kidnapping-pandemic,"The gunmen came for Alemetu when she was sleeping. They marched her out of her home in Ethiopia’s Oromia region and took her to a disused school in the countryside, where she was held hostage for four weeks.
About 40 fighters were living at the school, although hundreds of men passed through. Alemetu, who was pregnant when she was taken, said her captors beat her with a horsewhip. On one occasion, she was tied up and suspended upside down from a tree for several hours, an ordeal that left deep psychological and physical scars.
She was released only after her family paid a ransom of 110,000 birr (£1,530), a huge sum in rural Ethiopia, which they raised by selling livestock and borrowing from friends.
When Alemetu was kidnapped, the family was already struggling to pay a 90,000 birr ransom for her uncle, a farmer, who was held for 15 days in a separate abduction. The family is now destitute.
“It is very rare to find a family in our area who has not been affected by kidnapping,” says Alemetu. “The government has no control.”
Alemetu identified her kidnappers as insurgents from the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA), a rebel group that has been fighting Ethiopia’s government since 2018. The OLA styles itself as the champion of the Oromo, Ethiopia’s largest ethnic group, who claim a long history of marginalisation, but it has been accused of massacres and other abuses.
Ethiopia’s federal parliament classifies the OLA as a terrorist organisation.
After Alemetu was released, the fighters burned down her home. She believes she was targeted because her husband took a job at a local government office. “Even if you just pay taxes, the fighters will attack you,” she says.
Kidnapping has been a persistent threat for years in Oromia, a region that runs through the heart of Ethiopia and surrounds the capital, Addis Ababa. Until recently kidnappings were rare outside OLA’s strongholds in western Oromia. When they did occur, they were targeted. The main victims were like Alemetu: police officers, government officials or their relatives, and the aims were generally political rather than financial.
Now, kidnapping for ransom has become commonplace. Abductions take place not far from Addis Ababa, as the OLA’s insurgency spreads to new areas, and target anyone.
On 28 December, gunmen killed eight people and abducted 10 others near the town of Metehara, 100km (60 miles) east of Addis Ababa, as they returned from a religious festival. In October, agricultural researchers were abducted while doing field work near the town of Alem Tena, 60km south of the capital. In July, 63 bus passengers were taken by militants 100km from Addis Ababa.
Foreign-owned companies are also targets: in October, several Chinese citizens working for a cement factory were abducted in Oromia’s North Shewa area, while in January last year gunmen kidnapped 20 workers at another cement factory owned by Nigerian billionaire Aliko Dangote.
The road linking Addis Ababa to Djibouti’s port, Ethiopia’s main trade artery, has become a kidnapping hotspot in the past 18 months.
The manager of a foreign-owned farm in Oromia, who declined to be named, said the surge in kidnappings was putting off international investors. Local business people who had recently sold their crops and were known to have significant amounts of cash in their bank accounts were initially targeted, he says.
“But it has escalated into something much more widespread, affecting a much wider range of individuals, to the point where all our senior staff are targets,” the farm manager says. “We can’t get any of them to our site, it’s too risky.”
He claimed several foreign companies had paid ransoms to free staff.
The British embassy advises UK nationals to “avoid regular patterns of travel or movement” in large parts of Oromia because of the risk of kidnapping, warning that “people engaged in humanitarian aid work, journalism or business sectors are viewed as legitimate targets”.
In November, the Ethiopian Human Rights Council said “abductees often endure torture, cruel treatment, and detainment under inhumane conditions, constituting severe crimes against human dignity”.
Ethiopia’s prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, rode a wave of anti-authoritarianism protests to power in 2018. He promised a new era of openness and democracy, but his administration has overseen a proliferation of regional conflicts, including the devastating war in Tigray that left hundreds of thousands dead.

The most recent rebellion erupted in Amhara, Ethiopia’s second-largest region, in August, over a plan to disband regional armed forces. As well as hitting the economy, these conflicts have fed into a growing feeling of lawlessness across the country.
“I’m too scared to leave Addis Ababa,” says a lecturer at the city’s university, whose cousin and brother-in-law were recently kidnapped for ransom in separate incidents in Oromia. “I have inherited some land in the countryside, but I have not gone there because you don’t know if anyone will kidnap you. I don’t visit my parents. I don’t even go there for weddings and funerals.”
The Guardian interviewed four people who recently paid ransoms to free relatives. All declined to be named for fear of retaliation by the kidnappers. This fear means most abductions go unreported, but civil society activists believe thousands of people have been kidnapped in recent years.
The interviewees paid ransoms of between 20,000 birr (£280) to 500,000 birr (£7,000) to free their relatives and often managed to negotiate the price. “They ask according to your wealth,” says one man. He paid 125,000 birr to free his father, who was abducted from his home in North Shewa.
Another man says abductors demanded “a staggering 2 million birr” (£28,000) after kidnapping his brother and other passengers from a bus travelling through Oromia’s West Shewa in June. After lengthy negotiations, the family paid 100,000 birr.
“This is a pandemic,” says the man. “Kidnapping is happening everywhere. The rebels have made it a way of life because it’s easy money for them.”
The OLA rebels deny using kidnapping to fund for their insurgency, but the group is loosely organised and local units often act independently of their commanders.
Jonah Wedekind, an independent researcher, said there are strong indications that some OLA factions have turned to kidnapping as a way of raising cash, but bandits motivated simply by financial gain may also be engaging in the practice.
“Some armed actors perceive the OLA to be efficiently raising capital through these attacks and might be copying them,” says Wedekind. “And this is part of the wider problem: the conflict reflects the economy breaking down, and people don’t have jobs, so this is what they turn to.”
Peace talks between the OLA and the government failed in November. A spike in rebel attacks across Oromia followed.
The government’s response to the insurgency has been ham-fisted, characterised by arbitrary arrests and unlawful killings, according to the state-appointed human rights commission.
Alemetu did not go to the police after she was released, fearful they would accuse her of funding terrorists because her family paid a ransom. Instead, she simply packed up her remaining belongings and left her village. “I am afraid of both sides,” she says."
JCS42HZ2A2_I1C4OPII80L9YL9,"Missing Persons, Or My Grandmother’s Secrets review – a voyage into Ireland’s dark heart",John Banville,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/jan/23/missing-persons-or-my-grandmothers-secrets-clair-wills-review-a-voyage-into-irelands-dark-heart,"Missing Persons must have been a very difficult book to write, for certainly it is difficult to read. This is not due to any defects of style or execution – it is an expertly crafted work, at once vigorous and subtle, which manages its effects and conserves its revelations with all the skill of a master novelist. The difficulty for the reader is in struggling to absorb the pain and pity of the story, or stories, which it relates.
All families nurse guilty secrets, secret sorrows, as Clair Wills more than once acknowledges. Most of us are content to leave such matters undisturbed; not so Wills, who, with fortitude and much honest misgiving, puts on private trial a family, a generation and, indeed, an entire people and finds them guilty. She refrains, however, from condemnation. That is not her purpose.
Wills, a professor of English literature at Cambridge, has written numerous highly regarded books on Irish history and society. Although she grew up in London, her family on her mother’s side had its roots deep in Ireland, in an area of West Cork north of the town of Ballydehob. There, on a small, isolated farm, her grandmother lived into old age after her husband’s early death, watching her children emigrate, not to America, as most Irish people did in previous centuries, but to England, where they found jobs “nursing in psychiatric hospitals, labouring on farms, and building the motorways and power stations of England’s postwar boom”.
Each summer throughout their childhoods, Wills and her three sisters were taken for a holiday on their granny’s farm. The accommodation was basic: there were only two bedrooms, the one where the old woman and the girls slept together, and the “good” one that was reserved for the parents. “By the early 1970s the small-farm economy had decisively failed, but my grandmother … had no option but to keep living inside a world that had no future. Their lives outlasted their livelihoods.” All the same, magic attached to the place, in the eyes of the young.
Behind the idyll, however, a darker reality was hidden away in orphanages, in mother-and-baby homes, in so-called “industrial schools”, and in the infamous Magdalene Laundries. These institutions were funded, grudgingly, by the state and run, harshly, by the religious orders. The statistics are well known but still they shock. As Wills reminds us, between Irish independence and 1998, the mother-and-baby homes held, at the lowest estimate, “56,000 unmarried mothers, ranging from 12-year-old girls to women in their forties, and at least 57,000 babies and small children”.
In 2014 at one of these institutions, in Tuam, County Galway, run by the Bon Secours nuns, the remains of nearly 800 babies and young children were recovered from a disused septic tank, following research by a tireless and courageous local historian, Catherine Corless. Many of the children had died of malnutrition. A government commission set up to investigate the deaths concluded that the homes “did not save the lives of ‘illegitimate’ children; in fact, they appear to have significantly reduced the prospects of survival”.
Wills gives life, if that is what to call it, to these horrendous statistics. At some point, she cannot remember precisely when, she discovered that her mother’s brother Jackie, who was living on the farm with his mother, had impregnated a young neighbour by the name of Lily. Lily’s family was even less well off than Jackie’s; also, she had a “withered arm” and was therefore “poor stock”, so that marriage was out of the question.
Wills learned that Lily had her baby, named Mary, that Mary was consigned to an orphanage and later an industrial school, that when she grew up “she went to England to train as a nurse, that she became pregnant by an Indian doctor, that she went to India to meet the family and was rejected by them, and that she killed herself in 1980”. As Philip Larkin has it in This Be the Verse, “Man hands on misery to man. / It deepens like a coastal shelf.”
As Wills dug deeper into her family’s history, she made other, startling discoveries – Jackie’s betrayal of Lily was not by any means the only secret her grandmother guarded to the grave.
The great famine of the 1840s– in which a million people died and a million emigrated – effectively destroyed the old, half-pagan Ireland celebrated by Yeats and Synge and Lady Gregory. With so much of the peasantry wiped out, the petit bourgeoisie came to full power, and with it rose the “modern” Irish Catholic church. As Wills writes: “The rosary, novenas, devotion to the sacred heart and the immaculate conception, candles, vestments, incense, beads, scapulars, medals, missals: all the paraphernalia that we associate with old-timey Catholicism was introduced in the 1860s and 1870s, as a way of capturing the imagination of the people – and policing their behaviour.”
This was not the church of Jesus but of St Paul: severe, male-dominated, pleasure-hating, and terrified by what it saw as the sinful power of the female, which must be suppressed or at least strictly controlled. In the new, “respectable” Ireland of the shopkeepers, the farmers and the priests, sex outside marriage was, as Wills writes, “codified as a sin, for which women must atone in a penitentiary regime”.
In the “new” Ireland, families became “practised at not seeing what they could see, and not knowing what they knew”. A Faustian pact was sealed between family, church and state, and the cult of secrecy was “bureaucratised”. And as under all totalitarian regimes, people – women and babies – went missing, by the tens, perhaps the hundreds, of thousands. This was a collective crime for which Ireland has still not been brought to full public trial. Should it ever be, Wills will make a powerful witness for the prosecution.

JG4R491C4G_BFTT3E0GPLLZYHU,Hundreds outside ICJ give Israel ruling a measured welcome,Pjotr Sauer,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2024/jan/26/hundreds-outside-icj-give-israel-ruling-a-measured-welcome,"Under a large video screen opposite the international court of justice in The Hague, hundreds of Palestinian supporters had gathered in anticipation of the court’s interim ruling on South Africa’s accusation that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza.
Loud cheers soon erupted in the crowd when the court ruled that Israel must “take all measures within its power” to prevent all acts within the scope of the 1948 genocide convention.
Lighting red-and-green smoke flares and chanting slogans, the demonstrators, which included climate activist Greta Thunberg, also applauded when the ICJ ruled that Israel must ensure the provision of humanitarian aid to Gaza, preserve evidence related to allegations of genocide and submit a report in a month’s time on its compliance with these measures.
“It is very important that the ICJ did not throw out the genocide case at Israel’s request … We can only hope now that humanitarian aid is allowed into Gaza,” said Joris Doting, holding a large banner that read “Stop Genocide in Gaza”.
But, ultimately, many pro-Palestinian supporters were left feeling frustrated after the top UN court stopped short of ordering a ceasefire in Gaza.
“I am very disappointed. This is simply not enough,” said Raya, a German-Palestinian citizen who travelled from Germany to witness the hearing.
“My friends and family are dying in Gaza and this ruling will not stop Israel from bombing us,” Raya added, before joining a “ceasefire now” chant.
The Palestinian death toll in Israel’s assault on Gaza has surpassed 25,000, according to the ministry of health in the territory.
Still, some lauded what they described as a “historic” court decision.
“Today’s ruling is a clear signal to Israel that they need to follow international laws. Israel has been ordered to prevent acts of genocide,” said the pro-Palestinian protester Carolien Nieweboer.
“Of course, we hoped for a ceasefire, but our expectations weren’t very high,” she added. The Palestinian foreign ministry similarly welcomed orders by the ICJ and called it an “important reminder that no state is above the law”.
The South African foreign minister, Naledi Pandor, who flew to The Hague for the ruling, told journalists outside the court that she would have wanted the word cessation to be included in the judgment.
“But I’m satisfied with the directions that have been given,” Pandor said.
Separated by Dutch riot police, pro-Israel supporters were watching the court proceeding on a different screen 300 metres away.
Many were carrying Dutch and Israeli flags as well as pictures of people taken hostage by Hamas during the 7 October attack in Israel.
“I am against a ceasefire as long as the hostages, which include children, remain abducted in Gaza,” said Miri, a Dutch-Israeli teacher.
“We did not start this war. It started on 7 October,” she added.
While the closely watched case will add pressure on Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, over its war against Hamas, the Israeli leader was quick on Friday to stress that his country would “continue this war until absolute victory, until all hostages are returned and Gaza is no longer a threat to Israel”.
“Like every country, Israel has a basic right to defend itself … The ICJ in The Hague justly rejected the outrageous demand to deprive us of this right,” Netanyahu said, appearing to refer to the fact that the ICJ did not call for an immediate ceasefire.
Netanyahu also said the ICJ’s willingness to discuss genocide claims against Israel was “a disgrace that will not be erased for generations”.
Israel’s far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, openly mocked the ICJ ruling by tweeting: “Hague Shmague”.
While the ICJ’s decisions are binding and Israel cannot appeal against them, the court has no way of enforcing them."
JK3P306HR3_UAX6VGNUIGFGEGS,Two US Navy Seals declared dead after raid to seize Iranian weapons bound for Houthis,_,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/22/us-military-navy-seals-death-raid-iranian-weapons-seized-houthis-yemen-middle-east-crisis-red-sea-uss-lewis-puller,"Two US Navy Seals who went missing during an operation to seize Iranian weapons bound for Yemen’s Houthi rebels have been declared dead after a 10-day search failed to locate them, the US military has said.
US Central Command (Centcom) had previously said that two Seals who were reported as lost at sea were involved in the 11 January operation, in which the elite special operations personnel boarded a dhow off the coast of Somalia and seized missile components made in Iran.
“We regret to announce that after a 10-day exhaustive search, our two missing US Navy Seals have not been located and their status has been changed to deceased,” Centcom said in a statement on Sunday.
“The search and rescue operation for the two Navy Seals reported missing during the boarding of an illicit dhow carrying Iranian advanced conventional weapons … concluded and we are now conducting recovery operations,” the statement said.
Centcom described the capture of the missile components as “the first seizure of lethal, Iranian-supplied advanced conventional weapons … to the Houthis since the beginning of Houthi attacks against merchant ships in November 2023.”
The US military said earlier that the Seals were lost while its naval forces were conducting a “flag verification” of a dhow near the coast of Somalia. It said commandos based on the USS Lewis Puller, which is classed as an expeditionary mobile base vessel, executed a “complex” night-time boarding, with the support of helicopters and drones, and seized Iranian-made ballistic and cruise missiles components.
According to earlier US reports citing defence officials, the Seals approached the dhow in small special operations combat boats. At 8pm, as they were boarding the boat in high seas with 8ft (2.4-metre) swells, one Seal commando was knocked into the sea by a high wave and another dived in after him, following protocol for such an incident.
In November, Houthis began targeting ships in the Red Sea they claimed were linked to Israel – attacks they said were in support of Palestinians in Gaza, where Israeli forces are at war with Hamas.
The US and Britain carried out strikes on dozens of Houthi rebel targets earlier this month, and American forces have since hit a number of missiles that Washington says were ready to launch and posed a threat to both civilian and military vessels.
The Houthis – who declared American and British interests to be legitimate targets – have yet to be deterred, and have continued to carry out attacks on ships.
About 12% of global trade normally passes through the Bab al-Mandeb Strait, the Red Sea’s entrance between southwest Yemen and Djibouti, but the rebel attacks have caused much shipping to be diverted thousands of miles around Africa.

The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, announced Williams’ nomination on Wednesday morning.
Buttrose said last year she would not seek a second term and she will finish in the role in March.
Albanese said the national broadcaster needed “the right leadership” and that Williams was “a perfect fit”.
“Kim Williams … of all the people who were forwarded potentially as candidates for this position, shares a life experience and a breadth of capacity that he will bring to this role,” he said.
In his first interview after the announcement, Williams was asked about the scrutiny the ABC often faces.
“I think I’ve had constant public scrutiny in most of the organisations that I’ve run,” he told ABC television.
“I’m not averse to scrutiny, and in fact I think scrutiny is part and parcel of things that matter,” he said. “It’s a public institution and it’s accountable to the public.”
The surprise announcement came at a tumultuous time for the national broadcaster.
Union members passed a vote of no confidence in the managing director, David Anderson, this week, after the broadcaster defended itself in the Fair Work Commission against a claim by journalist Antoinette Lattouf that she was unlawfully fired. That comes amid a broader conversation about the ABC’s impartiality in reporting on the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas.
Williams said the ABC would need to defend itself calmly and authoritatively, without being “grandiloquent”. Asked whether some of the scrutiny verges on “vexatious complaints”, he said there was a certain degree of vexatious representation in any media environment.
“That come with news in particular where clearly often emotions can be very volatile,” he said. Asked whether the ABC had been measured in its coverage of the current Middle East war, he said he would talk to his colleagues at the ABC before venturing into “various potholes”.
Albanese described the ABC as “one of our most important institutions” and a “pillar of Australian life”.
“It is, indeed, one of the great pillars of our democracy,” he said. “It’s part of our cultural identity and our cultural wellbeing. Crucially, it’s a lifeline in times of disaster.”
Williams has previously had leadership positions at the Sydney Opera House Trust, the Australian Film Commission, Musica Viva Australia, as well as a stint as an executive at the ABC.
In 2006, he was appointed as a member in the Order of Australia for services to the arts and public policy formulation in the film and television industries.
When he left News Corp, Williams said he had faced “really confronting” roles and issues, and that he left with a “heavy heart and a mixed bag of feelings”.

“There have been many good wins matched with some memorable awful problems and opponents,” he said.
At the time, University of Melbourne journalism expert Denis Muller described Williams’ appointment as “like putting celebrity chef Gabriel Gaté in charge of the abattoir”.
In the lead-up to the 2013 election, News Corp wanted to see Labor defeated, Muller wrote in the Conversation, pointing to a notorious “kick this mob out” headline on the Daily Telegraph’s front page. Williams’ “allegedly civilising influence” was not having a visible effect on the “visceral anti-Labor campaign”, he wrote.
The Media Watch host, Paul Barry, said Williams was “a fascinating character” who was “incredibly well qualified for the job”. He described him as smart, hard working, and “extremely tough”.
“I think it’s going to be an interesting ride,” he said.
Barry said Williams had made the “right noises” about quality and independence.
Some people described him as a “micromanager and a control freak”, Barry said, adding that there could be conflict with the managing director because Williams was someone that liked to be “in control”.
Williams’ friend, former Victorian premier Steve Bracks, said Williams “probably has the greatest depth of understanding of the media more broadly in Australia than anyone else”.

His time at News Corp “probably wouldn’t be one of the highlights of the career of Kim Williams”, Bracks told the ABC’s Radio National.
Albanese’s press conference on Wednesday morning came after months of speculation about who would replace Buttrose.
The Australian Financial Review reported in December that the Sydney Opera House CEO, Louise Herron, and the ABC deputy chair, Peter Tonagh, were being considered, with some speculation ABC veteran Barrie Cassidy was also on the independent panel’s list.
The Australian reported this week that Herron, Tonagh and former Fairfax boss David Kirk were on the shortlist, and that a range of others including former prime minister Julia Gillard had been considered.
The speculation prompted Albanese’s announcement sooner than some had expected.
“Kim is a true renaissance man,” Albanese said. “The breadth of his experience is matched by its depth and his intellect, his energy and his insatiable curiosity [have all meant] that he’s been able to devote himself to a great diversity of passions.”
Williams said the role had a responsibility to “give life and personality” to the ABC charter.
“The charter is often invoked but rarely read and the charter is a refreshingly broad statement,” he said.
“It speaks to the cultural diversity of Australia, it speaks to the responsibility to national identity in the process of informing and entertaining the nation, it speaks to the necessity of being innovative and comprehensive in the approach that is taken across all of the delivery methodologies of digital media, broad casting on television, and radio, and clearly in a lot of written information.”
Asked about the ABC’s responsibilities in reporting on war in the Middle East, Williams said that at the core of ABC journalist was “the imperative of being absolutely, verifiably independent, offering at all times true journalistic integrity and to the extent possible in human affairs, having an aspiration to freedom from bias”.
Albanese said he spoke to outgoing chair, Ita Buttrose, who finishes up in March. He declined to comment on the Lattouf case because it is the subject of a Fair Work hearing.
The communications minister, Michelle Rowland, said Buttrose was “the right chair for the right time” and had shown “steady leadership” while defending the ABC’s independence.
The union representing journalists said Williams must “must restore ABC’s reputation for independence”, calling on the prominent media executive to address concerns at the broadcaster about the “impact of external pressures on editorial decision making”.
The Media, Entertainment & Arts Alliance was quick to urge Williams to chart a new course at the broadcaster, saying he should “work with unions to support staff who are under attack, reaffirm the commitment to cultural diversity in the workplace, and uphold the standards of reporting without fear or favour that the public expects of the ABC”.
MEAA’s acting chief executive, Adam Portelli, said it was a “crucial time” for the ABC, and alleging that Buttrose was “completely out of touch” with concerns from staff.
“On Monday, union members overwhelmingly said they had lost confidence in David Anderson because of his failure to address very real concerns about the way the ABC deals with external pressure and supports journalists from First Nations and culturally diverse backgrounds when they are under attack,” he said.“Public trust in the ABC as an organisation that will always pursue frank and fearless journalism has been damaged, and management under Mr Anderson has not demonstrated it is taking these concerns seriously.“We are optimistic that the incoming chair, Kim Williams, will bring a more collaborative approach to dealing with issues of cultural safety and editorial integrity than has been witnessed under Ms Buttrose.“He must understand that nothing less than the reputation of the ABC is at stake here.”
Albanese said he consulted with the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, about the role, and now will recommend Williams’ appointment to the governor-general. Opposition communications spokesperson, David Coleman, welcomed the move and said the ABC’s most fundamental obligation was to represent all Australians.
In a statement, the ABC said Williams’ appointment signalled “the continuation of stability and good governance at the ABC board under the leadership of Ms Buttrose over the past five years”."
JPKMEMX22D_AWWYOWFJG5NH5YU,"UK risks being ‘burnt-out nation’ due to poor mental health, charity says",Charlie Moloney,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/jan/22/mental-health-uk-burnt-out-nation,"A “worrying” number of people taking time off work due to poor mental health leaves the UK at risk of becoming a “burnt-out nation”, a charity has said.
The head of Mental Health UK has suggested global issues such as climate change and artificial intelligence fuelling “feelings of hopelessness” could be contributing to burnout.
It comes after a survey revealed more than a third of adults faced extreme pressure in the workplace in the past year.
The YouGov poll of 2,060 adults – 1,132 of whom were workers – found 35% had experienced high or extreme levels of pressure at work, with 20% requiring time off due to poor mental health caused by stress in the past year.
Mental Health UK’s chief executive, Brian Dow, warned the UK was “rapidly becoming a burnt-out nation” with a “worrying number of people” taking time off due to poor mental health caused by stress.
“High levels of work absence due to poor mental health are a major challenge, but its causes are complex,” he added.
“Public attitudes and understanding towards mental health and work have changed, particularly as the workplace transformed overnight in response to the pandemic.
“Meanwhile, we live in unprecedented times, and life outside work has become increasingly difficult due to the cost of living crisis and pressures on public services, while global challenges such as climate change and artificial intelligence fuel stress, anxiety and feelings of hopelessness.”
Dow called on the government to intervene and better support the workforce. He advocated for a “national conversation” on the issue.
Deidre Bowen, the director of national programmes at Mental Health UK, said she had experienced burnout in a previous role, saying she was “exhausted, constantly jittery and battling headaches”.
She said: “Experiencing burnout myself has truly shown me how harmful it can be to our wellbeing and why employers need to prioritise concrete actions to prevent it.”
Mental Health UK urged the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, to hold a national summit to bring together ministers, employers and experts in an effort to create healthy workplaces and better support workers.

A government spokesperson said: “We are investing £2.3bn into mental health services and putting almost 400,000 extra people through NHS talking therapies.
“But the link between work and good mental health is clear, which is why our back to work plan will help hundreds of thousands including those with long-term health conditions to break down barriers to work.
“Inactivity has reduced by over 300,000 since the pandemic peak, and our occupational health consultation will help make sure businesses offer the best possible health support to their staff.”
The YouGov survey also found 35% of people were not comfortable voicing concerns about pressure and stress to line managers or company leaders, with 31% saying bullying and intimidation by colleagues had been the cause of their stress in the last year.
Almost half (49%) of workers suggested their employers did not have a plan in place to spot signs of chronic stress."
JS0WWHAQAC_K7KGP62CL0ADM55,Why is Joe Biden dragging the US into another potential war?,Mohamad Bazzi,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/25/joe-biden-us-middle-east-war-houthis-gaza,"As a presidential candidate, Joe Biden made a forceful case for restraining US military intervention and ending the wars that America had unleashed after the September 11 attacks. “The use of force should be our last resort, not our first,” he said in a July 2019 speech, adding that military power should be “used only to defend our vital interests, when the objective is clear and achievable … It’s past time to end the forever wars, which have cost us untold blood and treasure.”
Yet Biden is now dragging the US into another potential war, one which doesn’t meet many of the standards he set out as a candidate. The Biden administration is risking a wider conflict with the Houthis in Yemen, amid reports that the Pentagon is preparing a “sustained military campaign”, after nearly two weeks of air and missile strikes failed to stop them from attacking shipping vessels in the Red Sea.
On 18 January, when reporters in Washington DC asked Biden if US attacks on Houthi targets were working, he was remarkably candid. “Are they stopping the Houthis? No,” he said. “Are they gonna continue? Yes.”
Biden and his administration are practically sleepwalking the US into another war – this time in Yemen, where Washington has already helped provoke one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises thanks to its support of Saudi Arabia in a years-long conflict against the Houthis.
Remarkably, Biden and his aides have consistently said that one of their top priorities is to prevent Israel’s devastating invasion of Gaza, which began after the 7 October attacks by Hamas, from spreading into a regional conflict that could spiral out of control. But the Gaza invasion has already spilled into clashes in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, Yemen and the Red Sea.
For months, Biden has avoided the most clear-cut solution to avert a wider conflagration: pressuring the Israeli government to end its assault on Gaza and negotiate a ceasefire with Hamas.
The US administration has multiple options to lean on the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. It could threaten to withhold billions of dollars in military aid, which allow Israel to continue its assault, or it could stop using Washington’s veto power on the UN security council to quash resolutions calling for a ceasefire. Instead, Biden and his aides have gone out of their way to deal with the regional conflict as somehow separate from the war in Gaza – a kind of wishful thinking motivated by treating symptoms rather than finding the cure for an underlying illness.
By getting more deeply involved in Yemen, Biden is acting against his own interests – as well as larger US security priorities – during a presidential election campaign when he’s likely to face Donald Trump once again. Netanyahu, on the other hand, has the most to gain by prolonging the Gaza conflict, so that he can avoid a political reckoning in Israel over multiple corruption charges and an investigation into whether his administration could have prevented the 7 October attacks.
The Houthis began the Red Sea attacks in late October, when they started firing missiles and drones at – and, in some cases, trying to hijack – commercial vessels sailing through the area. The Houthis claimed they were acting in support of the Palestinians and said they would stop targeting ships once Israel ends its invasion of Gaza.
The attacks prompted the world’s largest shipping companies to reroute vessels around South Africa, which can add thousands of miles to a freighter’s journey between Asia and Europe. With global companies facing skyrocketing fuel, labor and insurance costs, the Biden administration last month assembled an international coalition to protect commercial ships in the region.
When the Houthis would not back down, the US and Britain launched air and missile strikes against dozens of targets in Yemen on 12 January. Since then, the US military has struck Yemen eight times, most recently on Monday night. But Houthi leaders are undaunted and they’ve promised to exact revenge against the US and Britain.
The Houthis are portraying themselves as one of the few forces in the Middle East willing to stand against Israel and its western allies in defense of the Palestinian cause. At a rally in Yemen’s capital, Sana’a, after the first wave of US strikes, thousands of people chanted, “We don’t care – make it a world war.”
Houthis leaders are also using the global attention to enhance their reputation throughout the Middle East and raise their standing within the “axis of resistance”, a network of regional militias supported by Iran. Aside from the Houthis and Hamas, the alliance also includes several Shia militias in Iraq and Syria, and the powerful Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. Since 7 October, this alliance has tried to increase the stakes of the Gaza war by striking at Israeli and US targets across the region.
With its persistent support of Israel, the Biden administration has alienated its allies in the Arab world and it has been unable to convince two states that fought a seven-year war with the Houthis, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, to join the Red Sea task force. Because of their experience fighting the Houthis – with billions of dollars in US weapons and intelligence support – Saudi and UAE leaders are trying to avoid instigating the militia, which carried out missile and drone attacks in both countries.
The Saudis also want to maintain a tenuous ceasefire with the Houthis, which was brokered by the UN in 2022. The two sides are still negotiating a permanent deal that would recognize Houthi control over parts of Yemen, including the capital, and provide Saudi reparations.
During years of fighting with the Houthis, Saudi leaders learned a lesson that the Biden administration appears to have forgotten in the current confrontation: it’s nearly impossible to dislodge an Indigenous insurgent movement without a huge commitment of ground troops. Even then, as the US military realized during its wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, it’s costly to maintain an indefinite occupation.
The Houthis, who are officially known as Ansar Allah, or the Partisans of God, have been around since the 1990s as a Shia tribal movement based in northern Yemen that fought repeated battles against Yemen’s central government and its Saudi backers. In September 2014, the Houthis intensified Yemen’s civil war when they marched into the capital and within a few months forced the internationally recognized government to flee to Saudi Arabia.
By March 2015, the Saudis led an alliance of Sunni Arab states to intervene in Yemen, trying to dislodge the Houthis from Sana’a through a blockade and ultimately thousands of air strikes. By the end of 2021, the UN estimated that the conflict had killed 377,000 people – nearly 60% of whom died not through fighting but from other causes, such as cholera outbreaks, food shortages and destruction of the healthcare system.
The Houthis survived the US-backed onslaught, and emerged stronger than they had been at the start of the war. Today, the militia is eager to show the world that it can withstand not just a sustained military assault by Saudi Arabia, a US ally, but by Washington itself.
Since Biden refuses to pressure Israel to stop its bombardment of Gaza and accept a ceasefire, he is escalating the US confrontation with the Houthis. In the process, Biden risks entangling the US in another open-ended conflict, which is likely to expand by accident or miscalculation, rather than by design. Either way, it threatens to prolong the forever wars.

JT2EZWVI3C_K8AQ6DP7AQFK2EC,"Prisoners with severe mental health needs spending months in isolation, report finds",Rajeev Syal,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/jan/25/prisoners-with-severe-mental-health-needs-spending-months-in-isolation-report-finds,"A prisoner who repeatedly self-harmed spent more than 800 days in segregation, according to a damning report that reveals that jails are using isolation to manage severe mental health needs.
The inmate, who was detained under the imprisonment for public protection (IPP) scheme, is one of dozens with severe psychological issues who have been held for months at a time in isolation, the Independent Monitoring Board (IMB) has concluded.
Observers at a high security prison found that the inmate, identified in the report as “Mr H”, had been diagnosed with a personality disorder and had repeatedly self-harmed.
He was temporarily transferred to a specialist psychological unit but his behaviour deteriorated, and he was returned to a segregation unit again.
Prisoners with severe mental health needs who require care in a secure hospital or psychiatric intensive care unit should be transferred within 28 days, as set out by NHS England guidance.
Mental Health Act reforms were due to make the 28-day transfer target a statutory requirement. However, the bill was not included in the king’s speech in November, meaning it will not be passed in this parliament.
The IMB report, released on Thursday, said the Prison Service too often uses segregation in care and separation units (CSUs) as a way of managing prisoners with severe mental health needs.
It uncovered numerous examples of mentally unwell prisoners being held in isolation. They include a man with autism, a schizophrenia diagnosis and displaying severe ADHD symptoms spending almost nine months in a category C prison’s segregation unit, during which time his mental health dramatically deteriorated.
Another prisoner with complex mental health needs was segregated for 300 days while awaiting assessment for transfer to a secure mental health hospital.
By the time he was assessed and transferred, he had spent more than 550 days in the segregation unit – nearly 20 times the target transfer time.
Elisabeth Davies, the IMB chair, said: “Too often, the Prison Service is using CSUs as the default setting to manage and care for men with severe or challenging mental health needs.
“These units are holding bays for those who face lengthy delays prior to transfer to a more appropriate secure setting, stuck in CSUs because there is simply nowhere else for them to go.”
The report was compiled after surveys of monitoring boards at 30 prisons, which was completed in the spring.
Nearly all of the prisons had held men with mental health needs in CSUs, the survey found.
There was a lack of capacity in prison healthcare units and there were delays in referrals, assessments and transfers, the report said. Some prisoners struggled to cope in residential wings.
Campbell Robb, the chief executive at the charity Nacro, which helps people in prison and on their release, said the policy of holding people with mental health needs in isolation was “completely wrong”, adding: “These are vulnerable people at a moment of crisis – they deserve support, treatment and stability, not to be made to pay the price for our overstretched prison and health services.”
A government spokesperson said: “Segregation is an absolute last resort for those deemed a danger to themselves or others.
“Prisoners are entitled to the same care as they would receive in the community, which is why we guarantee the most vulnerable individuals are able to access mental health support tailored to their needs.”"
JTGBZ8D1FL_EHJ3D60FMPMKTV9,Protesters in bed during an eight-week sit-in: John Walmsley’s best photograph,Chris Broughton,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2024/jan/24/students-sit-in-guildford-john-walmsleys-best-photograph,"Guildford School of Art had a good reputation for photojournalism, but when I got there, I found there were no photojournalists on the staff. You just had to get on with it yourself. During my final year, I photographed the 1968 anti-Vietnam war demo outside the US Embassy in London. I learned on the job.
There was a lot of dissatisfaction, so when I found out there was going to be a meeting of students to discuss asking to improve things, I went along. It soon became clear that not only did the students believe the place needed a shakeup, many of the staff felt the same way. However, the governors refused to take us seriously. In those days, these places were run by local councillors who had no feeling for the young or for the arts. When we suggested they were the wrong people to be running it, we were just informed: “Do what you’re told, we’re in charge.” It was clear we needed to make a stand, and that’s how the sit-in began.
You can see the attitude we were up against in another one of the photographs I took, where the Vice-Principal is addressing students who have taken over the canteen. His stance and jabbing finger speak volumes. By week four, in an attempt to get the governors to take us seriously, we’d occupied the whole building. The sit-in continued for eight weeks, even longer than the similar protest at Hornsey College of Art in London. By the end, the school was entirely shut down, the electricity had been cut off and the board of governors were unsuccessfully applying for an order from the High Court to have us evicted.
Throughout it all, I kept taking pictures. Students were often up talking all night and sleeping wherever they could. I discovered these two in the graphic design studio one morning, asleep in their camp beds. In those days you valued your 36 frames, and I think this is the only shot I took of them. I didn’t know who they were and still don’t. A lot of us are still in touch, though, and even had a big get-together and an exhibition 50 years after the sit-in.
Two or three months before our final assessment, we’d had to say what was going to be our major piece of work. Mine was pretty mundane. When the sit-in started, I thought: “This is a ton more interesting.” It was a national event which I was in the middle of. The art school was supposed to have trained me to be entrepreneurial, to see an opportunity and grab it. “Well,” I thought. “That’s exactly what I’ve done.”
So I submitted pictures of the sit-in, half knowing the school wouldn’t be happy. And I was right: they refused to give me any kind of qualification, which didn’t please my dad, I must say. But the following year, photos I had taken of Summerhill, teacher AS Neill’s democratic school in Suffolk, were published as a Penguin Education Special with a text by children’s writer Leila Berg. I gave my dad a copy and he took it to show his mates in the pub, proud as punch.
As a boy from a council estate, the art school environment was a shock at first and the sit-in was eye-opening. It ended without the governors ever agreeing to a useful dialogue with us, but soon afterwards the minister for education insisted that all schools, colleges and universities must invite students and staff on to their advisory boards. That we have that today is a direct result of those art school sit-ins.
Nowadays I do a lot of work around copyright infringement, trying to ensure photographers get paid for unauthorised use of their work. I learned back then that if something isn’t as it should be, then say so – and I’m still doing that at 76. You might make yourself unpopular, but you can look back and think: “Well, that was worth doing.”

JX9ZR578PK_SV5RTUIUFTJKMCU,Baghead review – ancient face-covered demon emerges from creepy pub’s basement,Peter Bradshaw,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/jan/24/baghead-review-ancient-face-covered-demon-emerges-from-creepy-pubs-basement,"The extravagant absurdity of this chiller from screenwriter Lorcan Reilly and director Alberto Corredor might conceivably get it an audience. There are some interesting touches, but horror fans might well feel that it’s just too similar to the recent and frankly superior Australian film Talk to Me – though it must be said that Talk to Me was made well after Reilly and Corredor’s original 2017 short, with the same high concept, on which this is based.
Iris (Freya Allan) is a young woman, bitterly estranged from her widower father (Peter Mullan) and she is astonished to learn after his death that she has inherited from him a creepy old pub. And this pub has a 400-year-old she-devil locked up in the basement, her face concealed by an old sack, nicknamed “Baghead”. On request, and for two minutes only, she can summon up any dead person you want to talk to – but keep talking for more than two minutes, and the spirit of the dead is irreversibly loosed into the world of the living. An angry, intense young man, Neil (Jeremy Irvine) shows up at the pub, offering Iris fistfuls of cash, desperate for the chance to speak just one last time to his dead wife. But things go terribly wrong.
Neil’s first encounter with Baghead contains an amusing and insightful twist on the subject of his fear of women, but otherwise this film is a lumbering mess of cliched jump scares, and people’s eyes going demonically black and speaking with Daleky voices at scary moments. The original setting has been uncomfortably and bafflingly transplanted to Berlin – presumably because of the European co-production funding – without ever really explaining why and how a Scottish bloke (Mullan) came to own this “pub” in Berlin with its English name, The Queen’s Head. This creates a layer of clunky inauthenticity which scuppers it almost entirely.
Baghead is released on 26 January in UK and Irish cinemas."
JY5KT1M8OM_AKAR3A1CXHW0FCS,Netanyahu faces hostages dilemma as Israeli political debate heats up,Jason Burke,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/23/netanyahu-faces-hostages-dilemma-as-israeli-political-debate-heats-up,"As Israeli military casualties mount in Gaza, Benjamin Netanyahu finds himself on the horns of a dilemma. The Israeli prime minister’s popularity has plummeted and polls suggest that in an immediate election his rightwing Likud party would lose half its seats to a resurgent centrist opposition.
Voters have not forgotten the glaring failures that allowed Hamas to attack southern Israel from Gaza on 7 October, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting about 240. But the lack of tangible results from the Israeli offensive in Gaza that was supposed to bring “total victory” over Hamas is now important too.
Military casualties have risen to 221 and there has been no strategic breakthrough. Hamas has been seriously degraded but its senior leadership remains intact, and rockets were fired into Israel from Gaza again last week.
Politics, frozen in Israel in the aftermath of the October attacks, are warming up again. Local media talk of “resurgent opposition” to Netanyahu. Seasoned observers warn against exaggerating any thaw, pointing to the lack of any mass mobilisation and how most Israelis are still absorbed in their personal grief, or worries about close relatives in uniform.
But there are signs of change. Relatives of hostages still in Gaza are growing more vocal. In recent days they blocked a motorway and disrupted a committee hearing in parliament.
Last week Gadi Eisenkot, a former chief of army staff and member of the small war cabinet formed by Netanyahu after the October attack, accused the prime minister of misleading the public into believing in a swift victory in Gaza. The criticism resonated, not least because Eisenkot’s son, a soldier, had been killed there in December.
Prof Gideon Rahat, of Jerusalem’s Hebrew University, said: “In the long term, casualties become significant because people start asking what return they are getting for such a high price. The politicians announced that victories would come too quickly and that is problematic.”
Netanyahu could gain a boost in the polls – albeit potentially a short-term one – if he agreed a deal with Hamas that freed the hostages, analysts suggest. But even agreeing a short pause to the offensive in Gaza could lose Netanyahu the support of the far-right politicians who are important to his coalition government. This would not end his rule, but would seriously undermine it.
There are multiple scenarios for what plays out over coming months. Many lead to the 74-year-old veteran leaving office.
Some analysts think early elections are likely. Others say no politician would risk a wartime poll but admit the parliamentary maths of a successful no-confidence vote does not currently add up. Netanyahu’s opposition is hopelessly divided too.
“Bibi”, as he is known, has been in power for longer than Israel’s founding father David Ben-Gurion was, and faces potential imprisonment on corruption charges. He has been in tough situations before, and survived. Even if elections were called tomorrow, it could take six months before a new government formed.
“[Netanyahu’s ouster] is not inevitable and definitely not immediate. He is in a different league from anyone else in the current political scene and he thrives on pressure,” said one political insider.
Ronny Douek, a businessman and social entrepreneur, said Israelis needed to decide if they wanted the same government to take them to “the next stage”.
“If you are running a huge hi-tech company and your company shows losses, you probably want the board to change the management. The leadership fell asleep and we are paying a huge price,” said Douek, who set up the Yeladenu resilience initiative to arrange counselling and other services for thousands of Israeli children displaced by the conflict.
Israeli public opinion is fragmented, however. Protesters in recent days, including demobilised veterans of the fighting in Gaza, are calling for firmer commitment to the offensive, which has killed 25,000 Palestinians in the territory, mostly women and children. Hostages’ families have differing views too.
“Netanyahu’s decision is to not make a decision and to drag things out in the hope something will turn up,” said Mairav Zonszein, an Israel analyst at the International Crisis Group. “There is still a consensus that the war is justified but increasingly people want someone else at the wheel and think that Netanyahu has to go, not at some unclear later date but now.”"
K3F4GTD655_OON4UA4K00XCAL9,This momentous ICJ ruling may be brushed aside by Israel - but the US and UK can’t afford to ignore it,Steve Crawshaw,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/26/israel-gaza-icj-genocide-ruling-the-hague,"Israel will no doubt continue to pour scorn on the international court of justice (ICJ) in The Hague in the days and weeks to come. “Hague Shmague” was the first response from the security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir. But the provisional measures ordered by the world court today are historic, by any measure.
The requirement that Israel must take steps to prevent genocidal acts, prevent and punish incitement to genocide, and report back on its actions within a month, will all have rippling implications – not just in the weeks but in the years to come.
The court has few powers of enforcement, as Russia and others have made clear. In its provisional measures on a case brought by Ukraine in 2022, the court called on Russia to immediately suspend military operations, presumably with little hope of being heard. Russia responded by demanding that the court throw out the “hopelessly flawed” case (spoiler: it didn’t). But that lack of enforcement doesn’t lessen the political discomfort for Israel – or for those who have seemed so ready to protect Israel from any and all criticism.
Until recently, the ICJ has toiled in the shadows. Other legal institutions in The Hague, like the Balkan war crimes tribunal which prosecuted Serb leader Slobodan Milošević and the international criminal court (ICC), which indicted Vladimir Putin, have enjoyed the spotlight. Until now, however, even when the world court addressed issues such as genocide in Bosnia or the legality of the Israeli “separation barrier”, its rulings barely made the headlines.
That has now changed, perhaps for ever. The rulings, all passed by either 16-1 or 15-2 – even the appointed Israeli judge, Aharon Barak, sided twice with the majority – are devastating for Israel, though a final judgment is still a long way off. Meanwhile, those governments which argued that South Africa’s case was empty and illegitimate now need to dig themselves out of the hole of their own creation.
Especially compelling was the evidence of incitement to genocide, a core element of the 1948 convention. A former director general of the Israeli foreign ministry and others had talked, even before the South African submission, of “extensive and blatant incitement to genocide and expulsion and ethnic cleansing”. But it was notable how many governments were reluctant to confront that self-evident truth.
Benjamin Netanyahu and his government like to use attack as the best form of defence. When the UN secretary general, António Guterres, criticised both the “appalling” Hamas killings and the civilian deaths in Gaza, while saying the former had not occurred “in a vacuum”, Israel’s ambassador to the UN called for him to resign. When the ICC, two miles across town, announced in 2021 that it was ready to investigate alleged crimes in Gaza, Netanyahu told Israeli viewers: “The state of Israel is under attack this evening”, and talked of “the height of hypocrisy”.
Such language will no doubt continue. But one problem for Netanyahu – and, by extension, for many western governments – is that millions of people around the world now see hypocrisy and double standards elsewhere in a very different context.
In 2021, Boris Johnson criticised the ICC’s cautious and much-delayed decision to look at Gaza on the grounds that an international court should not investigate Britain’s friends. The White House seems equally determined that an ally of the US should never be criticised – just as Russia was always determined to block any action on war crimes in Syria. The spokesperson of the US national security council didn’t wait for the judges’ interim ruling before describing South Africa’s case at the ICJ as “meritless, counterproductive, completely without any basis in fact whatsoever”. No hindsight is needed to realise that the optics of such an aggressively pro-Israeli statement were bad, never mind the absurdity of “no basis whatsoever”, which the judges’ rulings made legal nonsense of.
Washington’s reluctance to condemn the crimes and human suffering has most obviously been bad news for Palestinians. Although Netanyahu refuses to acknowledge that obvious truth, it is also bad news for Israel, whose future security is likely to be damaged for many years to come by what is happening now. But the implications also go well beyond this one conflict. The pick-and-choose approach to justice – “hypocrisy”, to use Netanyahu’s word – is dangerous for justice everywhere.
Most immediately, Ukraine has increasingly become the victim of a north-south divide through no fault of its own but directly resulting from the double standards so blatantly on show. Ukraine has tended to be supported by countries in the global north; Palestinians by countries in the global south. As Russia’s attacks across eastern and southern Ukraine remind us every day – and as I again saw for myself, for instance in the village of Hroza in October, where 59 villagers were killed in a targeted attack on a funeral wake – Ukraine still deserves and needs maximum solidarity. But, as a result of Ukraine’s own allies’ actions and inactions, Ukraine will now find it more difficult to gather enough much-needed support in its battles for justice, including the crimes-of-aggression tribunal that it has been pressing for in the past two years. Western governments have turned this into a case of “your victims” versus “our victims”, which it should never have been.
In November, Britain and five other countries joined in support of a Gambian case against Myanmar at the ICJ in connection with allegations of genocide against Rohingya Muslims. So far, so admirable. Anything that puts pressure on the junta in Myanmar – and a powerful judgment at the world court would certainly do that – is welcome. But the disconnect is blatant, if Britain can make such an intervention on Myanmar while refusing to address the fact that a key ally has killed more than 20,000 civilians in just a few months.
Most obviously, the world court ruling puts pressure on Israel. It rightly highlights the crimes committed by Hamas, which those who criticise Israel are sometimes too eager to put to one side. But it also serves as a reminder of the starting point for justice itself. Unequal justice is no justice at all. Nothing can be more destabilising than the lack of justice. That matters for Gaza, it matters for Ukraine, and it matters in conflict zones from Ethiopia to Myanmar. If The Hague court’s judgment helps kick western governments into an understanding of the need for a more balanced approach, that will be valuable. If they look the other way, not just the Palestinians but all of us will be the losers.

K46SGXMU53_9GAL2J5YI467R9Y,Post Office set targets for recovering cash from operators accused in Horizon scandal,Kevin Rawlinson,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/23/post-office-set-targets-for-recovering-cash-from-operators-accused-in-horizon-scandal,"Targets set by the Post Office suggested it was prioritising clawing back money from branch operators accused of financial irregularities due to the organisation’s discredited IT system, the Horizon inquiry has heard.
Former investigator Robert Daily told the inquiry that increasing the target for recovering cash, which was among the performance indicators linked to investigators’ bonuses, from 40% to 65% was instructive when considering the Post Office’s motives for pursuing post office operators. However, he said it did not influence individual investigators.
Daily said the target was viewed as unfair by investigators because meeting it depended largely on a post office operator’s ability to pay the money they had been accused of stealing.
Asked why his performance targets were increased, Daily said: “I can only think it was because of the amount of losses the Post Office were suffering.”
Emma Price, the counsel to the inquiry, asked him if the target was “indicative of the recovery of funds from those being investigated being a high priority within the Post Office”. Daily said individual investigators did not look at the target that way, and it did not influence their work, but that “it would suggest it was”.
Price asked Daily: “How was this objective at this stage rewarded by the Post Office?” Daily responded: “I understand where this is coming from – ‘Were we given bonuses for recovering money?’. It was part of our objectives to do so. It didn’t necessarily rely on a bonus – we received a bonus every year regardless.”
Explaining how the bonus system worked, Daily said: “There were individual bonuses for how you performed over the year – if you’ve performed better than someone else. So, technically, you could say this went towards [it]. But, if you speak to individuals within the investigation team, the investigation managers, it was always considered an unfair target.
“Because any inquiry you did … all you could say to a person was: ‘Were you in a position to repay the money?’ If that person didn’t have the money, you couldn’t get blood out of a stone.”
Daily, who was involved in the criminal investigation of two wrongly convicted post office operators who died before their convictions were overturned, was giving evidence to the inquiry on Tuesday.
A Newcastle operator, Peter Holmes, was handed a community order and a curfew, and William Quarm, who had a branch in North Uist in Scotland, was sentenced to 150 hours of unpaid work after their convictions.
Daily also confirmed that, for a spell, there were “no Scottish qualified lawyers within the criminal team”. In his witness statement, he said he asked for support from Scottish solicitors after becoming “concerned” he was not receiving the same support he was in England.

Price asked Daily: “Is it right, therefore that – prior to managing to gain approval for BTO Solicitors to advise on Scottish cases in 2013 – the criminal law team was providing a decision on whether a case should be passed to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service without being qualified in Scottish law?” Daily replied: “I believe so, yes.”
More than 700 branch managers were prosecuted by the Post Office after Fujitsu’s faulty accounting software Horizon made it appear money was missing from their shops.
Computer Weekly and Private Eye, among others, uncovered the scandal more than 15 years ago, but national outrage did not follow until it was dramatised in ITV series Mr Bates v The Post Office earlier this month.
Hundreds of post office operators are awaiting compensation despite the government announcing that those who have had convictions quashed are eligible for £600,000 payouts."
K899XQLWOV_S6S2RHS3LLP75SC,Thousands of Māori gather to tell New Zealand’s government: you cannot marginalise us,Eva Corlett,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/22/thousands-of-maori-gather-to-tell-new-zealands-government-you-cannot-marginalise-us,"It was a rare national meeting that was expected to attract 3,000 attenders.
Instead, 10,000 were there, Māori leaders and their families pouring into Tūrangawaewae – the seat of the Māori King – in a mighty display of unity against New Zealand government policies that risk unwinding decades of progress for Māori rights and wellbeing.
“There was a massive feeling of solidarity,” says Te Rawhitiroa Bosch, a photographer, affiliated with the Northland iwi [tribe] Ngāpuhi and Ngāti Kahu, of Saturday’s gathering. “When you turn up and there are 10,000 people there and it takes half an hour to find a park – it makes you feel something.”
Bosch had attended the hui [meeting] alongside his iwi, in response to proposals from what he calls the “three-headed taniwha [monster] – the current government”.
The coalition government – led by National’s Christopher Luxon and with the populist New Zealand First leader, Winston Peters, and Act party libertarian David Seymour sharing the deputy prime minister role – has announced it will repeal or review at least a dozen policies that provide for Māori. This includes rolling back initiatives designed to improve Māori health outcomes, stopping “race-based” policies, and minimising Māori language use in the public service.
The government has said services should be provided on the basis of need, not race, and prime minister Luxon has often said the government intends to “deliver outcomes for everybody”.
As part of the National and Act coalition agreement, the government has also opened the door to a review of the principles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi, or Treaty of Waitangi, which upholds Māori rights, including the right to autonomy and protection of Māori interests – a move some critics have called a “modern day confiscation of treaty rights” and part of a wider “anti-Māori” policy direction. The Treaty, an agreement reached in 1840 between Māori and the Crown, is not a legal document but its principles to uphold Māori rights are woven into legislation.
The government’s direction is “fear based”, Bosch says. He challenges the government and its supporters to ask themselves why Māori should not seek equity. “We’re in the negatives for all of the statistics.”
“Just about everything the [government] is doing is reinforcing colonial ideologies, and that’s why people turned up in such numbers.”
Late last year, Kiingi Tuheitia Pootatau Te Wherowhero VII issued an extremely rare royal proclamation asking iwi to meet to “unify the nation and ensure all voices are heard when holding the new coalition government to account” as tensions flared between Māori and the new rightwing government, elected in late 2023.
The call was heard. On Saturday, iwi members from across the country turned up in droves – some had been bussed in convoys from the North, some had flown in from the South, others arrived on horseback; a trail of red, white and black tino rangatiratanga [self-determinaton] flags shimmering behind them.
The last time the marae had attracted such numbers was in 2006, at the tangi [funeral] of the late Māori Queen, Dame Te Atairangikaahu. But Waikato-Tanui, the hosting iwi, came prepared – marquees were set up to accommodate the overflow and thousands of packaged lunches were handed out. As the summer heat bore down, hundreds of children sought solace in the cool of the nearby Waikato River, while inside the marae, speeches, laughter and cheers rang out.
Prior to the event, many iwi held their own separate hui, to discuss their primary concerns, positions and what they could offer.
“Iwi came under their own mana [authority] – and that is important,” Bosch says. “This [was] an important time for iwi from all over the motu [island] to come and find a way forward together,” he said. “This is galvanising us … now I want to see if our korero [discussion] has teeth … if it will form into action on the ground.”
The hui is the first of three major events in the political calendar over the next few weeks – ahead of Rātana and Waitangi Day – and is likely to set the tone for discussions over the Māori relationship with the Crown, and the government’s direction.
One of the first speakers of the day, Anglican Archbishop Don Tamihere, recalled a time three decades ago, when a previous bishop told the visiting late Queen Elizabeth II that the Crown was not honouring the treaty. “Here we are, 34 years later, wondering if the message needs to be the same,” he said.
“Because somebody, somewhere, has made the political calculation that they can vilify te iwi Māori, that they can demonise te iwi Māori, that they can renegotiate our existence and the taonga [treasure] that you hold dear, knowing that it will cost them nothing and yet [for] te iwi Māori, it will cost us everything.”
On Friday, alarm about potential changes to the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi were further inflamed, after a draft memo detailing the proposed changes was leaked from the Ministry of Justice.
In a searing speech delivered to the crowd on Saturday, indigenous rights lawyer Dayle Takitimu, of Apanui and Porourangi descent, sounded a warning over the proposal and what she described as a “treaty-illiterate” government.
Takitimu accused the government of promoting “white supremacist” views, adding: “We have seen that as recently as last evening, when the leaked document that has spread throughout Māoridom and social media, was received that absolutely strips the tapu [sacred] and the mana out of the treaty arrangement that we have with the Crown.”
Luxon did not attend the hui, instead sending the minister for Māori development, Tama Potaka, and MP Dan Bidois.
Speaking to media at the hui, Potaka said Takitimu’s accusations about the creep of white supremacy within the government was “premature”, but he recognised that some Māori were feeling alienated. “I think there’s confronting comments all over our communities and all over society at the moment,” he said.
Kiingi Tuheitia took the podium late in the day, after a series of break-out sessions to discuss particular concerns, where he too singled out the government’s proposed treaty changes.
“By turning up we’ve sent a strong message and that’s the message that has been heard around the world.”
The Kiingi said he wanted the Treaty to be entrenched in constitutional law, to avoid exposing it to the whims of the Government of the day, and urged Māori to understand the treaty through their reo and tikanga [customs].
Where some iwi, such as Te Arawa, signalled their intent to secede from the Crown, should the government not take heed of their concerns, others, including the Kiingi took a more conciliatory tone towards action.
“The best protest we can do right now, is be Māori,” he said.
“Be who we are, live our values, speak our reo, care for our mokopuna [children], our awa [rivers], our maunga [mountains], just be Māori – Māori all day, every day, we are here, we are strong.”"
KC0RG792ER_XYAA3ITO7AR8H6V,David Compton obituary,Christopher Priest,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/jan/24/david-compton-obituary,"In his most accomplished novel, The Continuous Katherine Mortenhoe, David Compton, who has died aged 93, anticipated the impact of reality television on the lives of its subjects. The book was published under the name of DG Compton in 1974, at least two decades before the fad for fly-on-the-wall documentaries revealed the ghoulish public curiosity in personal traumas.
Compton’s story describes a programme about a woman with a terminal illness. The book was later filmed by Bertrand Tavernier as Death Watch (La Mort en Direct, 1980), in which Romy Schneider played the dying woman, and Harvey Keitel the TV journalist whose eyes have been replaced by tiny cameras and who covertly and intimately records her last days.
Compton was a diverse and fluent writer, who once complained that he would write more books if only he was able to find more ideas that presented themselves to him “with the whole glorious kit of parts” – that is, where the story, characters and meaning came to him whole. Over the years he assumed various writing personas, but shrugged away the idea that he was hardworking.
At first, from the early 1960s, he wrote quirky radio plays: although many were broadcast by the BBC they were not enough to make his name or his fortune. Two favourites were eventually published as Radio Plays (1988). After reinventing himself as Guy Compton, he produced six thrillers with Hodder & Stoughton, published between 1962 and 1967. Again, he felt that he was failing to make an impact and that the crime novel was not exactly stretching him.
The breakthrough arrived unexpectedly, with a book he called The Quality of Mercy (1965), which indeed came to him, now as DG Compton, with “the whole kit of parts”. He felt it was his first substantial piece of work. Rather to his surprise, Hodder offered him much more money than before and asked if they could market it as science fiction. With only a hazy awareness of the genre, Compton agreed.
Over the next decade he produced a steady stream of sci-fi novels, conceived in the same way as the first, and it is on these that his lasting reputation rests. His work relied on intelligent, subtle prose, with well delineated characters and the plausible depiction of human situations. Going against the conventions of sci-fi, a sense of English nostalgia imbued his writing. The elegiac The Silent Multitude (1967) is set in an English cathedral slowly succumbing to a space-borne fungus that rots buildings, with faith and hope helpless against inexorable reality. He gave one novel of time travel the quirky title Hot Wireless Sets, Aspirin Tablets, the Sandpaper Sides of Used Matchboxes, and Something That Might Have Been Castor Oil (1970), although his American publisher brusquely changed this to the more genre-acceptable Chronocules.
Many of his plots dealt with vicarious experience: events witnessed at a distance, lending the books a touch of satire.
These quiet virtues as a novelist gained him many admirers, but some fans of traditional SF were not completely won over by his apparent distrust in technology and scepticism about the future.
Still unable to live on the profits of his serious writing, Compton assumed the female pseudonym Frances Lynch, and in the 1970s produced a successful series of romantic novels, alternating these with his SF. At the same time he took a job with Reader’s Digest, condensing novels for their popular editions: colleagues there said that his work was outstanding. At first, the thought of this delicate literary craftsman hacking away at the work of others seems anomalous, but it reflects the economy and skill of his own writing.
Born in London, David was the son of the actors Nuna Davey, the stage name of Margaret Symonds, and her husband, Gerald Cross, best known as the local newspaper editor Arnold Tripp in the 1960s BBC soap The Newcomers.
From Cheltenham college David went straight on to national service in the army, and in 1950 his mother obtained a job for him with Leatherhead repertory theatre as an assistant stage manager. An affair with the wife of the stage director brought a premature end to his theatrical career, but marked the beginning of his own first marriage, in 1952, to Elizabeth Taylor (nee Tillotson).
A variety of jobs followed: Compton worked in Heal’s, became a furniture maker, a postal worker, a door-to-door salesperson and a docker, all part-time jobs intended to enable him to write in his spare time. At one point, he and his wife lived near Bideford, in Devon, and in 1962 befriended Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath, with Plath dedicating her novel The Bell Jar (1963) to them. David and Elizabeth divorced in 1967, and, under her later married name of Sigmund, Elizabeth went on to write about Plath.
In 1969 Compton married Carol Curtis-Brown Savage, and from 1981 they increasingly lived in the US, her home country.
Compton continued to publish sci-fi novels until 1993, including a rare collaboration with the British science and sci-fi author John Gribbin: Ragnarok (1991), exploring the theme of nuclear winter. The nonfiction study Stammering: Its Nature, History, Causes, and Cures appeared in 1993. His fiction is remembered in the new century: in 2005 he was honoured by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America as Author Emeritus, the only Briton to receive this award. That was followed in 2021 by the Cordwainer Smith Rediscovery Award for authors deserving of greater attention. A final non-fantastic novel was So Here’s Our Leo (2022).
Carol died in 2005. David is survived by a stepson from her first marriage, Toby Savage, and three of the four children, Margaret, Hester and James, from his own first marriage.

KC5JD4HNM8_BF1U4ANZ00OS6HF,New emperor penguin colonies discovered in Antarctica after guano spotted from space,Adam Morton,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/25/emperor-penguins-antarctica-new-colonies-guano-space,"Four new emperor penguin colonies have been discovered in Antarctica after their guano was spotted from space, giving what a leading scientist believes is a near-full picture of the species’ population as it comes under threat due to disappearing sea ice.
A peer-reviewed study last year found a record drop in the amount of floating sea ice in the Bellingshausen Sea in late 2022 could have caused a “catastrophic breeding failure” that killed thousands of emperor penguin chicks across four breeding colonies.
The latest study found four new colonies that had not been previously recorded and what was thought to be the re-establishment of one that was believed lost. If correct, it has moved 30km east, from Halley Bay to near a rise in ice known as the MacDonald Ice Rumples.
Dr Peter Fretwell, a geospatial scientist with the British Antarctic Survey, used satellite imagery to discover and monitor the remote colonies, being guided by the brown stains of the penguins’ guano – poo – on the white ice and snow. His research, published in the journal Antarctic Science, said the discoveries lifted the number of known emperor penguin colonies to 66.
“These newly identified locations fill in almost all the gaps in the known distribution of these iconic birds,” he said.
“All except one of these colonies are small with less than 1,000 birds, so finding these new colonies makes little difference to the overall population size. In fact, it is overshadowed by the recently reported breeding failures due to the early and fast ice loss.”
Emperor penguins are the largest but least prevalent Antarctic penguin species, with scientists estimating a total population of about 600,000. They depend on stable sea ice – formed when the ocean surface freezes but attached to the shore, and known as land-fast ice – for breeding. They lay eggs in May and June. Chicks are born 65 days later, but typically do not fledge until December or January.
That cycle is threatened by a sharp decline in sea ice extent. The past two years have been the lowest for sea ice cover since the satellite record began in 1979. The four lowest years on record have occurred since 2016.
Fretwell said predictions of future changes in the emperor penguin population due to the climate crisis were stark. About 30% of emperor penguin colonies are believed to have been affected by sea ice loss since 2018.
His paper cited models that suggested if carbon dioxide emissions continued to rise at the present rate almost all colonies would be “quasi-extinct” by the end of the century. Global leaders have set targets to make sharp reductions in emissions from burning fossil fuels, but they continued to increase last year."
KFLI21DPFA_XVLIV0EMQSF476T,Tom Priestley obituary,Ryan Gilbey,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/jan/25/tom-priestley-obituary,"Tom Priestley, who has died aged 91, knew early on that he wanted a career in the arts. “But my father had covered so much territory, there wasn’t much left,” he said. He was the sixth child and only son of the playwright and novelist JB Priestley.
The discipline he eventually chose, and excelled at, was film editing. He won a Bafta for Morgan: A Suitable Case for Treatment (1966), Karel Reisz’s dark comedy about conformity and rebellion, starring David Warner and Vanessa Redgrave. He was also nominated for an Oscar for John Boorman’s thriller Deliverance (1972), with Burt Reynolds and Jon Voight. It was adapted by James Dickey from his own novel about four friends who are terrorised by Appalachian locals while on a canoeing trip.
Boorman recalled showing a rough cut of the film to executives at Warner Bros: “The response was one that I got used to, which is that people just walked out without saying a word. People were sort of devastated by it.”
Priestley finessed the film’s air of tension and discomfort, not least in three unforgettable scenes that loom large in the history of suspense cinema: the tense “duelling banjos” encounter, the harrowing ambush during which one of the men is raped at knife-point, and the shock ending, which gives both movie and audience an electrifying jolt after the action has seemingly concluded.
He was also alert to moments of spontaneity. “A lot of the river stuff was in effect improvised because they were actually doing it,” he pointed out. “Let’s say the canoe going down a rapid might unexpectedly twist round or somebody’s hat would fall off – we incorporated that into the final cut.”
Priestley edited Boorman’s previous film, Leo the Last (1970), a class satire set in west London and starring Marcello Mastroianni. He worked again with the director on the ill-starred horror sequel Exorcist II: The Heretic (1977) after the original editor resigned.
His other films include Peter Brook’s Marat/Sade (1967), The Great Gatsby (1974) starring Robert Redford and Mia Farrow, The Return of the Pink Panther (1975), Roman Polanski’s Thomas Hardy adaptation, Tess (1979), and the teen-punk drama Times Square (1980).
For the director Michael Radford, Priestley edited Another Time, Another Place (1983), a wartime love story set in Scotland; an adaptation of George Orwell’s 1984, released in that year and featuring Richard Burton’s final film performance; and White Mischief (1987), inspired by a real-life murder case among the British upper-class in colonial Kenya.
Priestley’s philosophy of editing prized “the continuity of emotion” over the more conventional kind.
He was born in London and spent his early years there in a house previously occupied by Coleridge, and at a home in the Isle of Wight. His mother, Mary (nee Holland), known as Jane, was previously married to the humorist DB Wyndham Lewis. She was a keen ornithologist who later co-authored several books on birds with her third husband, David A Bannerman. The Peter Pan author JM Barrie was Tom’s godfather. His first encounter with one of his father’s plays came when he was taken as a baby to rehearsals of Dangerous Corner.
He described his early childhood as “a traditional upper middle-class nursery life … There was a nanny who looked after me and my younger sister. We were a separate group. If there were no guests, then we were allowed down for Sunday lunch.”
At the age of eight, he was sent to Hawtreys, a Kent boarding school, where he was permitted to listen to his father’s wartime broadcasts, Postscripts, on the radio. Growing up, he was accustomed both to his father’s frequent physical absences (he never visited him at school) and a certain emotional remoteness when they were together. “To be perfectly honest, he liked women,” he said. “I suspect they were more important to him than I was.”
He went to Bryanston school in Dorset, then completed his national service with the Royal Engineers. He read classics and English at Cambridge, where he ran a play-reading club attended by EM Forster. After graduating, he spent a year teaching English in Athens.
Returning to London, he got a job as an assistant film librarian at Ealing Studios, and moved into sound work. His first credit was as assistant sound editor on Dunkirk (1958). He was also sound editor on Polanski’s claustrophobic horror Repulsion (1965), though by this time he had moved into film editing.
He was an assistant editor on Bryan Forbes’s Whistle Down the Wind (1961), about three children who mistake an escaped convict (Alan Bates) for Jesus, and Lindsay Anderson’s This Sporting Life (1963), starring Richard Harris as a brutish rugby player. He was the supervising editor on two surreal and highly original state-of-the-nation dramas: Anderson’s O Lucky Man! (1973), with Malcolm McDowell as a coffee salesman travelling through an increasingly bizarre and hostile Britain, and Derek Jarman’s punk gem Jubilee (1978), featuring a time-travelling Elizabeth I.
In the early 1990s, Priestley quit editing, having “reached the point when I felt I had achieved all I could … I was only using part of myself, and life seemed to consist of the flickering images I saw in the lens of my editing machine. Instinct told me I needed to get out more into the world and reach out to people.”
This he did by teaching at the National Film and Television School, and by promoting his father’s life and work. He had already made a documentary about him, Time and the Priestleys, which was intended as a 90th birthday tribute but became an obituary instead when his father died shortly before broadcast in 1984, at the age of 89. He administered his father’s estate for the rest of his own life, helping to organise events around his centenary in 1994, as well as becoming president of the JB Priestley Society.
Tom was a stylish dresser, even a dandy. To celebrate his Oscar nomination in 1973, the Evening Standard ran a double-page spread on his wardrobe. “He’s confident of his own style, rarely self-conscious, liberated even,” the paper reported, praising the Moroccan kaftan he wore “instead of a dressing gown” and the “hooded Arab cape … when eating out locally” as well as his “winter moustache” and “Byronic” hair.
His appearance was a minor source of friction with his father. “It would be going too far to say he was jealous of me,” he told the Oldie in 2016, “but he was deeply offended by my jeans.” He was also “disappointed” to discover Tom was gay, and found it “difficult to adjust to”. Tom’s response: “Well, so did I.”
He is survived by 16 nieces and nephews.

KGYOMQP63A_K5ZJS2RGTLMZKDB,Christopher Kapessa’s family call on CPS to review decision not to charge suspect,Steven Morris,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/22/christopher-kapessa-died-as-a-result-of-dangerous-prank-inquest-finds,"The family of a black boy who drowned in a Welsh river has called on the Crown Prosecution Service to take action against an older white boy after a coroner ruled he had deliberately pushed the younger teenager into the water.
Relatives of Christopher Kapessa said their four-and-a-half year campaign for justice had been vindicated by the assistant coroner David Regan’s conclusion that the 13-year-old was pushed into the river as a “dangerous prank”.
The CPS found in 2020 there was evidence to support a prosecution for manslaughter but decided it was not in the public interest to charge the suspect – who was 14 at the time, and can be named for the first time as Jayden Pugh – taking into consideration factors such as his age and his good character.
Christopher’s relatives and anti-racism campaigners say if a black child had pushed a white child into the river with fatal consequences, the CPS would have prosecuted. They have accused the CPS and South Wales police, who at first treated Christopher’s death as a pure accident, of institutional racism.
Speaking outside the coroner’s court in Pontypridd, south Wales, after the inquest, Christopher’s mother, Alina Joseph, said: “I am haunted by the injustice our family endured throughout the police investigation into Christopher’s death. From the outset they had made their decisions on what had happened to Christopher. They had a biased view of me as a black single mother living in the valleys.
“I was a victim of the institutional racist practices of South Wales police. I deserve better. Christopher deserves better. The decision not to prosecute despite sufficient evidence is something I wouldn’t wish on any mother or any family. The coroner’s conclusion has confirmed today what I have always suspected and now know was actually clear right from the beginning: Christopher was pushed to his death without any warning.”
She said she cherished the memories of her son. “Christopher will always be remembered for bringing immense joy and happiness to me and everyone he met. We only wish he was here now for us all to tell him how much we love him.”
He would have celebrated his 18th birthday this month. Joseph said: “I wonder every day what he would look like now and what he would have been doing. I know he would have been fulfilling his dreams and aspirations.”
Daniel Cooper, a solicitor with the law firm Imran Khan & Partners, who represents Joseph, said: “The coroner’s findings were clear and unambiguous: Christopher was deliberately and intentionally pushed in the back from behind. The push was capable of being an intentional, unlawful act that caused Christopher’s death.
“We believe [the CPS] has an obligation to review their decision. In our view the reasons for prosecuting have become more compelling. The suspect is now an adult as are many of the children.”
During the two-week inquest, four children said they saw Pugh push Christopher, who was not a good swimmer, from a ledge at a bridge over the River Cynon about 2.4 metres (8ft) above the water. Pugh, now 19, told the inquest that he “fell into” Christopher, accidentally causing him to fall.
In his closing submissions, Michael Mansfield KC, for Christopher’s family, argued that the coroner should conclude the boy had been unlawfully killed. But the coroner opted to return a narrative conclusion, arguing that this would give more clarity.
Regan said: “Christopher was deliberately pushed in the back from behind by Jayden Pugh using his hands.” He added that he was satisfied that Pugh realised there was a risk in what he did.
Though he expressed concern about racist abuse Christopher and his family had faced in Wales, the coroner found there was no evidence that his death was caused by a racially motivated attack.
Regan said Pugh had not been honest, pointing out that he initially claimed Christopher had slipped into the river before changing his story.
In his closing submissions, David Hughes, representing Pugh, claimed a false narrative had developed that his client was a “racist killer” and said his adolescence had been “overshadowed” by this.
He said, as a Welsh person, he felt “vicarious” shame at the racism Christopher’s family had suffered after arriving in the country from London in 2011. But he said: “The fight against racism is not advanced by making Jayden a scapegoat.”
The CPS insists there was no racism in its decision. Jenny Hopkins, chief crown prosecutor for CPS Cymru, said: “Each case is different and the CPS’s role is to make an independent assessment on whether to bring a prosecution, not to determine the innocence or guilt of a suspect.
“We have always made clear the reasons why our test was not met to charge anyone in connection with this heartbreaking case.” She said the decision not to prosecute was upheld as lawful at a judicial review.
Danny Richards, assistant chief constable at South Wales police, said the force made a referral to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), which he said examined the force’s “initial response and investigation into the circumstances surrounding Christopher’s death.
“We hope that this independent scrutiny and the outcome of the inquest proceedings will give us a greater understanding of the issues which have been raised about this case.”
The IOPC said there were “some shortcomings” in the way the force dealt with Christopher’s family, adding: “In particular officers’ communication with them could have been better.”
It said one officer’s approach during a meeting in which the family voiced concerns about possible racism by the force was “ill-judged and insensitive, particularly taking into account the upset and distress the family were experiencing”. The IOPC recommended management action for the officer involved, with additional training on dealing with bereaved families, equality and diversity, and unconscious bias.
But the watchdog said it did not believe Christopher’s family were treated less favourably by the police because of their race."
KH82XCIRIH_M1XJ0MD7NQT67BW,Republican who said she held Trump accountable for January 6 endorses him,Martin Pengelly,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/22/nancy-mace-trump-endorsement-january-6,"The Republican South Carolina congresswoman Nancy Mace faced widespread accusations of hypocrisy after she endorsed Donald Trump – the presidential candidate she previously said she held “accountable” for the January 6 attack on Congress.
On Monday, Mace announced her endorsement, a day before the New Hampshire primary, in which Trump enjoys comfortable polling leads over the former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, his only remaining opponent.
“I don’t see eye to eye perfectly with any candidate,” Mace said. “And until now I’ve stayed out of it. But the time has come to unite behind our nominee.”
Saying “it’s been a complete shit show since [Trump] left the White House”, the congresswoman said the US “needs to reverse all the damage Joe Biden has done”. Trump, she said, would be better on the economy, immigration and national security.
“Donald Trump’s record in his first term should tell every American how vital it is he be returned to office,” Mace said.
“Good Lord,” said Adam Kinzinger, an Illinois Republican who sat on the House January 6 committee then quit Congress over his opposition to Trump. “Nancy Mace is just the worst.”
At present, Trump faces 91 criminal charges (17 for election subversion), attempts to keep him off the ballot for inciting an insurrection and assorted civil trials. Still, he has dominated the Republican primary, winning comfortably in Iowa last week.
Observers were quick to point to what Mace made of Trump at the end of that term, in the aftermath of January 6.
On that day, supporters Trump told to “fight like hell” to block certification of his defeat by Biden attacked Congress, seeking lawmakers to capture and possibly kill in a riot now linked to nine deaths, more than 1,200 arrests and hundreds of convictions.
“Everything that he’s worked for … all of that, his entire legacy, was wiped out yesterday,” Mace told CNN on 7 January 2021. “We’ve got to start over.”
On 11 January, Mace said: “We have to hold the president accountable for what happened. The rhetoric leading up to this vote, the lies that were told to the American people – this is what happens, rhetoric has real consequences. And people died.”
Trump was impeached a second time for inciting the Capitol attack.
On 13 January, Mace said on the House floor she would vote against impeachment but added: “I believe we need to hold the president accountable. I hold him accountable for the events that transpired for the attack on our Capitol last Wednesday.”
While 10 House Republicans voted to impeach Trump, he was acquitted at his Senate trial when enough members of his party stayed loyal.
Trump turned against Mace, endorsing a primary rival in her district in South Carolina. Mace fought off the challenge – with campaign help from Haley.
Also on Monday, Steve Benen, an MSNBC producer, said: “Remember when Trump called Nancy Mace ‘absolutely terrible’ and tried to end her career? And when Nikki Haley scrambled to rescue her? A lot can happen in 18 months.”
Mace is not the only senior South Carolina Republican to desert the former governor: the US senator Tim Scott, who Haley appointed in 2012, endorsed Trump on Friday.
Jose Pagliery, a politics reporter for the Daily Beast, pointed to another widely remarked irony in Mace’s decision to endorse Trump this week, writing: “Rape survivor Nancy Mace just endorsed Donald Trump in the middle of his second rape trial.”

In April last year, on CBS’s Face the Nation, Mace discussed both her work to improve the processing of rape kits by law enforcement and her support for exceptions for victims of rape or incest in abortion bans passed in Republican states.
She also said: “I am a victim of rape, I was raped by a classmate at the age of 16. I am very wary and the devil is always in the details, but we’ve got to show more care and concern and compassion for women who’ve been raped.”
In August, a New York judge dismissed a counterclaim by Trump in a defamation suit brought by the writer E Jean Carroll over her claim that Trump sexually assaulted her in a department store changing room in the 1990s.
Explaining why the jury decided Trump “sexually abused” Carroll but did not endorse Carroll’s claim that he raped her, Lewis A Kaplan discussed the difference, under New York law, between forcible penetration with the penis or with fingers.
The jury said Trump did the latter to Carroll. Kaplan, however, wrote: “Mr Trump did in fact ‘rape’ Ms Carroll as that term is commonly used and understood in contexts outside of the New York penal law.”
The case has now reached a second trial, though a hearing scheduled for Monday was postponed due to juror illness.
A representative for Mace did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Speaking to Fox News, Mace said Haley had been a “great governor” but voters in her South Carolina district were “overwhelmingly with Donald Trump”.
“People want the primary to be over,” Mace said, pointing to an eventuality most pundits expect sooner rather than later, given Trump’s leads over Haley in New Hampshire, South Carolina (the third state to vote) and elsewhere.
Mace also said that for voters in her district, “women’s issues” including abortion were “gonna be really important in the 2024 cycle”."

Sergei Lavrov, Russian foreign minister, told the security council that peace plans presented by Ukraine and the west were “a road to nowhere”. US deputy ambassador Robert Wood countered that it was Vladimir Putin’s “single-minded pursuit of the obliteration of Ukraine and subjugation of its people that is prolonging” the war that began with Moscow’s 2022 invasion.
The Turkish parliament’s general assembly will debate Sweden’s Nato membership bid on Tuesday, three sources from parliament said. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has been blocking Sweden’s membership to extract concessions from Sweden and other Nato members. The parliament’s foreign affairs commission has approved the bid, raising hopes that it will be approved by the full parliament and signed into law by Erdoğan.
A Mexican border security deal in the US Senate is being finalised in a painstakingly negotiated compromise aimed at unlocking Republican support to replenish US wartime aid for Ukraine. But far-right House Republicans under the sway of Donald Trump have indicated that they want to block any bipartisan deal in order to hamper Joe Biden’s prospects for re-election as president – even if it leaves chaos at the US-Mexico border. “Let me tell you, I’m not willing to do too damn much right now to help a Democrat and to help Joe Biden’s approval rating,” Troy Nehls, a Texas Republican, told CNN.
Moderate Republican congressman Dan Crenshaw has criticised Maga Republicans not willing to work with Biden on border security and Ukraine aid. Crenshaw told MSNBC that some Republicans were saying “we’ll never vote for it if it’s attached to Ukraine aid. Really? We get meaningful border policy with the Ukraine aid and you’re not going to vote for that? You want Russia to win more than you want border policy changes? Some people say Biden wants it now because it’s helpful to him politically? OK! I want border security, that’s what I told my constituents I would do for them. So if we can get that deal, that’s a no-brainer.”
EU foreign ministers have met to discuss support to Ukraine. With ministers focusing also on the situation in the Middle East, the bloc’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, insisted that Ukrainians should not worry and that the EU’s support for Kyiv would continue as strong as ever.
Borrell also said Ukraine “needs more and faster military support now”. Latvia’s foreign minister, Krišjānis Kariņš, said that “if we do not help Ukraine stop Russia now, it will be only all the more expensive for us later”.
Elina Valtonen, Finland’s foreign minister, said there was a need to fulfil Ukraine’s immediate defence needs, but that Europe also needed to ramp up its defence industry and capabilities.
Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, announced a proposal aimed at allowing ethnic Ukrainians and their descendants abroad to hold Ukrainian citizenship.
Zelenskiy said he had “very productive talks” with Poland’s prime minister, Donald Tusk, who visited Kyiv. The Ukrainian leader said the two countries would be able to resolve problematic issues. Tusk underlined that Warsaw and Kyiv would work in a spirit of friendship to resolve differences.
Denys Shmyhal, Ukraine’s prime minister, said that he “discussed the free movement of goods across the border” with Tusk and that the sides agreed to resume intergovernmental consultations.
There is movement toward a meeting between Zelenskiy and Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, a senior Ukrainian official has said.

KKS2KVJRRO_U87CXK003WQM3M3,More than 2m UK prepay meter users to be cut off from gas or electric this winter,Jillian Ambrose,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/jan/23/uk-prepay-meter-users-cut-off-gas-electric-this-winter,"More than 2 million people across the UK will be cut off from their gas and electricity this winter because they cannot afford to top up their prepayment meters, according to Citizens Advice.
The charity said it had made the estimate for what is expected to be its busiest winter ever for helping people who cannot afford to top up, after last year 1.7 million people were disconnected at least once a month. About 800,000 people went more than 24 hours without gas and electricity, unable to make a hot meal or take a warm shower, because they could not afford to top up.
In addition, more than 5 million people who are billed by their supplier are in debt, putting them at risk of debt collection or being forced to fit a prepay meter.
Dame Clare Moriarty, the chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: “Our frontline advisers are helping more people than ever who can’t pay their energy bill. Record numbers are in debt to their supplier and millions with a prepayment meter are too often going without heating and hot meals because they can’t afford to top up.”
Citizens Advice has predicted that the crisis will worsen in the coldest months of this year, just as some suppliers have been allowed to restart forcible installations of prepayment meters.
Energy suppliers were banned last year from force-fitting prepayment meters for elderly people and those with infant children after it was revealed that British Gas had been breaking into people’s homes to fit them at the height of the energy crisis.
“The government has not provided new energy bill support for those in need and has run out of time to develop the long-term approach it promised by April 2024. Without immediate action, we risk re-running this same crisis every winter,” Moriarty said.
Citizens Advice is particularly worried about households with children under four, who are twice as likely to be in debt and be unable to top up their prepay meter than those without children.

KLMX010JNT_ITYOVZNWDUFDRJY,"UK should consider raising defence spending, says US navy secretary",Dan Sabbagh,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/jan/25/uk-should-consider-raising-defence-spending-says-us-navy-secretary,"Britain should be prepared to review the size of its armed forces given the crisis in the Middle East and the threats from Russia and China, a member of the Biden administration has said during a visit to London.
Carlos Del Toro, the US navy secretary, said the UK needed to consider more investment in its navy and reinforcing the army – a day after the head of the British army warned it was too small to fight an all-out war without conscription.
Asked specifically about whether the US had concerns that Britain’s armed forces had become too small, Del Toro said: “I think it’s important for the United Kingdom to reassess where they are today, given the threats that exist today.”
Although US leaders often call for European countries to increase their defence spending, pointed comments about the UK military are rare because of the closeness of the two countries’ military relationship.
The US and UK are engaged in what is likely to be an extended bombing campaign against the Houthis, designed to stop the Yemeni group’s attacks on merchant shipping. However, Del Toro indicated there was no immediate need for Britain to step up its contribution.
A shortage of sailors has forced the Royal Navy to decommission two ageing frigates, HMS Westminster and HMS Argyll, reducing its total to nine – while army numbers, at 73,520, are at the lowest level since the period after the end of the war of Spanish succession in 1714.
Del Toro, speaking at the Royal United Services Institute, said the UK had to make a “decision around whether the army needs to be strengthened” and said that the conflict in the Red Sea demonstrated the need for further spending to protect commercial shipping.
“I would argue quite frankly that, given the near-term threats to the UK and the US, then investments in their [the UK’s] navy are significantly important.” That would “ensure that we have this free flow of trade” which “the economy of the United States, allies and partners can mutually benefit from”.
Any decision to spend more on the UK armed forces would be a matter for the British government, Del Toro said, but “we in the United States have continued to make significant investments in our national security” amid economic challenges.
The US is easily the world’s largest military spender, with a budget of $877bn (£690bn), according to figures compiled by the Economist. Despite recent cuts the UK is the sixth largest in dollar terms, spending £53bn in the current year.
Del Toro said he was satisfied with the UK’s naval involvement in the Red Sea. Britain has deployed a destroyer, HMS Diamond, which specialises in shooting down drones and missiles. The British were “doing exactly what’s best, which is act as the protective umbrella providing air defence capabilities”.
Asked whether the US could widen its operations to attack Iran, which it says provides the Houthis with drones and missile components, and intelligence and surveillance, Del Toro said: “Nothing is off the table.”
This article was amended on 26 January 2024. HMS Diamond is a destroyer, not a frigate as an earlier version said."
KQ4ZFCFHSX_NWER3LCEL262SPO,"‘More killing won’t bring back lost lives’: Tal Mitnick, 18, on going to prison instead of joining IDF",Michael Segalov,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/23/israel-man-jailed-refuse-serve-idf-military-tal-mitnick-interview,"On Tal Mitnick’s first morning inside an Israeli military prison last month, he was ordered into a small classroom. Pinned to its walls were various famous quotes. One caught his attention: “Education is the most powerful weapon you can use to change the world.” The name beneath it: Nelson Mandela.
“I nearly laughed to myself,” says the 18-year-old, speaking over Zoom from the bedroom of his family’s Tel Aviv home. “A military upholding apartheid putting that on their wall,” he says, “while South Africa was preparing its case against Israel for the international criminal court? I pointed out how ridiculous this quote being there was. No other prisoners engaged or agreed. I realised how alone I was.”
In late December, Mitnick refused his mandatory draft to join the Israel Defense Forces. As a result, a military court sentenced him to 30 days in custody, making him the first conscientious objector to be jailed in Israel since 7 October. He spoke to the Guardian late on Friday afternoon, one day after his release. Over the weekend, Mitnick spent time with friends and family and attended an anti-war march. This freedom will be short-lived. “I’ve already had my draft order from the army for Tuesday morning. Again, I’ll go to the military base and tell them I refuse to serve. Again, I’ll be sent to jail.” On Tuesday morning, Mitnick was sentenced to a further 30 days in prison.
No policy dictates how long this cycle might continue. Often refusers spend stints totalling 100 days or more locked away, after which the IDF eventually concludes they’re unfit for service.
Mitnick’s last enlistment date was 26 December 2023. “I was due to enlist that day, yes, but so were many others. My peers were there – with their mothers, fathers and siblings, too, all knowing they were sending their children off to maybe risk their lives.” He counted other conscripts in their hundreds. “Seeing someone else there, in this case me, refusing to do the same? It creates clashes. A lot either ignored me and kept walking, or said just a few words as they passed. They’d call us traitors, say it should have been me in Be’eri.”
A small protest had been organised by Mesarvot – a network supporting refuseniks – to show support for Mitnick outside the Tel HaShomer military base, his conscription location. Friends and family were also more understanding. “They know what I want is moderate, non-violent and peaceful,” he explains, “even if my outlook isn’t the norm here.”
Mitnick said he had known he wouldn’t serve for many years. While he studied maths and computer science at school, a teacher suggested his natural aptitudes would suit a role in an elite intelligence unit. “So I looked into it more. Intelligence units, I learned, blackmail LGBTQ+ Palestinians and people needing health treatment in Israel into being informants. I started to see how the system is built on oppression. Once I realised this, I knew I had to not only refuse, but also work against it.”
The events of 7 October only affirmed his decision. “Israel has already lost this war,” he believes. “More killing and more violence won’t bring back the lives lost on 7 October. I know people are hurt. Traumatised. But this doesn’t make anything better. To root out extremist ideas from Palestinian society, we must root them out in Israel.”
And so, once inside the military base last month, Mitnick presented the recruitment officer with his ID. “I said: ‘No, I’m not doing this.’ I was yelled at, told I had no choice. I had to stand up for myself.” He was sent from commander to commander. “To each of them, I said the same thing: I believe there is no military solution to this conflict. I’m a pacifist.”
For first-time refuseniks, seven to 10 days is a standard sanction. On 26 December, Mitnick received 30 days to be spent at a prison just outside the town of Kfar Yona.
“I don’t see myself as the hero or anything,” he says, “while people are being massacred every day in Gaza. And I want to stress I’m by no means the only one. There are other anti-occupation activists. People opting to not join the army. Peace campaigners, young and old. But at the same time, I do think this takes bravery.”
Online, at least, some pro-Palestine voices have questioned the praise being poured on Mitnick, suggesting refusing to participate in the slaughtering of civilians is the very least to be expected. “There is a huge social consequence here for refusing to serve,” he says, “especially doing so publicly. Israeli society is so militarised that most conversations start with ‘Where did you serve?’ or ‘Where are you serving?’ When you say you didn’t, don’t or won’t, a gap opens up. I’m paying a price for this. I was born in Israel – I didn’t choose to live here. We have a test at 18, the country and system tests us to see if we’ll be complicit. I chose not to be.”
The events of 7 October shifted political paradigms inside Israel. “Even four months ago,” says Mitnick, “we were in the middle of the judicial reform protests.” He played an active part in the demonstrations. “The refusal movement was gaining traction. Now the supposed liberals, that protested judicial reform, are pilots massacring people in Gaza. People who were speaking out about government corruption are now supporting the far-right leadership, saying there are no civilians in Gaza.”
Hitpakhut is a term much-used in Israel today. “It means sobering up. Lots of Israeli liberals who were vaguely pro-peace are now for Gaza’s destruction. They say they were high, drunk on the fantasy of peace; now they’ve sobered up and say we have to kill the Palestinians.”
Prison life, for Mitnick, took some adjustment. “You’re treated like a soldier inside a military jail,” he says. “Staff aren’t called guards, but commanders. Some of the day is spent being told to stand in line for hours while they talk to you. Otherwise, you eat, clean your room, maybe rest. Then repeat, over and over.” Access to media was limited. “The only regular news source is the rightwing daily paper Israel HaYom,” he says. Occasionally, a news programme would air on his in-cell TV, although domestic broadcasters have all but ignored Mitnick and the wider anti-war movement. “The media is trying to manufacture consent to kill and massacre more and more,” is Mitnick’s explanation. “If they show my opinion, suggesting there’s another way, it undermines what the government is doing.”
Mitnick was reluctant to tell other inmates why he was inside. “I was mostly in prison with deserters. People who served in the military then didn’t come back. Mostly, that’s for socioeconomic reasons.” Few, if any, shared his political position. “I knew I couldn’t keep it a secret the whole time,” he says. “So I talked. Initially, I was called stupid and naive. Worse, too.”
But he had the conversations. “Humanising my opinion is important. One guy I got to know heard other prisoners talking about me behind my back, and then defended me. He told them I don’t support Hamas, I just want peace.”
In truth, Mitnick knows, his generation of Israelis doesn’t broadly agree. “Young people here are more rightwing than their parents,” he says. Peace activists have been arrested and face public condemnation.
“I still remain hopeful,” he says. “We don’t have the privilege to lose hope here. I hope more and more young people my age see that it’s not normal to live in constant fear of terrorist attacks, nor to enlist 18-year-olds into the army. Nothing here is normal, and we have the power to change that.”
On Tuesday morning, Mitnick returned to Tel HaShomer. He now faces another month in custody. “There’s no end date to this in sight,” he says, “which isn’t easy. Inside, I wasn’t counting down the days. Here, I’m not celebrating being out either. This is simply a step I have to take. At some point, they’ll have to release me.”"
KRDCKKGB9Z_AXCX42Q6B1E4JY5,"Yes, Trump is dominating the primaries. That doesn’t mean he’ll beat Biden",Robert Reich,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/23/trump-primaries-election-biden-robert-reich,"The mainstream media is flabbergasted at Trump’s success in sweeping the Iowa caucuses, dominating the polls and destroying all his rivals but Nikki Haley before Tuesday’s New Hampshire primary.
CNN is awestruck, calling Trump’s “landslide victory in Iowa” a “stunning show of strength”.
The New York Times is dumbfounded, talking of an “expected Trump coronation” and also the “power of his political machine”.
Time magazine marvels at his “commanding position” to secure the Republican nomination, and that “nothing has slowed him down”.
The Washington Post’s Dan Balz writes that “the end of any real competition could come very soon”.
Headline after headline offers the same breathless, spellbound story: “Trump is dominating.” “Disciplined”. “Ruthless”. “Hugely effective”. “Remarkable”.
Earth to the mainstream media: this is dangerous nonsense.
Why should Trump’s dominance be surprising? He’s dominated the Republican party since 2016. He dominates by ridiculing opponents, blasting anyone who stands in his way, bullying, browbeating and bellowing. The media eats it up. He’s outrageous and entertaining.
Trump’s success in last week’s Iowa caucuses wasn’t a “stunning show of strength”. It was a display of remarkable weakness. He got just 56,260 votes. There are 2,083,979 registered voters in Iowa. Fewer than 3% of Iowans voted for him.
According to an entrance poll, only 46% of the Republican caucus-goers considered themselves part of the Maga movement. Nearly 50% said they were not. Three-quarters of these non-Maga Republican voters opposed Trump.
Over 30% said they would not consider Trump fit to be president if he were convicted of a crime.
His performance in New Hampshire will probably reveal similar weaknesses.
What seems to be lost on the media is that Trump was president for four years. In effect, he’s the incumbent Republican president.
That’s not because he says he won the 2020 election. It’s because he was in fact president.
Former presidents have a huge advantage in their party’s primaries because they control their party apparatus. Presidents who have served just one term and seek the nomination for another are always re-nominated by their party, as was Trump in 2020 – and presumably will be again in 2024.

Of course Trump will be the Republican nominee. Trump was the party’s presumptive nominee before he even announced he was running again.
What’s remarkable is that he nonetheless attracted so many competitors for the nomination, who raised a lot of money for their primary runs. Tim Scott, Niki Haley, and Ron DeSantis finished September with a total of $26.7m available for use in the primary. That’s no small change.
It’s also easy to forget that Trump began his third bid for the White House just days after Republicans took a beating in the midterms. That was the third straight national election in which Trump was a drag on his party. Across the country, his hand-picked candidates, who embraced his big lie that the 2020 election was stolen, lost critical races.
The danger in the mainstream media’s awestruck coverage of Trump right now – making a big deal out of his winning the Iowa caucuses, dominating the polls, pushing out all rivals except Haley, and almost surely winning today’s New Hampshire primary – is that it creates a false impression that Trump is unstoppable, all the way through the general election.
But no one should confuse Trump’s performance in the Republican primaries for success in the presidential election.
When Americans actually focus on the presidential election and the stark reality of choosing between Biden and Trump, I expect they will once again choose Biden.
Even if Trump is not yet criminally convicted, I doubt that a majority of Americans will want for their president a man who has 91 criminal charges against him, who has been impeached twice, who has orchestrated an attempted coup, who has profited financially while president, who has stolen top-secret documents and who has been judged to be a rapist.

KU3BBYGLPG_GH2WPFPFMJXOJO3,"Average UK person has lost out on £10,200 since 2010, thinktank says",Richard Partington,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/22/average-uk-person-10200-worse-off-since-2010-thinktank-says,"People in Aberdeen are a total of £45,000 worse off since 2010 after suffering the worst growth performance in the UK over the last decade, according to a report exposing the dangers of dependency on the fossil fuel industry amid the climate crisis.
Warning that every part of the UK had been “levelled down” after years of weak economic growth, the Centre for Cities said the Scottish oil and gas capital had lost out the most of the 63 UK towns and cities it had analysed.
Aberdeen was one of the most prosperous places in Britain after an energy industry boom in the 2000s, with about a third of jobs in its export base – the part of the economy that trades with the rest of the UK and the world – directly related to oil and gas.
However, the granite city has suffered over the past decade from an energy sector slump amid the US shale oil revolution, highlighting the risks of being dependent on an industry exposed to increasingly volatile global shifts.
The Centre for Cities said near-stagnant progress across the UK since the Conservatives came to power in 2010 had left people with £10,200 less to spend or save on average than if the economy had grown at pre-2010 trends.
However, there were differences in the size of shortfall for some towns and cities, and Aberdeen had experienced a shortfall more than four times the national average.
The people of Burnley were also out of pocket; there, the average person was £28,090 worse off, while people in Cambridge and Milton Keynes were poorer to the tune of £21,000.
Highlighting Aberdeen’s boom and bust tendencies, the report said gross disposable income per head in the city was £45,240 lower on average than it would have been if the local economy had continued to grow at the rate seen between 1998 and 2010.

“Aberdeen has gone from being one of the best performers to [having] a pretty disastrous decade,” said Paul Swinney, the director of policy and research at the Centre for Cities. “All of this stems from over-reliance on one industry, which has knock-on effects.”
The report found that while an estimated 9,000 jobs had been lost in areas connected with oil and gas, this was likely to have affected the amount of money spent in the city and hurt other areas. The city suffered a 30% drop in retail jobs, compared with a 6% downturn nationally. House prices have also been hit, with prices only 3.4% higher in 2022 than in 2010, compared to a 50% rise nationally.
It comes as Rishi Sunak doubles down on anti-green policies to create a wedge issue with Labour before the general election, while pushing to advance North Sea oil and gas exploration to “max out” the UK’s reserves.
However, economists – including the former Bank of England governor Mark Carney – have warned that the strategy could cause Britain to fall behind its global competitors amid the transition away from fossil fuels, while leaving the nation too heavily invested in the “sunset industries” of the past.
Swinney said the UK had painful past experience of the transition away from industries including coal and shipbuilding during the 1970s and 1980s.
“Notwithstanding the shorter-term policies the government has announced, you would expect that oil and gas is not going to play as big a role in the next 50 years as it has in the last. The question for Aberdeen and the rest of the country is about the transition.”"
KUZR6HR3LL_YXKNGTWCQO7KRAC,Russia jails ultra-nationalist Putin critic and woman convicted of bomb attack,Pjotr Sauer,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/25/russia-jails-ultra-nationalist-putin-critic-igor-girkin-and-darya-trepova-bomb-attack,"Russian courts have jailed a prominent ultra-nationalist critic of Vladimir Putin and, separately, a woman convicted over a blast that killed a pro-war blogger.
In Moscow, a court sentenced Igor Girkin, a former battlefield commander of Russian proxy forces in east Ukraine who was convicted by a Dutch court over the shooting down of flight MH17, to four years in jail on extremism charges prompted by his criticism of the Russian war effort in Ukraine.
Girkin, who also goes by the nom de guerre Strelkov, was a leading military commander of the pro-Russian forces who occupied eastern Ukrainian cities beginning in 2014. His armed intervention backed by Russia marked the beginning of the conflict in Ukraine.
A former officer for Russia’s FSB security service, Girkin was arrested last summer in his apartment and charged with “calls for extremism” after months of public criticism in which he accused Putin of failing to pursue the war in Ukraine with enough vigour.
His arrest and subsequent jailing is seen as a sign that the Kremlin has decided to clamp down on any dissent, even among those who support Moscow’s invasion.
Girkin was previously found guilty in absentia by a Dutch court of the murder of 298 people onboard flight MH17, the plane shot down while flying over east Ukraine in July 2014.
The Dutch court gave him a life sentence for his role in sending a Buk surface-to-air missile system controlled by Russia to a field near the village of Pervomaisky from where it fired on the passenger jet. Russia has been accused of harbouring Girkin.
Piet Ploeg, who heads a foundation representing Dutch MH17 victims, said he had mixed feelings over Girkin’s sentencing on Thursday.
“It feels very double – he is jailed but not for the right reasons. He should be in a Dutch prison for his role in the MH17 shoot-down, and not for voicing his opinion,” Ploeg, whose brother, sister-in-law and nephew were killed in the MH17 crash, told the Guardian. “Unfortunately, he might never face the justice he deserves in the Netherlands.”
Since the start of Russia’s invasion, Girkin has emerged as one of the most prominent voices within a group of ultra-nationalist and pro-war bloggers who have taken to berating the Kremlin for its military failures in Ukraine.
On his Telegram channel, followed by more than 760,000 people, Girkin frequently accused the Kremlin of not going far enough in its war in Ukraine and called for a total mobilisation of Russian society and its economy to support the war effort.
Girkin also rallied against Putin, calling him a “nothingness who managed to throw dust in the eyes of a large portion of the population”, and he urged Putin to pass power “to someone truly capable and responsible”.
Some of Girkin’s rhetoric echoed that of the late Wagner head Yevgeny Prigozhin, who was similarly critical of Russia’s military leadership and the defence ministry.
Girkin was arrested a month after Prigozhin’s failed mutiny, in what many observers saw as a move by the Kremlin to crack down on influential ultra-nationalists after the Wagner uprising. Many of the pro-war commentators have since fallen in line with the Kremlin, toning down their critical rhetoric.
In a separate case on Thursday, a Russian woman was jailed for 27 years for delivering a bomb that exploded in the hands of a pro-war military blogger last year.
Darya Trepova, 26, was convicted by a St Petersburg court of charges including terrorism in connection with the death of the popular pro-war blogger Vladlen Tatarsky. Her sentence is one of the longest given to a woman in modern Russian history.
Tatarsky, whose real name was Maxim Fomin, was hosting a discussion with other rightwing commentators at a cafe on the banks of the Neva River in the historic heart of St Petersburg when he was killed.
Footage published at the time showed Trepova handing Tatarsky a statuette out of a box – a small figurine in his likeness and painted gold – followed by a large explosion.
Trepova claimed at the trial that she was set up, saying she did not know there was an explosive device in the bust and thought the statuette contained a listening device, not a bomb.
She said she was acting under orders from a man in Ukraine whom she knew as “Gestalt” (German for “shape”), who had been sending her money and instructions for several months. She pleaded not guilty to the terrorism charge.
Several Russian pro-war commentators have been targeted inside Russia since the start of the war. Moscow accused Kyiv of the murder of Darya Dugina, the daughter of an ultra-nationalist Russian ideologue, who was killed when a bomb blew up the Toyota Land Cruiser she was driving.
Ukraine has denied involvement in the killings."
KWYEH2LEVZ_H72LXC17VKLN3H6,Mirror publisher’s boss warns print titles could become loss-making in five years,Mark Sweney,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/23/mirror-publisher-print-titles-reach-digital,"The boss of the publisher of the Mirror, Express and Star newspapers has warned staff they have to face the “inconvenient truth” that its print titles will become loss-making in as soon as five years.
The chief executive of Reach, which also owns scores of regional titles including the Manchester Evening News, the Birmingham Mail and the Liverpool Echo, also maintained that the publisher has “significant resources” despite cutting almost 800 roles in the biggest annual cull of jobs in the newspaper industry in decades.
Jim Mullen, who has run Reach since 2019, told staff in the meeting that they had to face the ramifications of the fact its traditional print operations have declined by 17% annually over the past four years.
“Our biggest revenue stream is newsprint and the papers,” said Mullen, in an internal town hall video meeting with staff. “When I started I said there is at least 10 years of profitable business in newspapers and probably more. I have been in the business for five years so half of that is gone. There is probably five to seven years that we can look at. We have to face into this inconvenient truth.”
Mullen said the Mirror, which now sells about 230,000 copies daily, would be “pushing” 100,000 copy sales in five years at the current rate of decline.
However, Mullen said that the cost-cutting drive to move to a digital-first approach to increase online revenues – which last year declined by £21m year on year to £127.8m – would stabilise the profitability of the titles.
“At the moment print, the big brother, the big sister, is supporting the digital business,” he said. “At some point in the next five to seven years, which is where we have to think of, digital will get to a point where it will repay that debt and support the print business and keep those titles running. There is a future for our titles but the future is going to be different. The titles you are passionate about at some point get to a point where they will be of minimum use on paper but will [also] exist in other forms.”
Mullen said the costs associated with running print plants and distribution remain high even as copy sales fall, exacerbated by print ad revenues falling in line with reduced circulation, and that readership was “under attack every day” from factors including the shift to digital and the life expectancy of its mid to late-50s average readership.
“The big one we can’t avoid, that’s nature, we die,” he said. “So, we have tracked the mortality rate and the readers are basically dying over a period of time. Also you get to 75, that’s average mortality in the UK. This may sound really dry but it is important.”
He also told staff who expressed concern that the deep cuts are making it increasingly difficult to adequately cover the news comprehensively that it was a matter of “prioritisation”.
“I think we have significant resources, even though we have cut them,” he said. “The question is, the argument is, we are spread too thinly. We need to accept the fact people are going to be asked to do more. We need to talk about prioritisation.”
Mullen added that he had “never been involved in the editorial process” and how the cuts and “prioritisation” strategy is handled is up to editorial leadership.

While he added that the deep cuts form part of a plan to ensure that this year will be free of redundancies, he could “not guarantee” there would be no more job losses if unexpected market shocks cause a faster than planned commercial deterioration.
Mullen said the often-criticised overloading of webpages with ads and pop-ups is a fact of life as the business drives digital advertising to balance the decline in print.
“The user experience is really straightforward, we are ad funded,” he said. “I am as disappointed as anyone else that people don’t really want to pay for our content online. Not enough of them, nowhere near enough of them. Some people struggle particularly on the websites but if we did not put those ad blocks in and did not get additional revenue in then those cuts would have to be deeper.”
Asked about the strategy of flooding its websites with stories, Mullen indicated that reader engagement and the quality of articles did not drive revenues as much as volume of content.
“We are in the real world,” he said. “I need to get the page views, that is the way we sell advertising blocks, and advertising blocks deliver revenue. I know it is not ideal. We don’t talk about engagement and quality. We do, but it is not in the trading report.”
Reach declined to comment."
KZTPRSIY0R_H57NK6M6AOFJ2Y7,Jackdaw review – northeast crime thriller turns into anti-Get Carter of dullness,Peter Bradshaw,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/jan/24/jackdaw-review-northeast-thriller-turns-into-anti-get-carter-of-dullness,"It could theoretically be an enticing proposition: a moody crime thriller set in the north-east, with proven TV talent Jamie Childs making his feature directing debut. But this lands with a sickening thud: what we get is a charmless anti-Get-Carter of dullness, with all the strident geezer movie cliches that somehow stay stubbornly alive in British cinema. The action sequences are lifeless and often simply tedious, the characters are inert and unconvincing and there is some catatonically wooden acting.
Oliver Jackson-Cohen plays Jack Dawson, nicknamed “Jackdaw”; he is a biker and former motocross champ who has come back to his home town after a spell in the army. In need of cash, he rashly accepts a dodgy job from a criminal acquaintance in the club scene to pick up a hidden package. But this guy tricks Jack out of his payment and then kidnaps his vulnerable brother, and so over the course of one night Jack sets out to track down the bad guys, roaring through the night on his bike. Jenna Coleman plays Jack’s old flame Bo; Joe Blakemore is a lairy rave impresario and drug pusher called Silas and Rory McCann is sinister uber-villain Armstrong.
There are a couple of nicely composed shots, and Thomas Turgoose, playing a goofy guy called Craig hanging around the fringes of the criminal underworld, does at least put a tiny bit of pep into the proceedings – he manages to relax in a way that none of the other actors do. But none of these factors can make this come to life.

L0613ORWC2_7CH3ADWS8QA7HZV,Come and Get It by Kiley Reid review – juicy campus drama,Gabrielle Schwarz,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/jan/25/come-and-get-it-by-kiley-reid-review-juicy-campus-drama,"Reading Kiley Reid’s fiction feels a bit like watching a prestige TV series. There are expansive casts of characters, many of whom happen to be good-looking. The plots are pacy and compelling, motored by flashbacks and cliffhangers and twists, while also dealing with social issues – particularly race and class – that add intellectual heft. Dialogue is hyper-realistic, often written out phonetically (“Ohmygod” is a favourite) so that you can hear it aloud in your head. No wonder the screen rights for Reid’s debut novel, the Booker-longlisted Such a Fun Age, were snapped up before it hit the shelves in 2019. It will be a surprise if her sophomore effort, Come and Get It, doesn’t soon land a similar deal.
In Such a Fun Age, Reid explored the fraught relationship between a babysitter, Emira, and her employer, Alix. Chapters alternated between their perspectives as the two characters processed the fallout from an incident in a food store in Philadelphia where Emira, a Black woman, was accused of kidnapping Alix’s white daughter. In Come and Get It, Reid widens her scope: now there are three central characters whose lives intersect, personally and professionally, on the campus of the University of Arkansas. Agatha Paul is a writer in her late 30s who is appointed visiting professor for the 2017-18 academic year; Millie Cousins is a student living and working as a resident assistant on a campus dorm, supporting the other young people; Kennedy Washburn is a new student on Millie’s dorm.
At the start of the autumn term, Agatha hires Millie to help recruit students to interview for a book project. The plan is to talk to them about weddings, although Agatha’s interest quickly shifts to the broader topic of money and how young women think about it. Kennedy, meanwhile, is roommates with one of the interviewees – but it transpires she is also a big fan of Agatha’s break-out book, a study of grief and mourning. “It had been gifted to her only eight months ago,” Reid writes, “and yet the pages were impressively worn.” You get the sense Kennedy has a personal investment in the subject. She’s depressed and struggling to make friends, and seems to have developed a hoarding problem. The others have a lot going on, too: Agatha has just broken up with her long-term girlfriend and Millie is grappling with her post-graduation prospects.
As their stories unfold, the dynamics between characters grow increasingly charged with tensions stemming from differences in power and identity. Agatha, for instance, is rich and white, while Millie – one of the few Black students in the dorm – is in need of cash. But a more subtly interesting aspect of Come and Get It is the use of eavesdropping, that classic narrative technique for revealing secrets and gossip, to draw together the characters’ trajectories. When Teen Vogue asks Agatha to write a series spinning off from her student interviews, she realises she needs more material. Millie invites her to come and sit in her room on Thursday evenings, where Agatha can hear the conversations in the dorm and be “inspired”. What neither of them realises is that Kennedy, whose bedroom adjoins Millie’s, has her own ear pressed to the wall.
All this spying serves as good fodder for a sequence of sitcom-like pranks and hijinks; Reid is a talented comic writer. But it also raises deeper questions about how we view the lives of other people, as material for our own consumption. Are the attractions of books and TV so different from those of eavesdropping? In each case, we acquire an intimate knowledge of characters – real or not – that is one-way and driven, at least in part, by psychological curiosity. Agatha might be understood as a kind of surrogate for the reader: when she first meets her interviewees, who make a few outrageous and casually racist comments, she experiences a queasy mix of “intrigue and revulsion” – she knows she wouldn’t want to befriend these women but she has the urge to keep listening to them, by any means necessary. Over time, her attachment grows. Near the end of Come and Get It, when she overhears a scandalous piece of gossip, her eyes literally widen. “The feeling of being invested in their lives, it was thrilling and terrible,” Reid writes. The drama is just too juicy – how could anyone resist a binge?

L2UWB6JFAG_KXNFYQEQUYSTSEU,"Suspect, 14, hospitalised after rock attack on politician in South Korea",_,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/26/south-korea-rock-attack-bae-hyun-jin-seoul,"A 14-year-old boy who attacked a South Korean lawmaker with a rock has been sent to a mental health facility, police have said, as they continued to investigate the incident that left the politician, Bae Hyun-jin, with cuts to her head.
The suspect was arrested at the scene of the attack in southern Seoul on Friday and sent to a hospital after he was interviewed in the presence of his parents, said Cheon Young-gil, an official at Seoul’s Gangnam district police station.
Thursday’s attack came weeks after a man stabbed the opposition leader Lee Jae-myung in the neck in the southern city of Busan, raising further concerns about the country’s intensely polarised politics.
Security camera footage showed the suspect, wearing a grey skullcap and a mask, approaching Bae inside the hallway of a building and seemingly initiating a conversation before striking her with what appeared to be a small rock.
He continued to strike Bae with the object even after she fell down. The video shows Bae resisting alone, waving her arms and grabbing the teenager’s wrist, before another person appears and attempts to intervene.
Bae was taken to hospital where doctors said she had avoided serious injury. Her office released photos of her blood-spattered coat and sweater, which were reportedly presented to the police as evidence.
Cheon refused to discuss health details of the suspect. South Korea’s laws allow for emergency admissions in which a person suspected of mental illness can be hospitalised for a maximum of three days if there is concern that the person could inflict harm on other people or themselves.
“The emergency admission was based on consideration of the suspect’s age and his health condition,” Cheon said without elaborating. He said police could seek to extend the boy’s admission at the hospital after the initial three days if his parents agreed.
Bae, a former television news presenter, was elected in 2020 and is seen as a close confidante of the president, Yoon Suk Yeol. Yoon’s office issued a statement calling the attack on Bae an “unacceptable incident that must be sternly investigated”.
Park Sukh Que, a neurosurgeon at the Soonchunhyang University Seoul hospital, said Bae sustained minor head injuries including scratches and a cut and arrived in a stable condition. The force of the attack had caused Bae to fall on her back but there were no signs of a concussion or internal bleeding, Park said.
“Fortunately, the bleeding wasn’t very serious,” Park said at a news conference. “She does have a headache and she’s showing a bit of anxiousness after being shaken by the attack.”
The motive of the attack was not immediately clear.
The man who attacked Lee on 2 January told investigators after his arrest that he wanted to kill him to prevent him from becoming a future president. Lee was discharged from hospital after eight days of treatment.
“My scar is aching again after this unbelievable incident,” Lee said of the attack on Bae, calling it an act of “political terrorism” that must not be tolerated. “There needs to be a thorough and decisive response. We pray for a speedy recovery for lawmaker Bae and our hearts go out to her family.” .
Han Dong-hoon, the leader of the governing People Power party, called for a thorough investigation and for the attacker to be “sternly punished”.
Thae Yong Ho, another lawmaker from the party, described the attack as a “serious challenge” to South Korea’s democracy. “Politics of hate, anger and violence must be put to an end,” said Thae, a former North Korean diplomat who defected to South Korea in 2016."
L4PS7NLXL6_RNZ3OXT2W2I0XYG,The Houthis are not a group that can be bombed into extinction – here’s why,Amal Saad,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/23/houthis-hamas-israel-iran-axis-resistance,"The war launched by the “axis of resistance” against Israel and the US marks the first time in history that a coalition of non-state actors has collectively come to the defence of another non-state actor, namely Hamas.
Spearheaded by Iran, the axis includes Syrian militias, the Palestinian groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad, Lebanon’s Hezbollah, Iraq’s Popular Mobilisation Units (PMU) and Yemen’s Houthis or, to give them their official name, Ansar Allah. For the past three months, the latter three have taken the initiative, launching attacks on Israeli and US targets in support of their Palestinian allies.
But rather than acknowledge these groups as having motives and interests of their own, the US, UK and Israel continue to reduce them to a transnational network of Iranian proxies whom they believe can be threatened and bombed into submission, a point made clear by yet another wave of overnight airstrikes. This is a fundamental misunderstanding of the underlying dynamics within the axis and of the unshakeable unity of its members, all of which could make western powers’ intervention in the region even more costly.
Unlike traditional western coalitions, which are created ad hoc by like-minded states to fight a common threat without any long-term commitments, the axis of resistance began as an enduring alliance that developed into a wartime coalition. Since its inception, what bound the core members together was the mutual provision of military and political support to confront Israel. While Iran furnished Hezbollah, Hamas and other Palestinian groups with longstanding military and financial assistance, Syria offered its territory as a secure supply route for Hezbollah and as a safe refuge for Hamas’s leaders. For its part, Hezbollah provided technical and military training to Hamas, including bomb and tunnel-making expertise, and along with Iran, smuggled weapon-manufacturing technology to the West Bank and Gaza.
In 2013 the axis formed its first wartime coalition, in support of the Syrian state. Hezbollah officially intervened in that war and persuaded Iran to deploy its Revolutionary Guards to Syria, while the newly formed PMU followed suit, further expanding the axis.
Alongside the coalition’s role in Syria, Iran and Hezbollah directly intervened in Iraq in 2014 to assist the PMU in fighting Islamic State. The final addition to the axis were the Houthis, who received military and political assistance from Iran and, according to some reports, military training from Hezbollah, in their war with a Saudi-led coalition that started in 2015.
What makes the axis such a cohesive and durable alliance is its deep-seated ideological pillars and shared strategic objectives. All its actors subscribe to an anti-imperialist and anti-Zionist agenda, with the Palestinian cause as the focal point. Today, it shares two common aims: to force Israel into an unconditional ceasefire in Gaza, and to expel US troops from Iraq and Syria.
In pursuing these aims, the non-state actors in this alliance are acting in accordance with their own political beliefs and strategic interests rather than following Iranian diktat. While Iran has offered material support to the non-state actors within the axis, such assistance has not translated into the kind of exercise of power that characterises sponsor-proxy relationships. This view is shared by the US intelligence official Brian Katz, who has argued that Iran’s non-state allies “are no longer simply Iranian proxies. Rather, they have become a collection of ideologically aligned, militarily interdependent, mature political-military actors committed to mutual defence”. In essence, the nature of this alliance is organic and symbiotic, as opposed to transactional and hierarchical.
This was most recently demonstrated by Hamas’s surprise 7 October attack on Israel of which, according to Israeli and US accounts, Iran had no foreknowledge. Having said that, there does appear to have been a pre-planned “forward defence” strategy whereby Hezbollah, the Houthis and PMU groups would take the offensive and initiate strikes against Israel and the US should Hamas require such assistance. This strategy is being executed today by means of tactical military coordination, which is reportedly occurring within several joint operations’ rooms in various capitals across the region.
Within this strategy, Hezbollah assumes the role of battle management whereby it directs, plans and coordinates military operations across the different conflict theatres. Three battle arenas outside Gaza are being fought in sync: Hezbollah’s moderate-intensity war with Israel, the PMU’s attacks on US and Israeli targets in Syria, Iraq and Israel itself, and the Houthis’ attacks on cargo ships in the Red Sea and occasional strikes on Israel. All fronts are synchronised to pause when the fighting in Gaza is suspended, as demonstrated by the temporary truce in Gaza in late November.
An alliance characterised by such a high level of coordination, reflecting a unity of purpose and vision requires the US and its allies to radically alter their approach to this conflict. The assumption that “sustained” military action against these actors will break their will to continue fighting is as misguided as it is dangerous. On the contrary, military solutions that expand the scope of the conflict will only invite more coordinated responses from across the axis. Western leaders would do well to reflect on the reality that they are not merely trying to protect shipping routes, but are waging an unwinnable war on an ideologically united and tenacious alliance of powerful non-state actors.
The US and UK strikes on Yemen have only increased the prospects of a full-blown regional war, given that the Houthis have now threatened to widen the scope of their campaign to include “all US and UK interests” in the region. Yet the Lebanese-Israeli front remains the most flammable, considering that Israel is champing at the bit for a war with Hezbollah. As the latter is the most powerful non-state actor in the axis of resistance, if not the world, such a war would be the most far-reaching and mutually destructive. Nothing short of a ceasefire in Gaza can prevent the region from turning into a powder keg.

L55942W4PX_OWFZG7VTWQP3SWJ,Idris Elba argues against mandatory prison sentences for carrying a knife,Eleni Courea,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/25/idris-elba-argues-against-mandatory-prison-sentences-for-carrying-a-knife,"Idris Elba has argued against mandatory prison sentences for carrying a knife amid a deepening public discussion over how to tackle an “epidemic” of street violence.
The actor and campaigner said there was no “one size fits all” that would banish weapons, and warned against criminalising young men caught up in a cycle of violence.
His comments came the day after the family of one of the Nottingham stabbing victims, Grace O’Malley-Kumar, called for compulsory prison sentences for those caught carrying a knife.
The Home Office will put forward secondary legislation to tighten the ban on zombie-style knives in England and Wales, which was first introduced in 2016.
Previous attempts to ban the weapons defined them as having a cutting or serrated edge and “images or words that suggest [the knife] is to be used for the purpose of violence”. The new law, which will not come into effect until September, will also ban “zombie” knives that have no threatening words or images, the Home Office said.
The shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, who visited Milton Keynes on Thursday alongside Labour’s leader, Keir Starmer, said the ban “goes nowhere near far enough and it is also too little, too late”. She told broadcasters: “It doesn’t include ninja swords, it doesn’t include a whole series of dangerous weapons.”
Elba, who has long campaigned on the issue, met Home Office ministers on Wednesday to discuss the changes.
Speaking to BBC Breakfast, he said many young people carried knives because they were scared, because they had been stabbed or had seen someone else attacked. “He’s walking through a neighbourhood, and thinks I’m going to protect myself here – he ends up in jail for five years. You wonder, are we winning?” he said.
He added that a deterrent to make young people know that they would pay a penalty if they carried a knife was an important step, but that there were “gradients” to the issue.
“As a deterrent it’s a really important step to consider, but it’s not one size fits all,” he said.
On Wednesday, O’Malley-Kumar’s mother, Sinéad O’Malley, a consultant anaesthetist, said carrying a knife was no different to carrying a gun. “I believe there has to be mandatory prison sentences for carrying a knife. It is not just an offensive weapon or something you could eat your food with. It is a lethal weapon.”
In the same interview, her husband, Sanjoy Kumar, a GP, said knife crime in England was an epidemic and that existing legislation on the issue appeared “easy going”.
The court heard this week that O’Malley-Kumar, 19, had shown “incredible bravery” trying to defend her fellow student Barnaby Webber from Valdo Calocane before being fatally stabbed herself.
Amendments to the criminal justice bill will raise the maximum sentence for the possession of banned weapons from six months to two years. They will also give police the power to seize and destroy knives found in homes, if there are reasonable grounds to suspect they will be used for serious crime.
Labour said the government’s proposed changes had already been promised by six Conservative home secretaries and that closing “loopholes” was not going far enough.
The party plans to launch a programme of action plans for young people caught with a knife, which could lead to their being subject to curfews, tagging or behavioural contracts. Labour first made this announcement at their conference in the autumn.
Starmer vowed this week to ban ninja swords if Labour won the next election. The party also said it would launch a £100m Sure Start-style programme to tackle knife crime. Labour’s programme, called Young Futures, would require coordination of local services to identify those most at risk of falling into knife crime.The number of knife and sharp instrument crimes has risen by 5% in the last year, new Office for National Statistics data show, mainly driven by an increase in robberies.
There were more than 48,700 knife and sharp instruments crimes recorded by the police in the year ending September 2023, equivalent to 85 incidents for every 100,000 people in England and Wales.
That was up from 84 in the previous 12 months. However, the volume of knife crimes reported to the police remains below the pre-pandemic peak of 91 per 100,000 people in the year ending March 2020.
Although overall knife crime has risen by 5%, ONS data show a 19% increase in the number of robberies involving a knife or sharp instrument in the last year.
Rishi Sunak told broadcasters during a visit to North Yorkshire on Thursday that the zombie knife clampdown, combined with police stop and search powers, would make a difference.
The prime minister sidestepped a question on growing calls for those found in possession of a knife to face a mandatory prison sentence, saying only that “penalties and sentences for people carrying knives have gone up over time” under the Tories.
Elba put pressure on the government when this month he launched the Don’t Stop Your Future campaign to tackle youth violence. As well as a ban on zombie knives and machetes, the campaign is calling for more funding for youth services.
In the year ending March 2023 there were just over 19,000 cautions and convictions for possession of a knife or offensive weapon in England and Wales. In about 18% of cases the offenders were aged 10 to 17."
L8K64LZP1Y_XZTVO5UWHMKXIHT,The absurd 26 January debate overlooks that many on both sides want the same thing: a day of unity,_,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/26/the-absurd-26-january-debate-overlooks-that-many-on-both-sides-want-the-same-thing-a-day-of-unity,"It has been a little over 100 days since the Australian people voted against recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as the first peoples of our nation through the establishment of a voice to parliament.
While the yes case achieved more than 6.2 million votes of support, it was not enough to secure a successful result. As many supporters continue to feel the pain of the result, the norm of Indigenous issues resting at the bottom of the national consciousness has been reasserted at a devastating but unsurprising speed.
Unsurprising because, throughout the campaign, even a historic referendum on an Indigenous issue struggled to cut through other priorities on voters’ minds. We were acutely aware of the impact that cost-of-living pressures had on voters’ capacity to deeply consider the case for a voice.
Of course, that is not the only reason why we did not achieve the result we wanted but it is a sad irony that those Australians most deeply impacted by cost-of-living pressures and those who stood to benefit most from a successful vote – Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples living in remote areas – were the strongest yes voters at the ballot box.
This result, along with the massive yes volunteer movement and the significant uplift in awareness about the challenges facing Indigenous people, provide solid impetus for the ongoing movement for real justice for Indigenous people in our country.
The defeat of the moderate voice proposal only increases the urgency for change and will galvanise advocates to keep the pressure on. Those who proclaim the referendum result signals the stopping or unwinding of Indigenous progress gravely underestimate the resilience of this movement.
The contrast between the depth of this movement and the attempts to ignite plastic culture wars right now could not be starker. On one hand, the Uluru statement from the heart offered hope that “we believe this ancient [First Nations] sovereignty can shine through as a fuller expression of Australia’s nationhood”.
On the other, political and media elites have spent the last couple of weeks getting into a fabricated lather about whether cheap throw-away items should be stocked on supermarket shelves to mark Australia Day.
One of the most depressing aspects of the argument to keep Australia Day on 26 January is its smallness. The paucity of the notion that we have reached “peak pride” in our country.
Writing about 26 January, the former deputy prime minister John Anderson this week demanded that legislators should “have the courage to stand up and fight for an education system premised on gratitude for Western civilisation and the historically unprecedented free and prosperous lives it has afforded all of us in this great land”.
This is the problem. In 1788, 26 January was not a watershed moment of freedom and prosperity but the date six prison ships from a convoy of 11 arrived at Sydney Cove to create the penal colony of New South Wales.
To those who landed in shackles, it represented misery, estrangement from country, punishment and brutality. To those on the land who watched them arrive, it heralded war, their systematic murder and estrangement and dispossession from their own country. This, and the subsequent policies of exclusion, removal and incarceration, reverberate today and will continue for generations to come.
Other than as a monument to resentful jingoistic stubbornness, 26 January makes no sense as a date to celebrate our past, present and future sense of nationhood. Not only has the date shifted over the years, the nationwide acceptance of the date as a national holiday has only been in place since 1994.
Thirty years is barely a historical pattern let alone a sacrosanct tradition.
Perhaps the ultimate absurdity of this debate is that many “keepers” and “changers” want the same thing: a day of unity that allows for considered reflection and celebration of the many versions of what it means to be Australian.
It is increasingly obvious that 26 January will not achieve this but the longer the resistance to change, the greater the likelihood that further wedges are driven among us.
A nation confident in its commitment to freedom would also accept that for some, it is too soon or not possible to celebrate national unity. If the choice is the chance to work towards genuine unity versus an arbitrary adherence to 26 January, surely we can choose unity.

LDKC718KE1_XDS3D9TO0H21I8H,"Nicola Sturgeon called Boris Johnson a clown, UK Covid inquiry hears",Libby Brooks,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/25/nicola-sturgeon-called-boris-johnson-a-clown-uk-covid-inquiry-hears,"Nicola Sturgeon described Boris Johnson as “a fucking clown” as he broadcast to the nation to announce a second Covid lockdown in October 2020, telling her chief of staff: “His utter incompetence in every sense is now offending me on behalf of politicians everywhere.”
The former first minister’s damning verdict on the UK government’s communications strategy – which she dismissed as “awful … we’re not perfect but we don’t get nearly enough credit for how much better than them we are” – was revealed during evidence at the UK Covid inquiry, which is sitting for a second week in Edinburgh.
Asked if the expletive-laden exchange on WhatsApp suggested that the relationship between Sturgeon and the former prime minister had broken down, her former adviser Liz Lloyd replied: “I think broken down to a degree overstates what was there to break.”
Evidence also emerged on Thursday morning of what appeared to be detailed decision-making on pandemic restrictions and strategy being conducted by WhatsApp messages, in seeming contradiction of Sturgeon’s insistence that she did not conduct her government’s Covid response through informal messaging.
Lloyd, who served as chief of staff and strategic adviser between 2015 and 2023 and described herself as Sturgeon’s “thought partner”, was shown several exchanges, including one regarding the numbers allowed to attend weddings and another suggesting “a good old-fashioned rammy [quarrel]” with the UK government over furlough policy.
Usman Tariq, junior counsel for the inquiry, noted that Lloyd’s messages “were the first provided by anyone involved in the Scottish government’s response to the pandemic to this inquiry”.
Asked how the public would have been able “to understand how and why this decision was made” if Lloyd had deleted the messages, she responded: “They might not see the reflection but they would know the advice.”
Lloyd’s evidence follows a succession of revelations about how senior ministers and officials deleted informal messages and exhibited apparent disdain for freedom of information rules.
There was a furious response last week when the inquiry heard that Sturgeon “retained no messages whatsoever”, while the national clinical director, Jason Leith, joked in a group chat that WhatsApp deletion was his “pre-bed ritual”.
Sturgeon has since clarified that the inquiry does have messages relating to the pandemic, although they were not retained on her device, and insisted: “To be clear, I conducted the Covid response through formal processes from my office in St Andrews House, not through WhatsApp or any other informal messaging platform.”
Asked why Sturgeon deleted messages but she did not, Lloyd suggested that in the exchanges “I am the official so she may have had reason to think Liz is taking care of it”.
She said anything salient was put on the official government record and she was “not familiar” with the policy referred to by other Scottish officials that informal messages should be regularly deleted.
Lloyd was also questioned about an exchange with Sturgeon in which Lloyd wrote: “I think I just want a good old-fashioned rammy [with the UK government on extending furlough to Scotland in November 2020]. She described this as “an expression of frustration that we were not able to manage the pandemic at this point in time in the way we wanted”.
She said: “There were a lot of things in Covid the UK government did or didn’t do and we just let it go. I felt the issue of furlough was materially important to the handling of the pandemic – it was a hindrance to our ability to handle the pandemic.”"
LE0N276LZ8_PV7NNULFLPEW8SZ,Graphic novelist Posy Simmonds wins prestigious French comics award,Angelique Chrisafis,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/jan/24/graphic-novelist-posy-simmonds-wins-prestigious-french-comics-award,"The graphic novelist Posy Simmonds has won the Grand Prix at France’s Angoulême International Comics festival – the first time a British artist and author has been awarded the world’s most prestigious prize for lifetime achievement in comics.
Simmonds’s satirical observations on modern British society, interweaving detailed illustration with long literary texts, are held to have redefined the graphic novel genre.
She said of the award: “I was gobsmacked – époustouflée, as you would say in French … It’s extraordinary because if you’re writing or drawing, you work in a room on your own, and it’s then very extraordinary when the book, or your work, or you are given a lot of exposure.”
Simmonds, 78, whose work ran in the Guardian from the 1970s, is only the fourth woman to win the Grand Prix at the International Comics festival in Angoulême, which has been running for more than 50 years.
“I always think in a perfect world, the gender of a prize winner shouldn’t be remarkable,” Simmonds said. “But it’s an imperfect world and the comics and bande dessinée world has always been a masculine milieu, a bit of a boys’ club. But, bit by bit, especially over the last decade, women have infiltrated it, so I’m pleased to be one of them, of course.”
Simmonds began as a newspaper illustrator and started a weekly comic strip for the Guardian in the 1970s.
Her modern satire, Gemma Bovery, an updated reworking of the classic Madame Bovary by the French novelist Gustave Flaubert set among English expatriates in Normandy, was serialised by the Guardian in the 1990s.
Later, in 2005-2006, Simmonds’s Guardian series, Tamara Drewe, referenced Thomas Hardy’s Far From the Madding Crowd and explored the contrast between a country writers’ retreat and the reality of local rural life. Gemma Bovery and Tamara Drewe were both published as graphic novels and later turned into feature films.
In 2018, Simmonds’s graphic novel Cassandra Darke took as a starting point the character of Scrooge in A Christmas Carol, creating an antiheroine in the form of an art dealer living a Chelsea townhouse, entirely unbothered by other people’s opinions.
Simmonds has a big following in France, where she is known as “the queen of the British graphic novel” and has been described as a “subtle satirist” of modern times.
Her graphic work stands out not just for its piercing take on contemporary life, but also for the narrative and literary element in her texts, which have reworked female characters from 19th century literature. She has been described as an artist who “enjoys writing as much as drawing”.
Simmonds grew up in Berkshire, but her mother’s family had Huguenot roots in France. At 17, she studied French at the Sorbonne, and said France had influenced her.
She said: “When I arrived in Paris at 17, I couldn’t speak French. I could write it but couldn’t speak it. I addressed a gendarme as ‘tu’ and used ‘vous’ for dogs. But I picked it up quite quickly and of course I loved being in France. It was in the early 1960s, when things were still a bit sad in Britain, where the food wasn’t great, and suddenly being immersed in a place where you’d got real coffee and the food was terribly good, I had a wonderful time. So I think my connection to France dates from that. I had a total immersion, going to galleries and libraries and walking everywhere.”
She said that at first she had worried how Gemma Bovery, her reworking of Flaubert’s classic, would be received in France.
“I wanted to take the story of Madame Bovary but update it and it would be my story,” she said. “When it was published in French, I was rather frightened. I was worried it would be seen as lèse-majesté that I had appropriated this great French classic. But they really liked the book, which was wonderful.”
She said: “It was quite a different shape from French format and also I wrote a lot and I remember the French saying: ‘Gosh there’s a lot of text in your graphic novel’ – that was thought to make it a bit of a hybrid, not a classic form. But they liked it.”
The Angoulême Grand Prix comes as the Bibiliothèque Publique d’Information at the Pompidou centre in Paris is holding a major retrospective of Simmonds’ work, including unpublished, drawings, sketches and sketchbooks – from her press illustrations to her graphic novels and children’s books.
Simmonds, who is based in London, said she was working on a new project.
She said: “It’s early stages, so it’s in sketchbooks and I write little scenes … it’s on the stove, being cooked, but I may be some time.”

LFWQ5T59SS_ACPLRHJX9TTNOGQ,Donald Trump ordered to pay E Jean Carroll $83.3m in defamation trial,Victoria Bekiempis,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/26/e-jean-carroll-damages-trump-defamation-trial,"A New York City jury awarded $83.3m to E Jean Carroll in her defamation trial against Donald Trump on Friday.
Carroll will receive $18.3m in compensatory damages and $65m in punitive retribution. The former president is paying Carroll compensatory damages of $18.3m – $11m to fund a reputational repair campaign. The $7.3m is for the emotional harm caused by Trump’s 2019 public statements. Carroll and her legal team were beaming as they left court in a black SUV. They did not answer questions immediately after court let out.
Moments after the decision was announced, Trump decried it as “absolutely ridiculous” on Truth Social, and said he would be filing an appeal.
“I fully disagree with both verdicts, and will be appealing this whole Biden Directed Witch Hunt focused on me and the Republican Party,” Trump wrote. “Our Legal System is out of control, and being used as a Political Weapon. They have taken away all First Amendment Rights. THIS IS NOT AMERICA!”
The Manhattan federal court decision comes less than one year after Carroll won $5m in her sexual abuse and defamation trial against Trump.
This sum stems from Carroll’s rape claim against the president in a June 2019 New York magazine article. The publication ran an excerpt of her then-forthcoming book, What Do We Need Men For? A Modest Proposal.
In that excerpt, Carroll said that Trump raped her inside the dressing room of a luxe Manhattan department store around early 1996. The tenor of Trump’s denials – saying, for example, that she lied and was a political operative – became the subject of her 2019 defamation suit against him.
At the time, Carroll could not sue Trump over the alleged assault, as it would have taken place outside the civil statute of limitations. A novel New York state law in 2022, the Adult Survivors Act, opened a one-year window for adult accusers to file suit for incidents outside the civil statute of limitations.
Carroll filed another lawsuit, this one over the incident and defamatory statements after Trump’s presidency ended. This lawsuit proceeded to trial first and the judge in both cases, Lewis Kaplan, determined jurors’ findings – that Trump sexually abused Carroll and tarnished her reputation – would be accepted as fact in this trial.
As a result, Trump could not re-litigate her sexual abuse claim. The jurors were tasked only with weighing financial penalties for damaging Carroll’s reputation – and the sum required to keep Trump from making still more defamatory statements.
“I’m here because Donald Trump assaulted me, and when I wrote about it, he said it never happened,” Carroll said on the stand. “He lied, and it shattered my reputation. I expected him to deny it, but to say it was consensual, when it was not. But that’s what I expected him to say.”
She continued: “The thing that really got me about this was, from the White House, he asked if anyone had any information about me, and if they did, to please come forward as soon as possible, because he wanted the world to know what’s really going on – and that people like me should pay dearly.”
Trump did not attend Carroll’s first trial but made appearances at the second – marking the first time she confronted him publicly in a courtroom. Trump’s comportment during the courtroom showdowns was in keeping with his infamously bombastic behavior, prompting warnings from the judge.
“Mr Trump has the right to be present here. That right can be forfeited, and it can be forfeited if he is disruptive, which is what has been reported to me, and if he disregards court orders,” Kaplan warned.
“Mr Trump, I hope I don’t have to consider excluding you from the trial … I understand you are probably very eager for me to do that.”
“I would love it, I would love it,” Trump retorted with a gesture.
“I know you would, you just can’t control yourself in this circumstance, apparently,” Kaplan said.

The end stages of this trial were also marked by another hallmark of Trump’s legacy: Covid-related chaos. On 22 January, trial proceedings were postponed as one juror experienced coronavirus symptoms; his leading attorney, Alina Habba, also told judge Kaplan that she felt unwell and had been exposed to Covid.
Trump did take the stand on 25 January. Kaplan restricted the scope of her questions and his responses, as per his prior ruling that he could not re-litigate her claims.
Habba was allowed to ask: “Do you stand by your testimony in the deposition?”
“One hundred percent, yes,” he said, referring to the deposition in which he denied her claims.
“Did you deny the allegation because Ms Carroll made an accusation?”
“That’s exactly right. She said something, I consider it a false accusation. No difference,” Trump retorted. This sparked an objection from Carroll’s camp. Kaplan said that everything after “yes, I did” was stricken.
“Did you ever instruct anyone to hurt Ms Carroll in your statements?”
“No. I just wanted to defend myself, my family, and frankly, the presidency,” Trump said. Carroll’s team objected again. Kaplan deemed that everything after “no” be stricken, so jurors were ordered to disregard this statement.
In total, Trump’s direct and cross testimony lasted about two or three minutes."
LG6D5O7PLT_BAJ0GRSEAHKF2ER,Four men guilty of violent disorder at Merseyside asylum-seeker protest,Mark Brown,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/22/four-men-guilty-of-violent-disorder-at-merseyside-asylum-seeker-protest,"Four men have been found guilty of violent disorder at a protest outside a hotel providing temporary accommodation to asylum seekers.
A jury at Liverpool crown court watched footage showing crowds chanting “get them out” and throwing fireworks at a police cordon.
Three police officers were injured and a police van was set on fire during the demonstration outside Suites hotel in Knowsley, Merseyside, on 10 February last year.
At the time, 163 men were staying in the hotel while they awaited decisions on their asylum cases, the court heard.
The protest was said to have been organised by the English Defence League, although there was no evidence that the four men were members of a far-right group.
Brian McPadden, 61, Thomas Mills, 47, Paul Lafferty, 42, and Jonjo O’Donoghue, 21, all admitted being present on the night but denied violent disorder. A jury found them guilty on Monday after deliberating for more than six hours.
One member of the public left the court saying “you fucking bastards” after the first guilty verdict was returned.
Mills, who suffered two epileptic seizures during the trial, began to sob after the verdicts were returned and then fell from his seat.
The court was adjourned as medical assistance was given and an ambulance was called.
During the trial, the court heard that police were made aware on 9 February last year that a protest was expected to take place outside the hotel.
There was “ill feeling” locally after a video was shared on social media appearing to show an asylum seeker from the hotel asking a 15-year-old girl for her phone number and a kiss, the court heard.
The jury was told social media posts were made about the planned demonstration and leaflets were delivered.
On the Friday evening, members of a rightwing group and a leftwing group gathered outside the hotel.
DC David Williams told the court that at about 7pm a large group of people arrived at the hotel. He said: “At that time, it seemed that tensions changed somewhat.”
Footage showed crowds chanting “get them out” and throwing fireworks at a cordon of police officers while a police van burned.

Rocks and paving slabs were also thrown, with one police officer needing hospital treatment and another two suffering less serious injuries.
Mills could be seen in footage standing on top of the van before it was set alight holding a banner which read: “Let’s shout, get them out.”
McPadden was heard in the footage saying: “We protect our own, yous are not from Kirkby, we are. These are twats, the lot of them.”
Five other men pleaded guilty to violent disorder at earlier hearings and have not yet been sentenced.
Seven youths, aged between 13 and 17, have been sentenced after they admitted violent disorder. Six were given referral orders and one was fined.
Jared Skeete, 19, was sentenced to three years’ detention last April after he pleaded guilty to violent disorder, having thrown fireworks and snorted ketamine while shouting abuse at police.
Three women – Cheryl Nicholls, 44, Nicola Elliott, 52, and Jennifer Knox, 41 – were found not guilty of violent disorder halfway through the trial after the judge told the jury there was “insufficient evidence”.
A fifth defendant, Daniel Fulham, 39, was found on Monday to be not guilty of violent disorder and of a lesser offence of abusive or threatening behaviour with intent to provoke violence."
LJZ594FDWP_0BH7KWER5VGPKIS,"‘Anti-European’ populists on track for big gains in EU elections, says report",Jon Henley,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/24/anti-european-populists-on-track-for-big-gains-in-eu-elections-says-report,"Populist “anti-European” parties are heading for big gains in June’s European elections that could shift the parliament’s balance sharply to the right and jeopardise key pillars of the EU’s agenda including climate action, polling suggests.
Polling in all 27 EU member states, combined with modelling of how national parties performed in past European parliament elections, shows radical right parties are on course to finish first in nine countries including Austria, France and Poland.
Projected second- or third-place finishes in another nine countries, including Germany, Spain, Portugal and Sweden, could for the first time produce a majority rightwing coalition in the parliament of Christian Democrats, conservatives and radical right MEPs.
The analysis should “serve as a wake-up call for European policymakers about what is at stake” in the election, said the political scientists Simon Hix and Kevin Cunningham, who co-authored the report for the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR).
The researchers said the implications of the vote were far-reaching, arguing the next European parliament could block laws on Europe’s green deal and take a harder line on other areas of EU sovereignty including migration, enlargement and support for Ukraine.
Domestic debates could also be affected, they said, bolstering the “growing axis of governments trying to limit the EU’s influence from within”: Hungary, Italy, Slovakia, Sweden and, if Geert Wilders’ PVV heads its new government, the Netherlands.
The possible return of Donald Trump in the US and a right-leaning, inward-focused coalition in the European parliament could result in a rejection of “strategic interdependence and … international partnerships in defence of European interests and values”, they warned.
The projections showed the mainstream political groups in the parliament – the centre-right European People’s party (EPP), centre-left Socialists and Democrats (S&D), the centrist Renew Europe (RE) and Greens (G/EFA) – all losing MEPs.
The more radical Left group and particularly the populist right, including the European Conservatives and Reformists Group (ECR) and far-right Identity and Democracy (ID), are set to emerge as the main victors, with a real possibility of entering a majority coalition for the first time.
Although the EPP looks likely to remain the largest group, retain its agenda-setting power and determine the choice of the next Commission president, the report argues that populists, particularly from the radical right, will have a greater say than ever before.
Their voices will carry most weight in several founding member states, the polling suggests, with Giorgia Meloni’s Brothers of Italy forecast to boost its MEP tally to 27 and Marine Le Pen’s National Rally on track to win a record 25 seats.
In Austria, the radical right Freedom party (FPÖ) is projected to double its total of MEPs to six, while in Germany the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) looks likely to nearly double its representation in the 705-seat parliament to 19.
Populist eurosceptic parties are likely to come first in Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland and Slovakia, and second or third in Bulgaria, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Portugal, Romania, Spain and Sweden.
As a result, the far-right ID group is projected to gain up to 40 more seats, for a total of 98, potentially making it the third political force and opening up the possibility of a “populist right” coalition (EPP, ECR, and ID) with 49% of MEPs in the new parliament, the report says.

The polling and modelling suggested the current “centre-left” coalition (S&D, G/EFA and Left) will see its MEP tally fall to 33% from 36% of the total, with the main “centre-right” coalition (EPP, RE and ECR) slipping to 48% from 49%.
The report’s authors noted that the role of Hungary’s Fidesz party may be critical: currently non-attached, the party of the prime minister, Viktor Orbán, is tipped to win 14 seats and could – by joining the national-conservative ECR – make it the third largest group.
If it does so, ECR and ID combined would have almost 25% of MEPs in the chamber, more than EPP and S&D. The existing “super coalition” of mainstream parties (EPP, S&D and RE), meanwhile, is projected to fall from 60% of MEPs to 54%.
The report’s authors said the biggest implications of parliament’s altered geometry would be in environmental policy, where S&D, RE and the Left have ensured progress. That could soon be thwarted by an “anti-climate policy action” coalition, they said.
Similarly, the centrist and centre-left alliance (RE, S&D, G/EFA, Left, parts of EPP) that pushed through rule of law measures, including withholding budget payments, against Hungary and Poland, may find itself no longer, the report suggested.
The authors called on policymakers to examine the trends that are driving current voting patterns in Europe and to develop clear narratives that address the necessity of a global Europe in an increasingly fraught and dangerous geopolitical climate.
“June’s elections, for those who want to see a more global Europe, should be about safeguarding and enhancing the position of the EU,” said Hix, a comparative politics specialist at the European University Institute in Florence.
“Campaigns should give citizens reason for optimism. They should speak to the benefits of multilateralism. And they should make clear, on key issues relating to democracy and the rule of law, that it is they, and not those on the political fringes, who are best placed to protect fundamental European rights.”"
LNJPEX0MNV_AF3NJ5SZCXMU9HE,"RIP the uncle I never knew: a poet, just like me, and killed by an Israeli bomb",Tamer Nafar,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/24/poetry-israel-bomb-palestine,"On 7 December, a dark cloud floated across my computer screen: a photograph of a man’s face. I wouldn’t have noticed it if it didn’t look like me.
“An Israeli missile kills Palestinian poet and author Saleem Al-Naffar and his family members in their home in Gaza,” I read on Arabic Wikipedia.
It made me have a flashback: I think I met him. I’m pretty sure we are relatives!
Seventy-five years before 7 October, the Nafar family lived in Yafa (which Israelis now call Jaffa). The Nakba and the creation of the state of Israel forcibly removed us, alongside 75% of the Palestinian population. Our family, like tens of thousands of other Palestinian families, was shattered and split apart. My grandfather fled to Askalan (now Ashkelon) and then to Lyd (now Lod), which became cities in the new state; the rest of my family to refugee camps in Ramallah, Lebanon, Gaza and other places.
I’m sure Saleem and I are relatives, I thought. He looks like all of my uncles. But death can be confusing, especially when it hits you like a missile.
Twenty years ago, my dad called me while he was chatting on MSN Messenger. “Tamer, meet our relative from Gaza. He is a poet,” he said. “Saleem, meet my eldest son, Tamer. He is a well-known rapper.”
I remember I was upset that he didn’t give a damn that I was a hotshot rapper. Only now, when I look back, do I realise that I didn’t give a damn that he was a poet. I didn’t even care to be part of a conversation between two of my elders who were sharing memories of my roots and ancestry. Instead, I was busy writing or recording as usual; just busy being the self-centred young rapper I was.
Every time Gaza has come under attack I’ve thought of him, but I couldn’t remember his full name. Suddenly, reading about his death, I did. And it was he who made the effort. He walked for dozens of miles and for 20 years, straight to my screen, just to remind me of what he was called: Saleem Al-Naffar, with the small addition of “RIP” after it. The reason I didn’t find him before is because of the “Al-” before Naffar, which together mean “The Naffar”. I dropped the “Al” so western people could pronounce it – but they still get my name wrong.
If I had found Saleem, I wonder what I would have texted him. Would I have even dared to send him a message at all? Being a Palestinian citizen of Israel, I fear I could get arrested by Israeli police just for contacting my cousin in Gaza. Would Israel accuse me of being associated with terror? To Israel, it seems, every Palestinian in Gaza is associated with terror. It doesn’t matter that my late cousin was a poet who wrote and published hundreds of poems. If Israel says he is a terrorist, then he is a terrorist.
But let’s say I did message him – maybe something like, “Sorry for being a jerk and not paying attention on that MSN call. I’m different now.” Maybe a simple, “How are you?” He’d probably say, “Zay al zift [like shit]. I lost my brothers and sisters and there is no food or water.” I’d have no idea how to reply to that.
I don’t know what’s more shocking: the fact that Israel, with the full support of the United States, can bomb and besiege 2 million Palestinians for three months, kill thousands of civilians, block the entry of food, water, electricity, fuel and medicine and cut telecommunications; or that leaders of the modern world, many of whom proclaim to uphold the values of human rights and freedom, are just watching. Or the fact that the same modern world hasn’t developed the relevant emoji for me to reply to the imaginary text from Saleem. How would I respond to him? A smiley with a tear? That works when someone tells you he has the flu or couldn’t find tickets to a Drake concert; not when someone’s entire family has been wiped out.
So I missed that chance to have a conversation with him. If we’d spoken before, maybe we’d have enriched each other with our different tastes in poetry. Maybe he’d have sent me some classical poems to help me achieve new depth in my work. And maybe I’d have sent him some hip-hop to shake up his sedate style. If I could contact him now, I’d send him the album Distant Relatives by Damien Marley and Nas, whose title explains the idea that all black people were relatives before slavery, but, because of the African diaspora, they became distant. Just like us, Saleem.
I hope he is with my dad now in heaven. It doesn’t make sense for Palestinians to go through hell twice. Or move from one nothingness to another.
“You who is looking for a way to redemption – you are not alone.” This line was written by my distant relative who was killed in an Israeli attack, along with his wife, his two daughters and his son.

LQJJREX9LA_A63XOYZA8K3SH6E,"Disadvantaged parents in England and Wales rule out Stem jobs for children, charity says",Sally Weale,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2024/jan/23/disadvantaged-parents-england-wales-rule-out-stem-jobs-for-children-charity-says,"Disadvantaged parents rule out careers in science, technology, engineering and maths for their children because they think those jobs are “already stitched up”, according to a leading education charity.
More than half of parents (51%) from a lower socioeconomic background, who took part in a survey by Teach First, said they believed their children were unlikely to go on to a career in Stem.
Asked about the barriers their children faced, parents referred to a lack of confidence, few role models in the Stem field and a general feeling that their children “don’t see it as subject for somebody like them”.
Russell Hobby, the chief executive of Teach First, which aims to address educational disadvantage in England and Wales, said: “I think people look at some of these jobs, and look at who gets them and who doesn’t, and they start to rule out whether those are meant for them and people like them.
“So they already think those jobs are off the table. I can’t believe that they don’t think they’re good jobs – it’s more they think they’re already stitched up.”
As well as talking to 750 parents, Teach First surveyed more than 1,000 children aged 11 to 16 and found only two-fifths (41.8%) of those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds said they would consider a Stem career.
One of the main issues the survey raised was the widespread shortage of specialist teachers in Stem subjects across England. Nearly nine in 10 parents (88%) said their children’s schools needed more high-quality maths and science teachers.
Last year, Vic Goddard, the executive principal of Passmores academy in Essex, said trying to recruit a maths, science, computer science or DT (design and technology) teacher was like “advertising for a unicorn”.
According to Teach First, the recruitment problem is particularly acute in disadvantaged areas. “Young people, particularly those from communities facing poverty, are being locked out of Stem careers due to a lack of science and maths teachers,” said Hobby.
“We know that those schools who serve disadvantaged communities struggle to fill all of their vacancies, and particularly with the shortage subjects that are in high demand, like maths and physics. It’s easier for schools in more affluent areas to fill those roles.”
The charity believes recruiting and retaining high-quality Stem teachers for the schools facing the biggest challenges is vital to boost the Stem workforce. “A nationwide skills shortage in science and maths will have dire consequences for our economic growth and stop us tackling urgent problems such as climate change,” said Hobby.

Teach First’s core role is to train high-quality teachers and place them in schools in some of the poorest areas of the country to give children with the fewest opportunities access to a great education.
Last year there was a threefold increase in Teach First’s recruitment of physics teachers, but “our job is not done yet”, said Hobby, who is calling for a pay increase for trainee teachers in shortage subjects such as maths and science, particularly in low-income areas.
“I think we need to do a lot more work to get the resources where they’re needed, but also to show people that anyone from any community can aspire to what are quite attractive careers. We want these jobs to be open to everybody.”
A Department for Education spokesperson said bursaries and scholarships of up to £30,000 are offered for chemistry, computing, mathematics and physics teachers, alongside £3,000 tax-free for those in disadvantaged schools in the first five years of their career, doubling to £6,000 tax free over the next two years.
They added: “We are boosting the teaching of Stem subjects in schools across England through our network of maths hubs, the rollout of T Levels, the ‘stimulating physics network’ and our continued work with employers to offer more apprenticeship opportunities.”"

Kirrily originated as a tropical low over the Coral Sea, and gradually intensified over several days. The tropical cyclone then quickly intensified on Thursday, reaching a category 2 system by 10am AEST, and category 3 by 3pm, producing gusts of 170 km/h (105mph). As Kirrily moved inland five hours later, it left more than 34,000 homes and business without power in Townsville. However, the cyclone was quickly downgraded back to a category 1 by midnight.
Earlier in the week, dense fog developed from Montana all the way south to the Gulf of Mexico, reducing visibility on Tuesday to less than a quarter mile for many. The combination of last week’s arctic blast, followed by the introduction of warmer air from the south this week, allowed water vapour to condense closer to the surface, which is also known as advection fog. Dense fog reappeared on Thursday morning, affecting just under 99 million people from North Dakota across to central Pennsylvania, and as far south as New Orleans.
Northern India has also been experiencing dense fog over the past few days, with visibility falling to zero in many places on Wednesday. As a consequence, the Indian Meteorological Department issued a red fog warning on Wednesday morning for Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Harana, Chandigarh and Delhi, which is valid until 28 January. Unlike in the US, it is the warmer, sunnier days, followed by cooled nights, which allows water fog to form, also known as radiation fog.
Meanwhile, in the Philippines, PAGASA (The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration) has declared a drought across eight provinces on Luzon Island. Many other provinces, notably Metro Manila, in which the capital city resides, have also been experiencing prolonged dry spells. A drought is here characterised by five consecutive months of below average rainfall, while a dry spell is after only three months. El Niño has been linked to the reduced rainfall, which is set to continue until at least the end of spring.
Other regions have also been experiencing dry spells linked to El Niño in recent months. The World Food Programme has suggested that by the end of January, many southern African nations including Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and southern Madagascar, will have received below average rainfall based on a combination of observations and forecasts. Consequently, the Meteorological Services Department of Zimbabwe has advised farmers to enhance water collection and harvesting when possible."
LRS8QZGKZQ_UEPBEZW988YUCZU,Griselda review – this intense Narcos spinoff is so much fun it’s appalling,Lucy Mangan,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/jan/25/griselda-review-this-intense-narcos-spinoff-is-so-much-fun-its-appalling,"A quote from Pablo Escobar appears on screen: “The only man I was ever afraid of was a woman named Griselda Blanco.” How, then, could you not tell her story? The team behind Narcos – writer Doug Miro, producer Eric Newman and director Andrés Baiz – which told Escobar’s own story, has seized the opportunity and run with it in the new six-part Netflix miniseries Griselda. It stars Sofía Vergara (who also executive produces) as the woman who would become a terrifying drug lord known as the Cocaine Godmother. It is the kind of bold, meaty, dramatic part that she has surely been hankering for after long ago proving her comic chops in Modern Family.
Miro plays a little fast and loose with the real-life Griselda’s narrative. The first episode opens in 1978 while she is injured and gathering up her three sons to flee her drug-dealing husband in Medellín, Colombia and move to Miami, Florida. A friend, Carmen (Paulina Dávila), who made a similar desperate journey a few years before, takes them in and gives Griselda a job at her travel agency. This is on condition that Griselda leaves cartel life behind and starts anew. Unfortunately, Griselda fled with a kilo of uncut cocaine in her bag so that she could provide for her family – and the lure of proper money, instead of a receptionist’s salary, proves too great.
In reality, Griselda came to Miami as part of her evasion of federal charges after setting up and running for 10 very successful years a drug operation in New York City. But an underdog narrative is an easier sell, and so the truth has been massaged for greater palatability.
Soon, however, you won’t care how much is fact and how much is invention. Where Narcos was a grim, gritty account of Escobar’s rise and fall, with a quasi-documentary feel, Griselda is stylised pulp semi-fiction played fast and loose, whose direction falls just the right side of flashy. It is, especially in light of the terrible suffering and destruction she and her operatives leave in their wake during the three years covered in the six intense hours, the most appalling fun.
In the early episodes, it looks as if it might be gathering to become something more than fun too. The misogyny and sexism that Griselda meets as she tries to sell her brick of cocaine in the new town is nicely sketched as a force that work against – and occasionally (thanks to players’ low expectations of a woman) – for her. There is a nice but never overplayed sense of sisterhood among the women she brings over from Medellín (their bras stuffed with more coke, which is sliced out and added to the pile of possibility on a motel room scale), whom she knows from her days working alongside them in a brothel. Vergara not only gives a barnstorming performance, but one that shows how early brutalising experiences hone a survival instinct and also bring whatever latent propensities for violence someone – even a woman! – might be born with into something truly murderous and ruthless.
It also shows the pervasive sexism of the time in the supposedly more civilised arena of the workplace. A Latina police officer, June (Juliana Aidén Martinez), is the first to pick up on the possibility that there is a new player in town rather than a new girlfriend who keeps being in the wrong, soon blood-spattered place at the wrong time. Her attempts to be heard are drowned in the sea of hilarious pranks with which her fellow officers amuse themselves (turning up the air-con so her nipples can be seen through her shirt, filling her office with crumpled copies of the memo she sends round about the new woman and so side-splittingly on).
Later episodes squander setting up potential rich seams that could have differentiated the series more sharply from Narcos – and the many other drug cartel films and dramas there have been. The series becomes too infatuated with set pieces and depictions of the extraordinary horrors that Griselda, like any cartel boss, unleashes in her pursuit of power and the expansion of her fabulously lucrative empire. Overall, the story of her rapid rise and fall hits all the beats and delivers all the tropes we have seen before. It doesn’t fulfil the promise it had to present us with something different, something deeper.
But it remains hugely enjoyable, well paced and gorgeous to look at throughout. There isn’t a weak performance in it and it functions always as a much-deserved showcase for all that Vergara can do. It is a reminder that casting directors and viewers, too, have their biases, their set expectations of women and of comedy actors (and especially of beautiful ones), and that it can be a joyful thing to watch them be overturned – even if a lot of bras have to be ruined and a lot of people have to die very bloodily in the process.

No Hard Feelings (Gene Stupnitsky, 2023), 8pm, Sky Cinema Premiere
On paper this is the last film you would expect Jennifer Lawrence to make. At this point, logic dictates that she should be chasing worthy awards bait. Instead, she signed up for this comedy about a woman hired by a worried couple to try to have sex with their nervous young son. What’s amazing is how well the film works, thanks to Lawrence’s committed performance. One scene, in which she suplexes a teenager on the beach, is as daring as anything she attempted in Mother.

The Magnificent Ambersons (Orson Welles, 1942), 8:30pm, BBC Four
The story behind The Magnificent Ambersons is almost as good as the film itself. A year after the triumph of Citizen Kane, Orson Welles wrote, directed and starred in an even more ambitious project: an adaptation of Booth Tarkington’s novel about a wealthy family living through the dawn of the automobile. However, fearing the film’s downbeat ending, the studio hastily re-edited it, and a fire ensured that it could never be put back together according to Welles’s wishes. Incredibly, even in this brutalised condition, it remains a masterpiece – although Welles was never quite the same again. SH"
LUM5B4N3IU_SGRUS8N111P3T1R,"Alleged damage to Michael Flatley mansion to cost €30m, court told",Rory Carroll,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/jan/23/alleged-damage-to-michael-flatley-mansion-to-cost-30m-court-told,"Michael Flatley built his reputation with big-budget blockbuster productions.
And now that includes the estimated bill to repair alleged damage to his Irish mansion: €30m (£25.6m).
The former Riverdance star says that is the cost to remove alleged toxic residue from Castlehyde, his 18th-century estate near Fermoy in County Cork.
He is suing a contractor, an insurer, a broker and a managing agency over the condition of the property, which he vacated last year on health grounds.
The claim includes €1.1m for health and safety protective work, €2.2m for bespoke plastering, €2.5m for painting and decor, €3.9 for woodwork and €9.8m for demolition. The alleged contamination affects the property’s pool, spa and cinema and is said to require replacing walls, floors, and ceilings.
Flatley, 65, launched the high court case last year, seeking €25m, and this week increased that to €30m, citing a surveyor’s report.
He claims a 2016 fire at the estate left unsafe levels of chloride residue due to PVC combustion and that the alleged main renovation contractor, Austin Newport Group Ltd, failed to address the issue. Austin denies the claims.
Flatley is also suing David Cushion, who was allegedly his broker, the insurers Castlehyde Am Amlin Underwriting Ltd, AXA XL Underwriting Ltd, and Hamilton Managing Agency Ltd.
All of the allegations are denied. Neil Steen, a lawyer for Cushion, said his client could not understand why he had been drawn into the case and was “adamant” he had no responsibility for the alleged issues. Steen said he would seek to have the case dismissed for failing to disclose a cause of action.
Flatley bought the property, which dates from 1790, in 1999 when his show Lord of the Dance, an Irish dancing extravaganza, had made him one of the world’s highest paid performers.
The Irish-American said he spent €29m renovating it into one of Ireland’s finest period homes, replete with a Portland stone staircase, gold-leaf ceilings, mahogany walls and walnut bookshelves with precious first editions. A display case exhibited his dancing shoes and the music room hosted Cliff Richard, The Chieftains and other performers.
“Living here, it’s a blessing from God,” he told the Irish Times in 2015 when he put the property on the market for €20m. “I had nearly 20 of the best years of my life here. There is no money in the world that could possibly pay for that.” He ended up keeping the estate.
In a court statement Flatley said he, his wife, Niamh, and their son Michael St James had suffered ill health since the remediation works. “I believe I was one of the fittest people in Ireland, and despite the same, I developed cancer,” he said.
The Flatleys left the mansion last October after routine maintenance detected allegedly high and unsafe levels of chloride residue, the court heard.
Flatley announced in January 2023 that he had been diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer.
In recent years he has focused on screen work. Blackbird, a spy thriller he wrote, produced, financed, directed and starred in, was released in 2022. Critics called it a vanity project.
In June Flatley announced plans for a six-part TV biopic titled Dancelord that promised to show the “epic sweep” of a life that evoked the fictional boxer Rocky Balboa and reached “a plane beyond mere rock stardom”."
LVNAQ2CAD5_K0EQT9WY1OM5CDX,Grenfell survivor in whose flat fire started describes anguish to victims’ event,Robert Booth,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/23/grenfell-survivor-in-whose-flat-fire-started-describes-anguish-to-victims-event,"The minicab driver in whose flat the Grenfell Tower fire started has said his heart is “full of pain, grief and desolation” and he can “never forget that it was in my flat, in my kitchen that the fire started … and all those lives were lost”.
Behailu Kebede, who lived in Grenfell Tower for 25 years, told a highly charged hearing in central London – attended by 24 executives from companies accused of responsibility for the fire – that he remained “broken inside”.
He made the comments, through an actor, at Grenfell Testimony Week, a four-day event aimed at achieving a measure of restorative justice, arranged as part of last year’s £150m out-of-court settlement of a civil case.
Other members of the community demanded long jail sentences for those they held responsible for the 72 deaths, as executives from companies involved looked on.
Kebede said he did not attend in person because he still felt “a deep pain and a shame that I will carry to my grave”. He said he almost had to go into witness protection, even though the fire began through no fault of his own but because of a fridge malfunction.
Dozens of the bereaved, survivors and residents gathered at Church House in Westminster to hear some of their number address representatives of companies including Celotex and Kingspan which made the combustible insulation, the fire engineer Exova, the builder Rydon and the council block’s owner, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea.
The US company Arconic, which made the highly flammable cladding, declined to send anyone. A table was left empty with the company’s name on it.
Sandra Ruiz, the aunt of 12-year-old Jessica Urbano Ramirez, who died in the fire after getting separated from her family, told the event Arconic’s absence “shows a total disregard for their responsibilities but also a total disregard for our loss”.
She was one of several speakers to call for jail sentences for executives of the various companies involved, saying some should be “behind bars”.
“They made decisions based on profit, based on speed, based on ‘couldn’t care less’,” she said.
The representatives included Mike Chaldecott, the chief executive of the UK and Ireland arm of Saint-Gobain, which manufactured the tower’s combustible Celotex insulation; Andrew Goldman, the marketing director of the main contractor, Rydon; and Elizabeth Campbell, the leader of Kensington and Chelsea council.
Representatives for Kingspan declined to give their names, but said: “It’s important for the bereaved to give their testimony and it’s important for us that we hear what they have to say.”
There were also representatives from the Home Office and the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities.
The event, which runs for the rest of the week, did not attract universal support.
Farhad Neda, who lost his father in the fire, did not attend and said having representatives of the companies “doesn’t make much of a difference because they have heard everything we have had to say during the inquiry, they had our police statements, our witness statements and they just continue to take no notice of it. It just feels like they don’t care”.
But others hoped their statements would have an impact. Marcio Gomes, who lived on the 21st floor and whose son, Logan, was stillborn as a result of the fire, described Logan’s potential childhood with birthday cakes, first steps, the tooth fairy, bedtime stories and his preschool artwork pinned proudly on the fridge.
He then paused, before telling the corporate representatives: “This is what Logan’s life would have been like … this is what you have taken away.”
Willie Thompson, a resident who escaped the fire, recalled watching body bags being removed from the tower. He wanted people responsible to be “banged up” and serve 20-year prison sentences.
“They need to realise what they did to us,” he said, in a pre-recorded video. “I don’t think they have put enough thought into the damage that was done: 72 lives were lost but the families, the bereaved, so many lives have been destroyed by them.”
He called the corporate entities “the enemy” and concluded by saying he was brought up as a Catholic and was taught hate is a sin, “but I fucking hate them”.
The executives sat still, heads sometimes bowed during pauses for silence after the testimonies. At breaks they were led into a different area of the venue, Church House, the headquarters of the Church of England.

M2IHHEVTHY_Z5MPBXAJZHQ14J2,Nitrogen gas execution: how it works and why it’s controversial,Gloria Oladipo,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/26/what-is-nitrogen-gas-execution-risks,"Alabama has used a new method of execution: nitrogen gas.
Kenneth Smith, who survived the state’s previous attempt to put him to death by lethal injection in 2022, was put to death Thursday by nitrogen hypoxia. It is the first new method of execution since lethal injection was introduced in 1982.
The state previously said that nitrogen gas will cause unconsciousness quickly, but critics likened the never-used method of execution to human experimentation.
Nitrogen hypoxia execution causes death by forcing the inmate to breathe pure nitrogen, depriving him or her of the oxygen needed to maintain bodily functions.
Before Thursday, no state had used nitrogen hypoxia to carry out a death sentence. In 2018, Alabama became the third state – along with Oklahoma and Mississippi – to authorize the use of nitrogen gas to execute prisoners.
Some states are looking for new ways to execute inmates because the drugs used in lethal injections, the most common execution method in the United States, are increasingly difficult to find.
Nitrogen, a colorless, odorless gas, makes up 78% of the air inhaled by humans and is harmless when breathed with proper levels of oxygen.
The theory behind nitrogen hypoxia is that changing the composition of the air to 100% nitrogen will cause an individual to lose consciousness and then die from lack of oxygen.
Much of what is recorded in medical journals about death from nitrogen exposure comes from industrial accidents – where nitrogen leaks or mix-ups have killed workers – and suicide attempts.
Smith was first strapped to a gurney in the execution chamber.
In his final statement, he said: “Tonight Alabama causes humanity to take a step backwards … I’m leaving with love, peace and light.”
He then made the “I love you sign” with his hands toward family members who were present. “Thank you for supporting me. Love, love all of you,” Smith said.
Nitrogen gas was then administered through a mask. Smith appeared conscious for several minutes before apparently convulsing and pulling against the restraints for at least two minutes, with his eyes rolling back into his head, Marty Roney of the Montgomery Advertiser reported. Afterwards, Smith breathed deeply for several minutes until his breathing was no longer detectable.
Smith’s time of death was approximately 8.25pm US eastern time.
The Rev Jeff Hood, who served as Smith’s spiritual adviser and was present for the execution, said prison officials in the room “were visibly surprised at how bad this thing went”.
“What we saw was minutes of someone struggling for their life,” Hood said.
Alabama’s corrections commissioner, John Hamm, said nitrogen was running for about 15 minutes, in a news conference.
“It appeared that Smith was holding his breath as long as he could,” Hamm said at the press conference.
Before the execution, the state heavily redacted sections of the protocol related to the storage and testing of the gas system.
The Alabama attorney general’s office had told a federal judge that the nitrogen gas would “cause unconsciousness within seconds, and cause death within minutes”.
Smith’s attorneys said the state was seeking to make him the “test subject” for a novel execution method.
They argued that the mask the state planned to use was not airtight and oxygen seeping in could subject him to a prolonged execution, possibly leaving him in a vegetative state instead of killing him. A doctor testified on behalf of Smith that the low-oxygen environment could cause nausea, leaving Smith to choke to death on his own vomit.
Experts appointed by the United Nations human rights council earlier this month cautioned that, in their view, the execution method would violate the prohibition on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment.
The American Veterinary Medical Association wrote in 2020 euthanasia guidelines that nitrogen hypoxia can be an acceptable method of euthanasia under certain conditions for pigs but not for other mammals, because it creates an “anoxic environment that is distressing for some species”.
Not exactly. Some states previously used hydrogen cyanide gas, a lethal gas, for executions. The last prisoner to be executed in a US gas chamber was Walter LaGrand, the second of two German brothers sentenced to death for killing a bank manager in 1982 in southern Arizona. It took LaGrand 18 minutes to die in 1999.
Smith was one of two men convicted of the 1988 murder-for-hire of a preacher’s wife. Prosecutors said Smith and the other man were each paid $1,000 to kill Elizabeth Sennett on behalf of her husband, who was deeply in debt and wanted to collect insurance money.
Alabama attempted to execute Smith in 2022 by lethal injection. He was strapped to the gurney in the execution chamber being prepared for lethal injection, but the state called off the lethal injection when execution team members had difficulty connecting the second of two required intravenous lines to Smith’s veins. Smith was strapped to the gurney for nearly four hours, according to his lawyers, as he waited to see if the execution would go forward.
The US supreme court rejected Smith’s final appeal on Thursday that requested a stay of the execution.
Supreme court justice Sonia Sotomayor, along with the two other liberal-leaning justices, dissented from the decision. Sotomayor wrote: “Having failed to kill Smith on its first attempt, Alabama has selected him as its ‘guinea pig’ to test a method of execution never attempted before. The world is watching.”
Smith had argued that the state’s proposed procedures violated the ban on cruel and unusual punishment. He also argued that Alabama violated his due process rights by scheduling the execution when he had pending appeals and that the face mask would interfere with his ability to pray.
In a separate case, Smith argued that it would violate the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment for the state to make a second attempt to execute him after he already survived one execution attempt.
Lethal injection is the most commonly used execution method in the United States, but death penalty states have struggled at times to obtain the needed drugs or encountered other problems in connecting intravenous lines.
Now that the Alabama execution has gone forward, other states may seek to start using nitrogen gas."
M2KUT8DC1C_5O6VQKUJJMF3Y87,"Grounded Boeing 737 Max 9 planes can return to service after inspection, says FAA",Callum Jones,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/24/boeing-ceo-plane-safety,"The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has approved an inspection and maintenance process to allow grounded Boeing 737 Max 9 planes to return to service, following a cabin panel blowout on an Alaska Airlines flight.
“The exhaustive, enhanced review our team completed after several weeks of information gathering gives me and the FAA confidence to proceed to the inspection and maintenance phase,” FAA administrator Mike Whitaker said in a statement.
The FAA said it would not grant any production expansion of Boeing’s bestselling Max narrow-body family of jets, including the 737 Max 9.
The agency halted flights on 6 January after a cabin panel blew off a brand-new 737 Max 9 jet during an Alaska Airlines flight earlier this month. About 171 Max 9 jets have since been grounded.
Earlier on Wednesday, the chief executive of Boeing insisted that the planemaker only allows jets to fly when it is “100%” confident of their safety.
Boeing fully understands “the gravity of the situation”, Dave Calhoun said in Washington, as he prepared to meet a string of US senators.
“We don’t put planes in the air that we don’t have 100% confidence in,” Calhoun told reporters.
As inspections continue, and officials continue to investigate what caused the incident, the Seattle Times reported on Wednesday that the fuselage panel that blew off the Alaska flight had been removed for repair and re-installed improperly by Boeing’s mechanics at its Renton final assembly line.
Speaking with reporters, Calhoun referred a question about the report to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which did not comment.
Calhoun is due to meet senators including Maria Cantwell, who chairs the Senate commerce committee and plans to hold a hearing. Ted Cruz, the committee’s top Republican, is due to meet Calhoun on Thursday.
Concern over the reliability of Boeing jets has strained the group’s relations with key airlines. Ben Minicucci, the chief executive of Alaska, said it had found “some loose bolts on many” Max 9 jets in its fleet.
“I’m more than frustrated and disappointed,” he told NBC News. “I am angry.”
United Airlines is weighing plans to leave an upcoming Boeing jet, the Max 10, out of its fleet. “I think the Max 9 grounding is probably the straw that broke the camel’s back for us,” Scott Kirby, its chief executive, told CNBC.
For Boeing, this amounts to the biggest safety crisis since the crashes of two of its Max 8 jets, in 2018 and 2019, in which 346 people were killed. The 737 Max was subsequently grounded across the world for almost two years.
Analysts have called into question whether executives at the company will have to resign.
Officials “will likely look for more change from within Boeing”, Ronald Epstein of Bank of America wrote last week. “We would not be surprised to see regulators, investors and customers push for a turnover in the ranks of senior management and the board of directors.”

In September, Guardian Australia revealed there are at least nine “suspicious” sites of possible graves on the grounds of Kinchela Aboriginal Boys’ Training Home, one of the most violent and abusive institutions of the Stolen Generations era.
A report by experts surveying the area using ground-penetrating radar (GPR) highlighted “high priority anomalies” in the ground at the home, which show “signal patterns that in other contexts have proven to be human burials” and cannot be explained by other information sources.
“Some evidence supports the use of cadaver dogs in finding buried human remains,” the report said.
Following the revelations, the NSW premier, Chris Minns, said he was open to funding further investigations at Kinchela on the north coast of NSW. Minns also vowed to take further action if more potential burial sites at other institutions of the Stolen Generations era were uncovered.
A spokesperson for the NSW government has confirmed it is supporting investigative work at two other Stolen Generations institutions: Cootamundra girls’ home and Bomaderry infants’ home.
“The NSW government has committed funding for investigations into accounts of missing children at three sites of former Aborigines Welfare Board children’s homes located at Kinchela, Bomaderry and Cootamundra, through the Keeping Places project led by Aboriginal Affairs NSW,” a spokesperson for the NSW minister for Aboriginal affairs and treaty, David Harris, said.
Aboriginal Affairs NSW has held a series of meetings with the survivor organisation, the Kinchela Boys Home Corporation and the Kempsey Local Aboriginal Land Council, which owns the site.
These meetings “ensure this critical work continues with the rightful and respectful urgency it requires”, the spokesperson said.
It is understood the report’s authors urge caution about interpreting the results as some of the anomalies could be archaeological as well as forensic. If forensic (less than 100 years old), police would need to be called in. But the authors note that the only way to determine for sure if there are bodies buried on the site is to excavate.
Kinchela was run by the Aborigines Protection Board, later called the Aborigines Welfare Board, under the NSW government from 1924 until it closed in 1970.
An estimated 400 to 600 Aboriginal boys between the ages of five and 15 were taken away from their families and incarcerated there under the laws and policies of the Stolen Generations era.
Kinchela survivors have long maintained that Aboriginal boys died at the home, either as a result of the brutal physical punishment and neglect or because they may have “met with foul play”.
“The minister has sought advice from the attorney general because of the legal complexity in relation to the report findings,” the spokesperson said.
“The minister asks the media and community to be sensitive to Sorry Business and truth telling, which can raise serious mental health and trauma issues for survivors, their families and their communities, and to give the parties the space they need to work through the issues together in the spirit of agreement-making to determine the next steps.”
The Aborigines Protection Board, later called the welfare board, ran from 1909 to 1969. It was a draconian regime of assimilation which included the forcible removal of Aboriginal babies and children.
From 1912 to 1969, the Cootamundra Domestic Training Home for Aboriginal Girls operated. Survivors of the home say there were referred to as “inmates’” and recall it was a harsh place where the strict routine was regulated by a bell and punishments included being locked up in “the morgue”.
Aunty Lorraine Darcy Peeters was taken to Cootamundra as a four-year-old.
“We learned from a very young age how to clean, because that was the endgame for us,” Peeters told NITV News in 2022. “We were to come out perfect servants. The process was done by brainwashing and abuse.”
At the age of 15, girls were usually sent to work as domestics, but their wages were withheld by the board.
From 2004 to 2011, the NSW government operated a repayment scheme to assess claims and pay survivors and their descendants these stolen wages.
Bomaderry infants’ home was run for the state government by the United Aborigines Mission (UAM) until 1988. It took babies and children up to the age of 10 who had been forcibly removed from their families. When they grew older, children were sent to Cootamundra, Kinchela or other institutions, fostered or adopted.
UAM record-keepers made reference over time to babies and children dying in their care.

M701MYB33C_0L2MP6VQNFW2728,‘I’m creating the tax I would want to pay’: Austrian heiress Marlene Engelhorn on why she is giving away 90% of her wealth,Ashifa Kassam,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2024/jan/23/austrian-heiress-marlene-engelhorn-who-is-giving-away-90-per-cent-of-her-wealth-im-creating-the-tax-i-would-want-to-pay,"As Marlene Engelhorn made her way through Davos last week, she was greeted a handful of times with expletives. The frosty welcome was not necessarily aimed directly at the millionaire heiress, but rather the message emblazoned on the metre-high placard she was lugging around with her: “Tax the Rich.”
Since 2021, Engelhorn, whose wealth traces back to the German chemical company BASF and pharmaceutical company Boehringer Mannheim, has called for taxes to be raised on herself and her peers in the 1%.
She’s now taking matters into her own hands. “I’m basically creating the tax that I would want to pay,” the 31-year-old said. “Since the government failed to tax me and fails to this day to tax me.”
Earlier this month, she launched an initiative whereby 50 randomly chosen people in Austria, where she lives, decide how best to spend the €25m Engelhorn inherited from her grandmother.
The Good Council for Redistribution, or Gute Rat für Rückverteilung, as the initiative has been named, will also be tasked with exploring the often overlooked question of how societies redistribute wealth. “Because we always do distribute it,” said Engelhorn. “To not redistribute wealth is as much of a distributional decision as to redistribute it.”
Underpinning the initiative is Engelhorn’s staunch belief that the failure to tax wealth such as her own – Austria abolished its inheritance tax in 2008 – distorts democracy by giving outsized political sway to the super-rich while simultaneously depriving governments of the resources that could help to address this power imbalance.
The council aims to directly challenge this, offering a high-profile demonstration of how democracy can be reclaimed through inclusivity and transparency, said Engelhorn.
These principles trickle through every step of the council. Invitations to join were sent earlier this month to 10,000 randomly selected people in Austria. Hundreds have since responded and statistical methods will be used to select 50 adults who reflect the country’s demographics.
In the coming months, members of the council will be paid to spend six weekends thrashing out thorny issues such as inequality and redistribution, aided by a roster of experts, before being asked to decide on how to redistribute Engelhorn’s inheritance.
Engelhorn, who provided an additional €3m in funding to cover the costs of running the council, will have no say in how the council decides to spend the money.
Broad rules have instead been set out: the funds cannot be directed towards groups or individuals that are unconstitutional, hostile or inhumane, nor can they be put towards for-profit endeavours, political parties or paid out to members of the council or related parties. If the council fails to reach a “widely supported” consensus on what to do with the €25m, it will be returned to Engelhorn.
“I see that a lot of people are fixated on what has to come out at the end,” said Engelhorn. “The fact alone that there are people willing to do this work, willing to commit their weekend – six freakin’ weekends – to discussing with strangers about whether or inequality is just, and what to do about it … It should feed this hope that democracy is far from dead.”
Educated in private schools and surrounded by other wealthy people for much of her life, her strong views on what she called the “illegitimate power” wielded by the wealthy took 20 years to coalesce. “This is how being rich and being born rich, especially, works,” she said. “Because it’s normal to you. To you, it’s like everybody’s rich. Like, why would someone not be?”
She described the inheritance from her grandmother as a “catalysing event”, one that forced her to reckon with the way that wealth works, which she was slowly learning about.
No longer could she simply point to her family as her source of wealth, now she was in possession of millions. It didn’t sit well with her. “Something’s not right about me inheriting millions, not being taxed, while a person who is working 40 hours, maybe more, maybe two jobs, has kids perhaps … and they get taxed on their work.”
She soon realised that she wanted her money to reflect her values, a drive that led her to co-found Tax Me Now, which brings together wealthy people from German-speaking countries, and join the hundreds of super-rich who have repeatedly called on global leaders to tax their extreme wealth.
Her quest was made easier by the backing of her family. “Nobody is openly telling me that I’m doing something wrong or bad,” she said. “On the contrary, my mum once said: ‘I’m going to be your biggest fan.’”
She’s swift to acknowledge, however, that the issue of taxation is one that has divided the 1%. “One of the consequences, that I think also underlies some of the fears or anxieties of wealthy people, is [that] it will bring a question to the table that is very uncomfortable when you’re used to being excessive, which is: how much is enough? And who gets to decide?”
Ultimately Engelhorn’s goal is to give away all of her wealth and transition out of what she calls the “feudal wealth soup” she was born into. “I will have to find a job and make money the way that 99% of the population have to,” she said.
At least 90% of her wealth has been handed over to the council, while the remaining amount will be used to cover her rent and other financial commitments, as well as provide a cushion for her as she adjusts to working life.
“I do acknowledge that it’s not going to be easy,” she said. “To me, really, starting a working, taxpaying life is ascending. It’s a step up into the democratic part of our society, the democratic 99%. This is like a boost to who I am as a person in the 21st century.”"

Spending time immersed in cold water appears to confer a range of physical and mental health benefits for menopausal women, with some likening it to “healing”, the researchers said.
The study, led by academics at University College London, examined responses from 1,114 women aged between 16 and 80, with an average age of 49, who regularly swim in cold water. Among the study group, 785 women were going through the menopause at the time.
Half of that group said cold-water swimming significantly reduced their anxiety, while large minorities said it also helped tackle mood swings (35%), low mood (31%) and hot flushes (30%). And more than six in 10 (63%) said they swam specifically to address menopausal symptoms.
One 54-year-old woman who took part in the study said: “Cold-water swimming has had a profound effect on my menopausal symptoms. Exercising in nature, alone or with a group of other women, is healing. The camaraderie, shared stories and laughter are part of the magic.”
The findings have been published in the journal Post Reproductive Health. Cold water has already been found to reduce stress among people who swim outdoors, while ice baths boost muscle repair in athletes, said the study’s senior author Prof Joyce Harper, of the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson institute for women’s health at UCL.
Although anecdotal, the evidence in the study suggests that “the activity can be used by women to alleviate physical symptoms, such as hot flushes, aches and pains,” the researchers said.
The effects of cold-water swimming were so marked that it “may provide an alternative solution for women struggling with the menopause and encourage more women to take part in sports.”
Another participant, 57, said: “Cold water is phenomenal. It has saved my life. In the water I can do anything. All symptoms (physical and mental) disappear and I feel like me at my best.”
The longer women swam for, and the colder the water, the greater the benefits they received.

Of the 1,114 participants, 711 women also had menstrual symptoms. Among them, 38% cited better control of their mood swings.
Regular cold-water swimmers who had either menopausal or menstrual symptoms experienced “a positive overall effect” from it, the study found. They identified five key benefits: the water proved calm and mood-boosting; they gained companionship and community; it improved their experience of periods; reduced the impact of their hot flushes; and gave “an overall health improvement”."

Tara Kershaw, 33, was discovered at Princes Road during the early hours of Saturday. An initial postmortem examination found Kershaw’s injuries were consistent with compression to the neck.
Adam Barnard, 40, who lived at the same address, appeared at Norwich crown court on Tuesday, where he was remanded into custody before a plea and trial preparation hearing on 12 April and a provisional trial date of 29 July.
Kershaw’s family have asked for privacy as they take the time to grieve their loss. In a statement released by Norfolk police, they said: “Following the death of our beloved sister, which we are struggling to come to terms with at the present time, we would like to ask people to respect our wishes for privacy.
“We would like to be given the time to grieve the loss of Tara and come to terms with the circumstances in which her life was taken.”
On a GoFundMe page set up in Kershaw’s memory, she was described as “a loving and kind soul that had a face that was well known all over by many and a mother to two beautiful children ”.
DI Alix Wright said: “We continue with our inquiries to understand the full circumstances which led to Tara’s death and would urge anyone who may have seen or heard anything in the days leading up to Saturday morning, to get in touch.
“However, the incident is being treated as an isolated incident as the pair are thought to have been known to one another.
“Norfolk police had been in contact with Ms Kershaw before she died, resulting in the force referring itself to the police watchdog.”"
MC7328BZO4_T1VTC3C982V6SIA,Labour to unveil plans for City at forthcoming business conference,Kalyeena Makortoff,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/jan/24/labour-to-unveil-plans-for-city-at-forthcoming-business-conference,"Labour will use its sold-out business conference next week to unveil the party’s City policy plans, the Guardian can reveal, as it tries to win over hundreds of UK executives before a general election.
More than 500 bosses from across British finance will gather in London on 1 February for the event, where opposition leaders including Sir Keir Starmer, his shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, and the shadow business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, plan to “showcase Labour’s offer to business”.
The party is hoping that the conference – which sold out within two hours in the autumn – will demonstrate its “commitment to work hand in glove with the business community” and will use it as an opportunity to reveal its business policy plans after two major industry reviews.
The Guardian understands that will include Labour’s much-anticipated strategy for the City and will detail how the party plans to harness the strength of the UK’s £275bn financial and professional services sector.
Reeves and the shadow City minister, Tulip Siddiq, revealed in December that they had appointed a panel of 10 independent grandees from the world of finance – including Barclays chair Nigel Higgins and London Stock Exchange Group chief David Schwimmer – to guide its approach to the City, which accounts for about 12% of the UK economy.
However, work had begun months earlier, when Labour seconded staff from the consultancy Oliver Wyman to gather views from more than 80 industry bodies, including TheCityUK, UK Finance, and British Private Equity and Venture Capital Association, as well as consumer groups and charities.
Siddiq is now expected to reveal the findings and policy plans at a breakfast meeting with City bosses on Thursday next week, which will cover financial regulation in areas such as buy now, pay later, and plans to boost gender and ethnic diversity across the sector. It is likely to break down its announcement into five key themes: capital markets, competitiveness, consumer protection, innovation and sustainability.
However, Labour’s approach to more controversial issues, including a previously mooted move to scrap discounted tax rates for “carried interest” in the private equity industry, were not “in scope” of the City review, according to sources.
Carried interest refers to the share of profits that private equity fund managers make on successful deals. Dealmakers now pay 28% capital gains tax on those profits, nearly half of the 45% income tax levied on higher earners. Labour had pledged in 2021 to scrap the tax loophole, which is believed to benefit about 2,000 private equity bankers across the UK.
Meanwhile, the shadow business minister is expected to reveal how the party intends to boost the voice of small businesses after a review by lobbyist Iain Anderson, a former adviser to Boris Johnson, who defected from the Tory party in 2023.

Anderson had been asked to draft a plan for how Labour should engage with smaller firms, to ensure they were not sidelined by engagement with big business and unions. “This is about everybody getting an ability to make a pitch,” Anderson told the Financial Times in October.
Labour’s conference – the location of which has yet to be unveiled for security reasons – will be held more than a month before Jeremy Hunt’s spring budget on 6 March, giving the opposition some lead time before the chancellor announces initiatives that the Conservatives hope will appeal to business and voters.

MC7FZPQ5UA_0CM4N62O9HTE24D,Canadian firm under fire for supplying equipment for Alabama execution,Leyland Cecco,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/24/onex-corp-canada-equipment-alabama-execution,"A Canadian company is facing criticism for allegedly supplying the equipment for a state execution in the United States, in a case that has drawn outrage for the reliance on a seemingly untested method of execution.
On Thursday, Alabama plans to kill inmate Kenneth Smith by suffocating him with nitrogen gas, a method never before used in the country.
The US-based advocacy group Worth Rises and the Responsible Business Initiative for Justice says that in the execution, Alabama will use workplace safety equipment made by the subsidiary of a Canadian company.
The state’s department of corrections would fix Smith to a gurney, apply a respirator mask to his face, forcing him to breathe pure nitrogen and causing death from oxygen deprivation. The mask and hose used for the execution are allegedly manufactured by Allegro Industries.
The group says Allegro is a subsidiary of Quebec-based Walter Surface Technologies, which in turn is partly owned by the Toronto private equity firm Onex Corp – a company that also owns one of Canada’s largest airlines.
Allegro Industries, Walter Surface Technologies and Onex Corp did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Smith was sentenced to death for the 1988 stabbing of Elizabeth Sennett in a murder-for-hire plot. Her husband, pastor Charles Sennett, paid Smith and another man $1,000 each for the killing, then later took his own life.
A jury voted 11 to 1 to give Smith a life sentence, declining to send him to death row, but the trial judge overturned their decision and ordered his execution.
Alabama attempted to execute him last year, but he survived the botched execution by lethal injection after officials failed to find a vein.
Last week, a federal judge gave the green light for a new execution to go ahead, using nitrogen gas. The method, which causes death by nitrogen hypoxia, involves forcing the condemned prisoner to breathe only nitrogen, which deprives them of oxygen. But the method of execution is considered experimental, and veterinarians in the US and across Europe have deemed it unacceptable as a form of euthanasia for most animals. Earlier this month, the United Nations human rights office warned this method of execution is untested and may cause serious pain.

Pharmaceutical companies are increasingly banning the use of their products for executions, making it difficult for states that still have the death penalty to source the chemicals needed for lethal injection. Both Oklahoma and Mississippi have also permitted the use of nitrogen hypoxia as a method of execution.
In recent years, activist groups have targeted Canadian investment in the US prison system.
In 2018, the Guardian and Documented reported that the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) – which manages $366.6bn in pension funds on behalf of about 20 million Canadian retirees – holds stock in Geo Group, a company which operates private prisons in the United States. The pension later divested of the investment, which at one point totaled $6.1m."

The group of about 60 hooded men were seen at Artarmon station just before midday on Friday.
“I was horrified by those images,” Albanese told reporters on Saturday, before warning of a rise in neo-Nazi activity in Australia. “I say to these people, quite frankly, have a good look at yourself.”
Officers from North Sydney police, the public order riot squad and police transport command waited for the train to arrive at North Sydney station, NSW police said in a statement.
“On arrival, members of the public were directed to leave the train while officers boarded and contained the group of approximately 61 to a few carriages,” the statement said.
“The group all had their faces concealed and were carrying a number of items, including shields and a flag.”

Police said six people were arrested and taken to Chatswood police station, where they were assisting police with inquiries. A further 55 men were issued rail infringement notices for offensive behaviour.
Two men have since been released and issued infringement notices for offensive behaviour. Police said they are continuing to investigate the incident.
The Australian neo-Nazi leader Thomas Sewell said he was part of the group stopped by police.
The 30-year-old self-appointed leader of the National Socialist Network was filmed being served by officers with a legal order banning him from attending any Australia Day events in Sydney.
The video, first posted by Sewell on his encrypted chat on Friday afternoon, was widely circulating across social media.
“You’re being served with a public safety order,” an officer tells Sewell in the video.
“I believe your presence in the Sydney city local government area poses a serious risk to public safety,” the officer adds.
“This is based on your ideological links, including your associates, your previous attendance and ideologically motivated public order incidents, your criminal history of assaulting members of the public and your goal of intimidating and provoking people.”

Sewell was then told to remain out of the Sydney city local government area or anywhere where an Australia Day event was planned until 11.59pm on Friday.
Albanese congratulated NSW police on its quick action to dispel the “what could have been very dangerous activity”.
“I don’t want to see people in balaclavas dressed in black from head to toe, who are engaged in neo-Nazi activity in this country. It has no place and it is rightly being condemned by all decent people,” he said.
“And on Australia Day, where we commemorate everything that is great about this country, we have a responsibility. We, to look to what unites us, not what divides us.”
In a statement, the NSW premier, Chris Minns, said “normal people don’t celebrate Australia Day with a balaclava on”.
“Due to great police work millions of Aussies were able to celebrate and come together without a potentially ugly confrontation,” he said.
“There is absolutely no tolerance for this behaviour.”"
MKH3PNRB3T_GXND1HM5HDSIQNS,‘Cowards’: University of California halts plan to hire undocumented students,_,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/26/university-of-california-student-work-undocumented-plan,"The University of California’s governing board on Thursday punted a decision of whether to allow immigrant students without legal status to apply for jobs on its 10 campuses, with the system’s president warning that doing so would carry “significant risk” for the institution and students, including possible criminal prosecution.
The board of regents voted 9-6 to delay considering the plan until 2025 amid shouts of “Cowards!” from some in the audience.
Before the vote, the University of California’s president, Michael Drake, told the board that the proposed legal pathway for the student work plan was “not viable right now” and said implementing such a plan would carry “significant risk for the institution and for those we serve”.
Drake said the policy could put immigrant students at risk of criminal prosecution and then deportation for working while lacking legal status. That, in turn, would put the university system at risk of fines and criminal penalties for employing them, and pose a potential threat to grants and other funding. He said the university system will continue to explore its options.
Regents who opposed delaying the plan shared their disappointment and called it a missed opportunity for the university system to lead in the fight for the rights of immigrant students who do not have legal status.
“We are taking a pause at a crucial moment on an issue that requires our commitment,” said California assembly speaker emeritus and UC regent John A Pérez. “If you stand and say this is the time for us to actually be bold, and take individual and institutional risks, then you speak to a different sense of moral authority.”
The prestigious university system has more than 295,000 students. The policy could benefit as many as 4,000 immigrant students who would previously have been allowed to work under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or Daca.
The federal policy implemented by Barack Obama prevents the deportation of hundreds of thousands of immigrants brought to the US as children. It was declared illegal by a federal judge in Texas in September. The judge’s ruling is ultimately expected to be appealed to the US supreme court, sending the program’s fate before the high court for a third time.
UC’s policy would also challenge a 1986 federal law prohibiting people without immigration status from legally working.
For years, students without legal immigration status have attended University of California schools while paying in-state tuition.
Department of Homeland Security officials did not respond to a request for comment on the proposal considered by the board of regents.
“I’m deeply disappointed that the UC regents and President Drake shirked their duties to the students they are supposed to protect and support,” Jeffry Umaña Muñoz, UCLA student and leader at Undocumented Student-Led Network, said in a statement.
Ahilan Arulanantham, faculty co-director at the Center for Immigration Law and Policy at the University of California Los Angeles School of Law, called it “deeply shameful” that the regents refused to adopt the policy now.
“Our legal theory, which we presented to the regents in October 2022, makes clear: the University of California has the legal right to authorize the hiring of undocumented students today,” Arulanantham said. “I have had the immense privilege of working with these students for the past couple of years, and I’ve seen first-hand how challenging it is to simultaneously pursue their studies and fight for their right to survive at the UC.”"
MO5JPI8MDE_7V9XL4OMWKIFYOY,Martin McCallum obituary,Michael Coveney,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/jan/22/martin-mcallum-obituary,"When Andrew Lloyd Webber’s musical Cats unexpectedly became a potential worldwide hit in 1981, the producer Cameron Mackintosh called in Martin McCallum, who ran an independent production company, to organise his office.
McCallum, who has died aged 73, did more than that. He collaborated in the management of Mackintosh’s overseas operations and offices in Australia and New York, and worked closely with him on restoring and refurbishing the first two of Mackintosh’s eight West End theatres, the Prince Edward and the Prince of Wales, before he went his own way in 2003.
In the 1980s, he was a very big part of the success of Mackintosh’s four biggest shows: Cats, Les Misérables, The Phantom of the Opera and Miss Saigon. Mackintosh said: “My companies’ ongoing success is in no small part due to the enduring foundations Martin laid so wisely in the 1980s and 90s.”
On Cats, Mackintosh brought in McCallum as a consultant to help him restructure the company to accommodate the international rollout. The production side needed beefing up and he suggested that Mackintosh relocate Nick Allott from the New London, where he was Mackintosh’s theatre manager on Cats, to his then offices above the Fortune theatre; Allott became McCallum’s successor as Mackintosh’s righthand man and remained so until he retired from the fray in 2023. Allott acknowledged how McCallum, importantly, had found ways of financing US tours and making them work efficiently.
While with Mackintosh, Martin was a proactive president of Solt, the Society of London Theatres, initiating a significant report that studied the economic impact of the West End theatre, and his time with the Donmar Warehouse (on the board 1992–2008, and its chair 1996-2004), proved to be a crucial and exciting period, as the venue was launched as an independent producing theatre under the artistic directorship of Sam Mendes.
He also helped Robert Noble finance Matthew Bourne’s New Adventures dance company when it was founded in 2001.
McCallum had worked in regional repertory theatres, and in 1971 joined Laurence Olivier and the National Theatre at the Old Vic. As production manager, he already had an impressive record of experience, and he supervised the technical and practical transfer to the new South Bank building in 1976.
He co-founded his company, the Production Office, with Richard Bullimore in 1978, the year of the production of Evita
that brought him a special friendship with the great US director Hal Prince, and a familiarity with the Prince Edward that made him especially well qualified to oversee the adaptation of that theatre required by Mackintosh. His technical and practical knowledge of working in theatre buildings was equal to that of any theatre architect, and crucial to Mackintosh’s project.
Born in Blackpool, Lancashire, Martin was the son of Jessie (nee Lamb) and Raymond Higgins, a greengrocer. The family, with his older sister Barbara, moved south from Manchester to Farnham in Surrey, where he was educated at Frensham Heights, a progressive school with a special bias in the arts, and Guildford Technical College.
His first job, at the Farnham rep as an assistant stage manager in 1967, paid him £1 a week. It could have been £100 as far as his father was concerned, who dubbed all “arts people” ne’er-do-wells.
At Farnham, where he also played small parts, he changed his surname to McCallum because of Equity rules and, as the network of rep theatres disintegrated in the late 1960s, he ended up lighting and designing shows.
Mackintosh acquired the Prince Edward – and the Prince of Wales – theatres from Bernard Delfont in 1991 and as McCallum, now working for Mackintosh, had “brought back” the Prince Edward (which had been a cinema and a variety house known as the London Casino) for the producer Robert Stigwood on Evita, he was well primed in what was required in the refurbishment.
The project became an architectural rebuild, with McCallum working closely with the architect Nick Thompson on improving the auditorium by linking the levels with new slips (side seats) and boxes, reducing the ungainly width and creating more opportunities for decoration. It was – and remains – a masterpiece of renovation, and one of the great new houses for musical theatre in London.
The Prince Edward and Prince of Wales were 1930s art deco buildings. McCallum was involved in the restoration of the Prince of Wales to the extent of drawing on his involvement in two German theatre projects in Stuttgart and Duisburg, which featured the intervention of flying boxes and loge seats in two modernist, featureless halls, and the use of metal and mesh that could enliven the box fronts when appropriately lit.
The work in the German theatres was done because, in the mid-1990s, Mackintosh was producing in them that country’s premieres of Miss Saigon and Les Misérables. He wanted them to have the improved intimacy of the Prince Edward, which had been completed in two phases by the time Mary Poppins opened in 2004, and the plans for linking the auditorium to the stage in a system of boxes and auditorium adjustments in the Prince of Wales, which was completed in the same year. So, in a sense, the plan for his first two London theatres as an owner was previewed in two German houses that needed to be remodelled as congenial, sympathetic theatres.
While supervising a tour of Cats in Australia, Martin met his third wife, Mary Ann Rolfe, a theatre publicist. They married in 1989 and, after the professional separation from Mackintosh in 2003, he moved permanently to Sydney, where he designed and built his own house on Palm Beach. He also created a rustic retreat on the mountainside in the village of Tilba Tilba on the south coast. Though he served on the board of the Sydney Theatre Company (2005-14), he became more taken up with the natural world.
McCallum’s three marriages ended in divorce. In 1971 he married the actor Lesley Nunnerley, and they had two children, Toby and Sophie. In 1986 he married Julie Edmett, a dancer in the original Cats, and they had a daughter, Amy. With Rolfe he had two sons, Gabriel and Fabian; they divorced in 2005. He is survived by his partner of the last decade, Gwynne Jones, a yoga teacher, and his children.

MT0YHCLZ4G_44JMFGYRV2IEM8A,US elected officials avoiding topics of abortion and gun control over fear of threats,Ed Pilkington,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/25/us-legislators-elected-officials-abortion-gun-control,"Tens of thousands of state legislators and elected local officials are avoiding hot-button policy issues such as abortion and gun control because they are fearful of the backlash of intimidating abuse, a new report has found.
A major survey by the Brennan Center for Justice released on Thursday warned that the spate of extremist intimidation that has been seen nationally in the US, epitomized by the attack on the Capitol building on 6 January 2021, is also sweeping local and state politics. In the fallout, elected individuals are limiting their interactions with constituents and narrowing the contentious topics they are prepared to take on.
Some are even contemplating quitting public life altogether. Such chilling of public discourse poses a threat to the functioning of representative democracy at every level of government, the Brennan Center, a non-partisan authority on law and policy, concludes.
The center conducted a survey of 350 state legislators and more than 1,350 local officeholders working in towns, municipalities and county government. It found that more than 40% of state lawmakers had experienced threats or attacks in the past three years, while almost one in five local officials faced the same abuse over 18 months.
Almost one in 10 state legislators reported that they had been intimidated by a person wielding a weapon. Many others faced death threats, including one state lawmaker who said they had received a message that provided granular detail down to the date, time and precise location where an attack would take place.
The abuse is often directly related to the policy positions that elected individuals have adopted over contentious issues such as gun control and abortion. That in turn is having a withering impact on the democratic process, the Brennan Center warns.
Some 39% of locally elected officials and more than one in five state lawmakers said they were less willing to advocate for contentious policies for fear of abuse. When those figures are extrapolated for all public servants in state and local government, many tens of thousands of officials are affected.
At a time when the US is experiencing record numbers of mass shootings, gun regulations were repeatedly mentioned as an area in which lawmakers were holding back for fear of attack. Kelly Cassidy, a Democratic representative in the Illinois legislature, told the researchers that she decided not to lead bills that would introduce safety controls on firearms because “my kids were too little, the threats were too common and too on point”.
Public service is being distorted in other ways. Many officials said they are now less likely to participate in public events, post on social media, visit public spaces when off-duty or bring their family members with them, or make media appearances.
A similar pattern has been seen on the national stage, with politicians becoming increasingly wary of confronting controversial subjects. Liz Cheney, the former leading Republican in the US House of Representatives who was herself forced out of her Wyoming seat in retaliation for her criticisms of Donald Trump, has alleged that some of her party colleagues voted not to impeach Trump over his role in the Capital insurrection because they were afraid for their lives.
Concern for the safety of elected individuals has become a top priority for the US attorney general, Merrick Garland, as the country enters the 2024 presidential election year. On 5 January he convened a meeting at the justice department to discuss increasing protection for all public servants, from law enforcement personnel, members of Congress and judges, to election workers.
Garland said the country was seeing “a deeply disturbing spike in threats against those who serve the public”. The abuse threatened “the fabric of our democracy”.
Kristine Reeves, a Democratic lawmaker from Washington state, told the Guardian that as the first Black woman elected to the state house in 2016 she now has to think carefully before addressing hard political topics. She recently introduced a bill that would disqualify anyone convicted of acts of insurrection from running for state office under the 14th amendment of the US constitution.
The blowback has been extreme, she said. “White men have come online and told me that I need to be hanged. They have called my office and suggested that me and my family need to watch out because we’ve got what’s coming to us. It’s one thing to take those risks on for yourself; it’s completely another to do so knowing that you’re putting your family in harm’s way.”
Reeves belongs to a demographic group that is bearing the brunt of the incipient political violence sweeping the US. The Brennan survey shows that women – and women of colour in particular – are disproportionately likely to endure severe abuse, often of a sexual nature and frequently with the threats extending to their families including children.
Reeves and her election campaigns team have been forced to limit contact with the public. They have curtailed the canvassing of citizens during elections – a bedrock of US democracy – with door knocking increasingly replaced by phone banking, mail outs and virtual events.
When canvassers do go out, Reeves encourages them to travel in pairs and to avoid knocking on doors alone. “It sounds crazy to say this out loud as a woman of colour, but if we have a Black man going out, we encourage him to go with a white counterpart, just to ensure that there’s a de-escalation opportunity.”
Canvassers are also handed pepper spray in case of attacks. Reeves herself was abused on a doorstep recently when she was called the N-word.
As the election year unfolds, the volatile language and imagery used by Trump at his rallies and in fundraising communications is raising concern about what might lie ahead. Trump has taken to calling convicted rioters from the January 6 insurrection “hostages”.
In a recent fundraising email the Trump campaign offered supporters free “Make America great again” knives, with “razor-sharp, 3.5[in]” flick blades. The knives are recommended for “military personnel”, “tactical enthusiasts”, and “law enforcement” and are described as a “symbol of patriotic pride” that are perfect for “self-defense”."
MU3F2QY6XF_9NPH35R6PO4CT3H,EU foreign policy chief says Israel failed to engage with Brussels peace summit,Lisa O'Carroll,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/22/eu-foreign-policy-chief-vows-to-push-for-two-state-solution-in-middle-east,"One of the EU’s most senior diplomats has criticised the Israeli foreign minister for not properly engaging with a summit in Brussels designed to pave the way for a peace plan in the Middle East.
Josep Borrell, the EU’s high representative for foreign affairs, told reporters Israel Katz had come to the meeting to present plans for an artificial island off the coast of Gaza and a railway to India, concepts that had nothing to do with the peace talks.
Borrell said: “We had had the pleasure of watching two very interesting videos, one about an artificial island project to serve as a port … and another one about a project to build a railroad line linking the Middle East with India, which also seemed to us to be very interesting.
“I think the minister could have made better use of his time to worry about the security of his country and the high number of deaths in the Middle East and the high death toll in Gaza.”
The EU foreign policy chief has said he is determined to pursue a two-state solution in the Middle East, whether Israel is ready to participate or not.
“Peace is a very general objective, nobody would say they are against peace; in our view we should stop talking about peace in the Middle East but talk about specifics, about the two-state solution,” he said. “If Israel does not want the solution, it is going to be difficult for them to take part … but it does not stop others taking part.”
His remarks came a day after the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, reaffirmed a hard line against the establishment of any Palestinian state on the grounds it would pose “an existential danger” to Israel.
Alluding to Israel’s stated objective of annihilating Hamas in its three-month-old war in the Gaza Strip, Borrell told reporters: “What are the other solutions they have in mind? Make all the Palestinians leave? Kill all of them? … The way they are destroying Hamas is not the way to do it. They are sealing the hate for generations.”
Katz, and his Palestinian counterpart, Riyad al-Maliki, made separate appearances at the monthly gathering of EU foreign ministers, which was also being attended by counterparts from Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Jordan, and the Arab League secretary general.
Katz came to the conference asking for the EU to renew focus on the fight to free the estimated 130 people who were seized on 7 October by Hamas and remain hostages. “Our brave soldiers are fighting in very hard conditions for those two aims: to bring back our hostages and restore security for the citizens of Israel,” he said in a brief statement before attending the summit.
The talks centred on a 12-point discussion paper about establishing a two-state solution.
Netanyahu has sought to obstruct the establishment of a Palestinian state throughout his political career. Nevertheless, his rejection of any moves to establish a state when Israel ends its offensive against Gaza caused consternation and represented his sharpest rebuttal yet of US and EU foreign policy.
EU foreign ministers lined up to denounce the Israeli leader as they arrived at the Brussels summit.
The Irish foreign minister, Micheál Martin, said Netanyahu’s insistence there would be no two-state solution was unacceptable while Stéphane Séjourné, France’s new foreign and European affairs minister, described his remarks as worrying.
“All those who say they don’t want to hear about such a solution have not brought any alternative,” the German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said.
The Jordanian foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, told reporters the war could no longer continue and that a two-state solution was the “only path”.
“We have engaged in over 30 years of process and look where that has got us,” Safadi said, referring to intermittent Israeli-Palestinian peace talks since the 1990s. “A moment of truth is upon us. Do we allow a radical racist agenda to dictate the future or come together and say the path is clear, we want peace for everybody?”
The EU paper does not offer any solutions or details but suggests that at a future peace conference participants should spell out “consequences” for both sides, depending on whether they accept or reject a plan approved by the gathering. It does not say what these consequences might be, although the EU has some areas of potential leverage.
The bloc is a major provider of economic aid to Palestinians and has a broad cooperation agreement with Israel that includes a free-trade area. Some officials have privately suggested the latter arrangement could be used to influence Israel."
MWN7KLNNNW_D3I4GK0J4CTUVAB,Online travel agent allows customers to filter out Boeing 737 Max planes,Alex Hern,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/23/online-travel-agent-allows-customers-to-filter-out-boeing-737-max-planes,"A leading online travel agent has added filters to let users exclude flights that use Boeing’s troubled 737 Max planes, after a piece of fuselage falling off an Alaska Airlines flight led to a surge of user interest in avoiding the airliners.
Kayak first introduced an aircraft filter in March 2019, to add and exclude specific models of plane, but the company says it saw little use compared with the more prominent filters of the number of stops or airports.
Following the Alaska Airlines incident, it says there was a 15-fold increase in use of the original filter, prompting it to rework the setting, making it more prominent on the search page and adding the ability to distinguish between 737 Max 8 and Max 9 planes, since only the latter has been grounded by America’s Federal Aviation Administration.
“Whether you’re searching by cabin class, flight quality or aircraft type, Kayak’s filters aim to provide travellers with all the information they need to make smart decisions and travel with confidence,” a company spokesperson said.
The surge of interest in the new feature demonstrates the unusual extent to which typical travellers are actively avoiding the 737 Max planes. Such filters are more commonly used by regular travellers with esoteric preferences around particular seat locations on various planes, rather than a broad-brush fear of an entire family of jets.
On Sunday, the FAA expanded its scrutiny of Boeing jets to another, older model of 737, the 737-900ER, which it says uses a similar door design. “The safety of the flying public, not speed, will determine the timeline for returning these aircraft to service,” it said.
In response, United Airlines, which has 79 737 Max 9s and a further 136 737-900ERs in its fleet, issued a profit warning. The airline has more of the affected planes than any other, and it forecasts that it will not be able to fly them again until at least February. In its annual earning report on Tuesday, United reported flat pre-tax profits of $3.4bn for 2023, but said it expected to lose money in the coming quarter."
MWRVH7SQP5_4XINQ21ORGDRACD,"Indictments fueled extremists’ support for Trump, survey finds",Rachel Leingang,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/26/trump-criminal-charges-increase-support-extremist-republican,"The criminal charges against Donald Trump have fueled increased radical support for the former president while his efforts to paint the government and Democrats as a threat to democracy have convinced more people to distrust democratic institutions.
New survey results from the University of Chicago’s Chicago Project on Security & Threats (CPOST) shows increased violent support for Trump aligns with the indictments, as did the erosion of support for democratic norms. Court cases using the 14th amendment to try to keep Trump off the ballot could further erode confidence in the political system, regardless of how the supreme court rules on the issue, the survey found.
Support for democratic norms has gone from “bad to worse”, said Robert Pape, a professor at the University of Chicago who directs CPOST. The two ideas are connected: The more a person believes the system is corrupt or rigged, the more likely they are to support using violence instead of the political system.
“Once you think you live in a corrupt political system, then you give up on politics as a solution and you go for violence,” Pape said.
While 50% of survey respondents said Trump was a threat to democracy, now 36% said the same of Democratic president Joe Biden. That means Trump’s attempt to twist messaging is working: the former president has repeatedly attacked Biden in recent months as Biden warns of the threat Trump poses to democracy after Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. Trump has called Biden a “threat to democracy” and a “destroyer” of democracy.
Effectively, Trump has turned a losing issue for himself, the future of democracy, into much less of a liability, particularly among Republicans.
“His new argument … is that the institutions of government are unfairly targeting him,” Pape said. “And what this data is showing is that he is actually persuading significant numbers of people on this issue.”
Support for violence has also increased across the political spectrum, a sign of intense polarization and weakened beliefs in the political system. The percentage of people who believe using force would be justified to keep Trump from being president again is higher, at 9.6%, than the percentage of people willing to use force to restore Trump to the presidency, at 6.5%.
Through the 2024 election, CPOST will be releasing new survey data tracking continued dangers to democracy every quarter. The data will be published first with the Guardian.
The survey results cut across various questions about the state of American democracy. Now, 50% of survey participants said political elites, both Republicans and Democrats, are the most immoral and corrupt people in America, up from 42% a year ago. And 63% said they agreed that a small group of elites controls all the levers of power and enriches themselves at the cost of normal Americans, up from 54% last January.
Support for conspiracy theories has increased during that time as well: 22% now believe Biden stole the 2020 election, up from 21%; 30% believe the Democratic party is trying to replace the current electorate with more obedient voters from the third world, up from 21%; and 14% believe a secret group of Satan-worshipping pedophiles is ruling the US government, up from 11%.
They are also more likely to support the use of violence to achieve political goals now compared with one year ago. 16% said the use of force is justified to coerce Congress, up from 9%, while 6.5% said force would be justified to return Trump to the White House, compared with 4.5% last January. On abortion rights, 9% said force would be justified to restore them, up from 8%.
Supporters of Trump who also believe in using violence to achieve their political goals are statistically much more likely to believe democratic institutions are deeply corrupt: 68% of that subgroup believe the 2020 election was stolen; 56% say their party has virtually no chance of winning elections in 2024 because the system is rigged and 81% think the prosecutions of Trump are intended to hurt his electoral prospects this year.
Those radical Trump supporters are the most likely to move toward violence if they don’t achieve their goals through the political process, Pape said. And depending on how Trump himself fares politically, he could instigate or orchestrate violence as well, he said.

“If Trump is put in jail, in prison, then his radical support is likely to go up,” Pape said. “And that’s where political violence is most likely to happen from the right.”
The 14th amendment cases, where left-leaning groups have filed lawsuits seeking to remove Trump from the ballot for violating the 14th Amendment by participating in an insurrection while an officer of the US, could exacerbate the political violence problem, no matter which way the case is decided by the US supreme court.
There’s an extreme partisan divide on the issue. For Democrats, 78% support disqualifying Trump from the ballot. For Republicans, 72% believe removing him would be an assault on democracy, with 16% of Republicans saying it would justify the use of force to restore him to the White House.
“There’s a real risk that whatever the supreme court decides is going to be viewed as illegitimate by one side or the other in the 14th amendment controversy,” Pape said.
There’s a subset of Republicans, 14%, that support disqualifying Trump. Of that group, 24% already plan to vote for Biden, while 71% said they wouldn’t vote for Trump. The group is heavily college-educated. Pape said this group is “enough to swing 2024” and serves as a “critical vulnerability for Trump” that his opponents could target in key states.
In order to subdue any claims of illegitimacy, the court itself should work to publicly explain its reasoning and make the case that its decision was based on the facts of the case, Pape said.
“This is why democracies fade into authoritarianism. These are the issues, ” he said."
MYEKZBKPR0_45WA2N4B1KI6B3V,Nick Kelly obituary,_,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/jan/24/nick-kelly-obituary,"My friend Nick Kelly, who has taken his own life aged 52, was a music writer, journalist and photographer who managed to combine critical acumen with good humour and kindness, an uncommon skill. Nick worked for various publications in the UK and Ireland, conveying his huge knowledge of, and enthusiasm for, various bands and artists in crisp and entertaining prose.
I first met him in 1993 at University College Dublin, where we bonded over a shared love of what was then called “independent” music, of books and writing, and of talking gibberish in Dublin’s bars.
Nick was born in Dublin, and educated at Terenure college, then University College Dublin. He was one of the five children of Yvonne (nee Wheaton), who had worked in a tailor’s before her marriage, and was originally from Southend-on-Sea, and Donal Kelly, an accountant. Nick and his older brother Joe, his gig-going comrade, must have been to every music venue in Britain and Ireland.
His first gig – the Smiths, in 1984 – was one of those adolescent events that form the adult life, a before/after moment that in retrospect can be understood as pivotal. He remained a lifelong fan of Morrissey, but he loved all sorts of music, from the jangling guitars of the cult Dublin band the Revenants to the wry melancholia of Americana artists such as Richmond Fontaine.
On leaving university, Nick started his journalism career at Hot Press magazine. After time freelancing for publications including the Times, Melody Maker and Word, he became a staff journalist at the Irish Independent in 2003, writing a well-regarded music column along with pieces on travel and comedy.
Eventually, Nick moved on from the Irish Independent and took his journalism to various online publications. He did, however, miss the people and solidarity he had so enjoyed while at the newspaper. A move to Barcelona in 2021 re-inspired him, and he spent happy days photographing that city, getting quiet joy, as he always did, from observing the small things: the morning sunlight dappling a building, how a tree might bend in the wind.
For personal reasons, he returned to Ireland and moved to the town of New Ross in Wexford. There he rediscovered, and found some consolation in, the rituals of the Catholic church that had been so important to him as a boy.Nick was utterly without affectation or swagger; he had to be prompted to tell anecdotes of his encounters with the famous and of his journalistic adventures. A genuine romantic and idealist, he retained, as a friend of his wrote, something close to, but more hard-earned than, a childlike wonder for the world and the people in it. Modest and self-effacing, he was always ready to talk, laugh and to take a day as it came.

With the fate of US aid for Ukraine hanging in the balance, the outlook for border compromise had appeared grim following reports on Wednesday night that the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, was walking away from a compromise that he suggested could “undermine” Trump’s chances in a November general election against Joe Biden. But by Thursday afternoon, senators involved in the discussions were insisting that the opposite was true: an agreement was in sight and legislative text could be released in the coming days.
According to a report in Punchbowl News, McConnell told Republicans in a closed-door meeting on Wednesday night that the “politics on this have changed”. With Trump as their likely standard bearer, McConnell reportedly indicated that it would be unwise to move forward with a bipartisan immigration deal that could possibly neutralize an issue that has become one of Biden’s biggest potential vulnerabilities. Referring to Trump as the party’s “nominee”, McConnell added: “We don’t want to do anything to undermine him.”
“That’s like parallel universe shit,” Senator Thom Tillis, a Republican of North Carolina involved in the negotiations, fumed to reporters on Thursday. “That didn’t happen.”
It would amount to a surprising about-face for McConnell, a strong supporter of sending aid to Ukraine and no friend of the former president, who has leveled racist broadsides against McConnell’s wife, Elaine Chao, and mercilessly disparaged the Republican leader as an “old crow”.
At the Capitol on Thursday, McConnell told Bloomberg News that the immigration talks were “ongoing”. Later McConnell reportedly assured his confused conference that he was “fully onboard” with the negotiations, and brushed aside reports that suggested otherwise.
The proposal under discussion in Congress would significantly change immigration policy with the aim of discouraging migration, amid a record flow of people arriving at the US southern border. It would include major concessions from Democrats on immigration in exchange for Republican support on passing military assistance to Israel and Ukraine, a country whose cause the party’s far right has turned against.
But the politics of a deal have only become more challenging as Trump consolidates support from Republican officials in what many view as his inevitable march toward the GOP nomination.
On social media, Trump implored Mike Johnson, the arch-conservative House speaker, not to accept a deal “unless we get EVERYTHING needed to shut down the INVASION of Millions and Millions of people”.
Failure to strike a deal would have global implications, with the Pentagon warning that Ukrainian soldiers on the frontlines of its grinding war with Russia risk running out of ammunition. The Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, has said the “future of the war in Ukraine” and the “security of our western democracy” depend on Congress reaching an agreement.
Biden had requested tens of billions of dollars from Congress to send aid to Ukraine and Israel as well as to allies in the Asia Pacific region. But the funding package has been stalled for months in Congress amid Republican demands for dramatic changes to border policy.
Senate Republicans who support the border talks said the party should seize the opportunity to address the situation at the border, which both parties and the White House have described as a crisis.
“I think the border is a very important issue for Donald Trump,” the Utah senator Mitt Romney, a Republican who has pressed his party to approve military aid for Ukraine, told reporters on Capitol Hill on Thursday. “And the fact that he would communicate to Republican senators and congresspeople that he doesn’t want us to solve the border problem because he wants to blame Biden for it is really appalling.”
He continued: “The reality is that we have a crisis at the border, the American people are suffering as a result of what’s happening at the border. And someone running for president ought to try and get the problem solved as opposed to saying: ‘Hey, save that problem. Don’t solve it. Let me take credit for solving it later.’”

Even in less contentious times, immigration ranks as one of the thorniest issues in American politics, and efforts to reform the nation’s outdated system have failed repeatedly. But as an unprecedented number of people fleeing violence, poverty and natural disasters seek refuge at the US-Mexico border, the issue has become top of mind for many Americans who overwhelmingly disapprove of the Biden administration’s handling of the matter.
Trump has already made immigration a central issue of his campaign, outlining a draconian vision for his second term that includes mass raids, detentions camps and more funding to build his long-promised wall along the border with Mexico.
Trump’s allies on Capitol Hill have argued that a bipartisan deal would only serve to give Biden political cover without actually solving the problem. Others argue that the Senate plan was designed to force the hand of the Republican-controlled House, where the speaker is under pressure from the far-right flank of his party not to compromise on the issue.
At a press conference earlier this week, the Texas senator Ted Cruz, a Republican, denounced the proposal, the details of which have not yet been released, as a “stinking pile of crap” that “represents Senate Republican leadership waging war on House Republicans”.
Cruz alleged that the negotiators involved cared only about supporting Ukraine and not fixing the issues at the southern border.
If a deal falls apart, Schumer and Biden will be forced to look for alternative legislative paths to approving aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. But with Republicans demanding border security measures in exchange for their votes, it remains far from certain that tying the aid to must-pass spending bills or bringing it to the floor as a standalone measure would garner the necessary 60 votes in the Senate.
The world will likely know soon whether a deal is possible, the Connecticut senator Chris Murphy, one of the Democratic negotiators, told reporters on Thursday.
“I think the Republican Congress is going to make a decision in the next 24 hours as to whether they actually want to get something done or whether they want to leave the border a mess for political reasons,” he said."
N8DQ8XQNHN_OECWX0KOFVK3M1T,Why is knife crime back in the news and what is being proposed?,Rajeev Syal,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/25/why-is-knife-back-in-the-news-and-what-is-being-proposed,"Tackling knife crime has become an urgent political debate after Valdo Calocane admitted to the manslaughter of three people in Nottingham, denying murder on the grounds of diminished responsibility.
Last June he fatally stabbed Barnaby Webber and Grace O’Malley-Kumar, both 19-year-old students, and a school caretaker, Ian Coates, 65. On Thursday he was sentenced to indefinite detention in a high-security hospital.
The Conservatives and Labour have unveiled proposals for tackling the rise in knife crime – a tacit acknowledgment that it is of deepening public concern in an election year.
The government has announced plans to close a legal loophole and ban the sale of “zombie” knives.
Amendments to the criminal justice bill will raise the maximum sentence for the possession of banned weapons from six months to two years and give police the power to seize and destroy knives found in homes if there are reasonable grounds to suspect they will be used for serious crime.
Previous attempts to ban zombie knives defined them under the Offensive Weapons Act 2019 as having a cutting edge and a serrated edge and “images or words that suggest that it is to be used for the purpose of violence”. The new law will ban zombie knives with no threatening words or images.
The new rules were introduced to parliament on Thursday but the government has been criticised because they will not take effect until September. This is the government’s third attempt at banning the weapons since 2016.
The parents of O’Malley-Kumar’s mother, Sinead O’Malley and Sanjoy Kumar, have made impassioned calls for mandatory prison sentences for carrying a knife.
Idris Elba, the actor and knife crime campaigner, has cautioned against this, saying there is no “one size fits all” that would banish weapons.
According to the sentencing council, possessing a weapon would result in a maximum sentence of four years’ custody, but there is no mandatory sentence.
Those caught threatening with a weapon would receive the mandatory minimum sentence of six months in custody, the council says.
Elba has expressed concern that there are still loopholes that allow people to carry some swords.
Campaigners have called for tougher rules on swords after Ronan Kanda, a 16-year-old Wolverhampton boy, was stabbed by a fellow pupil with a 55cm (22in) “ninja blade” in November 2022.
Chris Philp, the policing minister, has conceded that some swords will not qualify under the new ban, owing to the difficulty of differentiating between those that could be used for violence and those that are kept for historical or religious reasons.
Philp said some swords would be banned under the latest rules, which target weapons of more than 20cm that have a serrated edge, holes or multiple sharp points. “But a regular sword, like the sort a historic soldier might carry, would probably not qualify. It would depend on the design,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.
Figures published by the Office for National Statistics on Thursday revealed that knife crime rose by 5% in the year to September 2023, with a total of 48,716 offences. The ONS said there was a “notable” increase in robberies involvng a knife, up by 20%.
Ministers have resisted calls for mandatory sentences, saying it is right to allow judges to use their discretion about whether to lock up first-time offenders, with mandatory sentencing reserved for second offences.
Labour is focusing on a youth programme to tackle knife crime, pledging £100m for a nationwide initiative to support young people at risk of being drawn into violence. Alongside the programme, it is promising “real consequences” for those who offend, with an end to “empty warnings and apology letters” for those guilty of possession.
The leader, Keir Starmer, likened the intervention to SureStart, a policy of the New Labour government to deliver services and support to young children and their families."
NABAR5WSKI_3OGMYMLGX3FJECV,UN staff on £1.5bn Iraq aid project ‘demanding bribes’,Simona Foltyn,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/jan/22/united-nations-development-programme-undp-bribery-claims-iraq-aid-project,"Staff working for the UN in Iraq are allegedly demanding bribes in return for helping businessmen win contracts on postwar reconstruction projects in the country, a Guardian investigation has found.
The alleged kickbacks are one of a number of claims of corruption and mismanagement the Guardian has uncovered in the Funding Facility for Stabilization, a United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) scheme launched in 2015 and backed by $1.5bn (£1.2bn) in support so far from 30 donors, including the UK.
Since the 2003 US-led invasion, the international community has pumped billions of aid dollars into Iraq. Twenty years on, the country still suffers from poor services and infrastructure, despite being the world’s fourth-largest oil producer and generating a record-breaking $115bn in oil revenues last year.
Corruption and kickbacks have been described as “the lifeblood of politics in Iraq”, which is why the UN carries out projects directly, promising more transparency than local institutions. In a statement to the Guardian, the UNDP said it had “internal mechanisms that prevent and detect corruption and mismanagement, supported by robust compliance procedures and internal controls”.
But interviews with more than two dozen current and former UN employees, contractors, Iraqi and western officials suggest the UN is fuelling the culture of bribery that has permeated Iraqi society since Saddam Hussein’s overthrow in 2003.
The Guardian has found that bribes of up to 15% of the contract value have been demanded by UNDP staff, according to three employees and four contractors. In return, the employee helps the contractor navigate the UNDP’s complex bidding system to ensure they pass the vetting process.
“Nobody can get a contract without paying. There’s nothing in this country you can get without paying, not from the government, not from UNDP,” according to one contractor, who told the Guardian they had been approached by UNDP staff demanding bribes.
A UNDP employee said the deals were made in person rather than on paper to avoid detection, with influential Iraqis sometimes serving as guarantors. “The third party also takes a share of the kickback,” they said, adding that the contractors would “choose people with relationships and power”.
Government officials entrusted by the UNDP to oversee construction projects also allegedly take a cut. Contractors and UNDP staff who have overseen projects said officials used that authority to “extort” bribes from companies in return for signing off completed projects. Two contractors told the Guardian that they were forced to make such payments. In its statement, the UNDP said it took allegations of corruption and lack of transparency very seriously and had “zero tolerance for fraud and corruption”.The UN agency said: “This policy applies equally to UNDP staff members, as well as other personnel, vendors, implementing partners, and responsible parties engaged by UNDP. Any allegation of bribery, corruption, or fraud is thoroughly assessed and, where appropriate, investigated by UNDP’s independent Office of Audit and Investigation.” As well as corruption, funds have been spent on redundancies and the UN’s large overheads, raising further questions about what share of the mammoth budget actually reached war-torn communities.
The UNDP said it charged indirect costs in accordance with its financial regulations and rules and the requirements of its executive board.Interviewees, many of whom spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, said the programme had undergone an unwarranted expansion and extension that had mostly served to sustain the UNDP’s footprint while absolving the Iraqi government of its own obligations to rebuild the country.
They described a perverse incentive structure in which UN employees who wanted to “keep their cushy salaries” colluded with government officials who benefit financially to identify new projects, with progress reports embellishing results to justify more funding.
The UNDP claims to have improved the lives of 8.9 million Iraqis – a fifth of the country’s population. But the Guardian’s visit to project sites suggests that some of these numbers may have been overstated.

In a village in northern Iraq, a UNDP sign outside the local health centre claimed credit for its rehabilitation. But the facility, which suffered only light damage when Iraqi forces drove out Islamic State militants in 2017, was restored by two other organisations.
By the time the UNDP turned up, the clinic had been functioning again for two years. In what appears to be a digression from the original goal to rebuild damaged facilities, the UNDP built a new annexe for a laboratory and X-ray facility. But the premises stood empty in October, with locals complaining that for two years the UNDP had failed to deliver on promises to equip the new departments.In contrast, a UNDP report in 2022 said the facility had been completed and was, alongside other clinics in the province, serving thousands of Iraqis. But that figure appears to be based on census data provided by the government rather than actual usage.The UNDP said that it adhered to the technical and financial reporting requirements specified in agreements with each donor.
Donors have agreed to extend the programme for another two years and want some of the remaining funds to be redirected towards social and institutional development. But interviewees have described training and workshops run by the UNDP under such initiatives as “trivial” and “lacking strategic coherence”.Sessions were attended by government officials and community members mostly for the sake of enjoying a free trip and cashing in allowances, the Guardian was told. “UNDP just wants to burn the money and show the donor that they are doing the workshops,” said one former employee.A former employee described a UNDP livelihoods initiative that taught displaced women to sew as “unrealistic” because Iraqis tended to buy cheap, imported clothes from local markets. “They were trying to create an economy that didn’t exist. It was like going back to medieval times,” they added.The UNDP said initiatives such as skills training were developed based on community needs and in full consultation with local authorities or community leaders.Donors have admitted to struggling to track how their funding has been spent and rely on the UNDP to carry out monitoring and evaluation through an internal unit the agency described as “completely independent”, even though it reports to the UNDP’s management.
Five interviewees familiar with the UNDP’s reporting said it did not reflect reality on the ground. “A lot of these documents are mostly for PR purposes,” said a consultant who carried out an external review of another UNDP scheme. “When you actually go to these provinces and sit down with the recipients of these funds and you actually look at the projects, it’s a far cry from what you perceive from reading these reports.”Embassy staff, insulated behind concrete walls and only allowed limited field visits due to strict security protocol, appear to lack the means to challenge the information. “Everyone stays just two years and by the time they figure it out, they leave,” said a western official. “That’s how these programmes survive year on year.”
In response to the Guardian’s request for comment, an adviser to the Iraq prime minister, Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, said that if allegations of corruption in the UNDP programme and the involvement of government agencies were proven to be true, legal action would be taken.Farhad Alaaldin said: “We will communicate with the highest authorities at the UN to discuss and investigate the details of these allegations and refer those involved in corruption to the competent authorities. We will also review all programmes to find out the truth.”"
NDJ5XEN438_8IEFRZQP0MBJELD,GM’s Cruise reveals dual US probes into grisly collision and company’s response,_,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/25/self-driving-car-cruise-probe-gm-collision,"GM’s Cruise self-driving car unit on Thursday revealed US Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission probes stemming from an October collision in which one of its autonomous vehicles dragged a pedestrian who had been struck by another vehicle.
Cruise reported the government investigations in a blog post in which the company also vowed to reform its culture stemming from a “failure of leadership” around the incident. The blog post did not disclose the status of the victim, who was dragged 20ft by the vehicle, nor the scope of the justice department and SEC probes.
Cruise’s four-page post cited “inadequate and uncoordinated internal processes, mistakes in judgment, an ‘us versus them’ mentality with government officials, and a fundamental misunderstanding of regulatory requirements and expectations”. More than 100 people knew details of the incident prior to Cruise’s meetings with regulators, the report found.
Cruise said a report it commissioned from the law firm Quinn Emanuel found that the evidence did not establish that Cruise leadership or employees “sought to intentionally mislead or hide from regulators the details” of the 2 October incident. The safety review concerned the incident and did not broadly examine corporate culture or protocols.
A separate technical review by engineering firm Exponent found that the Cruise vehicle experienced mapping errors and incorrectly identified hitting the woman as a side-impact collision, the blog post stated. Cruise has updated its software. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is also investigating the crash.
Since the incident, Cruise has fired nine executives; its CEO and a co-founder resigned; and it cut a quarter of its staff. California suspended the company’s permission to operate autonomous vehicles in the state in October. The company recalled all its cars in November.
In December, California regulators said Cruise could face $1.5m in fines and additional sanctions for not fully disclosing details of the incident, in which a woman was initially struck by a human-driven auto before being dragged by the Cruise vehicle, prompting them to suspend the company’s permit to operate.
In the blog post summarizing a more than 100-page report, Cruise characterized its response to the incident as mistakes made by a relatively new company inexperienced in dealing with regulators, the media and the public.
The company initially provided regulators with video of the incident but no verbal context such as mentioning that the woman was dragged 23ft (7 metres). Instead it let the video “speak for itself”, according to the blog post. In three meetings, internet troubles prevented regulators from fully viewing the video and the report indicates company officials did not seek to fix the issue.
Quinn Emanuel interviewed 88 people and reviewed 200,000 documents, according to the blog post.
Cruise once operated hundreds of self-driving taxis in California, Texas and other locations, hoping to generate meaningful revenue while perfecting the technology for a broader rollout.
Trying to correct what it saw as inaccurate media portrayals of the October incident, Cruise omitted information and provided “incomplete facts” and video to the press and public, according to the blog post. The post did not make clear how those actions fit with the broader assertion that there was no intent to mislead.
Cruise and GM came under heavy criticism after Cruise failed to promptly disclose details of the incident to the California Department of Motor Vehicles. The DMV revoked the company’s permit to operate driverless vehicles on public roads, citing concerns about an inability “to respond in a safe and appropriate manner during incidents involving a pedestrian”.
Cruise has said it plans a return to testing on public streets, but not has not revealed where or when.
GM is spending nearly $2bn a year on Cruise and insists the business represents a “giant growth opportunity”. In June, the GM CEO Mary Barra reiterated a forecast that Cruise could generate $50bn a year in annual revenue by 2030.
Executives will appear before the California public utilities commission on 6 February to answer questions about the report and to help the agency determine an appropriate fine. Cruise had offered $75,000 as a settlement, but the commission is seeking a stiffer penalty.
NHTSA, the CPUC, the California DMV and other regulators were not immediately available for comment on the report.
While Cruise operations are grounded, vehicles from competitor Waymo, a unit of Alphabet, remain a common sight on San Francisco streets; the company has plans to expand to Los Angeles and other markets."
NFTPJR7DV6_BWT4R76DODDM89H,Nikki Haley has been running to lead a Republican party that no longer exists,Moira Donegan,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/24/nikki-haley-republican-party-new-hampshire-primary,"Can we stop pretending now? After weeks of speculating by the media that perhaps Nikki Haley might eke out a win in New Hampshire – or at least lose by a percentage small enough to make continuing in the race reasonable – she lost by a wide margin.
Before we had been offered various rationales for why, just maybe, this wouldn’t happen. Haley, after all, had recently come into a flush of donor money at the end of 2023, as the field dwindled and she was left alone as the last almost-plausible non-Trump candidate. She’d put much of that money into New Hampshire, a state whose Republicans tend to hew more moderate. (Haley, a rabid conservative but one who does not seem to oppose the rule of law outright, is what passes for “moderate” in today’s Republican party.)
There was also the force of history to consider, the fact that primary campaigns of either major party do not usually look like this. When there’s such a big field, as there was in this Republican cycle, normally New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation primary can have quite a bit of sway, helping to advance the strongest contenders and cull the stragglers.
But this year there were only two people really running by the time New Hampshire rolled around, and one of them loomed much larger than the other – both in fundraising and in his power to animate the public. It was like watching a race between a whale and a minnow: he lapped her without seeming to try.
One word for the 2024 Republican primary contest is “anticlimactic”. But considering how completely Trump has captured the imagination of his party, it is possible that the real story is not about how easily he has trounced his challengers, but that there were so many challengers in the first place.
What possessed so many Republicans to run against Trump? Were they delusional? Hopeful? Cynical? Had they missed the memo on what their party had become – a personality cult devoted in total service to one man? Or did they think, somehow, that he was weaker than he was?
Perhaps this was the idea of the Trump imitators. Whiny, pleading Ron DeSantis hoped that if he demonstrated enough cruelty in Florida, his home state, Republican voters might admire him as strong, and forget how annoying he is. He was Trump without the charm.
Nasally, scheming Vivek Ramaswamy attempted to channel Trump’s snake-oil salesman pitch for nostalgia, punishment of enemies and exaggerated promises; he was Trump without the movement.
Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey best known for shutting down the George Washington Bridge to punish a mayor who had crossed him, was the only Republican willing to attack Trump, building his campaign around severe, self-serious intonations about the former president’s danger to the nation. But it was impossible to take Christie seriously: he could not convincingly feign honor.
Maybe it was fitting, then, that Haley was the last one standing: though she was equally misguided, she was doing something different from her fellow candidates. Haley’s campaign, focused on a revival of a hawkish neoconservative foreign policy and a comparative de-emphasis of social issues, seemed uncannily retro and anachronistic – a 90s-era Republican wearing a 21st-century blazer set.
Hers was a campaign that talked about a generational shift and played up Haley’s relative youth (she’s 52), but which also seemed to wish for a return to the political past, attempting to proceed as if Trump had never happened. Who could look at today’s Republican party – animated by racist and misogynist zeal, in thrall to short-sightedness and bigotry, harnessed around petty grievances and functionally largely, for its base, to entertain – and think that what such people wanted was a competent, cool-headed and strategic woman of color? Only the most naive people in the world could think that. Haley, at least, was willing to take their money.
In debates, Haley talked about the virtues of foreign military involvement and played up her own discipline and competence. There might be arguments for all this, but they are clearly not arguments that the Republican party base wanted to hear: foreign wars remain unpopular in post-Iraq America. (Trump’s pivot to an “America First” isolationism seems to have returned Republicans to a Lindbergh-esque hostility to the outside world for the foreseeable future.)
And things like competence, self-discipline and hard work are qualities that tend to render women into useful, serviceable minor characters – the sort of background figures who can be useful to a man of showmanship and bombast.
One of the most plausible explanations for Haley’s campaign has always been that she is actually running for vice-president. This might be the role she is best suited to play: that of a bridge between the old-guard establishment Republicans and the new, permanently Trumpist reality.
But it’s unclear how much of a reconciliation is really needed there. After his landslide victory in Iowa, the big donor money has once again flowed to Trump; reporters at Davos issued dispatches detailing how the global rich have made their peace with Trump’s possible return to the White House.
The old-school Republicans that Haley represents have never been as far from Trump as it would benefit their egos to pretend. The national war hawks, the corporate rich: these people do not need the democracy that Trump threatens. And in a few days or weeks, when she inevitably drops out of the race and endorses Trump, Nikki Haley will discover that she can live without it, too.

NKVTD3WJ4E_7UKD3H0EDNUA61F,"Royal Mail could save £650m by moving to three-day-a-week service, says Ofcom",Alex Lawson,_,20240117,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/24/royal-mail-could-save-650m-by-switching-to-three-day-a-week-service-says-ofcom,"Royal Mail could save up to £650m if it delivered letters just three days a week and £200m by stopping Saturday deliveries, the communications regulator has said in its much-anticipated review of the postal service.
Ofcom laid out a series of options for the future of the universal service obligation (USO) – which requires Royal Mail to deliver countrywide, six days a week for a fixed price – including saving an estimated £100m-£200m by going from six to five days a week, or cutting costs by £400m-£650m with a reduction to three days.
The regulator began gathering evidence last year to show how the future of the service might be changed to better suit consumers’ needs, amid a long-term decline in letter volumes and a surge in the number of parcels sent as online shopping has grown.
Ofcom said there was an increasing risk that Royal Mail would become “financially and operationally unsustainable in the long term” given the cost of delivering the USO.
Ofcom stressed it was not recommending specific proposals, but said the two “primary options” on the table were cuts to the number of letter delivery days, or changes that could mean making first- and second-class deliveries take up to three days or longer. That would be accompanied by a next-day service for urgent letters, it said.
The first option would require parliamentary approval, but the second change is within the regulator’s gift. Ofcom has conducted consumer research and modelled Royal Mail’s finances in the review, and will now seek views from interested parties until 3 April.
In consumer polling for Ofcom, 88% of respondents said reliability was important for letter deliveries. This compared with 58% who said a Saturday service was important, down from 63% when research was last conducted in 2020.
Royal Mail has long pushed to be allowed to cut Saturday deliveries, but the government rejected the proposal last year. It emerged last weekend that the move was being studied, and Downing Street indicated it would oppose such a plan. Rishi Sunak reiterated that stance on Wednesday, saying the government was “absolutely committed to ensuring that [the USO] remains as it is”.
Martin Seidenberg, the chief executive of Royal Mail’s parent company, International Distributions Services (IDS), said: “We have been calling on government and Ofcom to tackle this issue for four years, and the lack of action means that we are now facing a much more serious situation.
“While other countries have grasped the opportunity to change, the UK is being left behind. There has been a lot of discussion about dropping Saturday letter deliveries in the UK, but as other countries have shown, there are a range of options to consider.”
In a letter last week to the Commons business and trade committee chair, the Labour MP Liam Byrne, Seidenberg wrote that the USO was “unsustainable” in its current form, and cited similar changes in other European countries.
On Wednesday, Byrne said: “Let’s be absolutely clear: the USO is a vital public service, which is why we’ve called for government to get serious about talks with Royal Mail to agree a plan to secure its future.”

Dave Ward, the general secretary of the Communication Workers Union, said: “We are not resistant to change, but we will not sign up to a three-day universal service obligation, which would destroy Royal Mail as we know and would impact on thousands of jobs.”
Tina McKenzie, the policy and advocacy chair at the Federation of Small Businesses, said: “Trading essential services for short-term savings is a slippery slope that may compromise the trust small businesses place in Royal Mail.”
The Liberal Democrats’ Treasury spokesperson, Sarah Olney, said: “This feels like a slap in the face for so many who already have the pain of delayed deliveries.”
It had been speculated that Ofcom could suggest state subsidies for Royal Mail, but that option was not contained in the review. The company was privatised in 2013, with the government’s final stake sold in 2015. Shares in IDS rose by 4% on Wednesday morning after the review’s publication.
Melanie Dawes, the chief executive of Ofcom, said: “We’re sending half as many letters as we did in 2011, and receiving many more parcels. The universal service hasn’t changed since then; it’s getting out of date and will become unsustainable if we don’t take action.
“So, we’ve set out options for reform so there can be a national discussion about the future of universal post. In the meantime, we’re making sure prices will remain affordable by capping the price of second-class stamps.”"
NPO9C3QHAK_16IY86H8QP65F2G,Denmark admits role in Nato airstrikes on Libya that killed 14 civilians in 2011,Dan Sabbagh,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/25/denmark-admits-role-nato-airstrikes-libya-killed-civilians-2011,"Denmark’s defence ministry said it would launch a review after evidence emerged showing its air force participated in airstrikes on Libya that killed 14 civilians in 2011, the first time any of the 10 countries involved in the Nato bombing campaign has acknowledged a possible link to non-combatant casualties.
Documents released under freedom of information show the Danish air force had concluded privately as long ago as 2012 that two F-16 attacks were connected to civilian casualty reports compiled by the UN, media and human rights groups.
However, this acknowledgment was not made public at the time, effectively preventing a relative of the Libyans killed from seeking compensation or redress, because he did not know which country may have been behind the bombing.
Nato attacks involving Danish fighter jets in which non-combatants were killed include:
An airstrike on Surman, nearly 40 miles west of Tripoli, on 20 June 2011 that killed 12 civilians, including five children and six members of one family. A surviving family member said the target was solely a residential compound, owned by a retired Libyan government member, but Nato said at the time it was “a legitimate military target”, despite reports of non-combatant deaths.
The bombing of an apartment block in Sirte, central Libya, on 16 September 2011 that killed two, a man and a woman who was five months pregnant. Although there were unconfirmed reports of snipers on the rooftop, questions were raised in the aftermath over whether an attack would have been proportionate, given civilians were killed.
The Danish defence ministry said in a statement that while the events took place many years ago, it had begun a review. “The Minister of Defence has requested the Defence Command to assess whether the documents in question indicate that there were ramifications of such magnitude that an investigation should have been conducted at that time within the coalition or Nato framework,” it added.
One newly released document, written in English and sent in May 2012 from Danish military command to the country’s Nato representatives, said “Danish aircraft participated in a number of the specific attacks” listed as having caused civilian casualties by investigators from the UN international commission of inquiry on Libya, Human Rights Watch and the New York Times.
“Civilian casualties during the conduct of these attacks cannot be ruled out,” the Danish internal review, previously marked secret, concluded.
However, the review also argued there was “no evidence or indication that Danish aircraft have caused such casualties”, because “there were no Nato troops on the ground to estimate the effects of attacks”. Instead, Denmark relied on remote pilot observations and other reconnaissance to reach an ambiguous verdict.
Further air force documents, in Danish, confirm the country’s F-16s participated in the airstrikes on Surman and Sirte on the basis of the dates of each. In each case, a second country was involved, but its name remains redacted, meaning it remains possible another country’s military delivered the deadly bombs.
The Danish admission of a link with the airstrikes follows a joint investigation between Altinget, a Danish news site, the civilian harm watchdog Airwars, and the Guardian.
One expert said the Danish military’s failure to acknowledge the possibility of causing civilian casualties at the time was a missed opportunity to improve standards of accountability – and to allow victims to seek compensation.
Marc Garlasco, an adviser to the UN-established international commission of inquiry on Libya, which investigated human rights violations by all parties in the conflict, said he found the disclosures in the documents “quite galling” because Nato had refused to answer questions about civilian casualties at the time.
“It is greatly disappointing that there wasn’t enough transparency that they put this out at a time back when it could be useful. Useful not only for lessons learned so that lives could be saved in the future but also useful for the victims of these strikes – that they could have an understanding of why their family members were killed and could potentially receive some kind of compensation for their loss,” he said.
Aerial bombardment is at the heart of modern warfare, used repeatedly by the west against Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, by Russia in Syria and Ukraine and most intensively by Israel in Gaza. However, militaries, including those in the west, have often been reluctant to admit when civilians were killed and wounded.
The UK says only one civilian was killed during a nine-year campaign of bombing IS targets in Iraq and Syria in which 4,324 missiles or other weapons were launched, a near perfect record that experts have questioned.
Responding to the Danish disclosure, a Nato official said the Libyan campaign was conducted with “unprecedented precision” and that “exceptional care was taken to minimise risks to civilians”.
Although the official conceded the risks “can never be zero”, they insisted that all locations bombed during the operation were “legitimate military targets”. Nato had no first-hand evidence of civilian casualties, because alliance soldiers were not allowed to inspect casualty sites.
“There was no invitation from the Libyan authorities for Nato to send personnel into the country to review strikes,” the Nato official said.
Ten nations, including six from Europe, participated in the bombing missions as part of Nato-led Operation Unified Protector, the codename for the western intervention in Libya, which ran for six months from 31 March 2011.
It helped lead to the overthrow of the dictator Col Muammar Gaddafi but also ushered in a long period of instability in the north African country, which remains divided between east and west after a period of civil war.
As well as Denmark, countries involved in bombing targets in Libya included the US, UK, France, Belgium, Canada, Italy, Norway, which are all Nato members, plus Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. A Dane, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, headed Nato at the time.
Other Nato airstrikes, not involving Denmark, have been linked to civilian fatalities, including a bombing in Majer on 8 August 2011, where a UN investigation concluded that an initial bombing killed 16 civilians – and then after rescuers had arrived, a follow-up attack killed a further 18.
Until now no country has accepted a link between their air force and a particular bombing, shielding their activities under the umbrella of Nato. As a result it has not been possible for family members of victims to seek redress in that country’s courts.
One man, Khaled al-Hamedi, whose wife and two children were killed in the strike at Surman, tried to bring a claim against Nato, but it failed when the Belgian court of appeal concluded in 2017 the military alliance had immunity from prosecution.
The strike targeted a large family compound belonging to Hamedi’s father, a senior figure in Gadaffi’s regime with links to the Libyan leader’s family. The younger Hamedi described the site as residential, while Nato said it was a command and control node.
Having been shown the documents, he said he would discuss with his lawyer about bringing a claim against the Danish military. “I want them first to declare their mistake to us,” he said, and that as well as seeking compensation he wanted Denmark, or whoever was responsible, “to say sorry as well”.
Denmark, in common with other western nations, had a policy in which a military officer, known as a “red card holder”, could refuse to let that country’s air force fly on a mission if, as stated in one of the Danish documents, it was “suspected that it would cause civilian casualties”. Pilots were supposed to abort missions if they suspected attacks would cause civilian casualties.
Tessa Gregory, a partner at the British public law firm Leigh Day, said if militaries were not prepared to examine reports of civilian casualties and acknowledge mistakes, they risked giving the impression they were above the law.
She said: “In military operations where it is alleged that civilian casualties have occurred it is imperative that those allegations are properly investigated and that victims are given enough information to seek redress under international and domestic legal mechanisms. Without transparency it is likely a culture of impunity will flourish.”
This investigation is part of collaboration between the Guardian, Altinget and Airwars. It was supported by Journalismfund.eu."
NTEXEVW875_B263QFCDPEBTY09,Keir Starmer keen to show he is not just ducking fights with the Tories,Pippa Crerar,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/jan/22/keir-starmer-labour-leader-latest-speech-analysis,"In the coffee break after Keir Starmer’s speech on civil society on Monday, the mood among charity leaders was positive. Perhaps most of all they liked his defence of the National Trust and RNLI, beloved national charities that have, over the years, been demonised and demeaned by the right.
“It’s come to something when the Tories are at war with the National Trust,” the Labour leader had told them. “That’s what happens when politics of self-preservation prevail over commitment to service.”
His speech was also symbolic of a broader strategy from Starmer, who has been looking for opportunities to flip the narrative and show that he is not just ducking fights with the Conservatives to deny them electoral dividing lines, as some of his critics suggest.
This same strategy was on display earlier this month when he told reporters he was “up for the fight” of defending the “nanny state” as he announced plans to improve child health under a Labour government, including supervised toothbrushing in schools.
Party insiders also point to more historic examples such as Starmer’s defence of the England team during Euro 2020 when he accused Boris Johnson of a lack of courage over his reluctance to condemn fans who booed them for taking the knee.
Last February he defended the BBC – a frequent target of Tory attack – as a “national treasure” that, along with Channel 4, which faced privatisation, had to be defended from government attacks that “threaten the future of these two great institutions”.
Labour strategists believe Starmer’s willingness to take on the Tories – even if defending the National Trust might not seem the riskiest of tactics – flies in the face of claims he is reluctant to do so for fear of it being weaponised at the election.
“We always knew that the final year before an election would be about picking sides on things,” one senior aide explained. “It’s not really about the individual rows: we’re trying to tell more of a story about what the party stands for.”
His team want to present him as a “normal bloke” – presumably in contrast to Rishi Sunak’s out-of-touchness – who will take a pragmatic approach generally shared by the majority of the country.
“There are issues where we think we’re in the mainstream of public opinion,” said one shadow cabinet minister. “What the Tories think is the mainstream has been pulled in ever more extreme directions. That’s why he feels quite confident making those arguments.”
Another party insider suggested that dividing lines were chosen carefully. “We’ve always wanted to make the Labour party the natural patriotic choice and we’re always looking for opportunities to do that. It’s a fairly reductive Conservative view that everybody is quite rightwing on everything”.
The Labour figure said, however, that Starmer had to strike the right balance between “not being baited by mad things the Tories come out with” and waiting for the right moment “like a boxer ducking and diving and picking the right approach”.
More importantly, it is not just culture war issues that have been picked to create some dividing lines, but also significant policy areas like illegal immigration. Starmer has said that he would repeal the government’s flagship Rwanda legislation if he wins power.

Again, he cites pragmatism. The policy would not work in practice, he argues, although it does highlight Tory division and Sunak’s depleted authority on the issue. He would, instead, seek an EU-wide returns agreement for people who seek asylum in Britain.
Several shadow cabinet ministers refer to Starmer as the “quiet radical”, insisting that his five “mission documents” are actually extremely ambitious – even if they have been criticised in some quarters for their lack of detail – because he actually intends to deliver on them.
His dividing lines strategy, however, has its limits. The Labour leader has said little to differentiate himself from the government on issues including transgender rights, public sector pay, the two-child benefit cap and even his position on a Gaza ceasefire.
His aides deny this proves his reticence to take on difficult issues, arguing instead that it would be easier to take the path of least resistance by siding with Labour activists, and he has “taken brickbats” from his own side as a result.
Perhaps the biggest test of his boldness is yet to come: to stand firm on Labour’s commitment to its £28bn green prosperity fund or decide that he would be electorally better off if he backed away. One party insider said: “It’s about fight or flight. We don’t yet know which is his instinct.”"
NVTT3FMD0X_86MEELYPZF0XURH,Cairns watch house worker sounds alarm over ‘massive deterioration’ in children’s physical and mental health,Ben Smee,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/jan/23/queensland-youth-detention-cairns-watch-house-children-physical-mental-health,"A child locked in the Cairns police watch house is self-harming by banging his head against the cell walls.
Anonymised notes about more than a dozen children in the far north Queensland watch house last week, seen by Guardian Australia, detail concerns about sickness spreading in the overcrowded cells, injuries and serious security incidents.
Some of the children have been held there for so long – up to 20 days and counting – that support workers have raised alarm about a “massive deterioration” in their physical and mental health, and requested they be taken to hospital.
The situation inside the Cairns police watch house in recent weeks has been described as “horrendous”, including by a senior psychologist who sent a “cry for help” letter detailing allegations of young people not being provided adequate food, medical attention or legal support.
The notes contain no identifying information. They were written by a worker on 19 January and relate to the cohort of 13 young people in the cells on that day.
All had been there for at least six days. Four of the cohort had been in the adult lockup for more than two weeks. It is understood 10 are still there due to a lack of available beds in youth detention centres.

In the notes, the worker details serious concerns about young people who have been in the watch house for an extended period.
“Massive deterioration in the health and mental health for the [young people] with long stays,” the worker’s notes say.
There have been “multiple referrals to [a mental health service], multiple requests for young people to be taken to hospital or see the nurse”.
Two of the young people suffered severe cuts “prior to and during their arrest”, requiring surgery. They were then taken back to the watch house and are receiving “continued medical attention”.
One young person “has a minor head injury due to self-harming behaviours”. Three young people contracted the flu from one another. Another required assessment at the hospital for a medical condition.
The notes also detail an incident that occurred within the watch house that was reported in local media as a prisoner setting fire to a blanket.
“Somehow the boys got access to the female wing and were given a lighter that was smuggled in by a female juvenile. After this the boys then lit a fire in their cell … and it was very concerning.”

The Queensland police service said three boys had been charged for “damaging material” in the watch house and that they could not comment further as the matter was before a court.
Guardian Australia is aware of another case, which has been raised in correspondence sent to senior Queensland officials, from November.
The letter, from the Youth Advocacy Centre, said a 13-year-old boy had spent four days in the Cairns watch house with an ear infection without receiving any medical attention or seeing a nurse.
“He has also said that he wasn’t receiving enough food and was always hungry, and had been exposed to adult prisoners who yelled at the child detainees,” the letter says.
“The cell was dirty and had only been cleaned once in the four days that he had been held in custody.”
Police said in a statement there were no people in custody in Cairns “who are exhibiting any flu-like symptoms or have requested treatment”.
“[The] QPS is committed to ensuring the safety, security and wellbeing of all persons in watch houses across the state,” a police spokesperson said.
“[The] QPS continues to work with Queensland Health, the department of youth justice and other community agencies in providing relevant healthcare and mental health support to young people in custody and prioritising their placement within a youth detention centre.”"
NWK7T709P0_T8SXKTVM5EPBHP6,Peter Dutton refuses to commit to stage-three tax cut changes as Labor begins negotiations with Greens and crossbench,Josh Butler,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/26/peter-dutton-refuses-to-commit-to-stage-three-tax-cut-changes-as-labor-begins-negotiations-with-greens-and-crossbench,"Peter Dutton has refused to commit the opposition to an official position on Labor’s amended stage-three tax cuts, as the government begins negotiations with the Greens and key independents.
Anthony Albanese said on Friday he would soon begin discussions with crossbenchers to get the updated tax cuts through parliament, as the Greens say they will push for further support for low-income earners.
The prime minister rejected Dutton’s calls for a fresh election on the amendments. Albanese said the next election could not be held until August, while the tax cuts would come into effect a month earlier.
“You can’t say that you’re concerned about cost of living pressure and then refuse to do anything about it. That’s the Coalition’s attitude,” Albanese said.
Labor has sought to pressure the Coalition into supporting the changes, outlined in detail on Thursday, by publicly questioning Dutton over whether he intends to oppose larger tax cuts for lower- and middle-income Australians.
Speaking on Channel Nine’s Today show, Dutton dodged questions on potential support for legislation to change the tax cuts, which will give larger tax refunds to more than 80% of taxpayers.
“Well, we want to understand the black hole and understand the costings, which we’re doing right now. Then we’ll make our announcement,” Dutton said.

“But we went to the election with a promise to the Australian people on stage-three tax cuts. We don’t break our promise in a way that the prime minister has. We don’t desert Australians who we have promised an outcome.
“I just think most Australians don’t want a prime minister who looks them in the eye, tells them one thing, and then does completely the opposite.”
On the same program, the Labor minister Bill Shorten was asked about claims from Dutton that Albanese’s leadership was now in question.
“No, not at all,” Shorten said. “This is about helping everyday Australians with their cost of living, middle Australia.
“For all of last year you guys all said ‘Labor’s got to do more on cost of living’, now we’re doing it and everyone’s crying. I don’t know,” he said.
“I am defending the prime minister. I support this decision. I think he’s made the right call. Someone famous once said that when your information changes, your conclusions change,” Shorten said.

Dutton went on to make a wager live on air with Shorten: “Let’s go 20 bucks, or let’s go $200 if you want – to bet that you’re going to challenge Anthony Albanese by the next election.”
Shorten quipped in response: “Oh mate, do you know why you can go to 200 bucks, Peter? Because you’re getting a tax cut under Anthony Albanese.”
The Greens have also held back from supporting the tax cut change. They said their sticking point was that the changes would still hand back $4,500 to the wealthiest, and that money would be better in the hands of lower-income Australians.
The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, called for further changes to the tax cuts to ensure low- and middle-income earners get greater financial relief.
Albanese said Labor’s changes were sensible, but he remained open to negotiations.
“It has the same costs across the forward estimates, but it is a better package being put forward,” he told reporters in Canberra on Friday.
“We’ll wait and see. We’ll wait for them to go through their mechanisms as well. We’ll talk with all of the crossbenchers.”
Bandt said despite the changes to stage three, they were not adequate to provide enough cost-of-living relief."
NX2VYVA9CN_LOEKEA7Q9DLWB3Z,Faculty of America’s largest public university system begin weeklong strike,Dani Anguiano,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/22/cal-state-strike-university-faculty-higher-pay,"Faculty at California State University, America’s largest public university system, began a historic weeklong strike on Monday as more than 30,000 workers walked off their jobs.
Professors, librarians, plumbers, electricians and other workers demanding higher pay and improved working conditions are striking. The five-day faculty work stoppage is the first to take place systemwide across Cal State’s 23 campuses.
The walkout comes two weeks after CSU officials ended contract negotiations with a unilateral offer of a 5% pay raise effective 31 January, far below the 12% hike that the union, the California Faculty Association, is seeking. California is one of the most expensive places to live in the US and pay has not kept up with the rising costs, faculty say.
“CSU management wants to maintain the status quo, which is not working for the vast majority of our faculty, students and staff,” Chris Cox, the CFA vice-president of racial & social justice, north, and a lecturer at San José State University, said in a statement. “In order for us to have a properly functioning system in years to come, we need to improve the working conditions for faculty and learning conditions for students.”
With the new semester beginning on Monday, classes for many of the system’s 450,000 students could be cancelled, unless faculty members individually decide to cross picket lines.
The CFA represents roughly 29,000 workers. They were joined on the picket lines by 1,100 CSU skilled trades workers represented by the Teamsters Local 2010, which has also not yet reached a new contract with the university.
Mildred Garcia, the Cal State chancellor, said on Friday in a video call with journalists that the university system had sought to avoid a strike but the union’s salary demands are simply not viable.
“We must work within our financial reality,” she said.
In December, CFA members staged one-day walkouts on four campuses in Los Angeles, Pomona, Sacramento and San Francisco to press for higher pay, more manageable workloads and increased parental leave. The CFA has also sought gender inclusive restrooms and changing rooms and more counselors for students but says management has ignored nearly all its demands.
The union says the university has money in its “flush reserve accounts” and could afford the salary increases with funds from operating cash surpluses and the $766m CSU has in emergency reserves.
“Our proposals are reasonable and absolutely necessary,” Dr Rong Chen, a CSU San Bernardino professor emeritus and CFA-San Bernardino president, said in a statement.
“We also know that the university has the money to fund them – if only it would get its priorities straight,” he added, pointing to the CSU reserves, recent raises for university presidents and the chancellors’s nearly $1m compensation package.

Leora Freedman, CSU’s vice-chancellor for human resources, said reserve funds cannot be tapped for wage hikes because they are meant for times of economic uncertainty or emergencies, including wildfires or earthquakes.
“We’ve made several offers with movement, and most recently a 15% increase that would be paid over three years, providing faculty a 5% increase each year. But the faculty union has never moved off its 12% demand for one year only,” she said.
The increase the union is seeking would cost the system $380m in new recurring spending, which the university can’t afford, Freedman said.
The university strike comes after a major year for the US labor movement. Last year, healthcare professionals, Hollywood actors and writers and auto workers staged high profile strikes as they picketed for better pay and working conditions.
In 2022, teaching assistants and graduate student workers in the University of California System went on strike for a month.

O25OHRZH30_WOYL8GOYZSEMABY,‘This is wild’: Florida man plays guitar during brain surgery to remove tumor,Gloria Oladipo,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/22/florida-man-play-guitar-brain-surgery,"A Florida man recently helped surgeons remove a tumor from his brain by playing 1980s and 90s rock music.
Christian Nolen, a professional guitarist in the south Florida community of Coral Gables, was instructed by doctors to play several songs on his guitar while undergoing an awake craniotomy meant to take a tumor out of the right side of his frontal lobe, WSVN Miami reported.
The surgery which Nolen underwent is performed while a patient is awake and alert to evaluate and protect brain functions.
During his procedure at the University of Miami’s Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center in early January, Nolen played several songs by rock groups the Deftones and System of a Down.
“It was just like out of this world, like, to just like wake up and like have people actively working inside of your head,” Nolen said to WSVN Miami. “It’s kind of an insane feeling.”
Nolen was first diagnosed with the tumor after experiencing symptoms that affected the left side of his body.
“I had lost feeling in my whole left side. From the waist up, like, I wasn’t able to move my arm, my face began to drag,” Nolen told WSVN. Nolen also had trouble playing his guitar and using his left hand in general.
Ultimately, doctors diagnosed Nolen with a glioma – a tumor seen in the brain – on his right frontal lobe. That area of the brain controls movement and other cognitive abilities, Messenger reported.
Doctors scheduled a surgery to remove Nolen’s tumor 10 days after the initial diagnosis. The goal of the surgery was to confirm the type of tumor and to remove as much of the mass as possible.
Before surgery, doctors asked Nolen if he would be willing to play the guitar during the operation to test his dexterity.
Dr Ricardo Komotar, director of the University of Miami Brain Tumor Initiative, told Fox News that keeping a patient awake during this type of brain surgery is critical to monitor for any damage done to the brain.
“When a tumor is involving or near a critical part of the brain – something that controls the ability to speak or understand language or move – we want to do the surgery awake to continually monitor the patient, so you know if you start to violate normal brain functions,” Komotar said to Fox News.
While surprised at the the proposition, Nolen agreed.
“I’d only really heard of procedures of that nature being done in shows and movies,” Nolen said to Fox News over email. “I felt like it was such a unique experience that I couldn’t pass up – especially with my motor skills being on the line.”
The surgical center had performed awake craniotomies before. But the doctors specifically asked Nolen to play guitar rather than another instrument given his professional background.
Nolen was put to sleep for the beginning of the two-hour surgery. Then, the surgical team woke him up and asked him to play.
The process of being woken up during the surgery was “overwhelming”, Nolen told Fox News. But after remembering what was happening, he was able to “breathe and stay calm”.
“This is wild,” Nolen said during the procedure, Fox News reported.
Surgeons with the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center were able to successfully remove all of Nolen’s tumor and discharged him the day after the surgery. He was sent to recover at home.
Nolen was subsequently waiting on the final pathology results of the tumor. He was likely to undergo weeks of radiation and chemotherapy as additional, follow-up treatment, Fox News reported."
O2G0R1R1XG_SRVNFZPUKOLUGNB,Houthi missile attack forces cargo ships with US navy escort to turn around,Patrick Wintour,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/24/us-navy-cargo-ships-houthi-missile-attack-yemen,"Two ships sailing close to the Gulf of Aden were forced to seek the support of the US navy after explosions were heard nearby, as the Houthi group kept up their assault on commercial shipping off the coast of Yemen.
The Houthis have said their attacks are in solidarity with the Palestinians as Israel bombards Gaza. The ships belonging to the US subsidiary of Danish shipping company Maersk were carrying US military supplies when they came under attack from three anti-ship missiles near the Bab el-Mandeb strait. The US central command (Centcom) said two missiles were shot down, and a third landed in the sea. No damage was caused either to the Maersk Detroit or the Maersk Chesapeake and no injuries were reported, Centcom said.
Maersk said in a statement: “En route, both ships reported seeing explosions close by and the US navy accompaniment also intercepted multiple projectiles. The crew, ship and cargo are safe and unharmed. The US navy has turned both ships around and is escorting them back to the Gulf of Aden.”
Maersk said its US subsidiary was now suspending Red Sea transits. “The safety of our crews is of utmost importance. Following the escalation of risk, MLL [Maersk Line Limited] is suspending transits in the region until further notice” the spokesperson said.
Both commercial vessels carry cargo for the US government and are enrolled in programs run by the defence department to transport forces, supplies and equipment during times of war or national emergency, which is why they were escorted through the strait.
Centcom also reported that on Tuesday night it had launched two pre-emptive strikes designed to stop imminent Houthi attacks. Previous attacks last Friday underlined the current inability of the US and UK to neutralise the Houthis despite multiple attacks on their missile sites.
The UK defence secretary, Grant Shapps, told MPs that risks to global navigation continued, with shipping costs rising by as much as 300%. He challenged what he described as absurd Houthi claims to be the Robin Hood of Yemen, saying their history proved the opposite. He said the attacks in which the UK participated alongside the US destroyed Houthi surface-to-air missiles and the Houthis’ ability to hold the seas to ransom.
“Our military strikes did not cause any civilian casualties,” Shapps said.
The attacks on the Houthis were backed by the influential chair of the UK’s foreign affairs select committee, Alicia Kearns, who said it was ahistorical to regard the Houthis as anti-colonial freedom fighters.
Houthi forces in Yemen have written to the UN demanding that all UK and US staff leave the country within a month on the basis that their governments are mounting assaults on Yemen. The warning also appeared to apply to NGOs working in the capital, Sana’a. In addition, it was reported that the Houthis had prevented a UN plane from landing in the strategically important town of Marib on Wednesday.
The threatened expulsions by the Houthis followed strikes by the US and Britain, with support from other countries, against military targets of the Iran-aligned group. The US government last week also said it would return the Houthis to a list of terrorist groups.
The Houthi foreign ministry letter to the UN stated: “The ministry … would like to stress that you must inform officials and workers with US and British citizenships to prepare to leave the country within 30 days.” It was sent to the UN’s acting humanitarian coordinator in Yemen, Peter Hawkins.
The letter also ordered foreign organisations not to hire American and British citizens for Yemen’s operations.The US embassy said in a statement that it was aware of reports about the letter but “cannot speak on behalf of the UN or humanitarian organisations in Yemen as to what they may have received from Houthi ‘authorities’”.
The British embassy said staff had not yet been told to leave and the mission was in close contact with the UN on the issue.
“The UN provide vital assistance to the Yemeni people … via the very sea routes that the Houthis are jeopardising,” the British mission in Yemen said in a statement. The UK’s Middle East minister called for the UN to be allowed to get on with the job.
Ahmed bin Mubarak, the foreign minister of the UN-recognised Aden-based government, also claimed Houthi militia had earlier in the week threatened to target a Sudanese civilian plane transporting stranded Yemenis from Port Sudan to Mokha airport.
He made the claim in a meeting with the UN’s Yemen envoy, Hans Grundberg, to illustrate the impossibility of dealing with the Houthis, who resisted a concerted Saudi-led air campaign after capturing Sana’a and forcing the western-backed former president to flee in 2015.
In April 2022 a ceasefire between the Houthis and the Saudi-led coalition prompted a decline in violence, and fighting has largely remained in abeyance despite the official expiry of the truce in October.
Bin Mubarak stressed the need for the international community to reconsider dealing seriously with the Houthi militias, remarks indicating that the UN-backed governmentwants to see the internal peace process frozen because of the Houthis’ behaviour.
Grundberg also met the Saudi and UAE ambassadors to Yemen, and the ambassadors of the five permanent members of the UN security council.
He stressed the need to maintain “a favourable environment for the continuation of dialogue in Yemen, and the importance of continuing concerted regional and international support for peace efforts”.
Saudi Arabia is not an enthusiastic supporter of the western strikes on the Houthis because it fears they will destabilise peace talks."
OB0RHUS2I7_T3D598X703DSQ7X,United Auto Workers union endorses Joe Biden for president,Michael Sainato,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/24/united-auto-workers-endorse-biden,"The powerful United Auto Workers (UAW) formally endorsed Joe Biden’s re-election campaign on Wednesday at the union’s national community action program conference in Washington DC.
Both the US president and rival Donald Trump have courted the union and supported its successful strike action against the US’s big three automakers last year. Biden became the first president to walk a picket line in support of the union.
“Joe Biden bet on the American worker while Donald Trump blamed the American worker,” UAW president, Shawn Fain told the conference. “If our endorsement must be earned, Joe Biden has earned it.
“Donald Trump is a scab. Donald Trump is a billionaire and that’s who he represents,” Fain said. “This election is about who will stand up with us and who will stand in our way.”
The conference is where the UAW’s delegates and leaders develop and shape the 400,000-strong union’s political and legislative priorities. It is the union’s first conference with Fain at the helm since he was elected president of the union on a reform slate in March 2023.
Addressing the conference, Biden said: “I honest to God have always believed the union movement in America is important because it produces the best skilled workers in the world. It’s good for everybody.”
“Our plan is delivering for the American people, building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down,” he continued. “When Donald Trump was in office, six auto factories closed around the country. Tens of thousands of auto jobs were lost nationwide during Trump’s presidency. During my presidency, we opened 20 auto factories and more than 250,000 auto jobs all across the country.”
Fain has been strongly critical of Trump. This week he said Trump was “pretty much contrary to everything we stand for”. But the UAW has many Trump-supporting members and the union had held off on endorsing Biden.
Biden has repeatedly touted himself as the most pro-labor president in history and joined the picket line of striking UAW members during the “standup” strikes at the big three automakers in September, becoming the first sitting president to join a picket line.
Last week Sean O’Brien, the president of the Teamsters union, announced he had met privately with Trump in a move that progressive members called “a slap in the face”.
Biden has also received the endorsements from the AFL-CIO, the largest federation of unions in the US, and the National Education Association, which represents about 3 million educators, the largest union in the US."
OBP1CHFSMC_AZFMED51TKOO23V,"Pandemic puppy owners still struggling with their dogs’ behaviour, survey finds",Nicola Davis,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/jan/22/pandemic-puppy-owners-still-struggling-with-their-dogs-behaviour-survey-shows,"Whether it is jumping up at strangers, tugging on a lead or disappearing into the distance, the UK’s pandemic puppies are still in the doghouse, a survey has revealed.
Research by the Royal Veterinary College (RVC) has added to growing concerns that many owners who acquired a puppy during the height of the Covid pandemic were struggling with their dogs’ behaviour as they reached 21 months.
Among other findings, a fifth of owners surveyed reported their dog had eight or more problem behaviours at that age, such as pulling on the lead, clinginess or aggression, while 33% of owners found training their dog harder than expected – something that was more common among first-time owners.
Dr Rowena Packer, a lecturer in companion animal behaviour and welfare science at the RVC, and lead author of the study, said a key problem was that many people did not do enough research, and were unaware of the level of responsibility involved in training their dog.
She said: “I think a lot of new owners go in with very high hopes [of] their dog’s behaviour and then when they realise actually training is quite tough, that’s where a third of them were really struggling.”
Another problem, said Packer, was the trend to project human thoughts and feelings on to dogs – for example labelling certain behaviours as naughty.
“Dogs don’t come off the shelf ready to know how to spend a day walking around on a lead meeting other dogs, going into social spaces with other people – all these things need to be taught,” she said.
However, not all struggling owners are inexperienced.
Phil Wright, 59, from Southport, owned a number of labradors before he welcomed sisters Scout and Harper into his home as puppies in February 2020.
He said: “I didn’t anticipate any problems. But I didn’t anticipate lockdown either.”
Both his black labradors have severe separation anxiety, with Scout howling if Wright leaves the house, as well as problematic behaviour on the lead such as barking – particularly if they see a small dog.
“They can pull me over,” said Wright.
“The separation anxiety definitely stems from me being around so much during lockdown. Likewise the behaviour on lead [is] due to lack of socialisation during lockdown,” he added.
According to UK Pet Food, in 2023 there were about 12 million pet dogs in the UK, with some data suggesting there was a surge in puppy ownership during the height of the Covid pandemic.
However, the RVC survey reveals Wright is not alone in facing difficulties. Out of more than 1,000 UK dog owners, 97% reported their dog had at least one problem behaviour from a list of 24, while on average owners reported five problems.
The most common problem was pulling on the lead – reported by about two-thirds of participants – with jumping up and poor recall in second and third place respectively.
Overall, control problems were the most common type of trouble – being reported by 84% of participants – however 25% reported their dog had aggressive behaviours.
The latest results are part of a project by the RVC that follows a group of dogs bought as young puppies in 2020, during the Covid pandemic.
While the study was not able to compare the prevalence of problem behaviours among pandemic puppies with their prevalence among dogs acquired before or after the pandemic, Packer said comparisons with other datasets suggested a general elevation of issues among the pandemic puppy cohort.
The team added one area of concern was that, while 96% of owners used positive reinforcement such as praise to train their dog, 82% used one or more punishment-based methods such as choke chains, shouting or pushing their dog – methods that can cause further behavioural problems.
Such approaches, they note, appeared to be more common in owners who had not attended online puppy classes during the pandemic.
Packer added owners reported turning to friends, family or even social media for advice on dog training, but that many of the latter advocated punishment-based techniques.
“These owners are struggling but they’re not actually reaching out to professionals for help,” she said.
The RVC advises those who are struggling with behaviour problems in their dog to take their pet to the vet, as difficulties can cause health problems, while those who missed out on puppy classes can still get help with behaviour from experts registered with the Animal Behaviour Training Council.
Wright added that despite the challenges, he would not be without his dogs.
“They are great, beautiful, friendly, but just a nightmare when they are out on a lead,” he said."
OEAH7NYDSW_IH49SV29CDPIEQO,Journalists who revealed Greek wiretapping scandal appear in court,Helena Smith,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/25/journalists-who-revealed-greek-wiretapping-scandal-appear-in-court,"Journalists and media outlets who revealed a wiretapping scandal that rocked Greece’s centre-right government have appeared in court on charges of defamation, in what many have described as a critical day for press freedom in the country.
The lawsuit, which came after media revelations that the phones of politicians, businessmen and media figures were being tapped, was filed by the nephew of prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis who, as the leader’s chief of staff, had been in charge of the country’s secret service.
In a move described as “disgraceful” by press freedom groups, Grigoris Dimitriadis launched the legal action a day before being fired after the spyware scandal came to light in August 2022.
As proceedings unfolded on Thursday at the Athens court of first instance, protesters chanted in solidarity and scores of reporters filled the chamber. The International Press Institute (IPI) and other organisations called the legal action “a startling example of a strategic lawsuit against public participation (Slapp), and an attempt to muzzle investigative reporting on a matter of significant public interest.”
Testifying before the panel of judges, Nikos Alivizatos, a leading expert in constitutional law, underscored the case’s significance for human rights and the rule of law. “Even the prime minister himself has called this affair a shadow over our government,” he said, referring to the revelations which caused unease in the EU.
Dimitriadis, who did not appear in court, filed the lawsuit against the leftwing Efsyn newspaper, the online network of investigative journalism Reporters United, and three journalists, including Thanasis Koukakis who has long reported on the Greek banking and business sectors.
Dimitriadis has demanded €550,000 (£426,000) in damages and the withdrawal of media coverage implicating him in the scandal. The defendants deny the charge.
The accused played a key role in exposing what has come to be dubbed Greece’s Watergate, with press censorship organisations saying the case highlights the EU member state’s deteriorating media freedom.
The country’s standing in press freedom rankings has fallen to the lowest in the EU. A European Commission fact-finding mission recently cited weak press regulations, self-censorship and a noticeable absence of pluralism in a nation where government-friendly plutocrats traditionally own media outlets as severely compromising press independence.
Although lauded for his reformist policies and handling of the Greek economy, Mitsotakis has been criticised for what is viewed as a concerted effort to “control the message” through choreographing press coverage.
One of the prime minister’s first moves on assuming power in 2019 was to bring EYP under the purview of his office. Phone-tapping victims included Nikos Androulakis, the socialist Pasok party leader. When the disclosures came to light, the ex premier Alexis Tsipras, then the main opposition leader, described them as “the deepest deviation from rule of law that the country has seen in its modern history”.
Before Thursday’s hearing, the IPI called on Dimitriadis to drop the defamation case, expressing alarm that he had filed two other lawsuits, including a second legal action against the same plaintiffs. In that lawsuit, launched two months ago, he claimed damages of €3.3m and also demanded that reports of his alleged links to the spy scandal be removed.
The court is expected to deliver its verdict in the coming months."
OFMX6NO9NW_AK5G6M7T9RUWNLL,"Gender is a social matter, not a biological one",_,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/24/gender-is-a-social-matter-not-a-biological-one,"If you believe in a patriarchal society, and the entitlement to male privilege that attends it, then the biological sex of babies is highly significant (‘Gender ideology’ is all around us – but it’s not what the Tories say it is, 19 January). But if you endorse a more equal society that isn’t based on male superiority and female inferiority, then the biological sex of babies is less consequential.
One feminist response to patriarchy has been to point out that the social judgment involved in believing in a patriarchal society logically comes before believing in the significance placed on biological sex.
Finn Mackay’s swipe at our Conservative government is well placed. But it doesn’t do much to clarify the debate about trans identities. Mackay lumps together “trans, transgender and gender non-conforming identities” because that’s what the government’s draft guidance for schools does. Some trans advocates reinforce the binary between male and female biological sex, aligning them with patriarchal society. In contrast, gender fluidity aligns with the feminist response to patriarchy outlined above – that these are social questions, not biological ones.
Biology in itself can never determine social values, because social questions are always contestable, and challenges to social norms require political determination. The social limits to be placed on children questioning their gender is a social and political matter. Finn Mackay, as a trans advocate, does not recognise that.Dr Raia BrowningOxford

OIJWSCA9O7_FAESZWTT3ZFP5WH,"Cute review – the world is on fire, but just look at that smol round boi!",Oliver Wainwright,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2024/jan/24/cute-review-the-world-is-on-fire-but-just-look-at-that-smol-round-boi,"A cute white kitten with a flourish of rainbow fur has been peering out from posters on the London Underground over the past few weeks, its fluffy head crowned with a golden unicorn horn. But look again and the image becomes disconcerting. This chubby little creature has an extra pair of paws poking out from its neck, while its metallic horn looks more like a screw that has been driven through its skull. Those big blue eyes no longer seem so cute, but blank and menacing.
“We wanted to make you feel uncomfortable,” says Claire Catterall, curator of Cute, a new exhibition at Somerset House. “So we needed something a bit queasy, encapsulating both irresistible cuteness, but also a darker side.”
Eighteen such cute/creepy kitten monsters greets visitors to the show, lining the walls of the entrance like unnerving family portraits. They were generated using AI, by design studio Graphic Thought Facility, setting the tone for what unfolds as an uncanny and unsettling, but also highly seductive, show. I admit I arrived somewhat wary that this might be yet another designed-for-Instagram selfie-fest, like the “immersive” Balloon Museum or the “experiential” Museum of Ice Cream – a series of backdrops to fill social media feeds with pastel rainbow selfies. There is a bit of that but, overall, the exhibition is neither mindless influencer fodder, nor an overly cynical take on the subject. Rather, it is a thoughtful exploration of the cult and culture of cuteness that will both entrance and repulse you in its saccharine embrace. It is a sugar-coated pill with an unexpected aftertaste.
The AI kittens make a fitting starting point, given that so much of what AI generates tends to have a cute aesthetic baked in. It is hardly surprising, given that it scrapes its source material from the internet, where cute has become the default language, from lolcat memes and doggo-speak to cartoonish stickers, gifs and emojis. Cats, meanwhile, have emerged as the de facto guardians of cyberspace. When the inventor of the world wide web, Tim Berners-Lee, was asked to name a use of the internet that he did not anticipate, he responded with one word: “kittens”.
The first room in the exhibition is appropriately dedicated to felines, complete with a skirting board cut with the profile of a cat, one of the many enjoyable details scattered through the show by its designers, AOC Architecture. We find the trippy psychedelic visions of schizophrenic painter Louis Wain, and what Catterall describes as “the first cat memes”, little photographic greetings cards produced by Harry Pointer in the 1870s, of his pet cats having tea parties and riding tricycles. It is a reminder that the human urge to anthropomorphise kittens, add funny captions, and share them as pocket-sized images, is a time-honoured tradition, not something invented by the internet. The Victorians, after all, had an insatiable appetite for cuteness, using doe-eyed animals and rosy-cheeked children on biscuit tins and chocolate bar wrappers to fuel consumer desire.
Similarly, the Kewpie doll – which you may associate with Japanese mayonnaise and its collectible plastic toys – dates back to 1909, when it was first drawn as a comic strip by Rose O’Neill. It was made as a bisque figurine in Germany a few years later, and mass-produced celluloid versions followed, making it the first consciously cute product to be a worldwide hit, and paving the way for the empire of Hello Kitties and Jellycat soft toys.
The history lesson continues with a room on the Japanese culture of kawaii, which takes a very different form, partly explained by its origins. The English word cute derives from acute, in the sense of clever or shrewd, first shortened in the 18th century. Kawaii, however, comes from the phrase kawa hayushi, meaning blushing face, in the sense of being embarrassed or ashamed, an expression that appeared in the 11th century. It makes sense when you look at the sparkly eyed characters staring out from the covers of manga comics, and the 1930s illustrations of women with longing, supersized eyes that preceded them. The comics might look like sexist male fantasies, but many come from the tradition of shōjo manga, drawn by and for women, featuring empowering stories that defy traditional gender stereotypes. Meanwhile, the raunchy covers of Barazoku, Japan’s first commercial gay men’s magazine, launched in the 1970s, show that kawaii culture is not confined to girls.
It is no coincidence that the rise in kawaii culture in the 1990s coincided with Japan’s economic slump and the “lost decade”, with cute Harajuku streetwear taking off as the stock market plummeted. The retreat into a safe, cocoon of cuteness as society crumbles provides a sharp mirror to our current times. Carpet bombing, climate chaos, the return of Trump – but oh just look at that smol round boi! As Catterall puts it, the current popularity of cute can partly be attributed to “the general fuckedness of everything”.
A supersized shrine to Hello Kitty is a fitting place to forget about the outside world, where a triumphal arch of the iconic mouthless creature leads to a space whose walls are smothered with hundreds of whiskered plushies. This vertical mass grave of cute white faces staring out, mute, ushers you on to a little dancefloor where you can boogie to sugary disco tunes, curated by David Gamson of Scritti Politti.
Things get contemporary upstairs, where a range of artists, many born in the 90s, offer their cute wares, punctuated by five “islands” that explore different aspects of cuteness. One looks at cute sadness, showcasing plaintive products designed to make you want to look after them, from Susie Sad Eyes dolls to a wounded Japanese action figure, who looks down forlornly at her bandaged arm. Another focuses on how cuteness can foster a sense of belonging and community: a display of My Little Pony toys introduces us to the existence of Bronies, an unlikely fan group of mostly straight adult men who create pony art and seek “life guidance” from the animated, rainbow-maned horses. A third island, on how cuteness can disguise the unpalatable, includes a photo of Hitler feeding baby deer.
Much of what is on show looks ironic at first glance, but there is an underlying sincerity to much of it, particularly among the work of gen Z. Multidisciplinary artist Hannah Diamond has conceived one room as a girls’ sleepover, full of beanbags and small screens that play glossy, highly synthetic electronic dance music videos on a loop. Leaning into a kind of pink-saturated hyper-femininity, Diamond’s work tries to reject derogatory connotations of girlishness and reclaim its affirmative, transformational potential. (I didn’t feel particularly transformed, but then I don’t think I’m her target audience.)
Next door, a games arcade explores the growing genre of cute independent video games. Out are the gory shoot-em-ups of yore, in favour of “cosy” games that simulate relaxing activities such as running a cat cafe, or staying at home on a rainy day. Some take a more morbid bent, despite their cute aesthetic. Froggy Pot – described as “a short cosy game with a small side of existential crisis” – takes inspiration from the folk tale that if a frog were slowly warmed up in a pot of water, it would not notice the increasing temperature and would eventually boil alive.
Another fitting dollop of existential dread is served up towards the end, courtesy of Ed Fornieles. The artist created a range of cute characters, called Finis, during the pandemic, which have since mushroomed to a population of more than 10,000, born as “living NFTs”, whose emotions fluctuate according to the value of their cryptocurrencies. As his website explains, they become happy and buoyant when the currency they are linked to does well, and sad or even sick when it performs poorly. (When I checked the listings, many were crying or in a freefall doom spiral.)
His new film, Adventures in Symbolic Love Tyranny, features a Fini voiceover who describes cute, in their childlike chirrupping voice, as “a new kind of emergent technology, a device being used by various parties on various levels to filter, buffer, rally, manage and control”. The chubby-cheeked avatar goes on to quote theorist Frances Richards: “Cute arises by manipulating the guarantee of non-manipulation. Professing its own demure and complete powerlessness, it gains power over and directs all interactions with it.”
From cuddly OxyContin-shaped plushies to civic mascots, to the exhibition’s amply stocked gift shop, cuteness is being weaponised all around us as a tranquillising tool to coerce, control and make us consume ever more. Can you resist the sugary anaesthetic?

OK1T84VKH1_AKFC3BBYZUDJWO7,"‘It’s fun, fun, fun’: the Arctic artist who took up painting for ‘cigarette money’",Chloë Ashby,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2024/jan/22/arctic-artist-shuvinai-ashoon-inuit,"It’s hard to comprehend what life is like in Kinngait, a chilly hamlet home to a thriving artist cooperative in the Arctic north of Canada. It’s currently the depths of winter there, with an average temperature of -20C and just four to five hours of daylight. Challenging conditions for an artist, I think to myself, casting my mind to the premium placed on large windows and natural light in studios closer to home.
As it turns out the challenge here isn’t so much making work as making it to work: in these parts the darkness acts as a nifty cover for polar bears who are prone to wander in and out of town uninvited. You’ll find those outsized interlopers in the imaginative drawings of Shuvinai Ashoona, the celebrated third-generation Inuit artist who received a special mention at the 2022 Venice Biennale, and who has a solo show opening at the Perimeter in London this week. It’s not just polar bears: we also get whales, walruses, seals – though not as we know them. Ashoona takes as her inspiration the natural ice-scape and a childhood spent camping and clamming, and on vast sheets of white paper gives them her own fantastical twist. Luminescent fish flop about on ice. Giant squid have human faces for eyes. Dreamlike gatherings take place between shapeshifting creatures.
Ashoona was born in Kinngait, formerly known as Cape Dorset, in 1961, the oldest of 14 children, three of whom died at birth. She grew up between the rocky town and remote outpost camps, at once watching television like any other teenager and living a more nomadic life of boating and berry-picking in the surrounding caribou-dotted hills. “A balance that came naturally to my family,” she tells me over email. She was among the first cohort of children to attend primary school in Kinngait, and one of few students to attend high school in Iqaluit, a two-hour flight away. When she was 16, she gave birth to a daughter, Mary.
Ashoona’s father was a hunter and master carver, her mother a graphic artist. Her grandmother made more than 8,000 drawings during her 25-year career. It wasn’t until the mid-1990s, though, that Ashoona picked up a pencil herself. She’d been struggling with her mental and physical health, and her younger sister, Goota, suggested it might help, and also earn her money for food and cigarettes – “smoke money,” Ashoona calls it. And so, she too got involved with the West Baffin Eskimo Cooperative, the community-owned cultural institution that has fostered five generations of Inuit artists. “I sold a drawing for $15,” she says. “And in return they gave me a bigger piece of paper.”
Without formal training, Ashoona learned like her relatives – by observing and imagining. Using a fineliner pen, she started out producing delicate black-and-white drawings that gradually became richer and more detailed. By the mid-2000s, she’d introduced coloured pencils, a mix of earthy browns and greys plus neon lilacs, limes and yellows. Globes and oceans began to appear – a nod to the changing climate and the world opening up before her – as well as spirits from Inuit mythology, including the sea goddess Sedna. The work she produces now is complex and layered, featuring seabird’s-eye views and drawings within drawings. When I ask Ashoona how she would describe her artistic development, she tells me it’s “fun, fun, fun”, that she feels she “can draw for ever”.
Rooted in Inuit traditions and storytelling, Ashoona’s art has a dreamlike quality and the feel of her vibrant drawings capture the history and contemporary experience of everyday Inuit life. When she doesn’t show up for our video call – schedules in Kinngait are fluid, to say the least – I wind up chatting with Juumi Takpaungai, the studio’s friendly associate arts manager. He describes the way Ashoona works: “Wafting around, thinking, looking at books maybe, then it spills from her mind straight on to the page.” She doesn’t do preliminary sketches, and she doesn’t take direction.
The absence of outside influence is one of the benefits of making work where she does, in one of the world’s most improbable art hubs. Located at the southern tip of Baffin Island, 1,300 miles north of Ottawa, Kinngait is reachable by small prop planes. Within the town, the only modes of transport are quad bikes and snowmobiles, and beyond it there are no roads. Though the residents have access to contemporary culture via the internet, travel is difficult. Ashoona doesn’t visit exhibitions or keep up with the art market. She isn’t trying to conform to ideas of what art today should be.
It’s thanks to the cooperative – an intermediary between the artists in Kinngait, which make up roughly a quarter of the 1,400 inhabitants, and the rest of the world – that the work of Ashoona and others is seen. Since it was founded in 1959, it’s been a crucial financial resource for the community, bringing in money from the sale of drawings and prints, which are shipped to a wholesale showroom in Toronto, from where they reach gallerists and dealers. Perhaps most importantly, the self-governed studios provide a sense of stability and camaraderie – something that in this isolated part of the world can be nothing short of life-saving.
I ask Ashoona if she ever imagines what her life – and her art – might look like outside Kinngait, and if she’s ever been tempted to leave. She doesn’t hesitate: “I never intend to leave Kinngait. It’s my one and only home.”

OY2HEAO3AR_FC43ID5U1EN6G0Y,"On Rwanda and working with Labour, we civil servants know the Tories are gunning for us – and we’re ready",The civil servant,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/24/secret-civil-servant-rwanda-labour-tories,"After a hard day of woke, tofu-eating activism, many civil servants like to unwind in front of a movie. So when a colleague asked me how I felt about Labour winning the election, I couldn’t help thinking about that opening scene from Dune. You know, the one in which the oppressed indigenous Fremen people suddenly find that their obscenely wealthy overlords, the Harkonnens, have abandoned the crumbling infrastructure of the desert planet Arrakis, for something like a well earned holiday in Mustique or the Cayman Islands. Anyway, the resulting transfer of power (spoiler alert!) doesn’t go particularly well.
Dune is, of course, just a piece of space opera, but it is nonetheless a handy reminder of why, after 14 years of galloping and often otherworldly Tory chaos, it is so important that Labour are prepared for a likely return to government.
It’s easy to forget that the UK is unusual – some might say bonkers – in that the leader of the election-winning party takes possession of No 10 literally overnight. Not so in the US, which famously takes a couple of months to complete the transition process. Nor in most European countries, which (with the exception of Belgium) at least take a few weeks to hand the keys over.
But take it from someone who’s been around government since the days of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, including the first faltering weeks of the 2010 coalition government: come polling day later this year, our battered public services can’t afford anything but a smooth transfer of power.
At the heart of that process is the opposition being allowed, in advance of the election, to talk to the upper reaches of the civil service in every major government department. Early access talks are, in fact, according to the Institute for Government, an unmissable part of preparing for government. This isn’t about either Labour or the civil service trying to jump the gun. Early talks ensure that if Labour wins, critical relationships between senior officials and new ministers are already in place, enabling us worker bees to crack on with the new government’s agenda. It’s simple.
Or maybe not. Weirdly, the length of time between access talks being authorised by the incumbent government and polling day seems to have shrunk since 2010. But given the current omnicrises lashing the country, they are now urgent, as there may be less than six months before the general election.
Rishi Sunak has recently – if reluctantly – authorised those access talks. And Keir Starmer has now officially requested that they begin. But it all feels very cagey, like the opening round of hostage negotiations. We will see soon enough whether Labour has a sufficiently forensic idea about how it wants to use those talks, and how it wants to rule.
And in the meantime? As ever, in the UK’s rather informal constitutional context, this sort of stuff always seems to be at the prime minister’s discretion. Which means it is essential that Sunak is a “good chap” and doesn’t sabotage Labour’s chances of governing well.
But this Conservative government has plenty of form, and plenty of reasons to drive a horse and cart through these long held conventions. Here are my top three.
First, the general election itself. Sunak’s current shtick is that his “working assumption” is it won’t happen until November. Nobody I know is betting on anything but a May election, a scenario that the Labour frontbencher Emily Thornberry describes as “the worst kept secret in Westminster”. More persuasive is last November’s national insurance giveaway and subsequent teasers from the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, about a hefty tax cut in March that is surely calculated to buy off a large cohort of potential Tory voters a couple of months later. Add to this the prediction of a recession by the end of 2024 and a pre-summer election feels almost inevitable. For many of us, the former Tory adviser Lord Finkelstein’s proposition that Sunak should call an early election to try to prevent Labour getting a majority is an increasingly credible one. And if he can’t do that, disrupting the time Starmer has to get ready for government is surely a decent consolation prize.
Second, the attacks on the civil service are ramping up again, with the announcement of yet another crackdown on civil service “activists”. It’s the kind of McCarthyist “enemy within” rhetoric along the lines of previous tropes about an “activist civil service”. Picking up where the stooshie concerning the senior civil servant, and now Labour chief of staff, Sue Gray, left off, expect to hear more about craven officials bringing democracy to its knees by implementing Labour policies before the election has even been won. But don’t fall for it.
Finally, we have the Rwanda deportation policy. Consider the latest wheeze to change official guidance to force civil servants to choose between ignoring Strasbourg judgments halting Rwanda deportation flights (thus breaking international law), disobeying the instructions of a minister or simply resigning. Many of us agree with the union leader Dave Penman’s conclusion that government ministers “are trying to put civil servants in an invidious position by placing them between serving ministers and their professional obligations”.
In other words, there is a deliberate attempt to force civil servants to act unlawfully – which could damage our credibility with the public and create a constitutional headache that a new administration would have to spend valuable time and energy undoing.
That tactic didn’t work in the run-up to Brexit. And it won’t work now. And although civil service morale is reportedly at an all time low, know this: there is ultimately nothing the Tories can do to stop civil servants from doing the right thing, no matter who wins the election.

OY5NT954L3_DEAM2W22BK29Y4X,Michelle Mone: leading entrepreneur or lucky baroness?,David Conn,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/25/michelle-mone-leading-entrepreneur-or-lucky-baroness,"Throughout the stunning interviews the Conservative peer Michelle Mone gave last month, finally admitting she had lied for years when denying her involvement in lucrative PPE deals, she still maintained a claim central to her remarkable rise. Hands neatly placed in her lap, she was, she told the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg, a “very successful individual businesswoman”.
Mone and her husband, the Isle of Man-based businessman Doug Barrowman, are facing a long-running National Crime Agency investigation into allegations of bribery and fraud in their securing of £200m in government contracts for a company, PPE Medpro. Both now admit involvement in the company, but deny any wrongdoing.
It is telling that the couple, in complete contradiction to their previous aggressive legal denials, are now claiming it was Mone’s business experience and contacts that enabled them to deliver PPE.
“I’ve got 25 years’ manufacturing experience, and that’s one of the reasons why I was put into the House of Lords,” Mone told Kuenssberg in December. When Covid hit, she said: “I looked at Doug and I thought, we could really, really help here. And I just know all the key players in the far east. And I made the call to Michael Gove.”
Barrowman, who also took part in the BBC interview, had made a similar claim in a film paid for by PPE Medpro that was released on YouTube a week earlier. “Michelle and I looked at each other one day and said, you know, we have strong contacts … in the far east,” he said. “Essentially, Michelle reached out to her contacts, we formed a consortium venture with a company based in Hong Kong and a company based in the UK.”
Analysis of documents, however, raises questions about whether Mone really did use her contacts in the far east, as is now claimed – or whether her role was principally to exploit her Tory political connections to secure those lucrative contracts.
Her claims about her level of success as a businesswoman have also been disputed. Her company had been heading into insolvency and needed to be rescued shortly before she was given a peerage.
And with David Cameron back in government, having himself recently been made a member of the House of Lords, there is a clear connection between the peerage he gave Mone in 2015 and the PPE Medpro “VIP lane” scandal damaging the Tories on voters’ doorsteps.
Mone made the first approach on behalf of PPE Medpro to the ministers Michael Gove and Theodore Agnew in May 2020, offering to supply PPE through “my team in Hong Kong”. Her offer was fast-tracked through the government’s “VIP lane” for politically connected people, and within weeks the newly formed company had been awarded two contracts worth £203m.
Later, the Guardian revealed that leaked bank documents indicated Barrowman – who at the time was still denying any involvement – had been paid at least £65m from PPE Medpro’s profits. He had then transferred £29m into a trust, of which Mone and her three adult children were beneficiaries.
In the BBC interview, Barrowman finally admitted he had made multimillion-pound profits. Not mentioned, however, was that three other companies had been involved in the supply of the PPE, and, according to a Guardian analysis, had shared a further £30m in profit. One of these companies had been paid a large fee to make an introduction to another company in Hong Kong.
Files leaked to the Guardian revealed the structure of the operation. PPE Medpro had entered into an agreement with a separate company, which had committed to supply the PPE. In this agreement, PPE Medpro stated that its role was to use its “extensive network” to secure contracts from the British government. The Guardian has repeatedly asked Mone and Barrowman whether that was a commitment to use Mone’s political connections with Tory ministers. They have never replied directly to that question.
It was the other company, London-based Loudwater Trade and Finance Ltd, whose role was to “manage and secure the supply chain of key PPE items from China and abroad”.
Loudwater in turn contracted with another company, Neumer Trading, for an introduction to the company in Hong Kong, Eric Beare, which bought the PPE from factories in China. Loudwater, Eric Beare and Neumer Trading have declined to comment.
After their broadcast interviews, the Guardian asked Barrowman and Mone why, if the baroness “knew all the right people in the far east”, the supply chain had paid an intermediary company for an introduction in Hong Kong.
They did not respond directly to this question.
Of the PPE delivered to fulfil the two contracts, the government rejected the entire consignment of surgical gowns and is suing PPE Medpro for return of the £122m paid. PPE Medpro is defending the claim, arguing that the gowns were fit for purpose.
Mone’s claims of great business success, key contacts in the far east and deep manufacturing experience spring principally from her lingerie company, Ultimo, which launched her to celebrity-tycoon status nearly two decades ago.
Through the 2000s, Mone built the Ultimo company, MJM International, with her first husband, Michael Mone. They achieved commercial success, reaching a pre-tax profit of almost £1m in 2007-08. Michael Mone is widely said to have concentrated on the operations of the business, while Michelle Mone developed her talent for promoting the brand. Glamorous pictures of models, and later Mone herself, wearing Ultimo bras and underwear were splashed across the internet as celebrity culture boomed.
In August 2015, Cameron appointed Mone, who had supported the union in the Scottish independence referendum, as his “entrepreneurship tsar”, and gave her a peerage later the same month. His government’s statements promoted her image of success, lauding her as a “leading entrepreneur” and stating that “she took the lingerie brand global before the multimillion-pound sale of 80% of the business last year”.
The reality – still generally ignored, but evidenced by Ultimo company documents and a damning 2014 employment tribunal judgment – presents a rather less glittering picture. Mone does not appear to have made multiple millions of pounds from the sale of the company. In fact, the company had been heading for insolvency until it was rescued by a Sri Lankan clothing manufacturer, MAS Holdings.
From 2011 onwards, the Mones’ marriage had fractured and the company’s fortunes had plunged. Michelle Mone later went public with some of the fallout, publishing an autobiography in February 2015 that was extensively serialised in the Daily Mail. Headlines were made as Mone related that she had taken a knife to Michael’s Porsche and scratched it “to shreds”, let down his car tyres, “cut holes in all his boxer shorts” and once “slipped some laxatives into his coffee”.
The employment tribunal case, brought in Glasgow by Ultimo’s operations director, Scott Kilday, found that he had been unfairly dismissed because his office had been bugged after the MAS takeover. The judgment set out the details of MJM’s financial predicament before the takeover. By May 2012, it said, the company “was in dire financial straits … There was a real possibility that the [company] would become insolvent if it failed to find a buyer.”
Mone reached a deal with MAS, which paid her £1.3m for the company. She first had to buy more than half the shares from Michael and another small shareholder. A new company was then set up and Michelle became a director.

A key MAS director, Eliaz Poleg, became anxious that Kilday – “a vital employee” – would leave for Michael’s new business, or was leaking information to Michael, which Kilday denied.
“Mr Poleg … was keen for [Kilday] to stay as in his view he was ‘the pole that kept the tent up’,” the tribunal noted. “[Poleg] had nobody else to keep the ship afloat. Mrs Mone was not hands on from an operational point of view and Mr Mone had left the business.”
Poleg decided “with hesitation and reservation” to “place a recording device in [Kilday’s] office”. Poleg “asked [another MAS representative] and Mrs Mone to make the necessary arrangements”. Kilday discovered the device in a plant pot, “was horrified”, and immediately resigned.
The MAS takeover involved a new company being formed, Ultimo Brands International. Initially, MAS owned 51% of this new company and Mone 49%. Despite investment from MAS, Ultimo continued to make losses. By January 2015, MAS had invested more and Mone’s stake had been reduced to 20%.
When asked whether Mone had been paid for this reduction of her shareholding, an MAS spokesperson said: “MAS continued to invest directly in the company with the intention of turning the business around.” He added that the increase in MAS’s stake to 80% had been “due to the continued investment”.
Mone did not respond directly to questions from the Guardian about these financial arrangements.
Ultimo never recovered, however, and Mone’s shareholding was further diluted. She appears to have still had a small minority stake when the decision was taken in August 2018 to appoint a liquidator and wind up Ultimo.
In 2015, a year after the media had reported on the Kilday employment tribunal, and just six months after the revelations in Mone’s autobiography, Cameron made her the government’s “entrepreneurship tsar”. She was appointed to lead a review for the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) into supporting people from deprived backgrounds to set up their own businesses.
The then work and pensions secretary, Iain Duncan Smith, proclaimed himself “delighted” at her appointment, saying: “There’s no one I can think of who is better qualified.” Weeks later, Cameron appointed her to the House of Lords, with the title Baroness Mone of Mayfair.
Looking back at that period, it is striking to recall the public criticism from her native Scotland, where people knew the Mones and the Ultimo business much better than in England, where papers carried gleeful “Baroness Bra” coverage.
Douglas Anderson, the managing director of the large Glasgow-based plant hire company Gap Group, was among business figures to speak out, providing his views in a letter to Cameron. “Ms Mone is not a successful entrepreneur,” Anderson wrote. “She is a small-time businesswoman with a PR exposure far in excess of any actual success.”
David Mundell, the secretary for Scotland at the time, told the Guardian that Downing Street had bypassed convention that all proposed Scottish peerages are discussed with the Scotland Office.
“The peerage was a fait accompli by the time we heard about it,” Mundell said. “I was unhappy that the proper process was not followed and that the Scotland Office was not asked to provide any background or input. And I wasn’t at all surprised to find that Scottish businesses were very, very unhappy about the appointment.
“I did communicate with Downing Street that Scottish business figures were unhappy because they did not consider Michelle Mone to be a substantial businesswoman.”
The DWP review delivered less than Mone promised. There was some embarrassment when Mone tweeted a picture of herself on a visit to Stockport, in a chauffeur-driven government Jaguar, drying her top on the air-conditioning. “The things you do. In Government car drying my travel top,” she tweeted. “Love it so much.”
Downing Street published a report three months earlier than planned. It offered a handful of ideas to support business startups, although Cameron’s government, dedicated to austerity, offered no new funding to deliver on any of these. Mone herself stressed repeatedly that she would “continue to work in a personal capacity” to create “a nationwide network of bank-funded enterprise hubs” but that never happened. A promised “final part” of the review did not materialise.
The DWP did not answer the Guardian’s questions about its statement that Mone had sold 80% of Ultimo in a multimillion-pound sale in 2014, or about her performance on the review, or why the report had been published early.
A spokesperson for Mone, Barrowman and PPE Medpro replied to questions by saying: “Michelle Mone came from a working-class family in Glasgow’s East End and worked hard to become a successful entrepreneur, building one of the biggest independent lingerie brands in the world. She also sat on the Prince’s Trust board for many years to help the next generation of entrepreneurs. Michelle has real life experience that makes her different to your typical, grey Westminster politician.
“Michelle was honoured to be asked to join the House of Lords by David Cameron after her role in the Scottish referendum campaign. Her appointment was duly vetted by Holac [the House of Lords Appointments Commission] at the time.”
The spokesperson added: “Any suggestion that Michelle ran a successful lingerie company for many years but did not have any experience in manufacturing is laughable.”
Holac’s role is to vet people nominated as peers “for propriety”, and can withhold support if there are legal or regulatory issues such as an outstanding tax investigation.
Cameron and Duncan Smith did not respond to invitations to comment. A Cabinet Office spokesperson pointed out that all peerages are vetted by Holac.
One senior Conservative said he believed Cameron was attracted to the idea that Mone, as a young Scottish businesswoman, would give the Tories a brighter image in the House of Lords, but that he had failed to scrutinise her actual career. Five years on, when Covid hit, she was in place – a baroness swept into the “VIP lane” for untold riches."
OYBVVBLW25_DR15027X34SLUPB,"Men, pick up your toilet brushes! It could solve the great British baby shortage",Coco Khan,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/23/men-pick-up-your-toilet-brushes-it-could-solve-the-great-british-baby-shortage,"If there is one silver lining to 2024, it has to be that eye-watering childcare costs have finally risen up the political agenda. I had the first twinges of hope watching Question Time earlier this month, as the primary care minister, Andrea Leadsom, and Labour’s Lisa Nandy duked it out over which party had the better record on childcare. And this week, we have actual male politicians, including the prime minister himself, talking about the childcare crisis with the urgency that it demands. I wish it was for happier reasons: it’s being talked about now because the free 15 hours of childcare that parents were promised in the autumn statement may not be delivered by the original April deadline. Sunak promises the scheme will happen, and Labour says that if it wins the likely election this year, its childcare plan will be even better. It hasn’t spelled out how, but still, 2024 bodes well on this issue.
Credit must be given to the women’s campaigners who have been raising the alarm on this for years. Though the cynical part of me wonders if the Conservative promise may also have something to do with an issue that has been gaining ground in the rightwing press and in the hard-right flank of the party recently: that of Britain’s baby shortage.
Britain isn’t producing enough babies to provide the workforce needed to support an ageing population. Holding the population steady requires 2.1 children per woman; right now we’re on 1.6. You can top up the deficit with immigration, but Conservative voters aren’t keen on that. Indeed, some of the harder-right commentators have used the shortage to push fearmongering racist narratives about the decline of the white Briton, and hint at the “great replacement” conspiracy theory. Not to mention the “family values” dogwhistle: take Miriam Cates, the Conservative backbencher who has made this topic a personal mission. At the start of this month she hit back at childcare for infants altogether, asking if it was best for children to be given to “strangers”, and wouldn’t it be better to help parents (let’s be real: she means mothers) stay home without fear of financial destitution? The idea that many mothers want to do some work doesn’t factor.
We should take note from other parts of Europe, most notably Hungary and Poland, where having children is being pushed as a moral imperative, resulting in barriers to abortion and the erasure of LGBTQ+ identities. We’re not there yet, but one unnamed cabinet minister has suggested borrowing Hungary’s policy of tax cuts for women with children.
Helping with childcare costs is therefore a bit of a win for the Tories – they get to look right-on for women, and appease some of the extremists they insist on placating.
But childcare costs aren’t the only reason for Britain’s baby shortage. Trust me, I’m 35 – the stick-or-twist age for having kids or having more kids – and this topic dominates my peer group’s conversations. There are issues around suitable housing, the hit on earnings for mothers (British mums only get six weeks of “decently paid” statutory maternity leave, compared with three months or more across many parts of Europe), the difficulties of accessing infertility treatment on the NHS and trouble finding a partner.
But here is one factor that isn’t mentioned nearly enough: chores. Japan’s Nikkei newspaper analysed OECD data and found that countries where men and women share them more equally tend to have more children. Take, for example, France and Norway – these are countries where men tend to do more around the house, and they have more children on average than Britain (1.8 and 1.7 per woman, respectively). Yes, those are nations where maternity leave is better paid, there is significantly more paternity leave or shared parental leave, and childcare costs are lower – but we can’t discount the chores factor, especially when you compare them with Japan and South Korea. Those countries also have better-paid maternity leave and lower childcare costs – but Japanese and South Korean women are still doing the vast bulk of the chores, and have fewer children (1.3 and 0.8). Is it really so surprising that if mothers have a poor quality of life, it will put women off having more children?
Arguably, distribution of chores may not be a matter for government policy; perhaps that is more about culture and education. But as rightwing voices use the baby shortage as a way to push their worldview – an anti-migrant, low-public-spending, traditionally gendered worldview – it’s worth remembering. It won’t be the cliched red-blooded breadwinning man and docile domestic woman that will spark a baby boom. Bring on the men with the papooses! Hands up, gentlemen who are unafraid of the bog brush! Britain’s future is with you.

OZBR7BB4B2_W2USQSMOG116LPT,Gérard Depardieu sexual assault claim dropped due to statute of limitations,Philip Oltermann,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/jan/22/gerard-depardieu-sexual-assault-claim-dropped-due-to-statute-of-limitations,"A sexual assault complaint against Gérard Depardieu has been dropped because it was past the statute of limitations, prosecutors in Paris have said.
The complaint, by French actor Hélène Darras, was filed last year but relates to the filming of Disco in 2007, during which Depardieu allegedly groped and propositioned her.
Darras was one of the 13 women who accused Depardieu of sexual misconduct in an investigative story that ran on French investigative website Mediapart in April 2023. She filed her complaint last September, after being interviewed as part of the investigation.
“It took me a year to go from talking about what happened to the criminal complaint,” she said at the time.“Walking through the door of a police station, telling an officer someone touched your intimate parts, it’s not easy, you need time to think about it,” she added.But she had “wanted to respond to the defence that plays down our allegations by saying they’re ‘just’ witness accounts”, Darras said.
Depardieu, 75, has been charged with rape in another case and has been accused of sexual harassment and assault by more than a dozen women, allegations he denies. In October 2023, he published an open letter in French newspaper Le Figaro defending himself. “Never, ever have I abused a woman,” he wrote.
In an open letter published in conservative-leaning French newspaper Le Figaro last month, 56 French film stars, including Carla Bruni and Charlotte Rampling, defended Depardieu against what they called a public “lynching”.
Neither Darras nor Depardieu’s lawyers were immediately available for comment.
In an interview with broadcaster France 2 for a documentary on Depardieu, Darras had accused him of touching her hips and buttocks and inviting her into his dressing room, continuing even after she refused.
Depardieu was in 2020 charged with rape and sexual assault after another actor, Charlotte Arnould, filed her own complaint over allegations dating to 2018. He has denied all charges; the case is now working its way through the courts.Arnould’s lawyer has also asked Paris prosecutors to investigate a recording of Depardieu making derogatory comments about women during a filming trip to North Korea, which was later passed to France 2 and broadcast in its documentary. In a separate case, Spanish journalist and author Ruth Baza said she had filed a criminal complaint in Spain against Depardieu last month, claiming he raped her nearly three decades ago in Paris.The complaint has little hope of leading to charges due to the statute of limitations in France, but Baza said she decided to go ahead anyway in the hope that it would “help other people” to do the same.Repeated allegations of sexual violence against Depardieu have become a culture-war frontline in France, dividing the world of cinema and pitting feminist groups against the actor’s defenders – including Emmanuel Macron.The French president last month said Depardieu should enjoy the presumption of innocence, calling him an “immense actor” who “makes France proud” and saying he was now the victim of a “manhunt”.Macron more recently conceded that he had not “said enough how important the words of women who are victims of this violence are”.

P0OI2P7ZRR_0LG1WSSLLQLILA1,Poland’s rightwing populists are getting a taste of their own medicine – and they hate it,Wojciech Orliński,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/26/poland-right-populist-ministers-president-pardon-law,"From the outside, Poland may seem to be in turmoil, its democracy at risk of being derailed by a palace farce, a far-right fightback or both. Two fugitive politicians, who served as ministers in the recently ousted rightwing government, were arrested earlier this month after seeking refuge in the presidential palace. The president, Andrzej Duda, thought he could grant them asylum – but as it turned out, his personal security detachment was loyal not to him but to the new government, and facilitated the arrest warrant. The former ministers went to prison, but after a fortnight of standoff, the president this week granted them a pardon.
Why couldn’t he have done it sooner? Well, that’s a long story.
To understand this extraordinary episode, which even the prime minister, Donald Tusk, described as “unbelievable”, we first need to understand how the new and old political camps are using the rule of law as they tussle for control.
On one side is the new government, led by Tusk, the leader of the liberal-left coalition that emerged victorious in the parliamentary election last October. On the other side is the opposition, nationalist Law and Justice party (PiS), which ran the country for the previous eight years, and shaped its laws and institutions to fit its populist rightwing agenda.
The political transition was always going to be bumpy. Law and Justice’s leaders had to cede power to Tusk after failing to form a government, but they expected to hold on to some of it. After all, they still had an opposition loyalist in the presidency until mid-2025. They miscalculated, to put it mildly. Jarosław Kaczyński, the PiS leader, was also used to getting his way: despite a wafer-thin majority, he had governed Poland with an iron fist.
There were constitutional and judicial constraints. Poland’s highest courts resisted Kaczyński at times, but he found his way around them. The rulings of the constitutional tribunal become law only when published by the official government register. So if you control the government, you can simply refuse to publish the verdict and – presto! This simple trick allowed Kaczyński to eviscerate the high courts.
Presidential authority in Poland is mostly ceremonial. The office is referred to as “the guardian of the chandelier”, due to the namesake element of decor in the grand ballroom of the presidential palace. The Polish president has the constitutional power of veto, but Duda was not a problem for PiS. He rarely exercised his powers.
The constitution also gives the president the right to pardon sentenced offenders. Duda is now trying to use this prerogative to provide immunity to rightwing politicians and pundits who find themselves on the wrong side of history.
The two PiS politicians, Mariusz Kamiński and Maciej Wąsik, were convicted of abuse of power in 2015, and last month sentenced to two-year jail terms. They refused to comply on the grounds that Duda had already issued them with a pre-emptive presidential pardon. But the president is not a king with the royal prerogative of pardoning a prisoner in advance of their sentencing.
They claimed, ludicrously, to be Poland’s newest political prisoners. In fact, the story of their conviction dates back to 2007, when Kaczyński needed the backing of the ultra-populist agrarian movement leader Andrzej Lepper to form a coalition. Kaczyński openly despised Lepper, but he had to give the former pig-farmer the ministry of agriculture and the title of deputy prime minister in exchange for votes. He frequently expressed his contempt, making it the most exotic coalition in Polish history (members of the same cabinet had a habit of insulting each other in public).
As tensions between Kaczyński and Lepper became apparently unreconcilable, Wąsik and Kamiński, officials in a newly formed anti-corruption agency at the time, concocted a plan involving a fake real-estate deal. The anti-corruption agency’s investigation led to what became known as the “land scandal” and the sacking of Lepper. But the two politicians were later charged with a range of offences, and in 2015 were found guilty of abusing their powers.
As long as PiS was in power, Wąsik and Kamiński were untouchable. The supreme court ruled in 2017 that Duda’s pardon was unconstitutional and not legally binding – but PiS simply ignored this verdict, like many others. Duda’s “pardon” kept them out of prison and allowed them to serve in government.
Even today, Duda is pretending his unlawful pardon never happened. He tried the farcical “palace hideout” scheme to protect the pair. When that failed, he tried to blow the whistle internationally, calling for the EU, Nato and even the World Economic Forum in Davos to liberate the “political prisoners in Poland” – eliciting nothing but raised eyebrows.

Duda and Kaczyński look like class bullies who have finally been punched back and just don’t know what to do. Tusk’s new coalition is meanwhile proving creative in finding loopholes in the legal straitjacket created for it by the previous regime. It can’t fire the management of Polish state radio and TV? It can put the stations in receivership and the interim administration can do as it pleases. The new prosecutor general cannot change his own deputy without presidential approval? He can nominate an “acting” deputy as a temporary caretaker.
As dubious as some of these workarounds may seem, they are legally binding until found otherwise by a court of law. The opposition is crying foul and claiming to be worried about the rule of law. But PiS used the same strategy extensively for eight years. Now it finds itself on the receiving end.
The new government is also picking its fights wisely. Wąsik and Kamiński were never popular with public opinion. Ditto the rightwing pundits in the state-owned media and PiS-appointed public prosecutors. When they are ousted from their well-paid jobs, the majority applauds it.
In a recent opinion poll, 56% of respondents claim to be satisfied by the recent actions of the new government, against 37% who are dissatisfied. So far nothing indicates this tendency will change before local elections in April.
As long as the opinion polls are in favour of his government, Tusk has little incentive to change course. The rightwing opposition can’t do much to stop him. The most it can do is to stage protests that may be loud and spectacular, but are futile nevertheless – just like the protests that the liberal-left opposition spent eight years staging. Our system is designed to ensure that it’s fairly easy to form a government and nearly impossible to topple it. For good or ill, Polish politics is decided by the ballot box.

P57OXQR2Y5_7WJFVZSFVNCCSW7,‘We suffer in silence’: five women share their miscarriage stories,Ava Macha,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/jan/24/pregnancy-miscarriage-stories,"Up to one in five known pregnancies end in miscarriage, but despite its ubiquity, the details of the experience are rarely discussed.
In September 2023, an Ohio woman who miscarried in the toilet at 22 weeks was turned in to police when she sought medical attention. A grand jury declined to indict Brittany Watts for “abuse of corpse” this month, but the charges sparked outrage on social media, prompting many women around the country to recount their own miscarriage stories.
Our recent callout asked readers about having a miscarriage in the US and was answered by over 100 people. Almost all indicated that understanding the statistical frequency of miscarriages – they occur in 10%-20% of known pregnancies – didn’t lessen the trauma they felt in the aftermath. In terms of treatment and support, respondents described a spectrum of experiences: doctors who were coldly indifferent or made them feel like criminals; surprise at the realization that many around them had also gone through pregnancy loss; and callous reactions from people who didn’t understand the physical or emotional process of miscarriage.
Many also wanted to emphasize that there is no control over where a miscarriage might occur: at the gym, during a board meeting, at church – and most commonly while on the toilet.
We selected five of those testimonies. Each entry has been vetted, but last names have been withheld to protect the women’s privacy.
– Libby, in Montana, where abortion is banned at fetal viability, generally 24–26 weeks
About 11 years ago, when I was near the end of graduate school, my husband and I decided to try to get pregnant. Seven weeks into the pregnancy, my gynecologist confirmed the heartbeat. Less than a week later, I started to get really painful cramping, so painful I was light-headed and could barely walk.
My husband wanted to take me to the hospital that specialized in childbirth, but I was in so much pain that I insisted on going to the nearest emergency room. During the intake, they told me my blood pressure was low. Once I was admitted to the room and asked to describe my symptoms and why I came in, the male emergency room tech actually told me, in front of my husband, that miscarriages are normal and don’t hurt much and that my pain was a result of my emotions around losing a pregnancy. This was before I even knew I had lost the pregnancy.
Then the male emergency room doctor examined me. He made a disgusted face and tossed something across the room into the metal bin, saying he believed he had just seen some “fetal material”. There was no empathy, rather the opposite. My husband was tearing up and asked to excuse himself for air. When he left, the male tech commented: “We usually don’t see the husbands get upset like this. It’s usually the women.”
My memory of our treatment in that room has haunted me for years, especially as I hear women being charged for their miscarriages. While I don’t necessarily attribute some of our treatment to racism, I will note that my husband was Black and I am white.
– Heather, in Illinois, where abortion is banned at fetal viability
Pregnant women who miscarry cannot control whether we lose our pregnancy or not. It’s a tragedy for most of us. We wonder what we could have done differently even though we know we have no control.
It’s magical thinking to imagine ourselves able to prevent our own miscarriages, and we need help not to blame ourselves for losing what we wanted most, a child. The new legal trend to police and persecute women who miscarry is as barbaric as it is ignorant of the most basic knowledge of how pregnancy works. The idea that women can be held criminally responsible for miscarriage is a misogynist fantasy, divorced from the reality of miscarriage.
– Britta, in Washington, where abortion is banned at fetal viability
The way we’re brought up, the way health teachers in school talk, you’d think you could get pregnant looking at someone the wrong way. Getting pregnant is hard. Getting pregnant is an emotional and physical rollercoaster. And if you miscarry, you, the birthing parent, can be left with a lot of physical and mental trauma. You blame yourself. You blame your body. You develop an unshakable fear about what might happen if you get pregnant again. And if you think too hard about what’s going on as it’s happening, you can’t shake the reality that there is a life that has ended inside of you. Your body is a vessel for a failed life. You are walking around the world knowing that, visualizing that, unable to take your mind off of that.
Yet, somehow, you are supposed to get up and go to work. Somehow, you are supposed to go to the grocery store, and pay the bills, and just keep going.
Women suffer through the experience in silence, either because it is too devastating to talk about, or because they don’t feel like it’s something people talk about. What I needed was shoulders to cry on, endless hugs, and compassion for my inability to operate like my normal self for a while. I wished the world had given me permission to not be OK, and to take a step back.
– Lisa, in New Jersey, where abortion is not restricted based on gestational duration
Miscarriage happens all the time. It’s not [Brittany Watts’s] fault. No matter whether she wanted the pregnancy or not, it’s traumatic. Plus, you have all this crazy hormonal stuff going on. I totally understand how this went the way it did for the Ohio woman.
If you aren’t getting anywhere with the medical staff and you’re just sitting around while you cramp and bleed, I’d also think it’s just as good as not to deal with this at home as at the hospital. The fact that the state is trying to prosecute her for not properly dealing with the remains of a nonviable pregnancy, all while she knew she actually needed medical care, is insane.
– Kristi, in Wisconsin, where abortion is banned after 22 weeks
We were excited to see our baby. During the ultrasound, the source of the bleeding was found. I had placenta previa, which often corrects itself. The tech also wanted to show us the baby and look at its heartbeat.
I remember the room going absolutely silent as she looked and looked and found no movement. No heartbeat. And her words, “I know this is not what you were expecting,” broke the silence like they were far away. I panicked. She brought in a very kind OB-GYN who went over options with us. I could wait to see if my body would “abort” the baby on its own or schedule a D and C right away. I decided to wait. I guess I wasn’t ready to let go. I didn’t have any support outside of my husband and was so scared. A missed miscarriage or missed abortion were the terms used. I hated the words. My baby had died. I wanted less medical terminology used and a more compassionate experience.
After two weeks went by, I scheduled a D and C. I found it to be miserable. My anxiety was overriding sedation and it was painful. I wanted to take the “products of conception” home for burial, but they had to go to the lab first. We collected them, wrapped in a brown lunch bag, a couple of days later. We eventually had a ritual to say goodbye to our first baby, named Izzy.
Now, at 56 years old, I realize how fortunate I was for the compassionate care I received. How much privilege I had during my treatment and care. I’m working for that kind of care for all moms.

P5F4T47NLP_BOBADVZXE1JC59D,Spain to review museums and enable them to ‘move past colonial framing’,Sam Jones,_,20230123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/23/spain-to-review-museums-and-enable-them-to-move-past-colonial-framing,"Spain’s socialist-led coalition government has announced a review of state-run museums to enable them to “move past a colonial framing” of people and the past, and has pledged to fight against political meddling and censorship of the arts.
Ernest Urtasun, a member of the leftwing Sumar platform who was appointed culture minister last November, told MPs he was committed to “guaranteeing the effective exercise of cultural rights throughout Spain” and ensuring that creative institutions engaged with society and the wider world.
“As you know, museums are living organisms that respond to the issues and debates of the times,” he told the congressional culture committee on Monday.
“With that in mind, one of the challenges we’re proposing … is the establishment of spaces for dialogue and exchange that will allow us to move past a colonial framing or one rooted in old gender or ethnocentric habits that have so often damaged how we see heritage, history and artistic legacies.”
Urtasun said such considerations had already been incorporated into the programmes of the National Anthropological museum and the Museum of America, adding: “We’re working to recognise and draw attention to the perspectives of the communities and the memory of the peoples from whom these works on display came.”
The minister also signalled a determination to tackle growing attempts to censor art for political ends, saying his department would stand with any creator, artist or collective whose work had been erased or censored.
“Protecting culture and understanding its relevance in building an equal society means protecting democracy, fundamental rights and freedoms and the welfare state,” said Urtasun.
The conservative People’s party (PP) and the far-right Vox party have been accused of politically motivated censorship and stoking culture wars in recent months after a series of events was cancelled on ideological grounds.
In July last year, the PP-Vox council of the northern Spanish town of Bezana apparently cancelled a screening of the Toy Story spin-off film Lightyear because it features a kiss between two women – a scene that led to the movie being banned in Saudi Arabia. Vox has also been accused of vetoing a theatrical adaptation of Virginia Woolf’s time-travelling, gender-shifting classic Orlando because its protagonist “goes from being a man to a woman”.
In December last year, Vox succeeded in its attempt to scrap a 23-year-old annual cultural festival in the north-eastern city of Huesca by threatening to scupper the upcoming budget proposed by the PP-run city council. Vox had argued that last year’s Periferias festival – which was dedicated to Gypsy culture – was a waste of money that “serves only to shower arty-farty trendy lefties with thousands of euros”.
Opposition MPs took exception to being called censors and to what they saw as Urtasun’s revisionist, partisan and politically correct approach to culture and Spain’s imperial past.
“You accuse us of censorship when you – the ‘woke’ left – are the champions when it comes to censorship,” Vox’s culture spokesperson, Joaquín Robles, told the minister. “If anyone deviates from the ideological path you defend, they’re immediately considered an outcast.”
Robles also accused Urtasun of comparing Spain’s imperial activities to Belgium’s atrocities in the Congo and of falling victim to the centuries of anti-Spanish and anti-Catholic propaganda known as the Black Legend. He suggested Spain had been beneficent by comparison and insisted it had not possessed colonies in Latin America, but rather viceroyalties.
“Do you know how many universities Spain founded in Spanish America?” he asked. “More than 27! What about all the cathedrals? The people who lived there had the same rights that the Spanish had in the viceroyalties. Spain never had colonies. That’s part of the Black Legend that you manifestly appeared to have internalised.”
The PP’s culture spokesman, Borja Sémper, warned Urtasun against allowing politics to permeate his ministry, duties and policies.
“Don’t be an ideological bureaucrat and don’t become a political activist in your important ministry,” he said. “You need to share a vision of culture in Spain that is open, plural and modern … If you pursue the dangerous idea of wrapping culture in a leftwing flag, you’ll be excluding an important part of Spanish society from the love and understanding from culture, and, of course, from the policies that are needed to promote culture.”"
P7W5PC7779_SOARE9CICZHY5VU,Seattle: racial justice protesters who sued police win $10m payout,_,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/25/seattle-police-settlement-protesters-george-floyd,"Seattle has agreed to pay $10m to 50 demonstrators who sued over the police department’s heavy-handed response to racial justice protests in 2020, in a settlement announced by attorneys from both sides on Wednesday.
The protesters were among tens of thousands who rallied downtown and in the Capitol Hill neighborhood for weeks following the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police – a period that saw Seattle’s police department abandon its East Precinct building as well as the establishment of the “Capitol Hill Occupied Protest”, a six-block zone taken over by protesters.
The police department – led by then chief Carmen Best – used aggressive techniques to disperse the crowds, including flash-bang grenades, foam-tipped projectiles, and blast balls that explode and emit pepper gas.
At some points during protests, people in the crowds did cause damage, including burning police cars and trying to set a fire at the East Precinct. But a federal judge ordered the department to stop using chemical and other weapons indiscriminately against against peaceful demonstrators.
When police used them even after Best and then mayor Jenny Durkan promised they would stop, the city council voted unanimously to bar officers from doing so.
Among the plaintiffs in the lawsuit was Aubreanna Inda, who was standing in the middle of a street before a phalanx of officers in riot gear when a blast ball hit her in the chest and exploded, causing her to go into cardiac arrest. Volunteer medics and other protesters performed CPR and brought her to a hospital.
Others included a teenager whose finger was partially blown off, a disabled veteran with a cane who was teargassed and tackled, and dozens who suffered hearing loss, broken bones, concussions, severe bruises, PTSD or other injuries, according to the lawsuit.
The case involved more than 10,000 videos, including police body-worn camera recordings, and hundreds of witness interviews.
“Historians should review what we collected and write the true story of the shameful behavior of our city against the peaceful protesters,” Karen Koehler, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said in a statement on Wednesday.
City attorney Ann Davison said in a statement that lawsuit had resulted in a “significant drain” on time and resources and Seattle is not admitting liability in the settlement, which was signed on Tuesday.
“This decision was the best financial decision for the city considering risk, cost and insurance,” Davison said.
A three-month trial had been expected to begin in May."
PCJ527QUY4_LJH6EYUTJ8LD0Q5,The US says it needs up to 22m acres for the solar energy transition – here’s what that looks like,Oliver Milman,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/23/us-solar-energy-transition-land,"If the US is to rid itself of fossil fuels then one of its primary replacements, solar energy, is going to need land. A lot of land.
The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), which oversees more of the public realm than any other federal government agency, has outlined exactly how much of western America should be made available for solar panels and their associated cables and transformers – up to 22m acres. That is roughly the size of Maine, or an area larger than Scotland.
This total, part of a new administration plan to accelerate solar energy in the US west, will give the US “maximum flexibility” to meet climate goals, the BLM said.
A smaller area of this available land, around 700,000 acres, will definitely need to be dotted with solar panels to meet a goal set by Joe Biden to have a 100% clean electricity grid by 2035. This is still a big leap from the status quo, where only around 34,000 acres of bureau land is used for solar.
Solar may currently contribute little more than 3% of the US’s electricity generation but it is having something of a moment, with projects bolstered by Biden’s huge tranche of clean energy subsidies. The BLM is progressing several major solar projects – the largest, in Nevada, is set to be 5,500 acres in size, enough to power more than 200,000 homes – and utility-scale solar generation is expected to grow 75% by next year compared to last, adding 79,000 megawatts of new capacity.
The scale of this growth, however, has unsettled some residents who oppose solar farms in their communities or on farmland, as well as environmentalists who fret over the fate of species such as the desert tortoise as seemingly empty habitat is upended into a new, mirrored, reality.
Even if land is used for a solar project, though, it can still be utilized for some other agricultural uses and BLM said it would prefer development to take place within 10 miles of existing transmission lines, with exclusions for habitat and cultural reasons.
Green groups say a detente can be found between the desire to protect food-producing land and habitat for threatened species while also tackling a climate crisis that menaces both people and wildlife.
“Renewable energy on public lands can be a win-win-win,” said Justin Meuse, a campaigner at the Wilderness Society. “It’s imperative and it’s possible.”
This article was amended on 25 January 2024. The headline, text and graphic were changed to clarify that the Bureau of Land Management needs up to 22m acres for the solar energy transition."
PDBGYLBW44_EOA3LOO8DE1D8YO,"Brown, Yale and Columbia to pay $62m in lawsuit claiming they favor wealthy applicants",Erum Salam,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/24/brown-yale-columbia-lawsuit-wealthy-applicants,"Brown, Yale and Columbia are among a group of universities that have agreed to pay a combined $62m to resolve a lawsuit that accused them and others of favoring wealthy applicants, pushing total settlements in the case to $118m.
Lawyers for a proposed class of more than 200,000 current and former US college students disclosed the latest settlements in a filing late Tuesday in Chicago federal court.
The University of Chicago, Vanderbilt, Emory and Rice had already reached settlements in the 2022 case, which alleged intentionally limiting financial aid in violation of US antitrust law.
The colleges were all part of a group called the 568 Presidents Group, named after section 568 of the Improving America’s Schools Act of 1994, which states it is not unlawful for institutions of higher education to use a shared formula for awarding financial aid, so long as they practiced “need-blind” admissions – meaning financial need was not considered when deciding whether to admit students.
The lawsuit has been nicknamed the “568 Cartel lawsuit” by some for the way this group of elite schools conspired to restrict aid by violating a pledge not to consider students’ finances in making admissions decisions, giving wealthy students an edge, the plaintiffs claim.
In the lawsuit, plaintiffs alleged these colleges “agreed among themselves on how to calculate need-based financial aid ‘to reduce or eliminate … price competition’ between members of the 568 Presidents Group”, the lawsuit states. “And ensure families pay ‘the maximum that they are capable of paying’.”
The 568 Presidents Group dissolved in the midst of litigation. The schools, including those that have reached settlements, have denied wrongdoing.
Yale and Emory said they would each pay $18.5m, Brown agreed to pay $19.5m and Columbia and Duke both said they would pay $24m.
The amount of Vanderbilt’s settlement has not been disclosed. The University of Chicago, which was the first school to settle, said it planned to pay $13.5m.
The remaining defendants are: Cornell University, the University of Pennsylvania, Georgetown University, Caltech, Northwestern University, Dartmouth College, Johns Hopkins University, Duke University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Notre Dame.
One of the plaintiffs’ lawyers, Robert Gilbert, in a statement urged leaders of other schools to “resolve the overcharges to middle class and working-class students”.
Brown in a statement said it decides student aid independently and “in alignment with our own institutional methodologies for determining need”.

Spokespeople for Columbia, Emory and Yale said settling allowed the schools to move past the case and focus on their academic missions.
Duke did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Matthew Kennelly, a US district judge, must still approve the settlements. He declined to dismiss the lawsuit in 2022.
A similar lawsuit was brought against MIT and its fellow Ivy League private, elite schools in 1991. In that case, a federal judge ruled against the universities for violating antitrust laws by participating in a decades-long conspiracy together in order to fix tuition amounts, making the the cost to attend any of these schools relatively the same. After the lawsuit was filed, all universities except MIT agreed to sign a consent decree agreeing to stop these price-fixing activities.

PDR4O067XN_FQJSWQYARV1V0MC,"Devastating drought in Amazon result of climate crisis, study shows",Damian Carrington,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/24/devastating-drought-in-amazon-result-of-climate-crisis-study-shows,"The climate crisis turned the drought that struck the Amazon rainforest in 2023 into a devastating event, a study has found.
The drought was the worst recorded in many places and hit the maximum “exceptional” level on the scientific scale. Without planet-warming emissions from the burning of oil, gas and coal, the drought would have been far less extreme, the analysis found.
It also showed the drought was made 30 times more likely to happen by global heating. The return of the natural El Niño climate phenomenon is associated with drier conditions but played only a small role, the scientists said.
The climate crisis is supercharging extreme weather across the planet, but the extreme Amazon drought is a stark and worrying example because the rainforest is already thought to be close to a tipping point into a drier state. This would result in a mass die-off of trees in the world’s most important store of carbon on land, releasing large amounts of CO2 and driving global temperatures even higher.
Millions of people in the Amazon have been affected by the drought, with some rivers at their lowest levels for more than a century. There have been drinking water shortages, failed crops and power cuts, as hydroelectric plants dried up. The drought also worsened wildfires and high water temperatures were linked to a mass mortality of river life, including the deaths of more than 150 endangered pink river dolphins in a single week.
“The Amazon could make or break our fight against climate change,” said Regina Rodrigues, a professor at the Federal University of Santa Catarina, Brazil, and part of the World Weather Attribution team that did the analysis.
“If we protect the forest, it will continue to act as the world’s largest land-based carbon sink,” she said. “But if we allow human-induced emissions and deforestation to push it through the tipping point, it will release large amounts of CO2. We need to protect the rainforest and move away from fossil fuels as quickly as possible.”
Simphiwe Stewart, a researcher at the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre in the Netherlands and also part of the team, said: “Many communities living in the Amazon simply haven’t seen a drought like this before. People were forced to make huge journeys, dragging boats over dried up sections of river, to access food, medicine and other essential goods. It’s critical that government interventions are geared towards supporting communities to prepare for intensifying drought as the climate warms.”
The analysis used peer-reviewed methods to compare droughts in today’s climate, which is 1.2C hotter, with those that would have occurred in a cooler, pre-industrial climate. The researchers looked in particular at “agricultural drought”, which accounts for both low rainfall and the evaporation of water from soils and plants driven by high temperatures.
They found that global heating is decreasing rainfall and increasing heat in the Amazon, making the drought from June to November 2023 about 30 times more likely. El Niño was responsible for some of the reduced rainfall, but the high temperatures were almost entirely due to climate change, making it the primary driver of the drought.
The extreme drought of 2023 would be expected about once every 50 years in today’s climate, the analysis estimated. But if global heating reaches 2C, such a severe drought would be expected every 13 years.

The scientists said the large-scale destruction of the rainforest for beef and soy production in recent decades had worsened the drought because the clearing of the vegetation means the land retains less water.
Recent data shows that the Amazon rainforest is approaching a tipping point, after which the rainforest would be lost with profound implications for the global climate and biodiversity. More than 75% of the untouched forest has lost stability since the early 2000s, the study showed, meaning it takes longer to recover after droughts and wildfires.
Gareth Redmond-King, at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit in the UK, said: “The Amazon rainforest is critical to regulating our planet’s climate, but this area of South America is also critical to the UK in an even more immediate sense.”
“About half of our food imports come from climate impact hotspots, including Peru, Colombia and Brazil, which are our top suppliers of bananas, avocados, melons and other fruit, as well as soya beans for feeding British livestock,” he said. “So climate change’s devastating effects on South America’s farmers last year may well translate into gaps on our supermarket shelves and higher prices for our food.”"
PE5GODF2PM_JUAVMLUVCL47KPL,"The experts: photographers on 20 easy, enjoyable ways to vastly improve your pictures",Sarah Phillips,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/jan/26/the-experts-photographers-on-20-easy-enjoyable-ways-to-vastly-improve-your-pictures,"We are all photographers now, with a phone in our pocket ready to capture life, love and everything in between – which, quite often, is incredibly mundane, such as what we had for lunch. But how can you make sure you are taking the best possible pictures? Here, photographers share their top tips.
“The best camera is the one in your hand,” says the Guardian photographer Sarah Lee. “How many of us have seen something that would make a wonderful photograph and had nothing to record it with? The good thing about a cameraphone is that you tend to have it on you.”
As a professional photographer, Lee tries to carry a Leica with her everywhere, “but sometimes I don’t have it and I’ll see a shot”. Luckily, phone cameras are pretty good these days. “Early phone photography was terrible,” she says. “It used to be a throwaway image. Now, you can get good, credible, high-resolution images.”
“Take photos with care and consideration, whatever the camera in your hand,” says Lee. “If it is your phone, don’t just hold it up and point it at the scene and think that works. Try to consider the light, the composition, how you’re going to frame it. Give the camera in your phone the same respect that you would give any camera.”
“I don’t really like that a lot of phones put in smart software to make the sky look better or do high dynamic range (HDR), because, as a photographer, I like to have control,” says Lee. “One thing that is really useful on an iPhone is, when you hold your finger on the screen while taking a picture, there is a yellow bar; you can play with exposure and think about the light.”
“Don’t be afraid to use your legs as the zoom, to walk closer or further away,” says Lee. “You’ll notice most photographers when they work are crouching or bending in strange ways. I’m always surprised if I see a picture of myself working, because I’ve often got my bum up in the air. You’re doing that to make all these tiny adjustments to make the framing better.”
“With landscape photography, the first step is to know when you’re going to have a chance of a great photo,” says Will Davies, Britain’s Landscape Photographer of the Year for 2022. “Misty mornings in autumn, the transition from snow to clear weather in the winter – these are the conditions where your odds will be high.”
“When it comes to getting the shot, practice and research will help,” says Davies. “Returning to locations that have worked before, gathering insights from other photos you’ve seen – all of this will help increase your chances. I also believe in opportunism and adapting to the conditions. Sometimes, the best shot is not the one you planned, but the one you just happened to see on that day.”
“With landscape photography, a common challenge is that foregrounds tend to be too dark and skies too bright. I am always looking for opportunities to reverse that – for example, where the sunlight is hitting the foreground, but the background is in cloud,” says Davies. “Similarly, if you can find a scene where light is hitting an interesting focal point, while the borders of the frame are in shadow, this can create a great effect.”
Ali Smith, a photographer from New York City who now lives in Norwich, says it is almost not worth bothering with the flash on a phone. “It only offers one direction for a light source out of 360 degrees of options,” she says, adding that there are likely to be much better options. “If you hit a subject such as a person with the flash, most often your phone will expose the person and underexpose what’s behind or around them. Fine if that’s what you’re going for, but limiting if not.”
Smith was a punk musician in the 1990s and got into photography through shooting at gigs, which she describes in her new book, The Ballad of Speedball Baby. When taking a photo, “there are two different ways that I think”, she says. “One is emotionally driven and one is aesthetically driven. Aesthetically, I’d look at light, colour, texture; emotionally, I would throw that mostly out the window.”
“I really like colour and patterns,” says Smith, who is always on the lookout for complementary and clashing combinations. “I am a portrait photographer, so faces are endlessly intriguing to me.”
When she shot Ethan Hawke on a Brooklyn rooftop in 2020, “He showed up in a hole-ridden black jumper, but I thought the plain white T-shirt underneath was way cooler, so I suggested he lose the sweater,” she says. “Sensing my enthusiasm about the look, he felt confident and excited about it, too.”
Be aware of the background, Lee says. “Think: ‘Do I want that old Tesco bag in the background? Do I want those cables hanging down off that lamp-post?’ Be aware of other things in the frame. You often think: ‘That picture would be great if it didn’t have half a Honda Civic poking into it.’ If you can master that, it will improve your photos instantly.”
Some professional photographers hate portrait mode, as it seems like cheating, says Smith, but she says it can be a shortcut to taking great pictures. She also uses filters and crops and occasionally retouches images, although she is not a fan of airbrushing. “They are all tools to get to the same place,” she says.
… but they often need a little help to get the right pose. “It is useless to say: ‘Smile!’ unless you want them to have their tongue sticking out awkwardly,” says Smith. “You have to entertain, you have to elicit a response, you have to be taking a photo while you’re asking them about something, so they look as if they are thinking. But mostly what works is saying: ‘One, two, three, fart!’ You’ll get a big laugh.”
If they are having their picture taken with an adult, make sure the adult is ready for the shot, too; they can often be distracted by the child, Smith says. Lee employs a Donald Duck impression for children. “If you spring it at the right moment it will get their attention and they will turn and look at you. Very occasionally, they will cry.”
“A high-pitched squeak will normally get an animal to turn its head and look at you with a sharp expression of interest,” says Lee. Out in the wild, “more expensive equipment does help”, says Davies. “Big telephoto lenses will open more opportunities for wildlife closeups, but they don’t come cheap. But there are exceptions. I was on Skomer Island in Pembrokeshire this summer and the puffins are so relaxed you can get great shots with any gear.”
“I used to be obsessed with not smiling, because it was an acknowledgment that you’re taking a photo and this is a contrived situation,” says Smith. “But I just like to get something out of people, whatever that is. The point is that you’re participating and making something together. Without that, it’s not as interesting.” That said, contemplative expressions can be particularly effective, she says.
Lee never tells people to smile. She recalls how the revered Observer photographer Jane Bown once said she asks her subjects just to look at her. “I tell people to look at the lens as if they are looking at me, rather than the camera, as if they are concentrating on something interesting. Sometimes, that makes them laugh.”
When Smith photographed the US TV host Rachel Maddow, “I had five minutes to find a connection with her and elicit a response. This is a skill I’ve had to learn.” On photographing live music, Smith says: “Get close and shoot with a wide angle. Experiment with shooting directly into light sources. Be loose with your framing. Try to match the energy of what you’re photographing with the energy of taking the photos.”
“Talk to people,” says Jennie Baptiste, a photographer from London who covers music and youth culture. “I didn’t grow up behind a screen. I went out, I did vox pops, I went to Camden [in London] and talked to goths and took their portraits.” She says you need to make subjects “feel as relaxed as possible to capture the true essence of who they are”.
“We are bombarded with images like never before, thanks to mobile phones,” says Baptiste. “We don’t tend to spend much time actually looking within the image. It tends to be a quick scroll and on to the next thing. If you want to make your photos captivating, you need to have some kind of strategic thinking as to how you’re going to engage your audience so that they stop and look at the image. The challenge is to create your own aesthetic style and not get heavily influenced by what you are seeing online.”
“Black and white can convey a lot of emotion and fragility,” says Baptiste. “It brings a psychological connection with the viewer that isn’t necessarily there in colour images.” She enjoys playing with different tones, such as sepia and selenium, drawing on reportage photographers such as Don McCullin, and advises exploring the scale from black to grey to see the different effects they can bring. When Baptiste photographed the musician Roots Manuva – the image is in the National Portrait Gallery’s collection – she shot only in black and white.
“People should spend time at home taking lots of selfies,” says Smith. “You can learn how to control things such as exposure and focus. You have to look into those. Once you know, it’s something that’s easy to do on the fly.”
Lee hates turning a cameraphone on herself accidentally: “Every year it gets more distressing and you look like a dissolved puddle.” Instead, she says: “I’m quite a fan of taking arty selfies in mirrors. Lifts are my weakness. I’m also very fond of a bevelled edge on a mirror, where you get a double effect and it looks quite noir.”
“Many people will have thousands of photographs on there,” says Baptiste. “But photo albums are a wonderful thing. I grew up in a family with lots of photo albums. I would regularly spend my weekends looking through photos and immersing myself in my family history and heritage, because I was born here, but my parents are from Saint Lucia. The challenge, because of our fast-paced culture, is taking time out to make albums. Reflecting on achievements and occasions with friends and family can help you mentally.”
Smith adds: “You must make sure you print them. If that phone breaks or gets stolen, they could be gone.”"
PHHJJKUE4U_XOLZ5TX9D21BAQ1,"‘Biggest, baddest’ – but is it the cleanest? World’s largest cruise ship sets sail",Karen McVeigh,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/26/icon-of-the-seas-largest-cruise-ship-human-lasagne-climate-fuel-lng-greenwashing,"The largest cruise ship in the world, which embarks on its first commercial voyage from Miami on Saturday, was launched amid a fanfare of superlatives. Longer than the Eiffel Tower is tall, the Icon of the Seas towers 20 decks above the waves, can accommodate more than 7,000 passengers and crew, and, at a quarter of a million gross tonnes, could swallow five Titanics for breakfast.
Coloured slides on its upper deck mark out “Thrill Island”, the largest waterpark at sea, and it boasts a 17-metre (55ft) indoor waterfall. The president of Royal Caribbean, Jason Liberty, told reporters it was the “biggest, baddest ship on the planet”, though it quickly became known on social media as “human lasagne”.
Yet the launch of the huge vessel in Florida, one of many the same size or bigger that could be built in the next few years, has refocused attention on the impact on the planet of cruise tourism.
Various studies by environmental organisations, comparing the carbon footprint of a week-long holiday on a European cruise with taking a flight and staying in a hotel, concluded that such cruises were up eight times as carbon intensive.
Royal Caribbean has made much of the fact that Icon of the Seas runs on liquified natural gas (LNG), describing it as the “cleanest-burning marine fuel”. However, Bryan Comer, director of the International Council on Clean Transportation’s marine programme, says using such fuel shows an industry “investing in false climate solutions”.
“They are doubling down by calling LNG a green fuel when the engine is emitting 70 to 80% more greenhouse gas emissions per trip than if it used regular marine fuel,” he said. “Icon has the largest LNG tanks ever installed in a ship. It is greenwashing.”
Using LNG rather than other marine fuels cuts carbon dioxide emissions by a quarter. But a cruise ship using LNG emits more greenhouse gas emissions overall, because of something called “methane slip”, Comer said. This is where some gas is not burned, leading to emissions of methane, a climate gas far more potent than carbon dioxide. Methane traps about 80 times more heat than CO2 during the 20 years after it is released into the atmosphere.
Ships should be using fuel cells and renewable hydrogen or methanol, which emit fewer greenhouse gases, he said.
When Icon was designed more than seven years ago, LNG was considered the “most promising fuel available at scale” said Nick Rose, a vice-president of Royal Caribbean.
“We consider it a transitional fuel that helps builds flexibility into our ship design and also helps us more easily adapt to different types of fuels as the market evolves and other scalable alternatives are introduced.”
Icon was built to accommodate fuel cells, which produce electricity without combustion, to be used to power the lifts, but the batteries have not been installed due to a problem with suppliers.
Rose said the company was committed to finding and implementing alternative energy sources, including fuel cells. “LNG is one part of our alternative fuel strategy, along with biofuels, methanol and other energy sources like shore power,” he said.
The vast ship has also been built to run on electricity supplied from shore when it is docked – a cleaner alternative to running highly polluting generators. Venice, Barcelona and Amsterdam are just three of the port cities to ban or curb cruise ships amid growing environmental and health concerns.
Marcie Keever, of Friends of the Earth US, said: “By building these megaships and using LNG, the cruise industry is moving in the wrong direction.
“Larger ships require more infrastructure at ports, destroying reefs and ecosystems in order to accommodate them.”"

The plane was operated by Sydney Seaplanes – the same company whose aircraft was involved in a 2017 crash that killed six people on the Hawkesbury River.
New South Wales police said on Thursday that one person onboard the light aircraft had suffered minor injuries and was treated at the scene by paramedics.

“Police have been told one of the pontoons had sustained damage and fell off, resulting in the crash,” a spokesperson for the force said.
Emergency services were called to Shark Island before midday.
The Sydney Seaplanes chief executive, Aaron Shaw, said the plane hit something during its takeoff run – possibly the wake from a boat – that damaged the aircraft.
“The pilot … aborted the takeoff. The plane didn’t get in the air,” he told Guardian Australia. “Fortunately, there weren’t any injuries. The pilot did everything as trained and they’re all fine.”
Shaw said the passengers were evacuated from the aircraft, which was then towed to Shark Island by a boat, rather than running aground “on its own steam”.
He said initial media reports that the plane had crashed into Sydney Harbour were incorrect.
The Australian Superyachts chief executive, Richard Morris, witnessed the aftermath of the incident.
“I’m on the harbour with my boat – I was going by when I heard [on the radio] that a seaplane was in trouble on Rose Bay,” Morris said.
“It didn’t crash into the harbour. Something happened and it came back into the water and then the lefthand float wasn’t staying upright.”

Morris said a “flotilla” of small boats helped take passengers off the seaplane “calmly and safely”.
He had earlier speculated the seaplane pilot may have deliberately run the aircraft on to Shark Island to prevent it from capsizing.
“If the seaplane sinks, it will turn upside down. Then it’s going to be much more hazardous to get your passengers off safely.”
The Vaucluse state MP, Kellie Sloane, said the situation “could have been so much worse”.
In 2017, a Sydney Seaplanes DHC-2 Beaver crashed into the Hawkesbury River, killing all six people onboard. It was en route to Rose Bay.
“Everyone is tremendously relieved that everyone is safe and no one was seriously harmed [on Thursday],” Sloane said.
“While the circumstances are very different to the 2017 crash, which took six lives, people will inevitably reflect on that.”
Sloane said the seaplane industry was an “iconic local service”.

The UN agency reported an enormous increase in numbers affected by the disease, which it said had accelerated in recent months. More than 30,000 cases were reported between January and October last year, compared with 941 cases in the whole of 2022 – a more than 30-fold rise.
Two in five cases were in children between one and four years old. One in five were in people aged 20 and over. The trend is expected to worsen if people do not vaccinate their children against the disease, the WHO said.
The warning came just days after the UK declared a national incident amid a surge in cases, and launched a campaign to encourage parents to get the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine for their children.
Dr Hans Kluge, the WHO regional director for Europe, said: “We have seen in the region not only a 30-fold increase in measles cases, but also nearly 21,000 hospitalisations and five measles-related deaths (reported in two countries).
“Vaccination is the only way to protect children from this potentially dangerous disease. Urgent vaccination efforts are needed to halt transmission and prevent further spread.”
Measles can lead to serious complications, lifelong disability and death. It can affect the lungs and brain and cause pneumonia, meningitis, blindness and seizures.
“It is vital that all countries are prepared to rapidly detect and timely respond to measles outbreaks, which could endanger progress towards measles elimination,” Kluge added.
The WHO said that falling vaccination rates were to blame, but also that more people were travelling abroad after Covid-19, increasing the risk of cross-border disease transmission and spread within communities.
The WHO Europe region comprises 53 countries, including Russia and some in central Asia, and 40 of those registered measles cases in 2023, it said. Russia and Kazakhstan fared the worst, with 10,000 cases each. In western Europe, Britain had the most cases, with 183.
Vaccination rates for the first dose of the MMR vaccine, which protects against measles, slipped from 96% in 2019 to 93% in 2022 across Europe. Uptake of the second dose fell from 92% to 91% over the same period.
About 1.8 million infants in the WHO’s Europe region were not vaccinated against measles between 2020 and 2022.
Vaccination rates against measles have been dropping around the world.
In 2022, 83% of children received a first measles vaccine during their first year of life, up from 81% coverage in 2021, but down from 86% before the pandemic, according to the WHO.
In 2021, there were an estimated 128,000 measles deaths worldwide, mostly among undervaccinated or unvaccinated children under five.
In the UK, the head of the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) warned last week that the UK was on a “trajectory for everything getting much worse” in the spread of measles.
Prof Dame Jenny Harries said “concerted action” was needed to tackle the virus, and suggested most people were not against their child receiving the MMR jab, but that they needed more information to feel confident about their decision.
She added: “What we are seeing at the moment with measles is that people have forgotten what a serious illness it is … We have had very high vaccination rates, especially for young families, but they are low at the moment.”
Figures released by the UKHSA showed there have been 216 confirmed measles cases and 103 probable cases in the West Midlands since 1 October.
Last week the UKHSA declared a national incident, which it said was an internal mechanism signalling the growing public health risk and enabling it to focus work in specific areas."

Karen Beale, 62, was employed as a cleaner at Envirograf, a factory that makes fire protection products in Dover, when she was filmed allegedly tampering with a jar of Nescafé, Canterbury crown court was told at the start of her trial.
The camera was set up after complaints about the coffee she was making, the jury heard. These included a strange taste, blue and white specks and a slurry.
In the footage, Beale could be seen wearing latex gloves to shake the coffee jar. After police were alerted, officers found two coffee jars containing sildenafil – an erectile dysfunction treatment sold under the brand name Viagra – and a medication for high cholesterol.
“Not what you would expect to be in Nescafé,” the prosecutor Matthew Hodgetts told the court.
The contaminated jars were found in the offices of two of Beale’s female colleagues: Katrina Gravenor, the firm’s accountant, and the company secretary, Jean Smith.
Beale, who had worked at the company for seven years, denies two charges of attempting to administer a poison or other destructive or noxious thing with intent to injure, aggrieve or annoy between July 2017 and September 2018. She told police she was the victim of malicious allegations and that she had been inspecting the coffee in the covert footage, the court heard.
It was also told that her husband and daughter had previously worked for the company.
Hodgetts said none of the chemicals found were toxic, but he alleged Beale still intended to harm her colleagues.
He told the jury: “She was intending that there would be some effect on those two women by putting it in their coffee. That’s why the prosecution say she was attempting to poison.”
He added: “She denies placing or attempting to place any substance into those coffee jars and is possibly going to suggest that these allegations against her are malicious in nature.”
The jury heard that Gravenor installed the secret camera after she became suspicious at the sight and taste of her coffee.
By the time the footage of Beale was captured in September 2018, it is alleged she had already tampered with the granules. “The defendant had already put something in and was checking it was still there,” Hodgetts said.
The court heard Gravenor, who had rheumatoid arthritis, wrote a letter to her GP complaining that something was making her ill and she had “narrowed it down” to the coffee.
Beale told the court she had been asked to keep an eye on the coffee jar by the firm’s general manager, Paul Ackerman-Mond. When challenged as to why she had not told police of his instructions when arrested, Beale told the court she feared reprisals from him on her return to work.
She denied having any grievances with Gravenor and Smith.
The trial continues."
PNUS2RKNCX_KQZZ5608UMTS8M1,US and UK strike Houthis in latest attempt to stop group targeting Red Sea ships,Dan Sabbagh,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/22/us-uk-continue-strike-houthi-yemen-military-biden-sunak,"The US and the UK have conducted a further round of strikes against the Houthis in an attempt to stop the rebel group targeting shipping in the southern Red Sea.
A joint statement from both countries said that they had conducted “an additional round of proportionate and necessary strikes” against eight Houthi targets, with the support of Australia, Bahrain, Canada and the Netherlands.
The number of targets is considerably lower than the 60 which were struck in the first air raids on Yemen made by the two countries 10 days earlier, while their effect and the number of casualties caused is uncertain.
The latest raid marks the eighth time the US has conducted strikes on Houthi targets this months and the second time that the UK has participated.
US officials briefed that the attacks by the two countries were taking place using fighter jets and ship launched cruise missiles, as initial footage and reports emerged on social media of explosions around the Houthi controlled capital Sana’a.
The bombing took place shortly before midnight Yemen time, according to the US Central Command, which covers the Middle East. Targets included missile launchers, air defence systems, radars, and weapons storage facilities below ground, it added.
Britain’s Ministry of Defence said four RAF Typhoon jets bombed targets at two military sites in the vicinity of the Sana’a airfield, which it said had been used to launch attacks on shipping in the Red Sea.
Grant Shapps, the UK defence secretary, said: “Along with our US partners, we have conducted a further round of strikes in self-defence. Aimed at degrading Houthi capabilities, this action will deal another blow to their limited stockpiles and ability to threaten global trade.”
There were no immediate reports of casualties, but the UK defence ministry said that a “very rigorous analysis” was applied in planning the strikes to minimise any risk of civilian casualties, and added that the bombing took place at night partly for that reason.
Because the strikes were said to have been undertaken in self-defence, following Houthi attacks on US and UK warships nearly a fortnight ago, the UK government has not sought the approval of parliament for the military action. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is understood to have not been consulted before Monday’s operation.
Mohammed Albukhaiti, a member of the Houthi’s ruling council, insisted the rebel group would continue to defy the west, although it was unclear how much damage to its military capability had been inflicted by the latest round of attacks.
“The American-British aggression will only increase the Yemeni people’s determination to carry out their moral and humanitarian responsibilities towards the oppressed in Gaza. The war today is between Yemen, which is struggling to stop the crimes of genocide, and the American-British coalition to support and protect its perpetrators,” he said.
Earlier in the evening, Joe Biden had spoken to Rishi Sunak about the Red Sea crisis, emphasising the need to continue “disrupting and degrading” Houthi military capabilities, an apparent reference to military action.
White House spokesperson John Kirby said the US president had discussed the situation with the British prime minister on Monday, following continued Houthi attacks on shipping transiting the Red Sea and nearby Gulf of Aden over the past week.

“They talked about what’s going on in the Red Sea and the need for a continued international multilateral approach to disrupting and degrading Houthi capabilities,” Kirby told reporters in Washington, in an apparent reference to military action.
The UK said Sunak and Biden had spoken in the evening UK time, where they also discussed the war in Gaza and funding for Ukraine. According to the British account, “the leaders condemned the surge in violent Houthi attacks”, and said they would continue to combat by putting diplomatic pressure on Iran to cease their support of the Yemeni group and “as needed, targeted military action to degrade Houthi capabilities”.
Britain joined with the US in launching 150 missiles at dozens of Houthi targets in Yemen 10 days ago, in an effort to halt a series of attacks by the rebel group, dating back to mid October, on shipping passing through the Red Sea region. More limited US bombing has followed in the days since.
But the US-led attacks have failed to eliminate the Houthi threat, and three attacks on merchant shipping were reported over three days last week, as the Houthis have signalled their determination to resist. The rebel group says it is targeting Israel and its western allies in support of Palestinians in Gaza in its targeting of the waterway.
Earlier, the Houthi movement claimed on Monday its forces had launched a missile attack on the American military cargo ship Ocean Jazz in the Gulf of Aden – but this was denied by the US.
“The Yemeni armed forces continue to retaliate to any American or British aggression against our country by targeting all sources of threat in the Red and Arab Sea,” Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Sarea said in a statement.
Shortly after, the US fifth fleet, stationed in the Middle East, said reports that Ocean Jazz had been successfully attacked were “patently false”.
Naval operational headquarters had “maintained constant communications” with Ocean Jazz “throughout its safe transit”, the fleet added in a statement released via X.
On Sunday two US Navy Seals who went missing, after falling into the sea, during an operation to seize Iranian weapons bound for Yemen’s Houthi rebels were declared dead after a 10-day search failed to locate them.
The missing service members had participated in an operation on 11 January, in which US forces boarded a dhow at night-time in rough seas off the coast of Somalia and seized missile components made in Iran, according to the Pentagon."
POJ5V40OMT_CVPEV6H6YVZL2IM,‘She’s bound and gagged for laughs’: is Poor Things a feminist masterpiece – or an offensive male sex fantasy?,_,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/jan/24/bound-gagged-poor-things-feminist-masterpiece-male-sex-fantasy-oscar-emma-stone-ruffalo,"Samira Ahmed, presenter of Front Row on BBC Radio 4 and trustee of the Centre for Women’s Justice
I wanted to enjoy Poor Things. Emma Stone is a terrific actor, Mark Ruffalo a genuine good guy activist playing a cad. Hilarious! But Bella, Stone’s character, has an infant’s brain – and the consent issue for a woman with learning difficulties is a blazing red flag. She embarks on a “voyage of self-discovery” which leads, quickly, to an insatiable desire for sex with as many men as possible, one of the oldest abuser myths. In the 1970s, pornographers jumped on the women’s liberation movement, claiming sexual liberation was essentially never saying no.
As a work of fiction, Poor Things can explore anything it likes, but it is not feminist. Just because a woman chooses to do something, does not make the act feminist. Feminists challenge the patriarchal system in which women’s choices exist. Prostitution has always been romanticised by men in fiction, but it remains overwhelmingly the male exploitation of poor female bodies. Men – always much older and sometimes with visual deformities (raising questions about the degrading treatment of people with disabilities) – use Bella’s body without any attempt at foreplay. She is bound and gagged in a scene played for laughs.
A man forces his young sons to watch him have sex with Bella. I know this scene was shortened, thanks to the BBFC’s suggestion that it contravened the 1978 Protection of Children Act, but lord, it still seems to go on for ever.
The acclaimed French film-maker Céline Sciamma, who made the genuinely erotic drama Portrait of a Lady on Fire, once told me about the battle for female actors, writers and directors to be treated with respect by European cinema’s enduringly sexist male establishment. The feting of Poor Things – a heterosexual middle-aged man’s fantasy about nymphomania, with the flimsiest covering of “satire” and a tagged-on message about female genital mutilation being “bad” – merely confirms that feminism still has a long way to go.
Charlotte Higgins, Guardian chief culture writer
To ask the question “Is Poor Things a feminist movie?” strikes me as a category error. No, I do not think that I will be basing my feminist manifesto on this film any time soon. I might as well think of Medea, the magnificent character of Greek myth who kills her own children, as charting a practical path to power. Poor Things – an adaptation of the late Alasdair Gray’s 1992 novel, itself a version of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein – is a fable.
It is not a handbook advocating the transplanting of a newborn’s brain into the head of a recently deceased adult woman, nor is it promoting (as some have suggested) paedophilia. Its relationship with realism is pretty heavily signalled from the off – as in, a distant one. You have never seen a person like Bella Baxter. You have also never seen a living creature composed of half a goose and half a dog.
Like the story of Medea, though, it brings something rich that is nothing to do with its surface mechanics. In Bella, the film offers a vision of a sexually free woman who fearlessly, without guilt, without negative consequences, quenches her appetites, utterly unconscious of Judaeo-Christian or patriarchal shame. Not a real-world picture, but a thrilling one, albeit one that might be found threatening in some quarters.
The phrase “male gaze” has been attached to the film, owing to the triumvirate of Gray, screenwriter Tony McNamara and director Yorgos Lanthimos. However, unless informed to the contrary, I regard Stone as an artist and a person in her own right, who has chosen to embody Bella in delicious ways of her own devising. That character, by the way, is not just a bodily person but a thinking one (a particularly enjoyable scene involves her, a book, and an older woman played by screen legend Hanna Schygulla). Is Poor Things feminist? The story is too wild and capricious to be captured by such a word, and is all the more magnificent for it.
David Thomson, film critic
There’s a point in Poor Things where Bella wonders why people don’t do this thing all the time – she means sexual action, the hectic activity that has overtaken this bride of Frankenstein. I was thinking the same way, though I was as thrilled by the passion of the film-making and the glee it was producing in the audience. I am thinking of how the movie so conflates production design with the ways lenses can enlarge and compress space. I hadn’t felt such a compulsion since Citizen Kane, in which the black-and-white imagery pulsated with megalomania and its shame. Poor Things was breathing and that’s how one feels Bella’s arousal and her coming into life.
The discovery of sex and the discovery of film. Some of us find it hard to escape the gene-splicing in that marriage. I was reminded of Barbarella, another sci-fi comic book rite in which the chronic voyeur Roger Vadim whispered to us: “Can you imagine having Jane Fonda?” Even in 1968, that modestly funny film was smarmy with male-gaze superiority. And I wondered, as I was surfing on Poor Things, whether there would be fresh objections to a display put on by and for men. But I set that aside because of the exuberant commitment Stone brings, not just on screen but in her talking about the picture.
This is a film about female pleasure in which the men are like discarded condoms, relics of archaic transactions, more intent on power than pleasure. That’s what seems so modern in Poor Things. It is interested in nothing so much as animal energy and its release. It says: “Can’t you see, we the people may have to become no more or less than animated sensation machines? Isn’t that where we have been headed all along? Why do anything else?”
Cinema has bred in us the intense narrowness of special effects. In that energy we may shrug off so many isms – even feminism and humanism itself. Why are these things poor? I think it’s because we begin to see that we are no more than on or off. This may be a lesser destiny than being Anna Karenina but Bella Baxter wants to be on, and we understand how film is getting her there. This is a movie for a world getting ready to end. Our last isms will be paroxysms.
Zoe Williams, Guardian columnist
Poor Things asks you to imagine a female sexuality that hasn’t been painstakingly formed by society and its arsenal of explicit rules, unspoken expectation, overt violence and the covert control of shame. And now imagine male sexuality with those levers taken away. Stand well back and see if they can get along.
I want to say that, even if I’d hated the politics, I still would have loved the experimental conviction of Stone’s performance, the virtuoso disintegration of Ruffalo, the pitch-perfect everyman Ramy Youssef – and who doesn’t love Willem Dafoe when he’s missing digits (English Patient klaxon!). But it’s impossible to disaggregate, just as it wouldn’t be possible to separate the meaning from the aesthetic, or its humour from its heart.
From the minute Stone discovers masturbation at the dinner table, then recommends it to a cranky maid, her wild and enchanting performance is pure Jungian libido (desire, will, interest, passion) expressed through libido the way Cosmopolitan uses it (having sex, constantly). Schematically, Willem Dafoe’s transplant surgeon is Frankenstein with a more lurid backstory. Mutilated himself, he thinks he can play God (it perhaps didn’t help that Bella calls him God), and his creation destroys him, except does it? Bella is more like a fire than a monster, though – destructive, heedless, purifying, warming, incredibly fun to watch, particularly in a mad tango with Ruffalo’s Duncan Wedderburn. Her spell in a brothel is the most honest pass at the question, “What does sex work look like stripped of internalised stigma?” I’ve seen in ages.
The film has a pretty confronting opening: the visionary professor and his biddable assistant discuss Bella as a sexual entity, a proposition essentially, while she’s non-verbal. There will be people who won’t walk through that as allegory, will see it as straight wish-fulfilment of a toxic patriarchy (adult body, tabla rasa brain, the perfect cocktail of woman) and that’s a pretty high-stakes ambiguity.
If it were a mainstream film, thinking, “Will people take this as a fable about pleasure and constraint, or as a, psychically speaking, paedophilic fantasy?”, I would run a mile. I would cut my losses and remake National Velvet. Maybe I’m taking it too seriously, but the courage of the film, as it leapt from one gender-flashpoint tightrope to another, struck me as a cultural renewal.
Viv Groskop, writer
Poor Things is an amazing piece of film-making and a visual extravaganza. Stone’s performance is a tour de force, utterly devoid of vanity and ego, and worthy of all the awards. But feminism this ain’t.
In the opening moments, we learn that Bella has been created by a mad scientist. Having acquired the corpse of a pregnant woman who has thrown herself off a bridge, Godwin Baxter, played by Dafoe, performs a caesarean and transplants the brain of the baby into the adult female. The mother “dies” and is reborn with her own baby’s brain inside her head. Godwin adopts this wobbly toddler-woman and raises her as his daughter. So far, so bonkers.
Things take a turn when baby Bella requests a cucumber at the dining table. (I know.) This kid loves her body! She has no sense of limitations or propriety! She’s wild and free! Bella learns to enjoy her body. She learns to read. And then she learns to appreciate the joys of employment in a Parisian brothel where she “asserts herself” by bravely informing the punters that they stink. Don’t worry, though, she still loves having sex with them! By this point, I had lost the will to live.
The grotesque, surreal comedy of this film is undeniable. But is it really “funny” when Bella is abducted from what is effectively her nursery by a creep who takes her to Lisbon for custard tarts and delightedly consensual “furious jumping” (as Bella calls sex)? Two seconds ago, she was supposedly a child who could barely talk or walk. We do not know the gender of the implanted infant brain. We are never told exactly what happened to her womb. Can Bella menstruate or get pregnant? Who cares? In a situation where transplants, hybrid animals and bubbles of gastric juice are portrayed in meticulous and fantastical detail, the inconveniences of the real-life body of a sexually active child-woman are too boring to explain.
The film’s message is clearly one of personal discovery and freedom from shame. Yay to that. But how can it be that, in 2024, we are supposed to believe that it’s shocking and surprising for a woman to enjoy sex? And how liberating can it be to have the brain of your own baby implanted into you and then go and work in a brothel? I despair.

I revelled in Poor Things, STD-test punchlines and all. This film isn’t perfect, but is a highly entertaining, dark-yet-silly take on how the patriarchy hurts and constrains both sexes. Bella made me recall the intensity with which I also sought out orgasms – just mine, rarely a partner’s – as a teenager. It all felt so new! It was! I’ve seen criticism of Poor Things boiling womanhood down to a series of frantic cowgirl sex scenes. But sexuality is a major part of what makes us develop into adults, and it’s not exactly been a social norm for women to explore sex (whether penetrative or not) for pleasure alone.
Stone is a conventionally attractive, youthful white woman, her (sometimes nude) body lapped up by the lens. Poor Things won’t beat the male-gaze allegations on that account. But is that enough to dismiss the story overall? This film can’t be everything for everyone, nor can it sum up every part of what it means to grow into a woman. Lanthimos made a choice to do the sex thing, and that’s his right as director – and Stone’s as a producer.
Although it’s uncomfortable to discuss, pleasure from our genitals is built into our bodies and sometimes explored safely and privately before puberty, without relating to intercourse or abuse. That Bella started masturbating before her age matched her body is transgressive, sure, but not a reason to discount an idea that the film presents. You’re meant to grimace at how quickly men who encounter her want to possess her and possibly take advantage of her naivety. Again, this is about the patriarchy.
Even so, the notion of sex work out of desperation as an empowering path – where the body is its own means of production, as Bella says – is a stretch (and would need the input of sex workers in the writer’s room to be truly rounded out). I tensed in my seat waiting for a scene of sexual violence, the likes of which about one in three adult women experience. Maybe Bella’s one of the lucky 70%.
Ione Gamble, writer
For me, to declare Poor Things feminist would not only be reductive to feminism but also to the film. Yes, Bella has loads of sex and – freed by her baby brain of the patriarchal trappings that plague so many of us – manages to not ascribe ideas of moral good or bad to “furious jumping”. Instead, she focuses only on her pleasure. While shagging her way round Europe, she escapes men who wish to control her – another win for the “Poor Things is feminist” school of thought.
But for everyone who felt empowered watching her story play out on screen, another five felt cheated out of a true depiction of the female experience. For some, the sheer amount of on-screen sex veered into a male fantasy of womanhood, directed and written by a man, and epitomising the male gaze.
Ultimately, Bella is not just a woman moving through the world, but a woman born into financial privilege. She can also arguably be read as disabled and/or neurodivergent – with much of the internet discourse swirling around the film debating if Poor Things is ableist. Divorcing her from these characteristics to push through a feminist or antifeminist argument is to not see the film – or her character – as a whole.
To paraphrase Rachel Sennott’s character in Shiva Baby, feminism is a lens to see the world through. As is class analysis, or discussion around the depiction of disability in Poor Things. The way she learns to move through the world with such freedom is inspiring, but would she be allowed the same freedoms if she wasn’t wealthy and running in upper-class circles? What would it look like to accept some of Bella’s more unconventional behaviours in all people, or does she simply represent the acceptable face of difference?
All of these debates and lenses certainly fall under the umbrella of social politics, but these are questions I was left with after watching the film, not answers that I found tied in neat little bows. Poor Things is not a feminist film – but feminism itself is not an adjective we can neatly assign to media that mirrors our moral values. I would rather watch a messy, complicated narrative that makes us think about our own world, than be spoon-fed a perfectly formed feminist fable.
Bidisha Mamata, broadcaster and presenter
Bloated wank fantasy or simple-hearted bildungsroman? Poor Things is both. The plot is this: Frankenstein creates a manic pixie baby dream girl who’s also a socialist PhD hooker who’s also a thoroughly modern Millie and striking fashion plate who makes no emotional demands and is also a really intelligent nymphomaniac without a jealous bone in her body. With her fresh mind, literal interpretation of events and gorgeous looks, she’s just so bewitchingly bold and artlessly instinctual and unspoilt that she drives men mad with lust and love and longing. But those men just want to control her.
Bella’s “adventures” are 98% penetrative heterosexual sex and 2% conversation. I was particularly grateful for her foray into brothel life, because men who write stories can’t imagine any job for women except prostitution, and then they turn themselves inside out spaffing off about how it’s all just so philosophically interesting, and add insult to injury by putting these masturbatory, self-justifying thoughts into the mouths of fictional women. But what would I know? Just like Bella at the start of the film, I’m just a braindead fuckwit, and I don’t have Bella’s unique combination of intense carnality and virginal beauty to make up for it.
Not that it doesn’t look great, like Willy Wonka directing a Campari ad. Know what we also see a lot of? Stone’s nipples, pubic hair, supine body and unaware, sleeping face. Lanthimos has depressing form in this regard – remember the long, leering, breasty shot of a teenage girl swimming backstroke in The Lobster, and the full-body underwear shot of a teenage girl displaying herself to the boy she wants to impress in The Killing of a Sacred Deer. His camera just eats up all that nubile female flesh.
Poor Things also had a screenplay by McNamara, photography by Robbie Ryan, is based on the novel by Gray, and is executive produced by Daniel Battsek and Ollie Madden. So let me say to all these guys: thank you for explaining.
Jason Okundaye, writer
I think the film is quite successful in depicting the different methods men use to attempt to constrain and control women. The central men in Poor Things are very different from each other, yet their attempted control of Bella unites them – whether it’s the father-like Godwin who attempts to imprison Bella to keep her “safe” from the outside world, or the perverse, misogynistic Duncan who throws Bella’s books into the ocean as she gains intellectual consciousness, wishing her to be only his compliant, docile sex doll. Her determination to pursue her desires – masturbate, reject polite society, read – overwhelms and destroys any attempts to restrict her.
That said, the film is not faultless. While Lisbon is depicted for its beauty, Alexandria is presented as a cesspit of poverty, a conduit through which Bella can muse on the “poor things” of Egypt and make vain attempts to improve their lives. Those poor people she witnesses are also described as people who would rape and murder those on the cruise ship if they had the chance, a message surely intended to muse on the cruel opportunism of humanity but instead presenting these people as barbarians.
Equally, while Bella’s resistance to patriarchy and those who attempt to confine her is ultimately triumphant, the depiction of sex work is altogether too casual. I’ve read some comments that claim the male gaze has been subverted in Poor Things as full frontal nudity shots of men are also shown, but the scenes of Bella having sex with a series of disgusting clients seem to serve little purpose beyond gratifying the curiosity of what such encounters may look like.
Certainly, Bella finds liberation through her sexuality: she and her fellow prostitutes refer to sex work as turning their own bodies into a means of production – but prostitution, in the circumstances Bella finds herself in, is surely more about survival and labour than empowerment.
Imogen Tilden, Guardian writer
No need to reference its male author, director and predominantly male production team, this is a film in which the heroine is literally created – stitched together and reanimated – by a man. And yes, Bella’s mature body and child mind is the very template of male fantasy, likewise her straightforward delight in and appetite for sex.
But if the fish-eye lens, the lurch from black and white to oversaturated colour, and the sheer artificiality of every set, costume and prop don’t signal that this is a movie to take with a pinch of salt, then surely the bonkers science does? I loved Lanthimos’s film and found it subversive and exhilarating.
For Bella, masturbation does come not freighted with the guilt and self-disgust embedded in a culture that teaches girls that their bodies or sexual pleasure are shameful. Bella enjoys sex. She is confident and comfortable asking for it and articulating what she needs. The lawyer played by Ruffalo seeks to exploit her but ends up enervated and emasculated. He can neither control nor satisfy her, no more than Godwin was able to contain her.
The happy hooker trope? Bella is not presented as unhappy and given that, for her, sex is a purely physical act, why not accommodate her own reasoning? For, in this fantasy version of a brothel in Toulouse-Lautrec-meets-Moulin Rouge-meets-Tank Girl Paris, it is her simplest way to earn money and thus independence. Why can’t she use her body as she wishes? This is a woman of instinct, but also intellect. Is she exploiting the men? Perhaps … her clients all appear fools or dolts. The most tender moment in this section of the film features her in bed with fellow sex worker, Toinette.
As Bella grows into mental maturity, it is her mind, not her body, she wants to use. The story ends with our heroine not happily married, nor happily jumping, but fully clothed and heading for medical school, the abusive bullying husband of her former life punished with a goat’s brain. As feminist fantasies go, that seems a good one to me.

Poor Things gave me a sense of deja vu: didn’t this film already bludgeon me with its pseudo-feminist credentials over the summer? No, I was just thinking of Greta Gerwig’s Barbie, which featured a similar plot, an overwhelming reliance on fish-out-of-water humour, and a similar propensity for didactic, simplistic morality. In both films, a woman created by men goes on a quest for self-determination and meaning, realises she hates the horrors of the “real” world, and decides to settle for a sense of slightly enlightened equilibrium back in her cloistered old world. In both films, I found it astounding that the surface-level allusions to feminist ideals were greeted with such outsized praise.Poor Things reminded me of the Tumblr-level gender politics of my high school years, which dictated that a woman’s power is inherently linked to her anatomy and fucking as much as you can is a source of uncomplicated liberation. There’s nothing particularly wrong with those ideas, but Poor Things makes no effort at all to complicate or question them: “furious jumping” becomes Bella’s raison d’etre and, for a period, her vocation. But it’s only ever a backdrop to her studies of philosophy and socialism, rather than something that interacts with them directly.
Some of my favourite films are women’s stories by men. But Poor Things struck me as self-congratulatory and fake deep, obsessed with its own radical approach to a female coming-of-age story. It feels like Barbie for people who thought they were a little too smart for Barbie, but still want their discussions of gender politics served up to them in neat little inspirational speeches. At least Barbie could, theoretically, provide a child with some basic level of feminist literacy. Poor Things, I fear, only serves to reaffirm the values of smug adults.

Oh come on guys, lighten up. It would be a bit bleak to dismiss the notion of a woman enjoying sex as an unrealistic male fantasy. Not just bleak, but also unfair to young women, who surely should be going into the experience believing that sex is something they should expect to enjoy. A healthy conversation about consent starts from a baseline that if anyone isn’t having fun, that is a problem.The clothes in Poor Things say a lot about where the film is coming from. In the brothel scenes, Bella and the other girls wear underwear in pale blue, lemon yellow, rose pink. No black stockings, no red lace – no male-gaze filter. It speaks to the film’s joyous, free, girl-centred attitude to sex. When Bella discovers sex she doesn’t transform into a pouting coquette. Instead, she carries on being her gawky, hilarious, mischievous self, just with lots of enthusiastic shagging. Marvellous.
There is a lot of naked Stone in the film, but there are also excellent clothes – especially the huge leg o’mutton sleeves. Holly Waddington, the costume designer, said the sleeves were supposed to be “very empowering. Whenever sleeves have been big for women – the Elizabethan period, the 1940s, the 1980s – women have generally been in a good place.”
The rude bits are unsettling at times, for sure. There are moments when the emphasis on Bella’s childish inexperience feels like an uneasy bedfellow, for want of a better metaphor, with her sexual appetite. Those pastel colours are the colours of Alice in Wonderland. Bella’s wide-eyed forthright manner is very Alice, at times, in fact – and Alice is a child, after all. So, that’s a bit odd. But what makes it work is that Bella’s enthusiasm is for her own physical pleasure.
Leslie Felperin, film critic
This film is many things to many people. For some, it’s a female-centric bildungsroman, with black comedy notes, and lashings of tasteful but very hot arthouse sex. It sometimes seems to me that challenging stories about women, especially ones as opaque, teasing and gloriously sex-positive as Poor Things, get labelled feminist as a get-out-of-accusations-of-sexism free card. I’m not sure that’s the most useful way to see the film, given Bella’s story is not so much about a young woman doing combat with patriarchy so much as just blithely ignoring it from the start as she plunges off on adventures.
Because her mental development is out of sync with her physical presentation, Bella is unburdened by any of the inhibitions women of her time would usually be tethered by, limiting their interests and ambitions. Instead, Bella is as eager to try pasteis de nata and oysters, punching annoying babies, sex work and medical training all in roughly equal measure.
An old-school feminist might take issue with the fact that novelist Gray, screenwriter McNamara and director Lanthimos have created a character who is more a living sex doll than matryoshka, albeit one who is hyper-articulate in the film’s later stages and likes to read philosophy books. Yet, thanks perhaps above all to Stone’s craftsmanship, Bella is achingly brought to life. She takes the raw materials handed to her by the book, the script, Lanthimos’s direction, the wondrous taffeta-and-shot silk costumes and the support of her fellow actors, and – via the uncanny alchemy of performance – creates a whole new creature.
Bella’s point of view is the lodestar of the film. That singularity of focus, the way this whole marvellous world is refracted through one singular woman’s consciousness, is what makes this film extraordinary and near immaculate.
Ann Lee, Guardian writer
There’s much to enjoy in this exuberant and surreal take on Frankenstein. Stone’s ferocious performance for starters, which has deservedly earned her an Oscar nomination. Then there’s the off-kilter visuals, the fantastically gothic depiction of a steampunk Victorian England, and the exquisite costumes.
I revelled in all of these until the sequence where Bella becomes a sex worker in Paris after being ditched, penniless and alone, by Ruffalo as her controlling suitor. In her mind – the mind of a child – it’s a logical conclusion to her financial woes. She likes sex so obviously this is the perfect job for her. Obviously, perhaps, if you’re a man – as the director, adaptor and writer are.
As Bella takes to her new profession with gusto, even jauntily helping a father school his young sons on how to pleasure a woman, I felt a growing unease that what I was actually watching was a male fantasy of what a woman’s journey of self-discovery would be. There are so many other ways to be a sexually liberated woman in the world that don’t involve humiliation, degradation or the threat of violence. Not that Bella would know. Her time at the brothel is presented as an interesting sexual experiment involving no repercussions whatsoever. I doubt a female film-maker would have presented it in such an upbeat manner.
Crucially, in the original novel, Bella denounces everything that happens, claiming it was all the “morbid” imaginings of her “poor fool” of a husband, whose account we have initially been following. So yes, it makes sense that it comes across as a male fantasy as that’s what the author was intending, as part of his commentary on how these are projected on to women, but we don’t get to see that condemnation from Bella on screen. If you want to see a real exploration of unapologetic female sexuality, you’re better off watching The Favourite."
POK0N7FJRX_6GXO9FM592RZD11,Tuvalu goes to the polls in election watched by China and Taiwan,_,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/26/tuvalu-goes-to-the-polls-in-election-watched-by-china-and-taiwan,"Voting has started in the tiny Pacific island nation of Tuvalu, in a national election that could reverberate from China to Australia, amid a tussle for influence in the region.
With just over 11,500 people spread across nine islands, Tuvalu is one of the smallest nations in the world, but the election for the 16-seat parliament was being closely watched. After the vote count, parliamentary negotiations will form a new government and elect the prime minister. Polls opened at 8am and were to close at 4pm.
Prime minister Kausea Natano is running again, but even reelection to parliament won’t guarantee him the top post.
Finance minister Seve Paeniu is challenging him, and opposition leader Enele Sopoaga is hoping to again be prime minister, after losing out to Natano after the 2019 election.
After votes are counted, government boats collect the new lawmakers from islands and bring them to the capital Funafuti, a journey that can take up to 27 hours. The prime minister is chosen by the newly elected lawmakers.
The elections come as China, the United States and others wrangle for influence in the strategically crucial region. Washington recently pledged to connect the country’s remote population by undersea cable to global telecommunications for the first time.
Tuvalu, a British colony until 1978, is one of only 12 countries that have official diplomatic relations with Taiwan, the self-governing democratic island that China claims as its own territory.
But China has been pushing those Taiwan allies to switch their alliance. Natano has so far rebuffed Beijing, but that could change after this election. Nauru, another small Pacific nation, recently switched its support from Taiwan to China.
Paeniu has said he wants to review Tuvalu’s relationships with both Taiwan and China.
Taiwan on Thursday said China was trying to influence the Tuvalu election and “seize our diplomatic allies”. China’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Global warming is another big issue, as Tuvalu’s low-lying atolls routinely flood.
A proposed security treaty between Tuvalu and Australia could also hang in the balance. The treaty commits Australia to help Tuvalu in response to major natural disasters, health pandemics and military aggression. The treaty also gives Australia veto power over any security or defense-related agreement Tuvalu wants to make with any other country, including China.
Debate on the treaty has been divisive and it has yet to be ratified. Sopoaga has said he would reject it."
PPLQ104M6B_RR9OVJK2PXSCBK8,Sexy Beast review – there is just no good reason for this movie prequel to exist,Leila Latif,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/jan/25/sexy-beast-review-there-is-just-no-good-reason-for-this-movie-prequel-to-exist,"One of the pithiest pieces of dialogue of Steven Spielberg’s entire oeuvre is Jeff Goldblum’s remark in Jurassic Park that the dinosaur-resurrecting scientists “were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn’t stop to think if they should”. This sentiment also applies to Paramount+’s Sexy Beast – a late-in-life prequel to the 2000 movie. It is not the how, but the why that should have been given consideration.
The series is set eight years before Jonathan Glazer’s Ray Winstone-starring thriller – a beloved film and university hall poster for many a geriatric millennial. It’s a film that holds up remarkably well, and is a far more accomplished piece of cinema than the faint memory of Winstone sunbathing in a pair of orange budgie smugglers would suggest. The film sees his anti-hero, Gal, happily retired in the Costa del Sol with his beloved wife Deedee, only to be roped in for one last job by his volatile former partner Don, played with jittery, simmering menace by Ben Kingsley.
For the television follow-up, we journey back to 1992 to see how Gal (now James McArdle) ended up at that point. But it begins with a familiar sight – McArdle getting a tan in a pair of tiny tangerine shorts atop a London tower block. We follow him and his pal Don (Emun Elliott) as low-level thieves who ascend the ranks, via the unscrupulous mob boss Teddy (here True Blood’s Stephen Moyer, in the film Ian McShane). He hires them for a series of increasingly elaborate heists to retrieve everything from gold coins to pocket-sized antiquities.
As is the way with prequels, much of how this turns out is a fait accompli. We know who will survive the eight episodes, we know that despite the young Gal’s engagement to the nice but dim Marjorie, him and young Deedee (Sarah Greene) are fated to be together.
What the show does remember is that Deedee is both the heart and the wisest character of Sexy Beast. The love story between her and Gal is at the core of the film (in which she is played by Amanda Redman), with Winstone sincerely uttering lines such as: “I love you like a rose loves rain water.” In the prequel, Deedee is a young porn star, starting to get more agency within her work, but unable to resist the charms of the young thief. Hers is far and away the most intriguing plot line, and Greene’s performance the most striking. Hers is the only character who could slip seamlessly into Glazer’s previous vision, which was far more surreal and tender than this bare-bones plot. Here, stereotypical London gangster shenanigans come to the screen with little weight behind anyone’s motives, and mob bosses such as Teddy simply growl that in these troubled times of war, “our country needs our lunatics”.
Like the crimes, the dynamics of the relationship between Gal and Don aren’t nearly as complex as that brought to the screen by Winstone and Kingsley. There’s a dusty void of chemistry between the two actors, and their characters’ tenuous allegiance bends and then breaks when small fish Gal and Don start work for the maniacal, violent criminal overlord Teddy, who dangles rewards for jobs well done in front of them, expecting the kind of loyalty he’d get from labrador puppies.
Violence in this world also often comes with a hint of sexual perversion. Teddy is not content to knock a foe’s teeth out and sexually violate him, but adds “What keeps me hard is the thought of keeping you alive as I squeeze you into a coffin with your dear old daddy” to further establish that Gal, who loves looking into Deedee’s “dancing brown eyes”, is not like these other angry weirdos.
While the heists, pummelling and kinky threats are not necessarily unenjoyable, the whole series – Deedee and Gal’s love story aside – is pretty one-note, with Gal reduced to “affable blond fella” and the majority of the cast doing a version of panto villain. The scenery-chewing evilness works best in the casting against type of Tamsin Greig, who plays Don’s even more despicable older sister, Cecilia, all botched Princess Diana hair do, incestual undertones and chain-smoking malice.
While Greig seems to be having a whale of a time playing a remorseless monster, everyone else’s enthusiasm feels as though it is waning by the penultimate episode – which is largely concerned with the stag do before Gal and Marjorie’s ill-fated wedding. There are a few more beatings to be delivered and bits and bobs to steal, but it’s unclear what any of this adds for fans of the film, or the uninitiated. Particularly given that the latter could, in the same amount of time, watch Glazer’s 85-minute masterpiece, follow it up with the rest of his filmography and still have a couple of hours to spare.

The show zips along perfectly pleasantly, and no one involved is embarrassing themselves – or jeopardising Glazer’s present Oscar campaign for The Zone of Interest. But following the arguably more misogynistic TV adaptation of Fatal Attraction, a dour True Lies and now this paint-by-numbers London underworld fare, those creating small-screen versions of fondly remembered films need to stop to think what purpose these projects serve. Just because you can doesn’t mean you should.

PTM3ZR7Q3C_YY9TX87TBLJ2440,Losing my beloved cat was nothing like having a TV stolen – so why does UK law treat them the same?,Toni Clarke,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/22/pet-stolen-uk-law-change-theft,"It might be tempting to ask whether spending parliamentary time on a bill that tackles pet theft is a little indulgent. Do we really need such legislation, with all that’s going on at the moment? But ask any victim of this pernicious crime and they will leave you in no doubt that there is nothing trivial about losing a beloved pet to theft.
Sitting in the public gallery for the second reading of Conservative MP Anna Firth’s pet abduction bill, which would apply in England and Northern Ireland, I was struck by how convivial and almost jocular the atmosphere was on the floor of the house. Here was a bill that united parties of all colours, as hon members spoke movingly of their unquestionable love and devotion to their pets, expressed concern that a well-meaning “Granny Miaow” would not be prosecuted simply for rescuing stray cats from the streets, and joked that their dogs had been robbed of a prize at the Westminster dog show.
But behind the banter lay a serious issue – one I know about first-hand: 13 June 2013 was the day I last saw my strikingly handsome Siamese cat, Clooney, undisputed Lord of his Kingdom and the bossiest keeper of my heart. Clooney had purred his way into filling a vacancy – I was a recent empty-nester – and became an unapologetically indulged family member. This demanding but irresistible cat-brat needed me and, goodness, how I needed him at this new phase of my life. But on that summer’s day, a courier van pulled into my driveway and I never saw him again.
It is difficult to describe the torturous place my mind inhabited over the following days, nights, weeks and months, and the physical consequences for my health. My mind was plagued by images of starvation, injury or deliberate cruelty – thieves, after all, don’t steal with compassion or care. The object of their theft is just that – an object to them.
And herein lies the most absurd parallel between law-makers and law-breakers: the law currently considers our beloved pets to be mere objects. Under the Theft Act 1968, pets are afforded no greater protection than personal possessions. The penalty for stealing a pet – and the police resources allocated to their recovery – is calculated solely on their monetary value.
It is precisely in recognition of our pets’ sentience and capacity to suffer when stolen that the government’s pet theft taskforce recommended a specific offence of pet abduction rather than theft. In its previous incarnation, within the shelved kept animals bill, this was solely about dogs. But credit to Firth who, having seen the data provided by my organisation, Pet Theft Awareness (we reported a 40% increase in police-recorded cat theft in 2021), decided that cats deserved inclusion as well. Firth’s bill describes two distinct offences: the taking and detaining of a dog from the lawful control of any person; for cats, this is restricted to just taking, thereby preventing Granny Miaow from being fined or sent down for up to five years.
But does the bill go far enough for those of us who have loved and lost, and campaigned for changes to the law for a decade or more? Certainly, I’d have favoured seeing Granny Miaow reminded that she has an obligation to make reasonable efforts to locate the owner of any cat she rescues, which will be made easier with microchipping of cats (compulsory from 10 June this year for cats over 20 weeks old). And it is important that we recognise that not all roaming cats are strays in need of a home – they can be displaced family felines simply requiring kindness and, crucially, scanning.
As the bill moves on to the committee stage, I can’t help wondering what would have happened had it been in place back in 2018, when I discovered Clooney had been scanned and his microchip details accessed by two identifiable veterinary surgeries. Scandalously, both failed to contact me. If the bill had been around, perhaps the police would have had more resources to investigate – and I might now have Clooney back in my arms.

PX8VCLBD32_DBCEVJKK9NGWKO9,"BBC Radio 4’s News Quiz is ‘completely biased’, minister claims",Ben Quinn,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/jan/23/bbc-radio-4s-news-quiz-is-completely-biased-minister-claims,"A minister has lashed out at a satirical Radio 4 show as being “completely biased” in the latest allegation from the Conservatives about BBC impartiality.
Huw Merriman, a transport minister, also referenced the BBC’s coverage of universal credit when challenged to give examples of supposed bias a day after a row was sparked by remarks by the culture secretary.
Downing Street was forced on Monday to deny the government was pursuing an agenda against the BBC after Lucy Frazer accused the corporation of bias and argued that it needed to adapt or risk losing the trust of audiences.
Frazer had struggled during an interview on Sky News to give examples of bias, citing repeatedly the BBC’s reporting of an attack on a hospital in Gaza.
But when challenged on Tuesday morning to come up with further examples, Merriman had said an episode of The News Quiz last Friday had struck him as “completely biased”.
“For 10 minutes all I heard was – and it wasn’t satirical – it was just diatribe against Conservatives. Not the government. And I did listen to that and think ‘for goodness sake’ where is the balance in that?” he told Sky News.
When reminded by Sky’s Kay Burley that it was a satirical show, Merriman said it did not strike him as particularly satirical and challenged any viewer to listen to it and make up their own mind.
However, he went on to attack the BBC’s coverage of universal credit, on which he had worked when attached to the Department for Work and Pensions.
Merriman singled out and named a journalist who the minister “always felt gave one side of the story and not the other side, the government’s side”.
Ofcom, the media watchdog, is to be given more powers to investigate the BBC, while the organisation’s board could get responsibility over its complaints process, under proposals in a midterm review of its governance and regulations.
Frazer told Times Radio on Monday: “This isn’t about the government. This is about impartiality and not just about politics. Audiences are feeling like impartiality and the BBC is on a downward trajectory.”
The shadow culture secretary, Thangam Debbonaire, criticised Frazer’s remarks, posting on X: “Just the latest in a long line of secretaries of state for culture wars. Attacking and undermining one of our greatest institutions at every chance they get.”
A BBC spokesperson said: “We’re confident our audiences know the difference between a longstanding and popular satirical comedy show and our news reporting.”
The National Union of Journalists accused Merriman of “scraping the barrel” and said it was “shameful” to single out individual journalists for criticism.
“Not content with demonstrating his lack of humour when it comes to topical satire shows, Huw Merriman felt the need to impugn the work of an individual journalist for the apparent crime of not lapping up his words of wisdom when he was batting for universal credit in a past ministerial gig,” said Michelle Stanistreet, the NUJ’s general secretary.
Merriman appears to have confused the BBC journalist he was seeking to criticise with Neil Buchanan, the host of children’s show Art Attack.
“It’s a shame he failed to get the journalist’s name right, but it’s even more shameful that a government minister feels it’s acceptable to slag off individual reporters in this way.”"
Q2OLAD2YLR_RR59VDP0Z3SPVOF,Top hedge funds make record $67bn in profits for 2023,Mark Sweney,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/22/top-hedge-funds-make-record-67bn-in-profits-for-2023,"Billionaire hedge fund managers Chris Hohn and Ken Griffin led the industry to record profits last year as bets on the stock market paid off handsomely for clients.
The top 20 hedge fund managers made $67bn (£53bn) in profits for investors in 2023, as the industry made combined profits of $218bn, topping the previous record of $65bn set in 2021.
TCI Fund Management, which is run by British billionaire Hohn, who paid himself $346m last year, topped the list making $12.9bn for clients.
Citadel, founded by the US billionaire Ken Griffin, who has been involved in a bid for the Telegraph newspaper with the co-owner of GB News, ranked second, making $8.1bn.
The list, compiled by the research company LCH since 2012, examines which money managers in the $4tn hedge fund industry are the most successful based on overall profits in absolute dollar terms they have made for investors, excluding fees.
The top 20 firms oversee less than one-fifth of the industry’s assets, but generated about one-third of the overall $218bn gained for clients.
The report found that over the past three years the top 20 star hedge fund managers have generated 83% of the gains made by the industry as a whole.
“These managers have been generating above average performance over several decades reflecting the persistence of their superior returns,” said Rick Sopher, the chair of LCH.
“In most cases this reflects an ability to limit the downside in adverse conditions and to make money when conditions are favourable, as they were toward the end of 2023.”
The strong performance of the stock market had carried into the new year with the S&P 500 index of leading shares hitting an all-time high on Friday, driven by the strength of tech stocks.

Q6LLMG91VZ_ZSO57LTI8C4DAA9,‘We’ve dug our heels in’: is this the end of New Hampshire’s election clout?,Adam Gabbatt,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/23/new-hampshire-primaries-elections-democrats-republicans,"Every four years, for the past five decades, New Hampshire has found itself the center of both the media’s and would-be presidents’ attention.
Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama are among the Democrats who have committed weeks to campaigning in the state, which has long held the country’s first presidential primary. Over the years, national and international media have spent tens of millions of dollars on hotel rooms, rental cars, food and booze.
But this year, Democrats have stripped New Hampshire of its proud first-in the-nation status, potentially jeopardizing its outsized influence over American politics. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) has instead decided the first place to vote will be South Carolina, a state with a more diverse population and perhaps not coincidentally, a place where Joe Biden performed well in 2020.
“A terrible decision,” Maggie Hassan, one of New Hampshire’s two Democratic senators, told NBC on Sunday.
“Tremendously disappointing,” Jeanne Shaheen, Hassan’s Senate colleague, said when the move was first proposed.
Republicans have stood by the traditional nominating calendar, which since the 1970s has seen both parties hold caucuses in Iowa and then a primary in New Hampshire, while under Democrats’ plan, New Hampshire would retain plenty of clout – voting second, on the same day as Nevada.

But the Granite state hasn’t taken the DNC’s proposals lying down. The state Democratic party here is plowing ahead with a primary regardless, even though the national party has said it will not honor the results. There is a sense that politicians, journalists and voters could be witnessing the end of an era.
“New Hampshire is a very white area with an average age that’s a bit on the older side, so I do understand that it’s maybe not the best group of voters to represent the entire country,” said Jamie Setzler, 20, from New Boston, New Hampshire.
“But from a selfish standpoint it is disappointing. I used to be able to look forward, every four years, to something interesting.”
Holding the first primary has long given the state an outsized influence in national politics. Hundreds of journalists essentially move here for an entire week every four years as they’re able to cover both Republican and Democratic campaigns: in recent days, TV satellite trucks have almost outnumbered the amount of political yard signs in Manchester.
But if Democrats persist with their plan, the state could lose some of its importance, said Chris Galdieri, a politics professor at Saint Anselm college in New Hampshire.
“That’s a concern. I think that’s a lot of what worries state Democrats. It’s not just that the new calendar would have pushed New Hampshire to second place, it would have been second place shared with Nevada, all the way on the other side of the country,” he said.
The change to the calendar came after Joe Biden, who came fifth in the 2020 New Hampshire Democratic primary before reviving his campaign with a win in South Carolina, wrote to the DNC in 2022.
“For decades, Black voters in particular have been the backbone of the Democratic party but have been pushed to the back of the early primary process,” Biden wrote.
“We rely on these voters in elections but have not recognized their importance in our nominating calendar. It is time to stop taking these voters for granted, and time to give them a louder and earlier voice in the process.”
Both Iowa and New Hampshire have predominantly white populations, which would appear to be out of sync with the Democratic party – in the 2020 presidential election about 40% of Biden voters were Black, Hispanic, Asian or of other non-white races.
The plan hit a snag, however, when New Hampshire Democrats said they would hold their primary on 23 January, the same day as the Republican party. They cited a state law which says the New Hampshire primary shall be held “on a date selected by the secretary of state which is seven days or more immediately preceding the date on which any other state shall hold a similar election”.
It’s led to a quasi-primary in New Hampshire, where Joe Biden hasn’t even applied to have his name on the ballot but two long-shot challengers, Dean Phillips, a Democratic congressman from Minnesota, and Marianne Williamson, an author and self-help guru who ran for president in 2020, are crisscrossing the state holding campaign events.

The DNC has said any votes from Tuesday’s primary will not count towards the nomination, but in a sign that the Biden campaign sees the potential for embarrassment, a movement has emerged encouraging people to write his name on voting slips.
The resistance by New Hampshire Democrats, which perhaps should have been expected in a state which has the word “die” in its official motto, has some people skeptical that the calendar change will persist in 2028, when the Democratic party will not have an incumbent president and the primary field is expected to be a lot wider.
“It would be a disappointment. But I don’t think it will happen. We have it in our [state] charter that if another state changes its date, we change the date,” said Amanda Whiby, a co-owner of the Red Arrow Diner, tucked away on a side street in the center of Manchester.
The 100-year-old diner has benefitted from the first-in-the-nation primary more than most. It has become a must-visit stop for both Republican and Democratic candidates, and behind its long, red-topped dining counter, the walls are plastered with framed photos of famous, and not-so-famous, politicians.
“The Democrats tried to make a change, and we’ve dug our heels in,” Whiby said. “We feel very strongly that we do a great job of vetting the candidates here for the rest of the country, and I don’t think that tradition is going to change.”
While it remains to be seen what happens in 2028, there is an argument that New Hampshire has already lost some of its influence, said Dante Scala, a professor of political science at the University of New Hampshire.
“I actually think the order of states on the calendar now matters less than it did two, three decades ago,” Scala said.
“The whole nomination process has become much more national in scale and scope. Nowadays, I think candidates feel this pressure to build a national name ID, a national brand within their party months ahead of Iowa and New Hampshire.”
Scala pointed to Biden’s poor performance in New Hampshire in 2020, when he won just 8.4% of the vote, as evidence that results here don’t necessarily dictate who will become a party’s nominee.
Added to the sense that New Hampshire’s influence could be on the wane is the way the media has changed. The days of a candidate literally having to introduce themselves to voters in New Hampshire bars, and to give speeches in person, are largely gone.
“Iowa and New Hampshire voters get a lot of their news, not from local outlets, but from national ones. You’ve got New Hampshire conservatives, watching Fox News, and seeing Ron DeSantis and saying to themselves: ‘Oh, Ron DeSantis, okay,’ and then then maybe seeing him in person in New Hampshire.
“Now partisans in every state can have a front-row seat. They can see a televised town hall meeting with Anderson Cooper on CNN, they don’t have to live in Manchester, New Hampshire to go see a candidate. They can watch on TV. And so as a result of all that, I do think it’s a little less important who goes first, who goes second.”"

The cross-party procedure committee has recommended in a report published on Wednesday that Lord Cameron, the UK foreign secretary, should take questions from MPs at the “bar” of the house – the white line on the Commons floor from behind which visitors must not pass while parliament is sitting.
The group of MPs said it was “unusual” for a peer to be serving in such a high-profile cabinet role after Rishi Sunak resurrected the former prime minister’s political career and made him a life peer.
But they said that inviting lords to appear at the dispatch box, from where frontbenchers address the Commons, would “risk blurring the boundaries between the two houses”.
Instead, they said Cameron should appear at the bar.
To get the Conservative peer to the bar, MPs would need to back a motion, which would typically be tabled by ministers.
Karen Bradley, the Conservative former cabinet minister who chairs the committee, said: “We hope the government implements our proposals as quickly as possible, so that MPs can best scrutinise all secretaries of states on behalf of their constituents.”
Cameron should appear for Foreign Office question time, for statements and urgent questions first in the Commons rather than the Lords, the committee said.
Ministers are yet to say whether they will back the report.
A government spokesperson said: “We will carefully consider the committee’s report and will respond in due course.”
Labour’s shadow Commons leader, Lucy Powell, said: “This weak and chaotic government is running scared of parliament failing to allow MPs to scrutinise the foreign secretary.
“This welcome report from the procedure committee must be enacted quickly. The Tories have given up on governing, tainting politics with chaos and sleaze.”"
QAHC1AD6C0_KGSFNRY2X2QQQ1F,Starmer vows that Labour will ‘get a grip’ on knife crime,Pippa Crerar,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/25/starmer-vows-labour-get-grip-on-knife-crime,"Keir Starmer has promised to “get a grip” on soaring knife crime as he announced that a Labour government would bring in a bespoke plan for every offender, including tags and curfews.
The Labour leader said there would be an urgent crackdown on the availability of machetes and zombie-style knives, along with interventions to help prevent young people getting involved with knife crime and tough sanctions for those who do.
Young people caught with a knife would have a bespoke action plan to prevent reoffending, which could include sanctions such as curfews, tagging, or behavioural contracts, along with interventions involving parents and schools.
Ministers announced that they would finally ban large serrated knives and machetes under new legislation to be laid before parliament on Thursday, after zombie knives themselves were outlawed in 2016. These were defined in the legislation as those with a cutting edge, a serrated edge and “images or words that suggest it is to be used for the purpose of violence”.
Ministers will also increase the maximum sentence for the possession of banned weapons from six months to two years, while anyone caught selling knives to under-18s, including online, will also face two years behind bars.
Police will for the first time get powers to seize and destroy knives found during a search on a property if there are reasonable grounds to suspect the blade will be used in a serious crime. The new measures are expected to come into force in September.
Labour has pledged to halve the number of knife offences by the end of a first term. Official statistics show that despite total knife crime soaring by 70% since 2015, almost half of all knife possession cases recorded by police last year led to no further action.
Starmer defended the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, from criticism over knife crime rates in the capital, saying that only the government had the power to ban dangerous weapons, properly fund councils to tackle youth crime and bring in tough sanctions.
“I don’t think it’s fair, proportionate or actually a reasonable response to the failure of the last however many years to simply say: ‘Let’s put it at the door of the mayor,’” he told reporters.
“This constant pointing at others … This needs someone to grip it and say: ‘We’re not going to put up with this any more.’”
The Labour leader said he had been struck by an interview on Wednesday with the father of Ben Kinsella, who was stabbed to death in 2008, in which he commented on how little had changed since his son’s murder. “That’s the consequence of simply pointing the finger at somebody else. I’m not prepared to let that happen,” Starmer added.
Labour would take a three-pronged approach to knife crime, tackling availability of the weapons, intervening to prevent young people carrying them, and introducing serious consequences for those who do.
Just hours before the government announced a crackdown on zombie-style knives and machetes on England’s streets, Starmer said Labour would implement one. It would also toughen existing rules on serration and centimetre length.
He pledged to introduce tough criminal sanctions on tech executives who allowed knife sales on their online marketplaces, such as Amazon Marketplace, eBay and Instagram. There would also be a review of online knife sales from the point of purchase through to delivery, in particular to strengthen identity checks, and checks conducted by Royal Mail and Border Force for UK-bound parcels.
Every offender would be referred to a youth offending team and have a bespoke plan to prevent reoffending, with possible penalties including curfews, tagging or behavioural contracts.
Currently, in some cases, they just have to write a letter of apology. Starmer said serious cases would warrant imprisonment.
The party would bring in a Sure Start-style programme for teenagers, called Young Futures, which would require coordination of local services to identify those most at risk of falling into knife crime.
The £100m-a-year scheme would fund new youth workers and mental health hubs in every community, youth workers in A&E and mentors in pupil referral units and custody centres.
Starmer said that he was “shocked” that some young people felt scared to go to their local high street even in daylight. “I am very worried about young people, and they ought to be able to walk the streets feeling safe,” he said.
“I know it sounds obvious, but it is basic. It’s really important. And after 14 years of this government, we do not have that level of confidence in our young people feeling safe that we ought to.”"
QCIRE09ZEX_IDCAX2372ANUT4H,An essentially conservative country? It’s a powerful myth that warps English politics,Nesrine Malik,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/22/england-conservative-politics-tories-labour,"No matter what profound changes come about in England, one thing always seems to remain the same: the unshakable belief that it is simply a conservative country. This is an influential article of faith: the only way Labour can win power, it follows, is to treat voters as so naturally hostile to leftwing politics that they must be appealed to on Tory ground. Keir Starmer’s Labour is lauded as wise and sensible for accepting these terms – wooing big business, being averse to borrowing and spending, adopting a hard line on immigration and ruling out a wealth tax on the richest. In a “conservative country that occasionally votes Labour”, these are the rules.
But are they really? Is England essentially a conservative country, or has it been made conservative? “Politics does not reflect majorities,” Stuart Hall wrote in 1987, reflecting on the success of Thatcherism, “it constructs them.” The only perennial truth about England is that it is an unequal country, and the Conservative party has leveraged that inequality to its benefit: the English ruling class it represents has constructed its own majority. This process starts before its leaders are out of school uniform, building networks that are then deployed to their benefit in adult life. Out of the 12 Conservative prime ministers since 1945, seven were privately educated, with five of them at Eton. Rishi Sunak’s cabinet is 61% privately educated.
The result is a class well trained in the art and technique of influence. Its dominance is not the expression of the country’s essential conservatism, but the outcome of its disproportionate ability, through certain groups and institutions, to stamp conservatism on the national character. To that end, cross-pollination between networks bound together by common interest draws in money for campaigning, electioneering and swinging public opinion. A 2017 study showed that the Brexit campaign was mostly funded by five of the country’s wealthiest men. Even as the Tory party’s prospects waned, in the last quarter of 2023, it raised three times as much as Labour. In 2019, it was revealed that the Leader’s Group, an elite dining club, had given more than £130m to the Conservatives since 2010.
What do wealthy donors get in return for their patronage, beyond influence over government policy? Entry into the ruling class in the form of honours and peerages – another means by which the Tories keep their thumb on the scales. The House of Lords, ostensibly a healthy break on the partisan impulses of an elected parliament, increasingly looks like, in the words of a former Tory cabinet minister, a “scandal in plain sight”, where former party treasurers are all but guaranteed an entry once their donations exceed £3m.
These networks extend into the media, where money and ideological sympathies intersect with party interests. The Tory party and media organisations friendly to its politics project a vision of a sacred Anglo-British nationalism constantly assailed by leftwing threats. From GB News, which is funded by a Tory donor and whose shareholders include two Conservative peers, to the national press, whose revolving door with No 10 is well known, Britain’s media does so much work securing consent for Tory interests. Is it any wonder that five of the eight national newspapers are seen by the British public as predominantly rightwing, and that 45% of the public, as shown in a poll last week, believe that more migrants to the UK arrive illegally than legally? (In 2023, irregular arrivals made up something like 4.3% of all immigration to the UK.)
You could take a look at these systemic strengths and conclude that it doesn’t matter if England is naturally conservative or not, because the right clearly has a deep war chest that Labour does not. But Labour does have one of its own. It resides in a public that is increasingly divergent from rightwing values, and a new millennial generation that is breaking a supposed iron law of politics by not becoming more conservative as it ages. These are trends the right recognises, and knows it is threatened by, no matter how much power it holds – so it frenetically and assiduously brands them as expressions of a woke, “new elite” capturing our institutions.
Samuel Earle, author of Tory Nation: The Dark Legacy of the World’s Most Successful Party, identifies this missed opportunity. “The hope for Labour,” he told me, “lies in the fact that the Conservative party is scared of the British public in many ways. They are scared of something within Britain that refutes them.” Labour, he says, is “not scared of the British public. They’re scared of the Conservative party.”
It is easy to conflate Labour’s lead, and the predicted wipeout of the Tories, with the notion that the party is on to something. But this assumes that Labour is winning over voters rather than picking up support by default as a result of the Conservative party’s colossal collapse – years of economic and political mismanagement, hastened by Brexit-related party breakdown, became unspinnable failings.
Labour is in a precarious position in the longer term unless it mounts its own majority-creation exercise by taking on fiscal and cultural orthodoxies on austerity, the welfare state, immigration and what constitutes our modern national identity. A recent study of European electoral data found that adopting rightwing policies on immigration and the economy “does not help the centre-left win votes”, and in fact may alienate progressive voters. “Voters,” an analyst on the project told the Guardian, “tend to prefer the original to the copy.”
The next election may be settled in Labour’s favour, but that’s all that will be settled, unless the party offers an original agenda and fights to build a nation in its image. If that doesn’t happen, Starmer risks serving merely as a housesitter for the Conservatives, who can take the time to get their affairs in order, and return to find a country and political culture still tilted in their favour.

In March 2017, she was living with her dad in Ealing, west London, while she prepared to start her studies. “I was single and wanted to settle down but I’d been on some really bad dates.”
When a friend suggested a blind date with one of her boyfriend’s colleagues, she decided to give it a go. “The dating apps weren’t working so I agreed to a double date with my friend, her boyfriend and someone he knew.”
But when Camilla’s date cancelled, her friend was reluctant to rearrange the event. “I didn’t know at the time but her boyfriend asked another of his colleagues to join us instead,” she says. He ended up asking Chris, who was working in sales for the same tech firm. “I’d been away in Ireland the year before and I was using apps to meet people, but not very successfully,” he says. “My colleague told me that I was going on a double date that night – he didn’t tell me anything about Camilla, just that it was going to be great. I figured that, worst case scenario, I’d make a new friend.”
The four of them went to a pub in Hammersmith. “At the time, Cam had an Instagram account reviewing burgers,” Chris says. “I knew nothing about this girl apart from the fact we were meeting outside Five Guys so she could eat a burger before we went to the pub. As soon as I saw her, I thought she was so pretty.”
When Camilla was introduced to Chris, she initially thought he wasn’t her type. However, as soon as they started talking, there was an attraction. “I really liked him and the more we talked it just got stronger.” They discovered they’d both worked for the same estate agent in the past, even attending some of the same parties without meeting.
Whether your tale is unusual and outrageous, or touching and everyday, we’d love to hear it – and maybe interview you and your friend or partner(s) for our weekly column.
We'll contact you to arrange an interview
Chris was immediately smitten. “I couldn’t tell if she liked me but that made me really intrigued,” he says. “She seemed really smart and driven.”
During the date, the four friends arranged to go to a Craig David concert in Coventry a week later. “Before that, we went for another date on our own,” says Chris. He describes their weekend away to see the gig as “a whirlwind”. “It was non-stop fun and from there it just snowballed into a relationship where we were hanging out all the time and meeting each other’s families.”
In September that year, Camilla returned to university to complete her law degree and the pair moved into Chris’s flat in Clapham two years later. “We were ridiculously excited about living together,” she says. “We couldn’t do as many nice things while I was a student, like holidays, but once I started as a trainee solicitor it meant we could do more again.”
They married in August 2021 with a small ceremony in London, followed by a party in Poland, where Camilla’s family is from. Their son was also born at the end of 2021, and they bought a home in Kingston the following year.
Chris says they share a passion for good food and music. “We love going to nice restaurants and enjoy drinking together. We fully integrated into each other’s friendship groups and have always spent a lot of time with friends.”
Camilla appreciates the support she gets from her partner. “When I went back to university, he was always there when I felt like it was too much. I love how smart he is and, if I’m ever grumpy, I know he’ll lift me up. He’s also an amazing husband and father.”"
QG4812CKZP_ZRCUNGU60Q2TZI3,US authorities say more Boeing 737 planes should get checks after door plug blowout,Callum Jones,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/22/faa-boeing-737-planes-inspect-door-plugs,"Another Boeing jet faces scrutiny after the US aviation watchdog issued a safety alert and advised airlines to check that door plugs are secure.
Boeing was already working to reassure carriers, regulators and passengers after a cabin panel blew off a brand-new 737 Max 9 jet during an Alaska Airlines flight earlier this month. Some 171 Max 9 jets have since been grounded.
Now the Federal Aviation Administration has drawn another jet into focus: the 737-900ER. Late on Sunday, the agency recommended airlines “visually inspect mid-exit door plugs” on the jet.
While the 900ER is not part of Boeing’s newer Max fleet, it has an identical mid-exit door plug design. Some operators had “noted findings with bolts” during additional checks on the 900ER, the FAA said, providing no further detail.
“We fully support the FAA and our customers in this action,” a Boeing spokesperson said. Shares in the company slipped in New York on Monday.
The cabin panel blowout on 5 January has raised fresh questions for Boeing about its safety procedures and supply chain. The incident, shortly after the Alaska flight had taken off from Portland, Oregon, forced an emergency landing. No serious injuries were reported. A chunk of the fuselage was recovered from an Oregon teacher’s backyard.
Alaska and United Airlines, the only two US carriers that use the Max 9, later found loose parts on multiple grounded aircraft during preliminary checks. Dozens of Max 9 jets remain grounded, prompting airlines to cancel thousands of flights, while regulators investigate what caused the panel to blow off. The FAA has said the Max 9 planes will only return to service when it is satisfied they are safe.
Unlike the Max 9, which is a relatively new plane, the 900ER is well established. Boeing delivered the first one in 2007, and the last in 2019. There are some 490 in service, according to Cirium data.
But the 900ER, like the Max 9, has an optional door plug design which allows carriers to add an extra emergency exit door, if they install more seats. At least 79 900ER jets are estimated to be configured in this format, with a door rather than a plug.
According to the FAA, 900ER aircraft have logged over 11m hours of operation and 3.9m flight cycles.
In an alert for operators on Sunday, the FAA recommended “as an added layer of safety” that airlines check the four locations where the door is secured to the airframe of the 900ER “as soon as possible”.
Alaska, United and Delta Air Lines operate the majority of the 737-900ERs with door plugs. Each carrier said in a statement they had been inspecting their respective fleet, and did not anticipate disruption to passengers.
On Wednesday, the FAA said inspections of an initial group of 40 Boeing 737 Max 9 jets had been completed, a key hurdle to eventually ungrounding the model. The FAA is continuing to review data from those inspections before deciding when the planes can resume flights.
The FAA administrator, Mike Whitaker, told Reuters this month the FAA is “going through a process to work out how to restore confidence in the integrity of these plug doors”.
The National Transportation Safety Board chair Jennifer Homendy said last week the investigative agency would be looking at numerous records related to the door plug. She said it is unclear if the bolts on the Alaska Airlines jet were properly secured or if they were actually installed at all.
For Boeing, this amounts to the biggest safety crisis since the crashes of two of its Max 8 jets, in 2018 and 2019, in which 346 people were killed. The 737 Max was subsequently grounded across the world for almost two years.
Dave Calhoun, Boeing’s chief executive, stressed following the Alaska incident earlier this month that Boeing must acknowledge “our mistake” while regulators examine the grounded planes.
Analysts have called into question whether executives at the company will have to resign. “We believe the Max-9 issue will only put further pressure on Boeing management, as these incidents reflect less than expected progress on improving execution in the wake of the initial Max grounding and Covid slowdown,” Ronald Epstein of Bank of America wrote last week. “Aside from results of the NTSB and FAA investigations, regulators will likely look for more change from within Boeing.
“We would not be surprised to see regulators, investors and customers push for a turnover in the ranks of senior management and the Board of Directors.”

QK6P2T6XNA_6X8M556JSSPCI57,I was getting older and feeling clueless when a quote about the ‘afternoon of life’ inspired my reinvention,_,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/jan/23/i-was-getting-older-and-feeling-clueless-when-a-quote-about-the-afternoon-of-life-inspired-my-reinvention,"I’ve always been in a hurry. From the age of nine months, I was on the run, according to my mother. Not in a sporty or graceful way (I’d often bump into things) but in an energetic, let’s get on with things, way. My goals were the guardrails of my time and I set them annually for my career, finances, travels and fitness. They kept me motivated and on track.
That was until 2019. Instead of bubbling with plans, I staggered into the new year feeling weary and disenchanted and unable to commit to a single goal. That didn’t mean I wasn’t busy, especially at work. There was always another cost to drive down or an efficiency to optimise. But the question that kept niggling at me was: “Is this truly what life is about?”
A life that was already more than half over. I knew this, as a friend had helpfully compared its length to a 30cm ruler. Nothing screams urgency like finding yourself already at the 20cm mark of life and feeling clueless. Or perhaps I was overthinking everything and I just needed to knuckle down and work harder. That approach lasted less than three months.
As luck would have it, I bumped into a colleague who was scouting for sign-ups to a course he was co-chairing on conscious ageing – ageing with awareness and intention. I signed up. On the first day, I was introduced to a quote by Carl Jung, showing me another way.
The afternoon of life is just as full of meaning as the morning; only, its meaning and purpose are different.
Despite the Swiss psychoanalyst having died before I was born, his words gave me pause. I took a deep breath and then another. Through a series of exercises, I came to appreciate that the busyness of my years to this point, life’s morning, had been well spent. A husband, a home, a strong résumé and a handful of good friends. The gaps lay in my eulogy. I realised it would be missing a tolerance for embracing other points of view and the courage to explore new opportunities. That was my homework from now on. Filling those gaps was the meaning and purpose of life’s afternoon.
My discovery was exhilarating and terrifying at the same time. It meant I had to sever the corporate umbilical cord that had been my lifeline for over 34 years. I was going to reinvent myself. I wanted to write stories.
Before being introduced to Jung’s quote, I never saw myself at 58, returning to being a beginner in a new career. It has been liberating. I’m not contemplating the proverbial slippery slope on the other side of midlife; I see new mountains to climb. I’m no longer inching towards retirement. I’m not even sure if that is in my cards. And I’m no longer racing through life.
Working out my indelible life’s contribution is still a work in progress but a big part of it is living a life to prove that getting older is truly something to aspire to.
And that’s a legacy fit for a eulogy."
QKVPI1EEIW_KMTRHEEZEGAIY2B,"Crumbling hospitals cause over 100 care disruptions a week, NHS figures show",Denis Campbell,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/jan/26/crumbling-english-hospitals-cause-over-100-patient-care-disruptions-week,"Hospitals in England are being hit with disruptions to patients’ care more than 100 times every week because of fires, leaks and problems created by outdated buildings, NHS figures reveal.
There have been 27,545 “clinical service incidents” over the past five years – an average of 106 a week – data compiled by the House of Commons library shows.
They are incidents the NHS says were “caused by estates and infrastructure failure related to critical infrastructure risk” and are linked to the service’s massive backlog of maintenance, the bill for which has soared to £11.6bn. All the incidents led to “clinical services being delayed, cancelled or otherwise interfered with” for at least five patients for a minimum of 30 minutes.
That means the 27,545 incidents between 2018-19 and 2022-23 disrupted the care of at least 137,725 patients, according to an analysis of NHS data by the Commons library commissioned by Ed Davey, the leader of the Liberal Democrats.
“These findings are shocking but sadly not surprising, given the dilapidated, and in some cases dangerous, state of so many NHS facilities,” said Saffron Cordery, the deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents health service trusts.
The “unacceptable impact on patients” should spur ministers into increasing the NHS’s capital budget so trusts can urgently overhaul their estates, she said.
She added that, besides disrupting care, the poor state of many NHS facilities was also leaving patients at risk and reducing their chances of recovering from their illness. “There are many patients in hospital, mental health and community settings who have received care but whose recovery is hampered by deteriorating environments that are neither safe nor therapeutic,” she said.
Essex partnership mental health trust had the most incidents over the five years – 1,230 – followed by the North East London trust with 1,022.
More than 5,000 of the incidents occurred at the 34 NHS trusts where “40 new hospitals” are due to be built, which Boris Johnson promised back in 2019. Progress towards fulfilling that pledge has been slow and caused huge frustration among NHS bosses.
Among those 34 trusts, the Princess Alexandra hospital in Harlow, Essex, had the most disruptions, with 1,049, followed by Nottingham university hospitals trust with 818.
The Princess Alexandra has had at least 40 leaks of raw sewage in recent years, with the smell leaving staff feeling nauseous and too sick to work.
“It is shocking that so many patients are seeing their care impacted by crumbling NHS infrastructure in the very areas promised a new hospital by the Conservatives,” said Davey. “No patients or staff should have to be treated in hospital buildings with leaking roofs and floors at risk of collapse. This Conservative government has allowed our hospitals to fall into a disgraceful state of disrepair and patients and staff are paying the price.”
The repeated disruption at the “40 new hospitals” trusts shows that using capital funding to help pay the NHS’s running costs, as has happened over the past decade, had been shortsighted, said Thea Stein, the chief executive of the Nuffield Trust thinktank and, until last year, the boss of the mental health and community services trust in Leeds.
“That a significant number of safety incidents have impacted the care patients receive at these sites promised new hospital buildings or upgrades, is clear evidence of the urgent need to upgrade our ageing NHS estate and reverse the ill-judged raids on cash earmarked for buildings and equipment in order to cover the day-to-day bills,” she said.
The Department of Health and Social Care did not respond directly to the figures showing widespread disruption.
A spokesperson said: “We have invested significant sums to upgrade and modernise NHS buildings so staff have the facilities needed to provide world-class care for patients, including £4.2bn this financial year. Trusts are responsible for prioritising this funding to maintain and refurbish their premises, including the renewal and replacement of equipment.”
The spokesperson said the “40 new hospitals” programme had already delivered four new hospitals, with another due to open soon and 17 more under way."

Police in the city of Joliet, Illinois, said 23-year-old Romeo Nance had been located by US marshals near Natalia, Texas, on Monday evening “at which time it is believed that Nance took his own life with a handgun following a confrontation with Texas law enforcement officials”.
Nance was a suspect in the killing of eight people known to him whose bodies were found on Sunday and Monday at three separate locations, police had said earlier.
Authorities said the first known victim among the eight was a man found shot dead on Sunday afternoon in Joliet Township. He was identified only as a 28-year-old man originally from Nigeria who had been living in the US for about three years, police said.
An investigation of that shooting led deputies to an overnight stakeout in search of Nance, the registered owner of the suspected getaway vehicle, at his last known address in the nearby city of Joliet, about 35 miles (56km) south-west of Chicago.
Officers on Monday morning noticed blood outside a second home across the street from Nance’s address and inside found two people shot dead. Police then entered Nance’s residence, where five more bodies were discovered, bringing the total death toll at the three homicide scenes to eight.
“I’ve been a policeman 29 years and this is probably the worst crime scene I’ve ever been associated with,” Evans said during a news conference outside the Joliet homes Monday evening.
Dan Jungles, Will county chief deputy, said during the news conference that he did not have any indications yet of how long the people in the houses had been dead. He said that autopsies were pending.
Evans said the victims found on Monday in the houses were family members. Asked if the victims were members of the suspect’s family, Jungles said he could not comment except to say that the suspect knew them.
Teresa Smart lives about a block away from where seven of the victims were found and said she worried she and her family would not be able to sleepon Monday night.

QUKW8BMTHX_3KA9OS3JNVOBRAR,What happened in the Russia-Ukraine war this week? Catch up with the must-read news and analysis,Warren Murray,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/27/russia-ukraine-war-latest-news-update-putin-military-plane-crash-prisoners,"Every week we wrap up essential coverage of the war in Ukraine, from news and features to analysis, opinion and more.
Russia accused Kyiv of downing a large military transport plane carrying Ukrainian prisoners of war to an exchange on Wednesday, after a crash in the Belgorod region that killed all 74 people onboard.
Ukraine neither confirmed nor denied that it had hit the plane but said Moscow had created a “deliberate threat to the life and safety” of its PoWs by failing to warn Kyiv to deconflict the airspace before the swap, Pjotr Sauer, Luke Harding and Andrew Roth reported.
Ukrainian military intelligence said it did not have “reliable and comprehensive” information about who or what was onboard the Ilyushin Il-76 aircraft, which was filmed crashing and exploding in a fireball on Wednesday afternoon.
But the Russian ministry of defence said Kyiv shot down the Il-76, and claimed that the plane was carrying 65 Ukrainian PoWs who were to be swapped, along with six crew and three Russian servicemen.
On Thursday, the accusations continued at the UN security council where Russia called the incident “a premeditated, thought-through crime”.
Ukraine pushed back.
“Ukraine was not informed about the number of vehicles, roads and means of transportation of the captives. This alone may constitute intentional actions by Russia to endanger the lives and safety of the prisoners,” deputy ambassador Khrystyna Hayovyshyn said.
Luke Harding reports from Kupiansk, where almost two years after Vladimir Putin’s all-out invasion, Moscow has mobilised tens of thousands of troops.
The Kremlin has two immediate goals. One is to take back Kupiansk, the gateway to Ukraine’s second city, Kharkiv. Another is to capture the salient town of Avdiivka, not far from the occupied regional capital of Donetsk. So far Moscow has been unable to achieve either military objective. In the process it has lost spectacular numbers of troops, tanks and equipment.
The difficulties experienced by Russia in Synkivka point to a wider problem facing both armies. “It’s a war of armour against projectiles. At the moment projectiles are winning,” Gleb Molchanov, a Ukrainian drone operator, said. The Russians had some tactical success, flushing out Ukrainian soldiers from the forest and a few villages. But, he said, a significant breakthrough was almost impossible in an era of cheap and lethally accurate drones.
Vladimir Lenin’s recognition that Ukrainians and Russians should live in different states, and his insistence the industrial Donbas region remain in the Ukrainian republic, helped bring Ukraine into the Soviet fold after it had declared independence in 1918.
“But the price he paid for doing so seems excessive to present-day Russian opinion makers,” notes Serhii Plokhy, a professor of history at Harvard University.
So it is that the centenary of the death of Lenin, one of the most influential leaders of the 20th century, has gone largely uncelebrated in his home country of Russia, Andrew Roth reported. One of Lenin’s most strident critics is Vladimir Putin. The Russian president has blamed Lenin – whose waxy corpse remains embalmed in his Red Square mausoleum – for appeasing nationalists and drawing faultlines in the Soviet system, creating national republics that would later have the right to secede from the USSR.
Yet even for some among the pro-Kremlin conservatives fighting in Ukraine, there is a nostalgia for Lenin as a powerful historical figure. “Every thinking Russian is proud that we had Lenin, that we have Lenin,” wrote Zakhar Prilepin, a writer and paramilitary leader.
In a Guardian Long Read, Olesya Khromeychuk writes about the battle to keep Ukraine in the hearts and minds of the international community.
This will be a year of choices, she writes.
“Billions of people in dozens of countries will go to the polls and exercise the right to make their voices heard. Of course, not every election serves as a genuine expression of people’s will, and there are also those nations where many either take their right to vote for granted because they never had to fight for it, or feel so disenfranchised that they don’t think their vote matters. In 2024, wherever we are in the world, we can’t afford to have our choices made for us. We are obliged to exercise our agency, however limited it might seem.
“We have the power to elect political representatives who can enact changes that will outlast their time in office. We need to support politicians who view Russia’s war not as an inconvenience to their economies, but understand that tolerance of a warmongering state is what led us to this situation in the first place. We need to hold accountable those leaders who allowed Russia to enjoy impunity after 2014, who benefited from continued business with the aggressor country and thus contributed to the escalation in 2022.”
Andrew Roth revealed exclusively this week that the UK has provided satellite photographs of North Korean cargo shipments to Russia to UN experts as part of an attempt to trigger an official investigation into arms deals in violation of international sanctions.
Intelligence imagery taken between September and December shows three Russian ships, the Maia, Angara and Maria, loading containers at North Korea’s revived Najin port before transiting to Russian ports in the far east. North Korea has been accused of supplying ballistic missiles and hundreds of thousands of artillery shells to the Russian government for its war in Ukraine – dealings that are in violation of international law.
The deliveries have been cited as enabling military strikes against Ukraine in December and January that “killed dozens of people and injured hundreds more”."
QYG6EKTQQU_8TI9E9C5BP7VDVL,US-UK airstrikes on Houthi military sites in Yemen – what we know so far,Jem Bartholomew,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/22/us-uk-airstrikes-houthi-yemen-what-we-know-so-far-explainer,"The US has carried out its eighth round of airstrikes against Houthi targets in Yemen on Monday at 11.59pm local time. A Pentagon statement said the bombing was “proportionate and necessary”.
US military officials said the strikes were successful and had “good impacts” in all eight locations. US Central Command said the strikes were to “respond to increased Houthi destabilising and illegal activities”.
The UK joined the airstrikes for the second time in 10 days. The UK defence secretary, Grant Shapps, said the attacks were “in self-defence” and carried out in the interests of degrading Houthi capabilities.
The Pentagon said the operation targeted a Houthi underground storage site as well as missile and air surveillance sites. The UK Ministry of Defence added that it was involved in hitting multiple targets at two military sites with guided-precision bombs in the vicinity of Sana’a airfield.
The action followed a call on Monday between Sunak and US president Joe Biden. The leaders discussed further “disrupting and degrading Houthi capabilities,” a US spokesperson said.
A joint statement from both countries said that they had conducted strikes against eight Houthi targets in Yemen, with the support of Australia, Bahrain, Canada and the Netherlands.
The UK involvement on Monday appears to have been smaller than 11 January’s strikes. Ten days ago, US and UK warships and jets hit more than 60 targets in 28 locations.
Yemen’s official Saba news agency said that American-British forces launched raids on the capital of Sanaa and several other parts of Yemen. Houthi TV outlet al-Masirah said four strikes targeted the Al-Dailami military base north of the capital, which is under rebel control.
A Houthi spokesperson said on X the airstrikes “will only increase the Yemeni people’s determination”. Mohammed al-Bukhaiti accused the UK and US of protecting the “perpetrators” of a “genocide” in Gaza.
Mohammad Ali al-Houthi, head of the Houthi’s supreme revolutionary committee, has also posted on X about the latest round of strikes. As part of his post he says “Trust well that every operation and every aggression against our country will not be without a response”.
The UK prime minister did not brief the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, the house or the Commons speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, ahead of the strikes. Rishi Sunak was criticised 10 days ago for not informing parliament before airstrikes were carried out.
The Houthi rebels, backed by Iran, have disrupted the global commercial shipping route in the Red Sea and forced ships to go around the Cape of Good Hope. The Houthis say they are acting to support Palestine amid Israel’s bombardment of Gaza, in which officials say 25,000 people have been killed. However Houthi attacks have also targeted ships with no connection to Israel."
R0BAJH1GBM_MGQ6KR2J87Q1XDL,Menindee fish kills: inconsistent pesticide levels sparks calls for review of water testing methods,Fleur Connick,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/27/menindee-fish-kills-pesticide-levels-testing-darling-baaka-river,"Experts are calling for more sensitive water-quality testing in the Darling-Baaka River amid concerns that pesticides could be contributing to poor conditions, blue-green algae blooms and fish deaths.
It follows two of the state’s top scientific bodies publishing test results from water samples taken near Menindee in far western New South Wales which contained inconsistent results.
Testing conducted on behalf of the NSW chief scientist, on samples collected in August 2023 as part of an independent review into the deadly fish kill event in March in which 30m fish died, found low levels of some pesticides. Separate testing led by the NSW Environment Protection Authority did not detect any pesticides, despite collecting samples at similar locations and during the same month as the chief scientist’s testing.
The testing for the chief scientist was conducted by Charles Sturt University. It detected several herbicides including atrazine, simazine, terbuthylazine, tebuthiuron, metolachlor, clopyralid and fluroxypyr.
Atrazine, simazine, tebuthiuron and metolachlor are no longer approved for use in the European Union and have been classified by the European Chemicals Agency as being “very toxic to aquatic life with long lasting effects”, but they are still approved for use in Australia.
The NSW deputy chief scientist and engineer, Dr Darren Saunders, said the CSU testing was commissioned due to requests from the community and the independent review’s need for further data.

The CSU report said the herbicide levels were “consistent with agricultural land-use in the area” and recommended ongoing monitoring. Two pesticides, tebuthiuron and metolachlor, were found to have exceeded the 99% species protection level in Australian and New Zealand guidelines for fresh and marine water quality, which signifies a concentration estimated to be toxic to 1% of organisms in that aquatic environment. Both were below the 95% value, which the EPA tests for.
In contrast, the NSW EPA said it had not detected any pesticides of a reportable level in any routine testing of the river which had been conducted since the fish kill in March. This included its results from August, when the CSU samples were also collected.
Dr Matt Landos, an adjunct associate professor at the University of Queensland and director of Future Fisheries Veterinary Service, said the results showed “seriously concerning” levels of herbicides, which could produce “an elevated risk of ecological harm occurring”.
Landos said the guidelines did not consider the cumulative impact of “a cocktail of multiple pesticides” on the aquatic ecosystem.
He said that while the mass fish deaths at Menindee were attributed to low oxygen levels, the potential contribution of pesticides should also be investigated, alongside other issues like excessive nutrients from agricultural run-off.
“Pesticides were likely one of several contributors harming the ecosystem, particularly upstream, making the water that flowed to Menindee vulnerable to produce near-zero oxygen conditions,” he said.
Landos said pesticides, even at low levels, could modify the aquatic food web by “selectively harming sensitive organisms” such as algae and allowing more tolerant species to predominate.
“This is what’s happening in the Murray-Darling,” Landos said. “And the most tolerant organisms, as it turns out, are cyanobacteria, or blue-green algae.”
He said blue-green algae blooms could impair the ecological function of the river by creating volatile dissolved oxygen conditions, where oxygen levels rapidly rise during the day “due to extreme photosynthetic activity” and then plummet overnight.
“The bigger the biomass of algae, the more oxygen they’re going to require in that water body to keep everything alive,” he said. “If the bloom is too dense, it will suck the oxygen level down far too low and it can in fact cause mortality even to the algae.”

Landos said it was concerning that the EPA testing and CSU testing had produced such different results, and called for a review into the “sensitivity” of the testing methods.
The EPA told Guardian Australia its results were valid and its testing did not show any concentrations which exceeded the reporting limits. It said those limits were “well below the 95% guideline values” and consistent with best practice under the laboratory standard used by the Department of Climate Change, Environment, Energy and Water.
In April, the EPA announced its testing had “ruled out a pesticide pollution event” after the results came back negative for more than 600 pesticides. It has since reduced the frequency of pesticide sampling “following consistent zero results” from multiple testing rounds, including its results from August.
A spokesperson for NSW EPA said the organisation’s testing methods “are sensitive enough to detect concentrations of ecological significance”. They added that results below that limit “have a high uncertainty, are not meaningful and reporting them is not appropriate nor consistent with analytical best practice”. They also suggested the CSU results were inconsistent, as the published report was amended in December.
“The reporting limit is the lowest concentration that can be reliably measured,” the EPA said.
They also said that exceeding the 99% or 95% default guideline values “does not indicate an actual impact, rather that further investigations are warranted”.
Vincent Pettigrove, a professor of aquatic pollution at RMIT, said while the guideline values provided an indication of whether the chemicals of interest were at concentrations which may cause environmental harm, there were no national guidelines for “the majority of pesticides registered for use in Australia”.
He added that the ecotoxicological tests used to derive the guideline values for pesticides “are often short-term acute tests and do not account well for chronic long-term exposures”.
“I believe that the impact of pesticides on fish is more likely to be more subtle from chronic exposure that may reduce the viability of populations.”
Pettigrove said the guideline values were for one chemical and therefore “unable to consider the total effects of a mixture of chemicals”. For example, the triazine herbicides detected in the CSU study had a similar mode of toxicity, “so their combined effect should be considered”, he said.

“There’s no excuse for it. We should have done better,” Yousaf, Scotland’s first minister, told the inquiry on Thursday.
A tense day of evidence at the inquiry, which is sitting in Edinburgh for a second week, revealed that the former first minister Nicola Sturgeon had described Boris Johnson as “a fucking clown” as he broadcast to the nation to announce a second Covid lockdown in October 2020.
She told her chief of staff: “His utter incompetence in every sense is now offending me on behalf of politicians everywhere.”
Following a succession of revelations about how senior Scottish ministers and officials regularly deleted informal messages and exhibited apparent disdain for freedom of information rules, Yousaf also told Jamie Dawson KC, lead counsel for the inquiry, that he had instructed an externally-led review into the use of WhatsApp and other unofficial technology in the Scottish government.
His announcement came as evidence taken earlier in the day revealed that, despite consistent Scottish government denials, decisions about pandemic restrictions and strategy did appear to have been made using WhatsApp, in seeming contradiction of Sturgeon’s insistence that she did not conduct her government’s Covid response through informal messaging.
On Thursday morning the inquiry was shown exchanges between Sturgeon and Liz Lloyd, who served as her chief of staff and strategic adviser between 2015 and 2023, in which Sturgeon described the former UK prime minister as “a fucking clown”.
Sturgeon went on the dismiss the UK government’s Covid communications strategy as “awful … we’re not perfect but we don’t get nearly enough credit for how much better than them we are”.
Lloyd, who described herself as Sturgeon’s “thought partner”, was shown several exchanges, including one regarding the numbers allowed to attend weddings and another suggesting “a good old-fashioned rammy [quarrel]” with the UK government over furlough policy.
There was a furious response last week from bereaved families and opposition politicians when the inquiry heard that Sturgeon “retained no messages whatsoever”, while Scotland’s national clinical director, Jason Leitch, joked in a group chat that WhatsApp deletion was his “pre-bed ritual”.
Sturgeon has since clarified that the inquiry does have messages relating to the pandemic, although they were not retained on her device, and has said: “To be clear, I conducted the Covid response through formal processes from my office in St Andrew’s House, not through WhatsApp or any other informal messaging platform.”
Questioning Yousaf about how decisions were made at that time, Dawson asked him if the Scottish cabinet was a decision-ratifying rather than decision-making body.
Yousaf said he disagreed with that assessment, but also spoke to concerns raised in his initial written statement that decisions made by Sturgeon were not “cascaded” to the rest of the cabinet.

He said the pandemic had not been “not normal times” but that there were occasions when Sturgeon and her “gold command”, a select group of senior advisers and ministers, made often time-sensitive decisions that were not discussed at cabinet level.
Asked by Dawson if it was correct that these gold command meetings were not minuted, Yousaf said it was “my understanding that they should have been”.
Yousaf, who has provided the inquiry with his own WhatsApp messages, was asked about an exchange with Leitch that took place on his first day in his role as health secretary. Leitch referred to a meeting and “some FM ‘keep it small’ shenanigans as always – she actually wants none of us”.
Dawson asked if this was an example of Sturgeon wanting to make decisions alone, but Yousaf said this was a “classic example of Jason over-speaking”.
Yousaf was also asked about a WhatsApp exchange which Leitch was challenged on earlier this week, where he asked whether he needed to wear a face mask at an indoor dinner event when he was standing up talking to other guests. Leitch had advised Yousaf to “have a drink in your hands at all times, then you’re exempt”.
But Yousaf denied that he had been asking Leitch for “a workaround”. He told Dawson: “I was asking for clarification on how to comply.”"
R5QCOREYQE_9WBT70TGSTTC85L,Families accuse Queensland police of racially profiling Indigenous children after alleged assault by vigilantes,Andrew Messenger,_,20230122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/23/families-accuse-queensland-police-of-racially-profiling-indigenous-children-after-alleged-assault-by-vigilantes,"The families of three Indigenous children allegedly assaulted by a pair of accused vigilantes claim they were “racially profiled” and treated like criminals by Queensland police.
In a complaint to the force, a family member of one of the children claims the police who responded to the incident took the side of the alleged vigilantes, telling the families that their children had been placed under a “citizen’s arrest”.
The two men faced Mareeba magistrates court on 22 January charged with assault and deprivation of liberty after an investigation by the specialist Tablelands child protection and investigation unit. They will return to court on 19 February.
Police allege that on 23 December the men used dog collars as makeshift handcuffs to restrain the boys, who they accused of trespassing on private property.
In interviews with Guardian Australia, family members complained of being deprived of information about the incident by the police, and said they were told the police were considering charges of trespass, despite the family members saying the children had never left public property.
The Guardian cannot name the alleged victims or their parents for legal reasons. No charges have been laid against the children.

The family member who made the complaint, an auntie of one of the children, claimed that examples of racial “bias” on behalf of the police were “regular” in the north Queensland community, particularly after a police shooting last year. The community had been “raw” ever since and was characterised by racial tension, she said.
“There’s a white adult telling you some stories about Indigenous kids, and then don’t even think to question, don’t even think to ask, just act on whatever they’ve been told by these adults,” she said.
According to the complaint, family members were led to believe their children were guilty of trespass by police who dropped them off at home.
Police told them they were considering whether to press charges and did not mention the alleged vigilante behaviour, the families claim.
In the complaint, one child’s male guardian accused police of providing “falsified and misleading information” as a result of “bias”.
He also accused them of “failing … to obtain information or children’s version of statements” but “instead acted and sided on these white vigilantes alone”.
In a section marked “how can we improve the service”, the complaint suggested “mitigate the racial discrimination attitudes and behaviours within the Queensland Police Service”.
One child’s grandmother said there had been a flood that day and their kids had left the house to look at a rising nearby creek, like many in the community.
She remembered the police telling her the children had been “citizen’s arrested”.

She only learned of the dog collars allegation when one of the children got over their shock at the alleged imprisonment, she said.
“There’s a lot of tension in the town at the moment,” she said. “And I think that they were being racially profiled because of the tension that’s in town.”
She said: “I want my [kids] to be good citizens.”
“If [the child] was doing what they allege [the child] was doing, [they] would be in trouble with me,” she said.
Another parent said her child no longer felt safe in the community.
“My [child] doesn’t really walk the streets any more. [They go] in the vehicle where they need to go,” she said.
Another parent said he had gone to the police station after being told what had happened by one of the children to ask for answers and for the men to be arrested.
The specialist unit travelled to the town to do interviews the next day, and charges were laid in January.
He blamed “hysteria” surrounding youth crime for the incident.
A spokesperson for the Queensland police service chose not to comment because the matter was before the court."
R765PW0INB_3YXTEGJK0MZHBW4,"Tuvalu election: what’s happening, and what could it mean for Taiwan, China and the Pacific?",_,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/25/tuvalu-general-election-2024-impact-china-taiwan-pacific-relations-prime-minister-kausea-natano-seve-paeniu,"On Friday, the small Pacific island nation of Tuvalu will head to the polls to elect members of its 16-seat parliament.
With the country’s population sitting at just over 11,000, Tuvalu’s elections rarely spark international headlines. But, against a backdrop of intense geopolitical competition and China’s rising influence in the region, greater scrutiny surrounds this year’s vote – and its outcome may have implications far beyond Tuvalu’s shores.
Candidates in Tuvalu are battling for one of the two seats in each of Tuvalu’s eight island electorates. Many islands have fewer than 1,500 eligible voters, and often only a handful of votes separates the winners and losers in each electorate.
There are no political parties in Tuvalu, and candidates are all running as independents. Once counting is over – which is expected some hours after polls close on Friday – a period of complex negotiations will begin, where the 16 newly elected parliamentary members develop factions. The largest group will form a government and elect the prime minister.
As a result, even if the current prime minister, Kausea Natano, successfully defends his seat of Funafuti, he may not be re-elected as the nation’s leader. In fact, Natano’s finance minister, Seve Paeniu, is aiming for the prime ministership himself, and has already secured a seat in parliament by running unopposed in his electorate of Nukulaelae. He says he has begun talks with other candidates in an attempt to seal his leadership.
Opposition leader Enele Sopoaga is also vying for another term as Tuvalu’s prime minister, having lost his prime ministership to Natano in the previous 2019 election.
Tuvalu is one of only 12 countries in the world that maintains diplomatic relations with Taiwan. The nearby Pacific nation of Nauru switched its allegiance from Taiwan to China earlier this month, just days after presidential elections in Taiwan.
There is speculation that Tuvalu may do the same following its elections on Friday, though Taiwan’s foreign ministry official Eric Chen condemned such rumours. “The Tuvalu government once again emphasised that it will firm up diplomatic ties with us,” said Chen at a recent press briefing.
Under Natano’s administration, Tuvalu has maintained strong ties with Taiwan, with the Prime Minister visiting Taipei in 2022 as part of an official delegation. Natano reaffirmed his support of Taiwan in November during the Pacific Islands Forum, revealing his government had been approached by Beijing to form a diplomatic union, but this was rejected since China “didn’t allow us to have two diplomatic ties with Taiwan and them”.
Sopoaga, who has served as Tuvalu’s ambassador to Taiwan, told the Guardian he “strongly believe[s] Tuvalu should continue to recognise Taiwan as a sovereign independent state and a diplomatic friend”.
However, Paeniu said if he were to become prime minister, he would “review” the country’s relationship with Taiwan and China, to ensure Tuvalu’s foreign policy was the most beneficial to the country.
“Even within our government that has led Tuvalu for the past four years, we also have different and differing opinions on certain topics, including the Taiwan-China issue,” he told the Guardian. “So I take the view that this is something that is open for review.”
Mihai Sora, a research fellow from the Pacific Islands programme at the Lowy Institute, an Australian thinktank, said that since 2016 there had been a global acceleration of countries forfeiting their support of Taiwan in favour of China, and elections often marked an “inflection point” for new governments to make “major changes in foreign policy”.
“The Taiwanese government would be quite concerned that this [election] might bring about another potential change, and it might result in the loss of another diplomatic partner, which is an ever-dwindling number for Taiwan, around the world,” Sora said.
Results from Tuvalu’s election are expected on Friday night, with a government expected to be formed in the days that follow.
Foreign policy is expected to play a large part in the leadership bids of the candidates, and a migration and security treaty signed between Tuvalu and Australia in November is weighing heavily on the vote.
The deal is yet to be ratified by either country, and has led to heated debate in Tuvalu’s parliament. Opposition leader Sopoaga says he would scrap the deal if elected as prime minister.
“The arrangement is one-sided, it’s all to do with what Tuvalu must commit [to], but Australia is not committing [to] anything at all,” Sopoaga told the Guardian.
Meanwhile, Paeniu – who was instrumental in negotiating the agreement with Australia – says he would continue to support the treaty and ensure it comes into force if elected as prime minister. However, he said he would make “slight modifications” to a controversial element of the agreement that states Tuvalu must “mutually agree with Australia” if it wants to strike a deal with any other country on security or defence-related matters.
“That’s something that would need to be negotiated with Australia,” Paeniu said.
Sora describes the situation as a potential “stress point” for Australia. “It’s a tense moment for Australian diplomacy in some respects,” Sora said. “I would expect that that agreement will come under scrutiny in any new government.”"
R7PMMJG1JN_WQB1FD3NR1RRND5,Fans shrug off study debunking love languages: ‘We didn’t pull it out of thin air’,Alaina Demopoulos,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/jan/24/are-love-languages-real,"Natalia Buia probably would not date a man if he refused to at least entertain a conversation about love languages. “It’s not a deal breaker per se, but I have gotten into arguments with men on dates over it,” said Buia, who is 35 and lives in Toronto. “If someone thinks love languages are silly or stupid, it means that we don’t see eye-to-eye on communication.”
Buia only recently learned about the five love languages, after leaving a 10-year marriage and re-entering single life. Her friends turned her on to a quiz that purports to tell you how you best receive and express love. It is based on The 5 Love Languages: How to Express Heartfelt Commitment to Your Mate. The book has sold 20m copies since being published by Gary Chapman in 1992.
This week, however, the Washington Post reported on new research that found there is not enough empirical evidence on love languages to back up their promised effectiveness.
You don’t have to read the book to understand the love language basics. Chapman claims there are five distinct ways to receive and express love: words of affirmation (giving compliments or validation), acts of service (doing something helpful, like taking out the trash), physical touch (PDA, a hug or a kiss), quality time (putting the phones away and being around each other), and gift giving (thoughtful little presents every now and then). Ostensibly, knowing which love languages you and your partner favor will help you talk through disagreements and give each other what you want from a relationship.
Love languages are a staple of first date conversations, an icebreaker that lives somewhere on the spicy scale between “what’s your sign?” and “do you want kids?”. But scientists and cynics alike have long called it an unreliable theory. For one, Chapman is not a psychologist. He’s a longtime Baptist pastor who counselled couples through the church.
In their paper, published in the journal Current Directions in Psychological Science, researchers reviewed all the scientific material published on the concept. They found that most people don’t have a “primary” love language. It’s common to connect with all five options – or even more, as researchers believe that there are more than five categories for expressing love in a “meaningful way”. It also might not matter if you date a fellow gift-giver or physical-toucher: according to the paper, couples who say they “speak” the same love languages do not report higher satisfaction than those who speak separate ones.
Even in light of this paper, love language adherents remain convinced by the theory. Buia compared having a primary love language to a zodiac sign – “you just have it,” she said. “It would be great if this had scientific backing, but it’s not as if we just pulled this thing out of thin air.”
Breanna Walther believes that learning about love languages and attachment styles – another psychology term that entered the pop-cultural lexicon due to a bestselling book – has enriched her relationships. “It’s helped explain to me why I dated certain people, and why it didn’t work out,” said Walther, who is 32 and lives in New York. “Why can’t they just let us have fun with it? If we want to live in our delusions, let us.”
And Sunny Daye, a 27-year-old musician from Houston, Texas, feels similarly unfazed. “All [Chapman] did was put words to things that have been around for ever,” they said. “If you know your partner loves flowers, and you bring home some flowers, that’s gift-giving. I don’t know how you can debunk something like getting your girlfriend flowers.”
But Daye believes that love languages can shift and change as people do. When they first took the quiz at 19, it told them their love language was acts of service. It made sense at the time. “Back then, I was in college, working as a professional photographer, and had a lot of stuff going on, so if you could help my days go smoothly back then, I’d appreciate it,” they said.

A few years later, they took the quiz again. It said their primary love language was words of affirmation. That rang true, too. “I was in a relationship where I was really deprived of that, so it became important to me,” Daye explained. Today, their love language is gift giving: “That will always be a big one for me, because it’s how my family showed love when I was a kid.”
Daye is currently in a relationship, but they say that talking about love languages was “non-negotiable” during their dating days. “If I’m dating someone and I ask them how do they show love and how would they like to receive it, and they say that’s made up, we don’t need to date,” they said. “I’ve stopped dating people because they don’t adhere to my love language.”
For his part, Chapman stands by his theory. “I think the fact that so many millions of people have read the book, so many people have found it to be helpful in their relationship, that I’m convinced it can have a tremendous positive impact on a marriage,” he told the Post.
For Buia, love languages don’t just help to form romantic connections. “I get together with my single friends and we talk about guys who put their love languages in their Tinder or Hinge profiles. We all follow the same meme accounts about this stuff,” she said. “It’s almost a form of community in that way.”"
R8FQT5527T_U9U3RNRO25S3MPS,Why is Orbán blocking Sweden’s entry to Nato – and what happens next?,Lili Bayer,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/24/why-is-orban-blocking-swedens-entry-to-nato-and-what-happens-next,"Sweden is closer than ever to becoming a Nato member – but its accession to the western military alliance, which has faced delays for more than a year, is still not a done deal.
Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine two years ago prompted Sweden and Finland to shift long-held security policies, and the two countries applied to join Nato in May 2022.
At the time, Nato accession for both was expected to be a quick process, given their advanced militaries, high level of interoperability with alliance forces and status as EU members.
Nevertheless, they faced obstacles to accession. Finland joined the alliance in April 2023, but Sweden’s accession has yet to be completed.
On Tuesday, Turkey’s parliament ratified Swedish membership, putting the country a step closer to accession – but it is still awaiting the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s final signature. Hungary’s parliament has yet to ratify, and delays could continue.
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (Nato), a collective defence alliance, was founded in 1949. Over the years, the alliance has grown from its 12 founding members to a total of 31.
It operates under the powerful principle, outlined in its founding treaty, that an armed attack against one or more Nato members “shall be considered an attack against them all”.
During the cold war, Nato focused heavily on deterrence and defence.
After the fall of the Soviet Union, the alliance expanded eastward. The Baltic countries and central European states such as Poland and Hungary joined the alliance.
The alliance became involved in operations beyond its borders, for example leading peacekeeping forces in Kosovo. But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine contributed to another shift in its focus, as military planners now put an emphasis on bolstering the alliance’s defences.
While all Nato countries agreed Sweden and Finland should become members of the alliance, Turkey raised concerns, in particular about the activities of Kurdish groups and restrictions on arms exports to Turkey.
As a result, in June 2022, the three countries signed a joint memorandum outlining steps they would take to address Ankara’s qualms, and in return Turkey said it would support inviting Sweden and Finland to become Nato members.
But while most Nato countries quickly ratified Sweden and Finland’s membership, Turkey and Hungary dragged out the process. They ultimately signed off on Finnish membership, but kept Sweden waiting.
During July’s Nato summit in Vilnius, Erdoğan vowed to send Sweden’s ratification to parliament as the two countries confirmed that they had “worked closely together to address Türkiye’s legitimate security concerns” and “as part of that process, Sweden has amended its constitution, changed its laws, significantly expanded its counter-terrorism cooperation against the PKK, and resumed arms exports to Türkiye”.
But further delays ensued.
Turkey’s leadership has used the accession as a negotiating chip, including in its quest to get approval to buy American F-16 fighter jets.
On Tuesday, Turkey’s parliament finally voted in favour of Swedish membership, and Erdoğan is expected to sign the legislation in the coming days.
That leaves only Hungary’s parliament, which has yet to ratify.
Hungary’s leadership has not provided a clear reason for delays.
Domestically, senior politicians from the ruling Fidesz party have argued that the delay is due to Swedish criticism of the state of Hungarian democracy.
Formally, Hungary has not put forward any substantive objections at Nato to Swedish membership. Unlike Ankara, which held highly structured negotiations with Finland and Sweden, Budapest has not made any concrete demands.
Hungary is an outlier in the western defensive alliance: while it remains an active Nato member, senior Hungarian officials still routinely meet their Russian counterparts and are often publicly critical of western policies toward Moscow.
Within Nato, the Hungarian delay in ratifying Sweden’s membership has long been interpreted in the context of a close alliance between Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, and Erdoğan.
Faced with mounting political pressure and increasingly isolated, Orbán said on Wednesday that he had spoken on the phone with the alliance’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg.
“I reaffirmed that the Hungarian government supports the Nato membership of Sweden. I also stressed that we will continue to urge the Hungarian national assembly to vote in favour of Sweden’s accession and conclude the ratification at the first possible opportunity,” he said.
Stoltenberg said he had a “good call” with Orbán. “I welcome the clear support of the prime minister and his government for Sweden’s Nato membership. I look forward to the ratification as soon as parliament reconvenes,” he said.
The accession of Sweden and Finland is of high strategic value to Nato.
The two countries’ geographic location significantly bolsters the alliance’s position in the north, turning the Baltic Sea into a de facto Nato lake.
Sweden and Finland also bring advanced military capabilities to the alliance.
This week, Nato is launching exercise Steadfast Defender 2024 – its largest exercise in decades, involving approximately 90,000 forces from 31 Nato countries and Sweden.
Expansion northward also has symbolic value.
“President Putin wanted less Nato, he is getting more Nato – and that’s an important message,” Stoltenberg said of Swedish and Finnish accession.
Sweden’s leadership has insisted that it is ready for Nato membership.
Reacting to the vote in Turkey’s parliament, the Swedish prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, said: “Today we are one step closer to becoming a full member of Nato,” adding that it was “positive” that the parliament had signed off.
Orbán this week publicly invited Kristersson to Hungary for talks, but Swedish officials have taken a cautious approach.
The country’s foreign minister, Tobias Billström, said that before responding the government would need to “think through what the letter signals”.
Within the alliance, there is growing frustration with Hungary.
One senior European diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive Nato matters, said: “We are shocked. Hungary always consistently assured us that they will not be the last..
“We frankly do not understand what is going on.”
A second senior European diplomat said that “after good news from Ankara, all attention goes to Budapest”.
“It is normal among democratic nations to voice out healthy criticism, but it is not normal to diminish security of all allies without substantive reasons,” they added."
R9J6HVGCT8_GQ5IN5VD1Y0VCOD,China’s human rights record criticised at UN as it faces rare scrutiny of policies,Amy Hawkins,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/23/china-human-rights-record-criticised-un-faces-rare-scrutiny-of-policies,"The UK, the US and several other countries criticised China’s human rights record on Tuesday as the country was subjected to rare scrutiny of its policies at the United Nations.
The UK called on China to “cease the persecution and arbitrary detention of Uyghurs and Tibetans and allow genuine freedom of religion or belief and cultural expression without fear of surveillance, torture, forced labour or sexual violence”, while the US said China should “release all arbitrarily detained individuals” and cease the operation of “forcible assimilation policies including boarding schools in Tibet and Xinjiang”.
The UK also recommended that the national security law in Hong Kong be repealed and specifically called for the prosecution of the pro-democracy activist Jimmy Lai to be dropped.
The recommendations were made as part of the UN Human Rights Council’s universal periodic review, a mechanism by which the 193 UN member states review each others’ human rights records every five years.
Each country at the UN headquarters in Geneva was given 45 seconds to make recommendations based on China’s human rights records since 2018. In that period, huge protests against the tightening grip of the Chinese Communist party (CCP) in Hong Kong prompted the imposition of a national security law that critics say criminalises dissent, and there has been increased international scrutiny of the human rights situation in Xinjiang, as well as growing concern about transnational repression as activists in the US, the UK and other countries have been targeted by Chinese authorities or agents.
Responding to the recommendations, China’s UN ambassador, Chen Xu, said concerns were caused by “misunderstanding or misinformation”.
Chen said: “A few countries groundlessly accuse and smear China, based not on facts but on ideological bias and unfounded rumours and lies.”
Tuesday’s meeting was the first time China has been through the review process since the UN’s report on Xinjiang was published in August 2022. The long-delayed report, which was written by the outgoing human rights commissioner Michelle Bachelet, found China was committing “serious human rights violations” against Uyghurs in Xinjiang. Beijing described it as “disinformation”.
Several countries brought up China’s policies in Xinjiang during Tuesday’s meeting. The region, along with Tibet, has become a byword for Beijing’s repressive human rights policies, particularly towards religious and ethnic minorities.
Human rights activists said that the fact that several countries mentioned Tibet in this year’s review bucked a recent trend of the region not being spoken about on the international stage.
Many smaller countries, or countries that are economically dependent on China, praised China’s rights record, in particular its success at lifting tens of millions of people out of poverty since 2018.
Ethiopia said it “applauds China for improving the criminal litigation system”, while Iran said: “We appreciate the economic programmes implemented by the government of China with the aim of promoting social, cultural and economic rights.”
Bhutan, a small, landlocked country between India and China that has recently been warming its relationship with Beijing, said: “We commend the significant progress in poverty alleviation and the achievement of the poverty reduction target of the 2030 agenda ahead of schedule.”
Speaking after the UN session, Sophie Richardson, a former China director for Human Rights Watch, said: “We increasingly hear Chinese government rhetoric in the recommendations made by governments, I think indicating a level of control over the process or influence over the process, and that’s problematic.”
Zumretay Arkin, the spokesperson for the World Uyghur Congress, criticised central Asian countries for failing to speak out against the abuse of Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other minorities in Xinjiang and said: “Muslim-majority countries have failed the Uyghurs.”
China’s foreign ministry has been approached for comment."
RBGOFYW1K3_8HQJI9H5G6F4HKT,Ted fellows resign from organisation after Bill Ackman named as speaker,Chris McGreal,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/24/ted-fellows-resign-bill-ackman-speaker-conference,"The Ted organisation has been hit with resignations and criticisms after naming the controversial activist billionaire Bill Ackman, who was instrumental in forcing out Harvard’s president over antisemitism allegations, among its main speakers at this year’s conference.
Four Ted fellows, led by the astronomer Lucianne Walkowicz and the filmmaker Saeed Taji Farouky, resigned from the group on Wednesday, accusing it of taking an anti-Palestinian stand and aligning itself “with enablers and supporters of genocide” in Gaza.
“2024 main stage speaker Bill Ackman has defended Israel’s genocide and ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people and has cynically weaponised antisemitism in his programme to purge American universities of Pro-Palestinian freedom of speech,” the pair wrote to Chris Anderson, who leads Ted, and Lily James Olds, director of the fellows programme.
“We’ve become increasingly concerned about the fundamental values and moral compass of the organisation over the years, but with this year’s speaker selection, it is clear Ted has crossed a red line.”
The conference will be held in Vancouver, Canada, in April, under the banner The Brave and the Brilliant”. The theme of Ackman’s talk has not been revealed but his selection was announced last week after he was accused of using his money and influence to help force Claudine Gay’s resignation as Harvard’s president following her disastrous appearance before Congress in December when she was questioned about on-campus antisemitism during the Israel-Gaza war.
Ackman has taken stridently pro-Israel positions, including justifying the scale of the attacks on Gaza in which more than 25,000 Palestinians have been killed, mostly civilians, and the forced removal of about 2 million Palestinians from their homes. He has described criticism of Israel as antisemitism and called for the blacklisting from employment of American students who signed petitions denouncing the offensive in Gaza in the wake of the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel.
Farouky and Walkowicz’s resignation letter noted that other speakers announced by Ted include the journalist Bari Weiss, who they describe as having “a long, sordid, and well-documented history of anti-Palestinian speech”, but that there are no Palestinians in the line-up.
“We refuse for our work and identities to be exploited to promote the Ted brand while the organisation and its speakers generate income and advance their careers through dehumanising Palestinians and justifying their genocide,” the pair said.
After the resignation letter was published, two other fellows – the entrepreneur Ayah Bdeir and cosmologist Renée Hlozek – also quit. Nearly 30 others added their names “in solidarity” without leaving Ted.
Ackman responded to the resignations with a statement to the Guardian.
“I stand unapologetically with Israel and against antisemitism and terrorism, while strongly supporting the Palestinian people. Attempts to cancel speech and eliminate the free and respectful exchange of ideas among people with differing views are driving much of the divisiveness that plagues our nation. Truth, wisdom and ultimately peace are the result of the free exchange of ideas and debate, precisely what Ted is all about. It is sad that this is not more widely understood,” he said.
Farouky told the Guardian he did not regard the issue as one of freedom of speech.

“Obviously, there’s a red line and and I think Ted are applying the same values that you would to, say, a debate about space exploration to a 21st-century live stream of someone who defends genocide, and it’s just failed miserably,” he said.
“A generous reading is that the organisation is just terrible at making moral judgments about who they invite. I think they want to have slightly edgy or controversial speakers in the belief that they can do an interview on stage that might challenge them. But they’re just not equipped for that.”
Farouky gave the example of the billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk’s appearance at Ted in 2022, which he described as “a puff piece”.
“The whole setup of the conferences just has no capacity to really interrogate ideas. It’s a celebration of the individual. It’s not a space for free debate at all,” he said.

RC8HMZUMHV_PTWWZ71T74OJY1J,"Josef Fritzl to be moved to regular prison from psychiatric unit, lawyer says",Kate Connolly,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/25/josef-fritzl-to-be-moved-regular-prison-from-psychiatric-unit-lawyer,"Josef Fritzl, the Austrian who raped and incarcerated his daughter in a purpose-built prison beneath his home for 24 years, will be transferred to a regular prison from a prison psychiatric unit, his lawyer has said – paving the way for his release to a nursing home.
Earlier this month his lawyer, Astrid Wagner, announced he was applying for early release from jail on the grounds of old age and dementia.
Fritzl, 88, was reportedly close to tears on hearing the decision by a panel of three female judges at Krems regional court.
However, they said the decision was not yet final and requires a further decision to be made by public prosecutors, although this is now thought to be a formality. If it is confirmed he could be moved to a nursing home.
He was pictured for the first time in 15 years on Thursday morning being driven to court, seatbelted in the back of a car and wearing a denim jacket.
Outside the court, Wagner said: “We were successful. It was a long hearing. He said once again how he regrets what he did. He was actually close to tears. In summary, the court came to the conclusion that my client is no longer considered to be dangerous.”
The electrical engineer was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2009 for the rape, incest and incarceration of his daughter, Elisabeth, and the seven children she had with him, one of whom was deemed by the court to have been killed by Fritzl, after he failed to get medical help for the child.
Wagner said earlier this month that a recent psychiatric report on Fritzl ruled he no longer posed a threat to society. A court could decide to move him to a normal prison. But Wagner said Fritzl, who has dementia, should be allowed to spend his remaining days in a care home. She said she had applied for his conditional discharge.
The case came to light in 2008, when Elisabeth managed to communicate with the police that he was holding her captive. Then 42, she said she had been held underground for 24 years and that previous to that, he had abused her from the age of 11.
Fritzl lured her into the cellar, built in the style of a cold war bunker sometimes found in Austrian homes, when she was 18. He told his wife and family acquaintances that she had run away to join a cult.
His crimes were first revealed when a child of Elisabeth’s became critically ill and he took them to hospital, where authorities appealed for their mother to come forward. He released her from the bunker to present herself to them and she managed to communicate her situation to authorities.
Fritzl is being held in a high-security unit for mentally disturbed patients in Stein prison in Krems, north-east Austria, not far from his former home in Amstetten.
Under Austrian law, prisoners are potentially eligible for conditional release after 15 years – in Fritzl’s case this would be 2023.
The Austrian psychiatrist Heidi Kastner, who in 2009 described Fritzl as “extremely psychologically abnormal” and “emotionally illiterate”, has come to the conclusion in a 28-page report that he is no longer dangerous. She described him as suffering from dementia, physically frail and in need of a walking frame to move about.
Wagner, who has visited Fritzl in prison 40 times, and in 2022 wrote a book about him called The Abysses of Josef F, said that based on the report she considered it legitimate to allow his release. “I would not be frightened of moving in with him in a flatshare arrangement, or to live alongside him in a care home. He no longer possesses a sex drive,” she said.
In an interview with the German tabloid Bild, she described how he spent his days watching television in his cell, sunning himself through the bars of his window, and exercising."
REFB803NB7_5T00XS2LY656PAU,Israel braces for interim ICJ ruling on allegation of genocide in Gaza,Bethan McKernan,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/25/israel-braces-for-interim-icj-ruling-on-allegation-of-genocide-in-gaza,"Israeli officials are bracing for an expected interim ruling from the international court of justice on South Africa’s allegation that the war in Gaza amounts to genocide against Palestinians, an emergency measure that could expose Israel to international sanctions.
The UN’s top court, which settles disputes between states, said on Wednesday that it would hand down its landmark ruling on Friday. The Hague-based body could order Israel to stop its three-month campaign in the Gaza Strip, sparked by the unprecedented attack by Hamas on 7 October. ICJ rulings are binding and cannot be appealed against, although the court has no power to enforce them.
South Africa filed a case against Israel before the court in December, alleging that the devastating offensive, which has killed 25,700 people, amounts to state-led genocide and stands in breach of the UN’s genocide convention, signed in 1948 as the world’s response to the Holocaust.
The full ruling is likely to take years, and the court is only looking at South Africa’s request for emergency measures to protect Palestinians from potential breaches of the convention on Friday. International legal experts believe an interim decision against Israel this week could serve as a pretext for sanctions.
Lawyers for South Africa alleged in their opening arguments in The Hague that Israel’s bombing campaign amounted to the “destruction of Palestinian life” and had pushed people to the brink of famine.
Israel has dismissed the allegations as “grossly distorted”, arguing it has a right to defend itself after the 7 October attack that killed 1,200 people, and that its offensive is targeting Hamas rather than the Palestinian people as a whole.
The Israeli government struck a bullish tone on Thursday, implying that it was confident that the world court would rule in its favour.
“We expect the ICJ to throw out these spurious and specious charges,” its spokesperson Eylon Levy told a press conference.
Earlier this month the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said: “No one will stop us, not The Hague, not the axis of evil and no one else.” He was referring to the Iran-aligned “axis of resistance” groups in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen.
The diplomatic bluster does not, however, correlate with the steps taken by top Israeli officials. Israel’s establishment, and much of the public, have long maintained that the UN and associated bodies are biased against the Jewish state, but the country has taken South Africa’s allegations seriously, sending a robust legal team to The Hague to defend its actions in Gaza.
Netanyahu held a meeting at the Kirya in Tel Aviv on Thursday afternoon to prepare for potential scenarios after the ICJ ruling, attended by the attorney-general, justice minister, strategic affairs minister and national security council director.
Israel also declassified documents on Thursday in an attempt to show it has taken steps to protect civilians and minimise civilian casualties in its Gaza operation.
South Africa’s case has been widely criticised in Israel, the state that rose from the ashes of the Holocaust. Many descendants of survivors cannot understand how their country could be accused of genocide.
Writing in Yedioth Ahronoth, a leading Israeli daily, the commentator Ben-Dror Yemini alleged on Thursday that South Africa had bought the ICJ case at Iran’s request after Tehran “provided generous funding to the governing party in South Africa”.
It is rare for the ICJ to issue emergency measures, although recent interim decisions have been handed down in cases involving Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Myanmar’s treatment of the Rohingya people.
Israel is facing two other major international legal cases over its treatment of Palestinians.
A 2022 UN general assembly resolution requested an advisory opinion from the ICJ on the “legal consequences arising from the policies and practices of Israel in the occupied Palestinian territory”, a move seen as important because while various UN bodies have found that aspects of the occupation are illegal, there has never been a judgment on whether the occupation itself, now in its 56th year, either is or has become unlawful.
The international criminal court also decided in 2021 that it had a mandate to investigate violence and war crimes committed by both Israel and Palestinian factions, although Israel is not a member of the court and does not recognise its authority.
This article was amended on 26 January 2024 to change the number of people killed in the 7 October attacks from 1,400 to 1,200, the figure given by the Israeli foreign ministry."
RFVR2NB15D_I3995CGSLWV58SD,Roger Rogerson: the ‘icon of the force’ who became the ‘best policeman money could buy’,Angus Fontaine,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/23/roger-rogerson-the-policing-hero-who-became-the-best-detective-money-could-buy,"If power corrupts, then Roger Caleb Rogerson – who died on Sunday aged 83 – proved that absolute power corrupts absolutely. The former New South Wales detective had a high IQ, epic courage, brilliant instincts for policing and a preternatural talent for manipulating people. Yet he came to embody evil at its most enigmatic for many, that most despicable figure in any civilised society: the officer sworn to serve and protect the public but who lies, cheats and murders.
“You could say I ruled by fear but that was just the reputation I acquired,” he once told me. “Truth is, I did better tricking crims into thinking that I was their mate. That was my edge. The fear fell away after a while and I ran on adrenaline. Battle and bloodshed became part and parcel of the job. For me it was never about civic duty, that ‘serve and protect’ shit. I was a cop and my job was to mix with dangerous offenders and solve underworld crime.”
Why Rogerson went from “icon of the force” to “best policeman money could buy”, few knew. But I came to know The Dodger a little in his later years when as a journalist I’d visit his home in Padstow, south-west of Sydney, chasing the truth of why a good cop went so rotten.
Born in Paddington in 1941, the first son of a Yorkshire boilermaker and Welsh soprano mother, Rogerson was raised on an acre lot in Sydney’s west with a brother and sister, three cows, six goats and an old mare named Bessie that he rode to Bankstown primary school. In the Bible, Caleb was a spy for Moses, but Rogerson was named for his grandfather, a bare-knuckle boxer. “He always told me: ‘Treat people properly. And don’t make a cunt of yourself.’”
As a boy, he built things – billy carts, soapbox racers, tandem bikes – then he took them apart. In 1958, age 17, that agile mind and industrious spirit took Rogerson to the police academy. His animal aptitude for the job was apparent from the get-go. Before he became “The Dodger” he was “The Boy Detective”, a prodigy. “If I knocked on your door, you had a problem. If you hit me, I hit back. Hard. If you shot at me, I shot back. Straight.”
By the time Rogerson won the Peter Mitchell award as most outstanding officer in 1980, after single-handedly arresting a gang for a series of bank hold-ups, he was at a crossroads. He had already shot three men in the line of duty by then. But in June 1981, he gunned down drug dealer Warren Lanfranchi in an inner-city laneway, stealing $15,000 in cash and loading him up with a defective pistol from 1900. All while 18 of his cop mates looked on.
One day I showed him a photo of that day, Rogerson standing over the body of his victim. “Victim?” he snarled. “He didn’t get shot because he was a victim. He got shot because he was a fucking scumbag druggie. His father was a gun dealer, his girlfriend was a drug addict. He got shot because he was wanted for five bank robberies and he’d tried to shoot a cop.” He later wrote on the photo: “Angus, don’t fuck up or this could happen to you. Roger.”
True, he was acquitted. But it was the point everyone knew Rogerson had gone truly rogue. Afternoon tabloids splashed with headlines such as “Man shot like dog, Rogerson at scene” and the nightly news was a dizzying maelstrom of foul deeds and accusations against him. For me, a kid, his name hit like a one-two punch from the fables. He was the white knight who wore black, a Jedi seduced to the dark side, a one-man wrecking ball for rough justice.
About the time I became a reporter and a decade after Rogerson was acquitted of conspiring to murder fellow detective Michael Drury, Blue Murder broke big. The 1995 ABC TV series written by Ian David and directed by Michael Jenkins told the machiavellian rise-and-fall stories of Rogerson, Drury and Neddy Smith, the career criminal and informant to whom Rogerson had granted a “green light” to break the law with his assistance to their mutual profit.
In 1999, I profiled actor Richard Roxburgh, whose gimlet gaze and cardigans had taken Roger global, and naively called Blue Murder a “love story”. Rogerson found me and rang, fuming. “We both played subterfuge but there was never a friendship,” he growled. I offered an olive branch in his preferred currencies – cold beer, free food, company and mild flattery.
Like an old gunslinger, Rogerson walked into the bar bow-legged. He was 63, his shooting shoulder was slumped after a fall from a ladder and the fists that had thumped phone books into crims to extract bruise-free confessions were so racked with arthritis, I had to help him cut up his steak. Afterwards, when I gave him a water pistol for a photoshoot, he calmly pointed it at me. Bang. Bang. Bang. All head shots. Even with a toy gun, he shot to kill.
“Roger was a good friend and a bad enemy,” Neddy Smith reckoned. “He was loyal, as long as it didn’t involve discomfort to him. I trusted him more than most would but I kept my guard up. But I never underestimated him for a second. He was a man who could turn on you in a flash. Our friendship was one of convenience. He used me to suit his own purposes.”
In time I realised he was using me – and the mastheads I represented – in much the same way. Last time we spoke he was heading back to jail and had sobbed into his hanky, scared. But regret or remorse? That really wasn’t Roger Rogerson’s style. He turned those ice blue eyes on me and my marrow ran cold. “I’ve got more commendations than most – sure, more convictions too – but when all is said and done, I look back and think: I wasn’t that bad.”"

The 35-year-old rugby union playmaker was charged after allegedly sexually assaulting and groping a 28-year-old woman who cannot be identified for legal reasons.
The alleged offences occurred at the Beach Road hotel near Bondi beach in December 2022.
Beale has pleaded not guilty to one count of sexual intercourse without consent and two counts of sexual touching.
A jury was empanelled in Sydney’s Downing Centre district court on Monday morning for a trial which is expected to take 10 days.

Crown prosecutor Jeff Tunks said it would be alleged Beale touched the complainant in the public bar before non-consensual oral intercourse took place in the cubicle of a men’s bathroom.
Beale’s barrister, Margaret Cunneen SC, told the jury panel some people in the community leapt to judge sportsmen accused of crimes.
“That’s not the sort of person who we need on our juries in this state,” she said.
Urging the jury to keep an open mind, Cunneen said the allegations against Beale had to be decided on the evidence that was presented.
CCTV footage to be played to the jury would appear at odds with some of the allegations against Beale, Cunneen said.

A helicopter of California highway patrol air operations airlifted the woman to shore as waters surged around her vehicle at a crossing in a park.
Harrowing footage posted online showed the woman being plucked from the car by a helicopter technician using a rescue harness. California highway patrol Golden Gate division air operations said on Facebook that the woman was taken to a hospital with minor injuries. Her name was not released.
Shaun Bouyea, a California highway patrol flight officer and paramedic, said it was remarkable that the woman survived the 15-hour ordeal.
“Climbing on top of the car saved her life,” he said.
Following recent rain in the area, the unexpected creek water levels overtook the woman’s car as she tried to cross the Del Valle creek around 7pm Monday in Livermore, a city about 35 miles (60km) east of San Francisco.
After the woman spent the night atop the vehicle, a person camping nearby spotted her the next morning and alerted the county fire department. The department then turned to the California highway patrol air operations for support. Several emergency agencies assisted in the rescue.
Firefighters had attempted to use their ladder truck to reach the woman until highway patrol air operations were able to send a helicopter to rescue her, said Cheryl Hurd, Alameda county fire department public affairs manager.
A San Ramon Valley fire department helicopter rescue technician landed on top of the vehicle and was able to harness the woman and take her to emergency responders waiting onshore.
Hurd said the woman had often made that crossing before but had underestimated the water levels that day.
Emergency crews had conducted a similar rescue on the same creek in 2012 after a man became stranded atop his vehicle."
RVFZLJ04WE_FAIGATRKI0NEJUM,Biden hits pause on natural gas projects amid plans for carbon ‘mega bombs’,Oliver Milman,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/26/biden-delays-cp2-louisiana-lng-export-project,"Joe Biden’s administration has hit the brakes on the US’s surging exports of gas, effectively pausing a string of planned projects that have been decried by environmentalists as carbon “mega bombs” that risk pushing the world further towards climate breakdown.
On Friday, the White House announced that it was pausing all pending export permits for liquified natural gas (LNG) until the Department of Energy could come up with an updated criteria for approvals that consider the impact of climate change.
The pause, which will likely last beyond November’s presidential election, could imperil the future of more than a dozen gas export terminals that have been planned for the Gulf of Mexico coast. According to one analysis, if all proposed LNG projects go ahead and ship gas overseas, it will result in 3.2bn tons of greenhouse gases – equivalent to the entire emissions of the European Union.
A vigorous campaign by climate activists and local residents has pressed Biden to curb the rapid growth of LNG exports, pointing to its contribution to global heating and the direct pollution suffered by surrounding communities.
The US president said the pause will allow his administration to “take a hard look at the impacts of LNG exports on energy costs, America’s energy security, and our environment”.
“This pause on new LNG approvals sees the climate crisis for what it is - the existential threat of our time,” Biden said, adding that Republicans who support ever-expanding fossil fuel infrastructure “wilfully deny the urgency of the climate crisis”.
The halt on permits isn’t absolute – the White House said exceptions would be made for “unanticipated and immediate national security emergencies” and that its allies in Europe will continue to receive the gas they need to help reduce dependence upon Russia, following its invasion of Ukraine.
But activists hailed the decision as a landmark victory that showed the climate crisis will no longer be ignored in previously routine decisions to allow oil and gas projects to proceed. “This announcement from the Biden administration is truly monumental for our communities,” said Roishetta Ozane, an activist in Louisiana, where much of the LNG buildout is happening.
“It is a powerful statement that we can no longer allow these industries to continue operating without considering the health and safety of the people living in these areas.”
Others vowed to continue pushing the Biden administration to go further. “This is a bold and important step from President Biden, but the fight is just beginning,” said Lukas Ross, climate and energy deputy director at Friends of the Earth. “The climate movement is in this fight for the long haul until the LNG boom is stopped dead in its tracks.”
The US started exporting gas only in 2016 but is now the largest such exporter in the world, with a boom of new export terminals and pipelines sprouting up on the Gulf of Mexico coast. A planned facility in Louisiana, called Calcasieu Pass 2 (or CP2), would be one of the largest in the world, shipping 24m tons of gas a year once built.
Supporters of the industry – including Donald Trump, who has vowed to “drill, baby drill” if elected again as president – contend the exports aid countries in Europe, create jobs and help displace coal, a dirtier fuel, as an energy source overseas. A coalition of oil and gas industry groups has written to the Biden administration to complain a pause would “only bolster Russian influence” and risk American jobs.
However, various analyses have shown much of the gas is not bound for European allies and that the surging exports have pushed up domestic gas prices for Americans. By some measure LNG can be seen as an even bigger carbon polluter than coal, a recent scientific paper argued, when leaking emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, from the drilling, transport and shipping of the commodity are taken into account.
Scientists warn that the simple arithmetic of emissions and the climate crisis means there are severe dangers associated with a new American boom in gas exports.
Last year was the hottest ever recorded globally, part of a trend of rising temperatures that could soon surpass the internationally-agreed limit of 1.5C warmer than pre-industrial times, unleashing ever-worsening heatwaves, floods, drought and other disasters.
“We are already very close to the 1.5C climate change limit, so we can only emit more CO2 if at the same time the fossil methane emissions are reduced drastically,” said Stefan Rahmstorf, a climate scientist at the University of Potsdam.
“Expanding LNG production would do just the opposite.”"

S08C5PE82P_I4AJRJYP6SX90N3,Trump takes aim at Haley in combative New Hampshire primary victory speech,Adam Gabbatt,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/23/trump-wins-new-hampshire-primary,"Donald Trump has won the New Hampshire primary, likely cementing his place as the Republican presidential nominee.
The win over Nikki Haley, who had briefly threatened to rein in the former president, suggests there will be a smooth path to the GOP nomination for Trump, who also won easily in the Iowa caucuses last week. Addressing supporters in Nashua, Trump took a victory lap with a combative speech that included sharp criticism of Haley.
“She had a very bad night,” Trump said. “She came in third [in Iowa], and she’s still hanging around.”
The Associated Press called the race just as the last remaining polling places in New Hampshire closed at 8pm ET, following a contentious primary that saw groups backing both candidates spending millions of dollars in increasingly vicious TV advertising.
Haley, who branded Trump a “chaos” candidate, promised a more palatable version of the rightwing fire and brimstone that has come to characterize the Republican party. She surged in the polls in New Hampshire in mid-December, but could not capitalize on that momentum on Tuesday night.
Despite her disappointing performance in New Hampshire, Haley insisted she would continue on to her home state of South Carolina, which will hold its Republican primary next month. As she spoke to supporters in Concord on Tuesday, Haley congratulated Trump on his victory in the first primary state, but emphasized the importance of upcoming races.
“New Hampshire is first in the nation. It is not the last in the nation,” Haley told supporters in Concord. “This race is far from over. There are dozens of states left to go, and the next one is my sweet state of South Carolina.”
But polls show Trump maintaining a significant lead in South Carolina, so it is unclear how that primary might reshape the dynamics of the race. New Hampshire appeared to represent the last significant threat to what seems set to become a Trump coronation. In a purple state that voted for Joe Biden over Trump in 2020, Haley presented herself as a centrist Republican, while Trump continued to proffer rightwing populism in a series of rallies in recent days. Haley was Trump’s only serious contender in New Hampshire, after Ron DeSantis dropped out of the race on Sunday.
As he addressed supporters, Trump derided Haley’s efforts to downplay her loss in New Hampshire, saying: “Let’s not have somebody take a victory when she had a very bad night.”

Trump’s team similarly ridiculed Haley’s decision to stay in the race after two decisive losses, with one of the former president’s strategists mocking her as “delusional”. Appearing undaunted, Haley stuck to her campaign message that Trump was incapable of leading the Republican party into a more promising future, referencing the former president’s numerous legal battles. Trump has now been charged with 91 felony counts across four criminal cases, and he spent much of the past week in court for a defamation case.

“With Donald Trump, you have one bout of chaos after another – this court case, that controversy, this tweet, that senior moment,” Haley said on Tuesday night. “You can’t fix Joe Biden’s chaos with Republican chaos.”
But Trump’s routine continues to appeal. Tina Lorenz, who said she had supported Donald Trump since 2016, was among those who voted for the former president on Tuesday.
“He is representing the American people. He is not out for himself. He’s not out for political gain. He’s not out for financial reasons. He doesn’t need money, he doesn’t need fame and fortune. He already has all of that,” Lorenz, 63, said.
“He is out there for the average person. And that’s what’s happening, we’ve become so polarized, that there’s nobody out there for just regular people.”
The result in New Hampshire suggests Trump will become his party’s presidential candidate for the third election in a row, and will likely face Biden in November. After Trump’s wins in Iowa and New Hampshire, more and more Republican lawmakers are lining up to endorse him. Speaking at Trump’s victory party on Tuesday, former presidential candidate Tim Scott, who dropped out of the primary race in November and endorsed the former president last week, called on Republicans to unify.
“It is time for the Republican party to coalesce around our nominee and the next president of United States: Donald Trump. Let’s get that party started tonight,” Scott said.
Despite Haley’s claims to the contrary, Democrats also clearly believe the Republican presidential primary is effectively over, and they are already turning their attention to the general election.
“Tonight’s results confirm Donald Trump has all but locked up the GOP nomination, and the election denying, anti-freedom Maga movement has completed its takeover of the Republican party,” said Julie Chavez Rodriguez, Biden’s campaign manager. “While we work toward November 2024, one thing is increasingly clear today: Donald Trump is headed straight into a general election matchup where he’ll face the only person to have ever beaten him at the ballot box: Joe Biden.”"
S5IROVWQ00_AWLA7JBEN2YOZXJ,‘The Lord told us to’: US pastor says he stole $1m from Christians to remodel home,Gloria Oladipo,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/23/us-pastor-1m-cryptocurrency-scheme-christians-denver,"A Colorado pastor who is charged with stealing more than $1m from his Christian community in a cryptocurrency scheme has admitted to the fraud but argued that God instructed him to carry it out.
Eli Regalado and his wife, Kaitlyn, are charged with creating and selling their cryptocurrency, known as “INDXcoin”, to Christians based in their home town of Denver, Colorado, allegedly telling would-be investors that the Lord had told him people would become rich if they invested, the state’s division of securities announced in a press release on Thursday.
But INDXcoin was “practically worthless” in reality, prosecutors said in the statement. Investors lost millions of dollars while the Regalados used their investments for lavish living.
In a video statement about the charges, Eli admitted that the couple had squandered $1.3m that was raised through cryptocurrency.
“The charges are that me and Kaitlyn pocketed $1.3m,” Regalado said in the video published to INDXcoin’s website on Friday. “I just wanted to come out and say those charges are true.”
Regalado added: “A few hundred thousand dollars went to a home remodel the Lord told us to do.
“We took God at his word and sold a cryptocurrency with no clear exit.”
Regalado added that the couple still believes that God will “work a miracle in the financial sector”.
In total, INDXcoin raised about $3.2m from more than 300 people between June 2022 and April 2023. The Regalados took at least $1.3m of that for personal, luxury purchases, including jewelry, an au pair and a pricey home renovation project.
The Regalados also pocketed at least $290,000 for their online-only church, Victorious Grace church, despite there being no physical location for it, BusinessDen reported.
The Regalados additionally had no experience with cryptocurrency. A third-party auditor also said the INDXcoin code had significant technical problems, but the Regalados continued to market the cryptocurrency as a low-risk, high-reward option.
Eli had claimed to investors that an amount of the raised money would be used to help widows and orphans. But those purported payments were also personally spent by the Regalados, the Denver Post reported.
“We allege that Mr Regalado took advantage of the trust and faith of his own Christian community and that he peddled outlandish promises of wealth to them when he sold them essentially worthless cryptocurrencies,” the Colorado securities commissioner, Tung Chan, said in Thursday’s statement, adding that consumers should remain “very skeptical”.
Civil fraud charges have been filed against the Regalados as prosecutors allege the couple violated several tenets of the Colorado Securities Act.
The couple is scheduled to appear in Denver state court in the coming days, NBC News reported.
The Regalados did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment.
Both INDXcoin and the Kingdom Wealth Exchange – where INDXcoin was exclusively available – were shut down on 1 November, BusinessDen reported."
S76Y9VHP0E_ZI3F9MISWIALSMK,EY Oceania accused of potential conflict of interest over government contracts on climate policy,Henry Belot,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/24/ey-oceania-accused-conflict-of-interest-australia-government-contracts-climate-policy,"Consultancy firm EY Oceania was supporting the oil and gas industry’s lobbying efforts while being paid by the federal government for independent advice on its signature climate policy and gas emissions.
The firm, which is a member of the oil and gas lobby and audits Santos, insists there was no conflict of interest between its work for industry and government. But a bipartisan group of politicians and transparency advocates is not convinced and has demanded more information.

In late October, EY Oceania was hired by Australian Energy Producers (AEP) to publish a report on the future of the gas industry. The 27 November report called for “ongoing investment in gas supply” and warned against a rapid transition away from gas.
EY Oceania was also hired to support AEP – formerly known as the Australian Petroleum Production & Exploration Association – and prepare a submission outlining concerns about the government’s future gas strategy, which was being developed by the industry department. The submission, also submitted on 27 November, frequently cited EY’s analysis and conclusions.
While EY was working for AEP, it was also contracted by the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW) to provide “analysis and advice on emission outputs for oil and gas facilities”, “analysis and advice under the safeguard mechanism” and “professional advice on market modelling services electricity”. These contracts were worth $510,000, according to government records.
The Albanese government’s safeguard mechanism aims to limit emissions from the country’s biggest industrial sites. This would impact many AEP members including Santos. EY did not tell the government it was a member of the AEP.
“There is no overlap of subject matter nor is there a risk of one EY team reviewing the work of another EY team,” the spokesperson said.
“When a conflict of interest exists, or arises during an engagement, we will disclose this to the client, which may result in EY declining to act, as required by professional standards.”
Despite claiming there was no conflict of interest, EY was required to sign a non-disclosure agreement while working on the safeguard mechanism and to submit written assurances about how internal conflicts would be managed with regard to staff and other engagements.
Greens MP Abigail Boyd, who is leading a NSW parliamentary inquiry into the consulting industry, was not convinced by EY’s assurances and said she would seek more detail when EY appears before the inquiry next month.
“Once again we have a consulting firm deploying a farcically narrow and self-serving definition of conflict of interest that simply doesn’t pass the pub test,” Boyd said.
“I’m putting EY on notice that I fully intend to interrogate this issue. The implications for government and public policy in this space are too grave for this issue to go un-interrogated.”
Labor senator Deborah O’Neill, who is a member of a federal inquiry into the industry, said she was concerned by firms advising government on policies that would affect the profitability of their private sector clients.

The chief executive of Transparency International, Clancy Moore, said there was “clearly a potential conflict of interest in this case”.
“It’s not a good look to have the government paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to a consultancy firm for independent advice on the oil and gas industry while the same firm is also on the payroll of the oil and gas industry,” Moore said.
“We would expect EY to have disclosed the conflict of interest and explained how they managed the conflict of interest to relevant stakeholders including the government.”
Doctors for the Environment Australia, a group of medical professionals who lobby the government on climate change, said EY should not have been hired by the department.
“It is deeply troubling that our government engages a consultancy firm to advise on mechanisms touted to reduce our reliance on gas when that same firm is also employed by the gas industry to provide advice on its ongoing expansion,” said the group’s executive director, Dr Kate Wylie.
A DCCEEW spokesperson said it hired EY “to provide specialist services and capability that that were not available in the department”.
Independent ACT senator David Pocock said there was “clear scope here for a serious conflict of interest” given EY’s taxpayer-funded contracts and “the work they were being paid for by the oil and gas lobby”."
S91EN7ENFK_3U5DN4AUQIYC5K3,Underpaid and overstretched: Essex yoga instructors ballot to strike over pay,Esther Addley,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/jan/24/underpaid-and-overstretched-essex-yoga-instructors-ballot-to-strike-over-pay,"To those who turn up in Lycra to practise their sun salutations and downward dogs, a yoga class can represent a moment of calm reflection. For a group of instructors in Colchester, however, teaching yoga has become a much more stressful business.
Yoga, pilates and aerobics instructors employed by Colchester city council are balloting on possible strike action, after what their union says is nearly a decade without a pay rise.
Unison says the 11 instructors, who work at the Leisure World complex and one other site, are paid considerably less than the private going rate and well below the pay level at neighbouring councils in Essex.
They say their hourly rate does not reflect the extra time it takes to prepare for sessions, set up, clear up and answer questions from class members – meaning more than two hours’ work goes into each session.
The yoga and pilates teachers’ rates have been stuck at £25 an hour since 2015, while neighbouring Tendring council pays £5 more, Unison says.
“It’s a wonderful community at Leisure World, and the people taking classes are so supportive of each other,” said Arlene, a yoga instructor who has worked for the council since 2016. “But I don’t even reach the minimum wage for the classes I teach, with all the preparation that goes into them.”
The instructors are unhappy that their pay is determined on a different scale to other local authority staff and say the council refused to review the yoga and pilates teachers’ hourly rates until last year.
When this was considered, in August 2023, senior managers offered no rise at all, while aerobics instructors rejected an offer of a £2.50 increase to their £22.50 hourly rate, according to Unison.“It doesn’t feel like we’re even considered to be working for the council,” said Arlene. “They’ve never increased the market rate. Everyone else in the building gets a pay rise, but we’re forgotten.”
The instructors “are bending over backwards to provide the best service they can”, said the Unison eastern area organiser, Emma Aboubaker. “But bosses can’t stretch to more than one pay rise a decade.
“Fitness instructors provide a vital service for the city’s public health, but they’re also bringing paying residents into leisure centres. They deserve a proper pay rise.”
The council’s chief executive, Pam Donnelly, said: “Like every resident and business in the UK, the cost-of-living crisis alongside the recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, rising energy costs and the current economic climate is placing an unprecedented pressure on local authority budgets, and Colchester city council is no exception.”
The council has improved its pay offer to the workers and hopes to reach a resolution, she said. Unison’s ballot closes on 1 February.
The UK’s estimated 10,000 yoga teachers are subject to the same pressures as other gig workers, according to the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB), which in 2021 established the first dedicated branch for yoga instructors.
“As is the case with many precarious industries, yoga teachers are atomised and individualised, leaving us vulnerable to exploitation,” said a spokesperson for the IWGB yoga teachers’ branch.
“Without proper protection that most workers would have, teachers are not only victims of inadequate pay and a lack of employment rights but also are vulnerable to sexual harassment and violence, without real reporting mechanisms and a fear of personal repercussions for speaking out against abuse.”"
S9W9MRGWNB_4068Y0L3YZQF6OE,Ex-post office operator claims she was told British Asians were often pushed into theft,Daniel Boffey,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/25/ex-post-office-operator-british-asian-theft,"A former post office operator has come forward claiming she was told British Asian women were often pushed into theft as auditors urged her to confess to stealing £30,000 – a charge of which she was later cleared.
Before her trial in 1997, it was allegedly suggested to Kuldeep Kaur Atwal, then 46, that her cultural background may have played a role in her criminality and that she was likely to receive a custodial sentence unless she admitted to stealing from her branch.
A jury at Coventry crown court was subsequently instructed by the judge, Richard Cole, to return a not guilty verdict due to lack of evidence but the Post Office went on to demand that Atwal pay the money she had been falsely accused of taking.
Atwal, a mother of three, whose husband, Gurpal Singh Atwal, was a teacher, was contractually obliged to make good on shortfalls and had to quickly sell her branch for a fraction of its market value to pay off the debt.
Speaking to the Guardian, Atwal said the auditor’s alleged comment had made her angry at the time but she had felt powerless to respond.
The Post Office apologised last year after a document was discovered in which operators were categorised as “negroid types”, “Chinese/Japanese types” and “dark-skinned European types”. Other victims have claimed that racism fuelled the prosecutions, with one claiming that he was told by a staff member that “all Indians are doing it”.
Atwal said: “Looking back, I feel like saying they were bullies, to be honest. I lost my job and everybody judges you. The Post Office was so strong – everybody feared them. I felt for my husband more than anything with all the staff, all the students, looking down on him.”
The accounting system Atwal had been using in her branch in Coventry was a predecessor to the infamous Horizon IT software built by Fujitsu, whose faulty returns have led to the wrongful conviction of more than 900 people.
However, internal documents seen by the Guardian suggest the Post Office had also been aware of “serious problems” with the earlier system, known as Capture, prompting a series of software upgrades.
One advisory note about Capture that circulated in September 1995 advised that users could continue with the latest software upgrade but the problems encountered were more significant than they had initially understood and branches risked “data corruption problems”. A “large number” of offices were said to have been affected.
Kevan Jones, the Labour MP who has been prominent in the campaign for the post office operators, said he had been contacted by a number of people who believed the pre-Horizon system led to paper shortfalls in their accounts and persecution.
He said: “What makes me angry is that the Post Office knew all along about the problems with Horizon, and now they are not coming clean about the pre-Horizon system. The Capture system was full of bugs and errors.”
A Post Office spokesperson said: “We take very seriously the concerns raised about cases from before the Horizon system was first rolled out in 1999. We are investigating, including specific cases brought to our attention.”
Atwal was accused of stealing the money over a period from July 1995 until November 1996, when Post Office auditors made a morning visit to the branch.

“It was not unusual but after a couple of hours they said this branch will be closed for the rest of the day so I started thinking, ‘What’s going on?’” Atwal, 73, recalled. “They kept asking me whether I had had any accounting problems and I said, ‘No’. There had been a couple of occasions where there had been discrepancies but that was a few years back.
“They said, ‘We are short of £30,000, do you suspect anyone?’ I said, ‘I don’t, no.’ They said in that case you are responsible for it. One of the auditors commented to me as they were questioning me that ‘It is quite common in your society that women come under pressure to take money on the side, they don’t tell the family. Is someone putting pressure on you?’
“He meant being an Asian woman that the culture is such that the rest of the family puts the pressure on the woman [leading to theft]. I said, ‘Don’t be silly’. I didn’t think much of the remark at the time but I was angry, to be honest.”
Atwal, who had run the post office branch since 1989 without incident, said she was asked repeatedly whether anyone else in the family was involved in the business and whether she trusted her part-time staff. “They had been working with me for so many years so I did trust them,” she said. It was allegedly suggested by the auditors that if she admitted to being at fault that she may be able to avoid the harshest sanctions.
Atwal was subsequently interviewed by Post Office investigators. “There was no support at all from the Post Office side, just accusation after accusation,” she said. “They kept on telling me to plead guilty, saying I would be treated leniently if I did. ‘You are otherwise definitely looking to a custodial sentence’, they said. I said, ‘I haven’t done anything, I won’t admit to it’”.
Atwal appeared at Coventry crown court in August 1997. After three days of evidence, the judge said the Post Office had failed to provide any evidence of any shortfall in the accounts of agencies and clients. “They all said they had no complaints,” Atwal said. “But after the case the Post Office still wanted the money. I had no choice.”"
SB16XKDDHQ_FCYT0R4IEOOIQGM,Philippines president sparks outcry for using presidential helicopter to see Coldplay concert,Rebecca Ratcliffe,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/22/philippines-president-coldplay-concert-in-helicopter-ferdinand-marcos-jr-response,"Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos Jr has been criticised for using a presidential helicopter to attend a Coldplay concert north of the capital Manila, bypassing the area’s notorious traffic jams.
On social media, many accused the president of wasting taxpayers’ money, and pointed out that the public has to endure Metro Manila’s infamous traffic daily while commuting.
The Presidential Security Group said the Philippine Arena had “experienced an unprecedented influx of 40,000 individuals eagerly attending a concert, resulting in unforeseen traffic complications along the route”.
The traffic situation posed “a potential threat to the security of our president”, it said.
However, activist Renato Reyes described the decision as “a grave insult to millions of Filipino commuters”, adding that Metro Manila has been ranked as having the worst traffic in a recent international survey. “We are faced with a debilitating mass transport crisis that has caused terrible traffic and nightmare commutes for ordinary folks,” he said.
During Coldplay’s show, frontman Chris Martin joked about the traffic in Manila, and thanked the audience for persevering: “We’ve seen some traffic. But I think you have the number one [traffic] in the world. Thank you for making the effort to come through all of that bullshit to be here,” he said.
The 2023 TomTom Traffic Index recently named Metro Manila as the slowest metro area in a survey of 387 cities across 55 countries. On average, it takes 25 minutes and 30 seconds to travel 10km (six miles) in the capital region, according to the index.
In a column for the Philippine Star, Ana Marie T Pamintuan wrote: “Perhaps the horrendous traffic that forced the first couple to take a helicopter will end the state of denial in the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority about the Philippine capital region having the worst traffic congestion among ‘metros’ in the world.”
For the older generations, the incident had revived memories of Marcos’ father and mother, Pamintuan wrote. The late dictator Marcos Sr ruled the Philippines for two decades, and the family, known for their extravagance, were accused of plundering billions of dollars.
Others pointed out that Marcos Jr’s mode of travel contrasted with Coldplay’s wider efforts to make their shows as low-carbon as possible. According to Coldplay’s website, it has started using renewable energy to power their shows, and electric vehicles and alternative fuels where possible.
“All the effort of Coldplay and their team in promoting sustainability while on tour, finding a way to make that work here in the Philippines, only for this asshole to fly in a chopper probably funded by… take a wild guess…,” wrote one user on X, suggesting it was publicly funded travel."
SEBEHUVCUY_4TZSAZPDC6NVFIM,Minister vows to end water firms’ pollution self-monitoring in England,Sandra Laville,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/24/minister-vows-to-end-uk-water-firms-pollution-self-monitoring,"The environment secretary has told water companies in England that they will no longer be able to monitor and report on pollution from their own treatment works.
Steve Barclay told the privatised industry he would put an end to operator self-monitoring in a toughening of the regulatory approach.
The system, which has been criticised for allowing water companies to “mark their own homework”, was introduced more than 10 years ago, ending the practice by which Environment Agency officials carried out all the testing of treatment works and sewage discharges.
Water companies were allowed to do their own testing of treated effluent to make sure it met the legal requirements of their permits, as well as monitoring their releases of raw sewage via storm overflows.
The Guardian revealed recently that the Environment Agency was failing to regularly audit water companies to check they are telling the truth about pollution and illegal sewage discharges. The agency is conducting a major criminal inquiry into suspected widespread illegal sewage dumping from treatment works.
Peter Hammond, who in evidence to MPs said that illegal sewage discharges by water companies were at least 10 times higher than monitoring figures suggest, has been calling for an end to operator self-monitoring for years, saying it is routinely abused.
He said: “If they are going to end operator self-monitoring, I would be very pleased. It could result in a major improvement in river ecology, but this is assuming it would be done properly and paid for by the water industry. Ending operator self-monitoring is one of the major changes I have been campaigning for. My research shows less than 50% of all treated sewage has ever been monitored for quality for decades because of operator self-monitoring.”
Hammond said the scale of monitoring required would need huge investment.
Sources in the water industry said Barclay told companies at a meeting this week that he was going to end operator self-monitoring. He gave no timescale or any indication that this would happen before the next general election.
Barclay is not the first Conservative minister to promise an end to the practice. Rebecca Pow, as an environment minister, promised to end operator self-monitoring three years ago, but no action was taken.
Steve Reed, the shadow environment secretary, said: “Labour has long demanded the end of self-monitoring of sewage discharges, which allows water companies to cover up what’s really going on. It’s astonishing it’s taken the government so long to act.

“Now the Tories have started to follow where Labour leads, they must go further and adopt our plan to ban bonuses for the water bosses responsible for illegal sewage dumping. If they do, they can count on our support.”
The Environment Agency lost the job of monitoring water companies during major cuts to the agency. The agency’s former chief executive, James Bevan, said he liked the system, telling MPs: “We have some quite sophisticated ways to check that data.”
A government spokesperson said: “The environment secretary has been clear that he wants to reduce the levels of self-monitoring that were introduced in 2009 by bringing in significantly more EA inspections and spot checks of water company asset, including through forced entry to sites.
“This is part of the government’s wider determination to hold companies to account – driving more investment, stronger regulation and tougher enforcement.”"
SEKRTJ6MG6_L6PYIRTELYOF85T,Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 700,_,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/24/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-700,"At least 18 people were killed and more than 130 wounded in massive Russian airstrikes on Ukraine on Tuesday, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said. The air raids mostly targeted the two largest cities: the capital, Kyiv, and Kharkiv in the east. Ukraine’s president said more than 200 sites were struck, including 139 dwellings.
Russia’s military is carrying out probing attacks with barrages of missiles and drones in an attempt to find weaknesses in Ukraine’s defences as US funding for security assistance is tied up in Congress, Celeste Wallander, a Pentagon assistant secretary of defence, has said.
The Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, said he had invited Sweden’s prime minister to visit and negotiate his country joining the Nato military alliance, a process that Hungary and Turkey have delayed. Turkey’s parliament, though, voted on Tuesday to accept Sweden as a Nato member.
Lloyd Austin, the US defence secretary, has made his first appearance since being hospitalised for cancer treatment – a stay he concealed from both the White House and Congress for several days. Austin spoke via video link at the opening of a meeting on military aid for Ukraine. “The security of the entire international community is on the line in Ukraine’s fight. I am more determined than ever to work with our allies and partners to support Ukraine and to get the job done,” Austin said.
Western allies aren’t supplying Ukraine with enough ammunition and air defence missiles, Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has said in an interview with German media. Russian attacks on Kyiv and Kharkiv on Tuesday “clearly show the need to provide more anti air defence systems, as well as more surface-to-air missiles”. As for the ground war, “insufficient quantities of artillery munitions has been a problem from the start”, he said.
Kuleba said he was still in talks with the German government about receiving Taurus cruise missiles, even after the lower house of the German parliament voted a week ago against delivering them. “We’ll never give up,” Kuleba said.
The finance minister of Germany has said it can’t keep up Ukraine’s defence capabilities on its own in the long term and that others will need to increase bilateral contributions.

SKABV2R1SE_V0TBTKXE1SJOMOU,"Madonna, two hours late to her own gig? Believe me, I’ve seen far worse",Simon Price,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/22/madonna-two-hours-late-guns-n-roses-pete-doherty-patience,"Last week, news broke that Madonna was being sued by two fans in New York who had bought tickets to a show at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn that didn’t begin until 10.30pm, two hours later than the advertised time, and didn’t end until about 1am.
The lawsuit from Michael Fellows and Jonathan Hadden included the argument that “many ticketholders who attended concerts on a weeknight had to get up early to go to work and/or take care of their family responsibilities the next day”. The story was greeted with eye-rolling in many quarters, with the sense that this was merely an instance of those crazy litigious Americans taking “where there’s blame, there’s a claim” culture to an absurd extreme. But while it remains to be seen how this case shakes down in court, I think Fellows and Hadden may have a point.
Some musicians see their job as a lifelong holiday from responsibility. Such lowly, quotidian concerns as having to work the next day, getting home in the middle of the night, or sorting out childcare are for the little people, too banal for renegade superstars to worry about. Turning up on time doesn’t go with the lifestyle: punctual isn’t punk. (Full disclosure: my own punctuality is poor. I’m not proud of that, and I don’t think it makes me rock’n’roll.)
But there are limits to an audience’s tolerance of that. Seasoned gig-goers will know the unspoken rule that 15 minutes are generally added to a stage time to make sure all bums are in seats. When it stretches beyond an hour, however, it tips over from artistic waywardness into outright disrespect.
The Madonna story takes place against the backdrop of a changing culture regarding late nights. Students and young people don’t drink the way they used to, and nor do the old. The nightclub industry has been hit hard by a reluctance to stay out till stupid o’clock. Earlier curfews are a growing trend: London’s legendary LGBTQ+ club Duckie recently ran a popular series of daytime events, and the actor Vicky McClure and her husband, the producer, actor and writer Jonny Owen, have attracted much attention for their afternoon club, Day Fever, in Sheffield.
However, audience dissatisfaction with tardy performers is nothing new. Axl Rose is notorious for his arrogance regarding timekeeping. In 2012, I attended a Guns N’ Roses gig in Newcastle at which he didn’t take the stage till 10.45pm, presumably too busy getting his cornrows braided and stuffing his face with pizza. He was booed on his arrival and by the time the show ended at 1.40am many fans had gone home.
I don’t blame them. I once left a secret Prince show at Bagley’s Warehouse in London at 4am, midway through an interminable muso funk jam. I couldn’t quite believe what I was doing – walking out on the GOAT – but I had to admit to myself that I was tired and bored. At least that gig didn’t pretend to be anything other than a very late-night session.
Lateness is one thing, but shows that are objectively awful are another complaint-worthy category. In 1995, I was present at what was wrongly billed as a Wu-Tang Clan show in Ilford that in reality involved Ol’ Dirty Bastard, unassisted by any other Clan members, mumbling listlessly over a CD. He made the mistake of staging an open-mic rap battle in which he was spectacularly owned by a local kid: “I paid £12.50 to get in this place/To see this shit it’s a fucking disgrace!”
Sometimes, of course, there are extenuating circumstances. The ropiness may be a symptom of a slowly unfolding tragedy. In 2007, I saw an Amy Winehouse show in Brighton that didn’t begin until 10.10pm, with rumours that she had been seen drinking on the beach beforehand. (The show, when it finally happened, was great.) And I was at the Birmingham NEC in 2010 when Whitney Houston, on her notorious Nothing But Love tour, gave a seemingly part-mimed performance that became a national scandal. We all know how that ended.
Other times, there’s no such excuse. The Oasis documentary Supersonic includes the story that Liam Gallagher somehow forgot that they were due to perform two nights at Knebworth in 1996, and partied so hard after the first one that he was barely able to function for the second.
Of course, slick professionalism can be dull. Sometimes, the most memorable shows are ragged around the edges. For example, Nicky Wire’s entertainingly shambolic, rosé-assisted solo performance at the Hay festival in 2006 is still recalled with fondness by Manic Street Preachers fans.
And a certain masochistic pleasure can kick in with hindsight. Attendance at sub-par shockers becomes a war story, a medal to wear. I was present at The Worst Gig Of All Time when the rump of The Stone Roses headlined Reading in 1996, featuring Ian Brown honking tunelessly – even by his foghorn standards. I’m weirdly glad that I saw it.
But in order for those things to happen, the band have to actually be there: I attended at least two Pete Doherty shows where he simply couldn’t be bothered.
What, then, do we want from performers? At a bare minimum, be there and actually perform. And, barring acts of God (as opposed to acts of make-up artist), show up at approximately the advertised time.

SL9CE3KMV4_2KXSTSDOGRUQC28,BHP and Vale ordered to pay $15bn in damages for 2015 Brazil dam collapse,_,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/26/brazil-dam-collapse-mariana-bhp-vale-samarco-15bn-damages-payout,"A Brazilian judge has ruled that mining companies Vale and BHP and their joint venture Samarco must pay 47.6bn reais (AU$14.7 bn) in damages for a 2015 tailings dam burst, according to a legal decision seen by Reuters.
Vale, a Brazilian company, and BHP, an Australian listed company, said in separate statements they were not informed by the judiciary about the decision.
Samarco declined to comment.
The dam collapse in the south-eastern city of Mariana caused a giant mudslide that killed 19 people and severely polluted the Rio Doce River, compromising the waterway to its outlet in the Atlantic Ocean.
In the decision, federal judge Vinicius Cobucci wrote the amount was fixed, taking as a parameter the value of expenses already acknowledged by the companies in repair and compensation actions.
He said the 47.6bn reais needed to be adjusted by monetary correction and late payment interest.
It was not immediately clear how much of the total stipulated in the sentence each company owes.
The judge wrote in the legal document that the money would be put in a state fund and used for projects and initiatives area affected by the dam collapse.
The companies can appeal the decision.
In the securities filing, Vale said the Renova Foundation, which the companies have been using to pay for some of the repairs, had paid until last December 34.7bn reais in socioeconomic and environmental compensation."
SNG2VDEP0S_5JIV8UTJHDUYWC9,US oil company ExxonMobil sues to block investors’ climate proposals,Alex Lawson,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/22/us-oil-company-exxonmobil-investors-climate-follow-this,"The US oil company ExxonMobil has filed a lawsuit to block a vote on a climate resolution brought by a green activist, in move that will be watched closely by fossil fuel companies worldwide.
The company hopes to stop investors voting on a motion put forward by Follow This, a Dutch green activist investor group, which called for Exxon to accelerate its attempts to cut greenhouse gas emissions.
The company filed the lawsuit at a US district court in Texas on Sunday, arguing that the proposal violates SEC investor petition rules. It asked the court to make a decision by 19 March, before its annual meeting on 29 May.
The move will be followed closely by other oil and gas companies and green groups, as environmental campaigners attempt to hold the world’s biggest fossil fuel companies to account for their emissions.
Follow This, which put the motion forward with the investment adviser Arjuna Capital, has registered motions at a series of oil companies’ annual general meetings for years, in a campaign to tighten their commitments to reducing their emissions.
Shell is facing a rebellion from investors that own about 5% of its shares over a Follow This resolution at this year’s AGM, after a chaotic meeting disrupted by green campaigners last year.
It is unclear whether Exxon also sent a “no action letter” to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the typical route taken by listed companies attempting to stop a vote on a resolution. The company has argued that the Follow This and Arjuna proposal breaks the US regulator’s rules designed to prevent shareholders being able to “micromanage” businesses’ decisions through proposals.
The SEC has come under pressure for allowing environmental groups to register too many motions at annual shareholder meetings, after it revoked policies adopted by the Donald Trump administration.
Last year, ExxonMobil announced it planned to reach net zero by 2050 for greenhouse gas emissions from its own operations.
In 2021, an activist hedge fund, Engine No 1, won three seats on Exxon’s board at its annual meeting after demanding it reduced its emissions more quickly.
An Exxon spokesperson said: “The breakdown of the shareholder proposal process, one that allows proponents to advance their agendas through a flood of proposals, does not serve the interests of investors.
“We are simply asking the court to apply the SEC’s proxy rules as written to stop this abuse and eliminate the significant resources required to address them.”

Mark van Baal, of Follow This, said: “With this remarkable step, ExxonMobil clearly wants to prevent shareholders using their rights. Apparently, the board fears shareholders will vote in favour of emissions reductions targets. We don’t know why ExxonMobil took this remarkable step.”
In the UK, ExxonMobil’s subsidiary Esso Petroleum Company (EPC) owns the Fawley oil refinery in Hampshire as well as a fuel distribution business. There are 1,200 Esso branded forecourts in the UK, of which 197 are company owned.
Accounts filed at Companies House this month showed EPC’s pre-tax profits surged from £150m in 2021 to £864m, while turnover more than doubled, from £6.3bn to £13.7bn.
The group’s UK operations paid a £440m dividend to its US parent in September 2023, the accounts show.
“Turnover was significantly higher due to the economic recovery after the Covid-19 pandemic, driving up both volumes and prices,” the directors said.
EPC’s gross emissions in 2022 increased by more than 5% to 2.81m tonnes of CO2 equivalent, up from 2.66m in 2021."
SSYIK11VH8_V9PN9AYZPWRWFV5,"Fresh US/UK airstrikes ‘send clear message’ to Houthis, says Cameron",Ben Quinn,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/jan/23/us-uk-airstrikes-houthis-yemen-cameron,"A fresh set of US and UK airstrikes against Houthi targets in Yemen were intended to “send the clearest possible message that Britain backs its words and our warnings with action”, David Cameron has said.
The foreign secretary insisted he was confident that attacks carried out 10 days ago by Britain and the US had had an effect on degrading the Houthis’ abilities to attack shipping in the Red Sea.
“Since we last took action 10 days ago, there have been over 12 attacks on shipping by the Houthis in the Red Sea,” he told the BBC.
“These attacks are illegal, they are unacceptable. What we have done again is send the clearest possible message that we will continue to degrade their ability to carry out these attacks while sending the clearest possible message that we back our words and our warnings with action.”
However, unlike the previous strikes by the US and UK, with support from allies, the British government had failed to brief the opposition, the Labour party has said. Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker of the House of Commons, was also not consulted on this occasion, it is understood.
Karin Smyth, a shadow health minister, said Labour had not been briefed ahead of fresh allied strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen.
Speaking to GB News, she said: “We don’t know why the government haven’t spoken to us on the usual terms. We would expect them to do that. We would certainly expect a statement by the prime minister today in parliament, so we will await developments on that.”
Starmer and the Commons speaker were consulted 10 days ago in their roles as members of the privy council, but it is understood that this did not happen this time.
Rishi Sunak is expected to make a statement to parliament on Tuesday, where Labour will press for further details of the government’s strategy and a summary of the legal advice that was drawn on before the strikes went ahead.
The Liberal Democrats accused the government of again “bypassing” MPs as the UK joined US military action.
“Liberal Democrats are concerned about the Houthis’ attacks in the Red Sea and so we support the case for limited strikes, so long as they remain limited,” said the party’s leader, Ed Davey.
“However, it is absolutely vital that parliament has an opportunity to have its say, via a debate and a vote. The prime minister has so far failed to grant either. It is deeply disappointing that elected representatives are being bypassed on an issue as important as military action.”
Sunak was criticised 10 days ago for not informing parliament before airstrikes were carried out.
Huw Merriman, a transport minister, insisted during an interview on Sky News that this had not been the case.
“The leader of the opposition and the speaker were given that information. My understand is that that information was conveyed, which is what I have been told,” added Merriman, who said the government was not ruling out further strikes.
The US and UK said they had conducted “an additional round of proportionate and necessary strikes” against eight Houthi targets, with the support of Australia, Bahrain, Canada and the Netherlands.
The number of targets is considerably lower than the 60 struck in the first air raids on Yemen made by the two countries 10 days earlier, while their effect and the number of casualties caused is uncertain.
The latest raid marks the eighth time the US has conducted strikes on Houthi targets this months and the second time that the UK has participated."
SW5LEMYWA2_L0M5NE88TY882UI,Jimmy Lai: UN experts call for release of Hong Kong newspaper founder,_,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/23/jimmy-lai-un-call-for-release-charges-dropped-hong-kong-updates,"Four UN experts have called for all charges against pro-democracy Hong Kong tycoon Jimmy Lai to be dropped, as they pressed for his immediate release.
“Jimmy Lai’s arrest, detention and series of criminal proceedings over the past few years appear to be directly related to his criticism of the Chinese government and his support for democracy in Hong Kong,” the UN experts said.
The statement was penned by the special rapporteurs on freedom of expression, on freedom of association, on degrading treatment or punishment and on the independence of judges and lawyers.
Special rapporteurs are unpaid experts who are appointed by the UN Human Rights Council. They do not speak on behalf of the United Nations.
Lai pleaded not guilty on 2 January to “sedition” and “collusion” charges in a high-profile national security trial that could see him jailed for life.
The charges against Lai – founder of the now-shuttered popular Chinese-language tabloid Apple Daily – revolve around the newspaper’s publications, which supported pro-democracy protests and criticised Beijing’s leadership.
The announcement from the UN experts came a day before China faces a regular review of its human rights record at the UN in Geneva, with a crackdown on rights in Hong Kong among the issues expected to be raised.
“We are alarmed by the multiple and serious violations of Jimmy Lai’s freedom of expression, peaceful assembly, and association, and his right to a fair trial, including the denial of access to a lawyer of his own choosing and the handpicking of judges by the authorities,” the experts said.
Lai’s trial, which began in late 2023 after he was jailed for more than 1,100 days, is being closely watched as a barometer of Hong Kong’s political freedoms and judicial independence.
His case has drawn widespread condemnation from the international community but Beijing has dismissed the criticism as interference.
A rags-to-riches figure who made his fortune selling clothes before expanding into media, Lai, 76, will be tried without a jury and has been denied his first choice of lawyer.
The British citizen is accused of “collusion” with foreign forces under sweeping national security legislation that Beijing imposed on Hong Kong in 2020.
“We expressed our concerns about the National Security Law before it was enacted and will continue to do so, as we believe it is not in line with international legal obligations,” the UN experts said.
Critics say the law has curtailed civil liberties, silenced dissent and eroded the judicial independence that once attracted foreign businesses to the city."
SX6ZLH84VG_29066MHGDVRC3TD,Sunak’s plan to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda receives first parliamentary defeat,Rajeev Syal,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/22/sunaks-plan-to-deport-asylum-seekers-to-rwanda-receives-first-parliamentary-defeat,"Rishi Sunak’s plan to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda received its first parliamentary defeat on Monday after peers backed calls for protections to be introduced before any flights take off.
The House of Lords voted for a motion that sought to delay ratification of the new Rwanda treaty until the government can show the country is safe.
The vote on Monday night, by 214 votes to 171, was an unprecedented move seeking to pause implementation of the deal that paves the way for the asylum scheme.
Under the terms of the safety of Rwanda bill, the law will not come into force until the treaty is ratified.
The bill was passed by the Commons last week but it followed a Tory row that damaged the prime minister’s authority.
Downing Street has insisted that flights to Rwanda will not be delayed by the Lords vote and had warned peers prior to the vote that a failure to pass the legislation would be an attack on the “will of the people”.
Peers were debating a report from the House of Lords international agreements committee (IAC), which spearheaded the unprecedented move to delay the treaty.
James Cleverly, the home secretary, signed the legally binding pact with Kigali in December, saying it addressed concerns raised by the supreme court about the possibility of asylum seekers deported to Rwanda then being transferred to a country where they could be at risk.
But the cross-party Lords committee said promised safeguards in the treaty are “incomplete” and must be implemented before it can be endorsed.
Labour peer, Lord Goldsmith, who chaired the committee, told the upper house that the report identified at least 10 issues where “significant additional legal and practical steps” must be implemented to ensure the safety of asylum seekers.
He said: “We are not saying the treaty should never be ratified but we are saying that parliament should have the opportunity to scrutinise the treaty and its implementing measures in full before it makes a judgment that Rwanda is safe.”
Conservative former cabinet minister, Lord Howell, criticised the “rather patronising tone one hears in some comments about Rwanda and its judiciary and legal system as though it could not possibly have high enough standards”.
Pointing out the country has recently become a Commonwealth member, he said: “I can understand the Rwandan government’s exasperation and that of senior legal figures at the implication that their system somehow has got to be reinforced, made over and renewed to bring it up to scratch and be called safe.”
But another Tory peer, Lord Balfe, said he could not think of “any country in Africa that I would wish to go and live in”.
The motion received support from Labour and the Lib Dems, as well as crossbench peers and some on the “one nation” wing of the Conservative party.
It is the first time that the Lords has approved a motion to delay ratification of an international treaty since legislation was introduced in 2010. Lord Sharpe of Epsom, the Home Office minister who responded to the debate, accused Labour peers of “using the House of Lords to frustrate our plans to stop the boats”.
Downing Street has played down the significance of the vote. Speaking before the Lords motion, the prime minister’s spokesperson said it would not delay any flights for Rwanda.
“My understanding is that if the motion was successful it would simply require the government to layer [the legislation] with an oral statement and wouldn’t impact on the timelines for getting flights off the ground,” they said.
Baroness Shami Chakrabarti, the Labour peer and barrister, said the vote was a major blow to the government’s plan: “Mr Sunak’s dog whistle will be muted or at least delayed. Today’s debate has been crucial.”
A Labour spokesperson said: “This is a cross-party amendment with support from across the House of Lords which simply asks the government to properly implement the standards and safeguards over the Rwanda treaty that they are in theory committed to. It is fundamentally untrue to say that this measure blocks anything, they should stop blaming everyone else for their chaos.”
Leader of the Liberal Democrats in the House of Lords, Dick Newby, said: “Tonight has delivered yet another blow to Rishi Sunak and his failing Rwanda scheme.
“From day one, this policy has been a totally unworkable waste of time and money. Yet the Conservatives are obsessed with pushing it forward, no matter what evidence arises to the contrary.
“The government should now accept reality and move on from this white elephant of a policy.”"
SZXF3EEV2X_EDC9K1IROSJDNG0,EU plan for medicine stockpile could worsen UK’s record shortages,Denis Campbell,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/jan/25/eu-plan-medicine-stockpile-uk-record-shortages,"The EU is to stockpile key medicines that will worsen the record drug shortages in the UK, with experts warning that the country could be left “behind in the queue”.
The EU is seeking to safeguard its supplies by switching to a system in which its 27 members work together to secure reliable supplies of 200 commonly used medications, such as antibiotics, painkillers and vaccines.
But the bloc’s move to insulate itself from growing drug shortages threatens to exacerbate the increasing scarcity of medicines facing the NHS, posing serious problems for doctors.
“Europe is securing access to key drugs and vaccines as a single region, with huge influence and buying power. As a result of Brexit the UK is now isolated from this system, so our drug supplies could be at risk in the future,” said Dr Andrew Hill, an expert on the pharmaceutical trade.
Britain is experiencing a record level of drug shortages, with more than 100 – including treatments for cancer, type 2 diabetes and motor neurone disease – scarce or impossible to obtain.
Mark Dayan, the Brexit programme lead at the Nuffield Trust health thinktank, said the EU’s decision to act as a buying cartel could seriously disadvantage Britain.
“There is a real risk that measures in such a large neighbour, which is now a separate market due to Brexit, will leave the UK behind in the queue when shortages strike,” Dayan said.
“The EU has been scoping out buying more medicine jointly, starting with action on antibiotics next winter.
It also has an initiative for member states to transfer stocks of medicine to cover shortages in others. These measures could shut UK purchasers out in certain scenarios.
“This would risk worsening shortages from a starting point where they are already exceptionally severe for the UK and other countries, with a mounting impact in terms of costs and wasted time for the NHS, and in terms of patients struggling to get what their doctors have said they need.”
The European Medicines Agency, which Britain belonged to and hosted in London before Brexit, has said that the drugs on its “list of critical medicines … will be prioritised for EU-wide actions to strengthen their supply chains and minimise the risk of supply disruptions”. It defines a drug as “critical” based on the seriousness of the disease and whether there are alternative medicines doctors can offer in the event of a shortage. The EU plans to expand the list to cover a wider range of drugs.
Several factors make Britain less attractive than the EU to the pharmaceutical trade, Hill said.
“The UK has additional regulations, higher taxes and is a much smaller country to work with than the European region. Those are all disincentives for drug manufacturers to supply to the UK, a country of 66 million people, when they have a much bigger market of [450 million] nearby that is eager to secure their products.”
The UK should protect its access to drugs by working more closely with the EU on medication supply, in the way it already does on defence, policing and higher education, Hill said.
The EU is also considering offering drug companies incentives to build new manufacturing plants as part of its response to global scarcities caused by events such as the Russia-Ukraine war.
Several European countries, including France, plan to expand drug production within their borders to reduce their reliance on India and China.

Mark Samuels, the chief executive of the British Generic Manufacturers Association, which represents generic drugmakers, said the government’s recent decision to increase the amount it claws back from manufacturers of generic drugs, if their sales exceed an agreed level, risked turning some products into loss-makers that would become uneconomic to bring into the UK.
Without a government strategy to bolster British production of generic medicines – which comprise 80% of the drugs the NHS uses – “we will see the supply problems become even worse”, given the EU’s concerted action to ensure its own supplies, Samuels said.
But the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, which represents drug companies in the UK, denied the EU’s moves would necessarily worsen shortages in Britain.
David Watson, its director of patient access, said: “We recognise that, for a wide range of reasons, shortages do happen, and that we need to continue to work across borders to prevent and manage them for patients. We have no reason to think that the EU’s latest policies will adversely impact this ongoing challenge.
“The UK has its own well-rehearsed procedures in place to safeguard essential medicine stocks, working with companies.”
The Liberal Democrats’ health spokesperson, Daisy Cooper, said: “We need immediate action to address these drug shortages that are causing havoc for people who rely on these medications. This Conservative government does not seem to be taking this seriously at all, despite the devastating impact this is having on people’s lives.
“The government has questions to answer about whether their dogmatic approach to relations with our European allies is about to cause further misery for ordinary people.”
The Department of Health and Social Care was approached for comment."
T2E90FMWFT_IWK72WN5TLOTVCF,"Erwin James, former Guardian prison columnist, dies aged 66",Jem Bartholomew,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/jan/23/erwin-james-former-guardian-prison-columnist-dies,"Erwin James, the writer of an influential Guardian column about life in prison who would go on to be a leading voice on criminal justice, has died.
James, real name Erwin James Monahan, was convicted of murder in 1984 and served 20 years in prison.
He wrote the Guardian column, A Life Inside, from 2000 until his release in 2004, and continued to write extensively for the newspaper afterwards, offering a glimpse of the reality of life behind bars and the challenge faced by those trying to build a rehabilitated life after it.
The first such column of its kind in the UK, it won him unlikely admirers including the former Conservative minister Jonathan Aitken, himself a convicted criminal, and was credited with inspiring a generation of prison reform campaigners.
He was the author of three books, including a memoir, Redeemable: A Memoir of Darkness and Hope, published in 2016, which detailed his troubled childhood and life in the Foreign Legion while on the run from his crimes, as well as his years in prison.
That year he became the editor of Inside Time, the prisons newspaper, which he had described as his “dream job”, continuing in the role until 2023.
James died suddenly at his home in Devon on 19 January, leaving his wife, Margaret, his sister and two daughters. He was 66.
The Prisons Reform Trust, of which he was a former trustee, described him as “a man of deep intelligence, humility and warmth”.
Ian Katz, now the chief content officer at Channel 4, who as Guardian features editor first commissioned James to write for G2, said: “Jim was an acute observer of people and gifted writer who offered us a rare, humane – and frequently hilarious – insight into life inside the prison system.
“He was also something still rarer – physical embodiment of the possibility that even people who have done the most terrible things can turn their lives around in prison and earn a second chance at life.
“Jim put his second chance to extraordinary account – he challenged our assumptions not just about the prison system but about those who commit the most heinous crimes. He was generous, open, funny, vulnerable and will be greatly missed.”
Writing on X, Alan Rusbridger, the former Guardian editor, called his death “a big loss”, saying: “Erwin James wrote a really remarkable column from prison for the Guardian, full of humanity and insights into life inside, and the purpose of prison – in theory and in practice.”
The prisons campaigner Mark Leech said James was a “hugely talented man”, adding: “He did so much to highlight the plight of prisoners and will be greatly missed.”
John Roberts, the publisher and director of Inside Time, said: “We shall be forever grateful to Erwin for his contribution to the success of Inside Time during his time as editor, and he will be missed.”
In 1984, aged 28, James was sentenced to life alongside another man for murdering Greville Hallam, a theatrical agent, and Angus Cochrane, a solicitor. Hallam, 48, was robbed and strangled in his north London home in September 1982. Cochrane, 29, died after being mugged in the West End three months later.
James wrote in 2009: “I can only express my heartfelt sorrow for what I did. My behaviour was unforgivable and I seek no forgiveness now.”
In prison, where James would later write that inmates “exist on dreams, nightmares and fantasies”, he found that reading and writing were crucial to his survival.
“Locked in my cell for 23 hours a day with few apparent skills or abilities, and almost insurmountable failings to overcome – my prospects were bleak,” he wrote. So he devoured paperbacks from the prison library, studied for an Open University degree and began to write.
“I involved myself in writing groups, helped to publish prison magazines, wrote letters to newspapers. While my role as camp scribe flourished, I indulged in another fantasy. If my life had been different, perhaps I could have been a writer, maybe a journalist,” he wrote.
His first article was published in the Independent in 1994. Then, in 1998, he began speaking to the Guardian, eventually being commissioned to write what became A Life Inside in 2000.
After his release in 2004, he worked as a writer and became a trustee of the Prison Reform Trust and the Alternatives to Violence Project. He was a consultant to Iain Duncan Smith MP on prisoner rehabilitation and a commissioner on the panel of the Westminster Commission on Miscarriages of Justice, as well as a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts (RSA) and patron of several charities.
On becoming a full-time writer, James grappled with the knotty issues of what it meant to achieve success after his crimes.
“Words are insufficient to express how sorry I am for the pain I have caused – and I know that my ‘success’ is still painful for at least some of those people,” he wrote in 2015. “When I went to prison for life I was a damaged, ignorant brute.”
He said learning and knowledge had helped open him up to an alternative future, furnishing him with a sincere belief in the power of rehabilitation and a second chance for people formerly incarcerated.
“Hand on heart, I know that most of the people I served alongside had the desire to change and live crime-free lives,” James wrote.
“For some, the problems and issues they faced were so deep-rooted that progress was unlikely. But in the right environment and with the right attitude from government and society in general, rehabilitation was achievable for the majority.”"
T2KRYAM34K_29AFCWUEA9A6L1D,Ex-Trump adviser Peter Navarro sentenced to four months in prison,Hugo Lowell,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/25/peter-navarro-contempt-congress-trump-ex-adviser,"Peter Navarro, a top former Trump administration official, was sentenced to four months in federal prison and fined $9,500 after he was convicted of contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with a subpoena issued by the House select committee that investigated the January 6 Capitol attack.
The sentence imposed by Amit Mehta in federal district court in Washington was lighter than what prosecutors recommended but tracked the four-month jail term handed to former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, who was similarly convicted for ignoring the panel’s subpoena.
“You are not a victim, you are not the object of a political prosecution,” the US district judge said from the bench. “These are circumstances of your own making.”
Navarro, 74, was found guilty in September of two counts of contempt of Congress after he refused to produce documents and testimony in the congressional investigation into the Capitol attack, claiming that executive privilege protections meant he did not have to cooperate.
The committee took a special interest in Navarro because of his proximity to Trump and his involvement in a series of efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election, including to have members of Congress throw out the results in a plot he named “the Green Bay Sweep”.
But Navarro’s subpoena defiance prompted a criminal referral to the US attorney’s office for the District of Columbia, which brought the charges and ultimately asked for six months in jail because he brazenly ignored the subpoena even after being told executive privilege would not apply.
“He cloaked his bad-faith strategy of defiance and contempt behind baseless, unfounded invocations of executive privilege and immunity that could not and would never apply to his situation,” prosecutors wrote of Navarro in their sentencing memorandum.
Within hours after the judge handed down the sentence, Navarro’s lawyers John Rowley and Stanley Woodward filed a notice of appeal to the US court of appeals for the DC circuit. As with Bannon, Navarro is expected to have his punishment deferred pending appeal.
Navarro’s lawyers had asked for probation, saying the judge himself seemed to acknowledge at one point that Navarro genuinely believed Trump had invoked executive privilege, a separation-of-powers protection aimed at ensuring White House deliberations can be shielded from Congress.
The privilege, however, is not absolute or all-encompassing. The January 6 committee had sought both White House and non-White House material, the latter of which would not be included, and the judge concluded in any case at a hearing that Trump had never formally invoked the privilege.
Regardless of what Navarro may have believed, the judge found, he failed to prove the existence of a conversation or communication from Trump that explicitly instructed Navarro not to cooperate with the January 6 committee’s subpoena specifically.
That proved to be the central problem for Navarro.

Before charging Navarro, prosecutors decided not to bring charges against two other Trump White House officials – Mark Meadows, the former chief of staff , and Dan Scavino, former deputy chief – even though they also did not cooperate with the January 6 committee and were referred for contempt.
The difference with Meadows and Scavino, as the record later appeared to show, was that they had received letters from a Trump lawyer directing them not to respond to subpoena requests from the panel on executive privilege grounds.
Navarro received a similar letter from Trump directing him not to comply with a subpoena from around the same time issued by the House committee that investigated the Covid pandemic. But he was unable to produce an invocation with respect to the later January 6 committee.
“Had the president issued a similar letter to the defendant, the record here would look very different,” the judge said at a hearing last year.
The January 6 committee completed its work last January, writing in its final report that Trump criminally engaged in a “multi-part conspiracy” to overturn the results of the 2020 election, conspiring to obstruct Congress and conspiring to defraud the United States.
Last year, the US justice department charged Trump on four criminal counts related to his efforts to reverse his 2020 election defeat and impede the transfer of power. Trump was also charged in Georgia for violating the state’s racketeering statute for election interference efforts there."
T55TLQBM0I_EC7MUTB7SCY7ZOV,Man found dead with three others in Norfolk had called 999 over mental state,Matthew Weaver,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/23/four-found-dead-in-house-in-norfolk-named-by-police,"A man who was found dead in his home near Norwich along with three others was told to seek medical advice when he expressed concern about his mental state in a 999 call earlier that morning, the police watchdog has revealed.
The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) announced on Tuesday that it has launched an investigation into Norfolk constabulary’s prior contact with the man, and its failure to respond to a call before the deaths last Friday.
The force, which has referred itself to the watchdog, provisionally identified the man, woman and two young girls who died as Bartlomiej Kuczynski, 45, Kanticha Sukpengpanao, 36, Jasmin Kuczynska, 12, and Natasha Kuczynska, nine.
Announcing its investigation, the IOPC regional director, Charmaine Arbouin, said: “Norfolk constabulary established that the man had made a 999 call to the force shortly before 6am on 19 January. During that call the man expressed concerns for his own mental state saying he was confused. He was advised to seek medical advice and police did not attend.”
Arbouin added that an hour later the force did respond to a call from a dog walker who expressed concerns for the welfare of those inside the house.
When officers forced entry at 7.15am they found the four bodies, she confirmed.
Arbouin said: “Following a mandatory referral from the force we have decided to investigate and will be examining if the force’s handling of the contact they had with the man was appropriate and in line with force policy, training and procedures.”
The IOPC said it would be making contact with the families of the deceased to explain its role. Arbouin said: “Our sympathies are with the families and friends of the deceased and all those affected by this incident.”
The Norfolk police force has also referred itself to the IOPC in relation to previous contact at the address on 14 December, which was in relation to a missing person inquiry.
On Monday, the force’s chief constable, Paul Sanford, asked His Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services, which is already carrying out a routine inspection of Norfolk police, to conduct a “deeper review” into his force.
Police are not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths.
Postmortems carried out on Sunday found the man died of a stab wound to the neck, while the woman died of a number of stab wounds to the neck.
The bodies of the two girls will be examined on Wednesday.
Detectives said the man and two children lived at the address, but the woman was visiting and lived elsewhere."
T5NTDH1WTW_51WA7RBDH1755OF,"Cookstove carbon offsets overstate climate benefit by 1,000%, study finds",Patrick Greenfield,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/23/clean-cookstove-carbon-offsets-overstate-climate-benefit-by-1000-percent,"Clean cookstove projects, one of the most popular types of carbon-offset schemes, are probably overstating their beneficial impact on the climate by an average of 1,000%, according to a new study.
Every year, an estimated 3.2 million people die prematurely from household air pollution caused by cooking with smoky fuels such as wood, paraffin or kerosene, which produce about 2% of global greenhouse gas emissions.
Such cooking also drives deforestation and habitat loss, as people cut down trees for fuel. By switching from smoky fuels to cleaner alternatives such as electric cookers, cookstove projects in the developing world can have major health, social and environmental benefits: improving air quality, reducing the amount of time people spend collecting wood and slowing the loss of the world’s forests.
To fund these initiatives, which are often dubbed “nature-based-solutions”, projects sell on the greenhouse gas reductions as carbon credits. Each credit represents a tonne of carbon dioxide – which companies then use to “offset” their emissions, sometimes claiming their products and services are “carbon neutral”.
Improving access to clean cooking facilities features in the UN sustainable development goals, and cookstove-based credits have been on the rise. From May to November last year, figures from the Berkeley Carbon Trading Project show cookstove projects issued the most new credits in the market, comprising about 15% of the total. They also registered the most new projects.
But a new study published in the journal Nature Sustainability has found that cookstove projects that generate carbon offsets are overstating their climate benefits by 1,000% on average.
The findings have been disputed by Verra and Gold Standard, both leading certifiers of carbon credits, which say the evidence in the study does not back the conclusions drawn.
While many offsetting schemes said they were funding “clean” cookstoves, most did not meet World Health Organization standards, according to the assessment by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley.
Analysis of common rules to produce the offsets found that projects were allowed to overstate how often people used the stoves and the resulting benefits for nearby forests, dramatically inflating the benefit to the climate and biodiversity, researchers said.
The findings draw on previous research on the impact of cookstove schemes by development economists, who found they often failed to produce their potential benefits in practice.
Despite the problems, the researchers said the rules on producing carbon credits could be reformed to provide a meaningful source of climate finance that companies could trust. They offer a method that clean cookstove projects can use to avoid overstating their impact, which some of the cookstove companies have already adopted while the paper has been in peer-review.
The lead author, Annelise Gill-Wiehl, a PhD student at the University of California, Berkeley, said: “Comprehensively assessing the five major cookstove offset methodologies, we find that our sample of 40% of the market is 9.2 times over-credited. Extrapolating to the entire market, we find roughly 10 times over-crediting.
“Over-crediting replaces direct emission reduction and other more effective climate mitigation activities, even if some reduction is achieved. Lack of trust weakens the market,” she said.
The study comes amid intense scrutiny of the unregulated voluntary carbon market, with concerns that many schemes are producing huge amounts of worthless carbon offsets.
Barbara Haya, director of the Berkeley Carbon Trading Project, who has been researching carbon credits for 20 years and is co-author of the study, said researchers hoped the quality of credits could be improved.
“A carbon credit market built on exaggerations is destined to fail. Our hope is that the specific recommendations we offer can help make clean cookstoves a trusted source of quality carbon credits,” she said.
Gold Standard, a major carbon credit certifier, disputed the findings of the study. The researchers found that Gold Standard produced the best-quality method for producing offsets, which directly monitored use of stoves, and was only 1.5 times over-credited.
“Gold Standard welcomes academic scrutiny and has engaged extensively with the authors of this study,” a spokesperson said, adding that it had already incorporated some of the ideas and changes discussed in the research.
“It must be stressed that the study neither studied, nor found, over-estimation. The evidence provided does not back the conclusions drawn – which are at odds with the wider academic literature and expert view on this subject.”
In a statement, Verra, the world’s largest carbon standard, said it was disappointed to see continued attention on the study. The non-profit organisation is developing a new methodology for cookstoves, and said the findings did not directly relate to its current methods.
“As detailed in a September 2023 open letter from researchers and experts, there are numerous substantive concerns about this research,” it said.
Verra said the proposed methodology it was developing included changes that “reflect current best practices of project design and implementation”, as well as a number of measuring techniques to check how much the stoves were being used.
“Carbon finance is critical for the implementation/sustenance of improved cookstove projects, which provide access to sophisticated cooking methods and a range of other sustainable development benefits to disadvantaged communities,” it said.
Ben Jeffreys, chief executive of the cookstove company ATEC, which is working with UC Berkeley to measure the benefits more accurately, said he supported the research. “Ensuring ‘a tonne of emission reductions is actually a tonne’ is critical if we are to reach the full potential of the cookstove carbon-market sector,” he said.

T9P0FNX6CN_D70R2FE9SNFIEWT,Education will be poorer if religion is banned from schools,_,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/26/education-will-be-poorer-if-religion-is-banned-from-schools,"Polly Toynbee’s articles are always worth reading, but to keep religion out of schools is, in my view, quite wrong (Banning prayer rituals in school? Just get religion out of education completely, 23 January). Her article makes it very clear that what is needed is the best education possible for every child – and every child is an individual with individual needs. There is no “one size fits all”, though there are basic matters that all children should learn, starting with reading and writing. Michaela community school has a regimen which to me sounds like a prison, but it seems to work for the children who attend and for their parents. But I do not think that the present problems, which seem to relate to bullying and coercion, will be solved through inflexibility.
Surely it is vital for children to learn about religions and philosophy in school, just as they need to know about geography, history, languages and many more subjects, as well as having tuition in art, music, sciences etc. All these things are crucial parts of how the world and its denizens operate and how they are interlocked. If you want to enjoy Shakespeare’s work, it helps to know about the historical context, the geographical references, the social mores and the religious beliefs of the time. Children must learn how to think and reason for themselves, rather than learning to behave like robots.
We are not just physical creatures – we have spiritual needs, so ethics, morals and religious beliefs are very important. It’s worth remembering that the church has been in the forefront of establishing education in many countries, and that huge numbers of people have been prepared to be martyred for their faith. We should learn from this.Juliet ChaplinLondon
Polly Toynbee writes that faith schools “escape other schools’ obligation to prioritise children in care”. This is not the case. All state-funded schools in England, including schools with a religious character, must legally comply with the government’s admissions code. This requires all schools to give the highest priority in their admissions oversubscription criteria to looked-after children and previously looked-after children (children who were in care but have been adopted, or become subject to a child arrangements order or special guardianship order). In practice this means that whenever any school, including a faith school, receives more applications than there are places, children in care are at the front of the queue.
It’s also somewhat misleading to claim that the state “pays religions to run a third of our schools”. Maintained faith schools are funded in exactly the same way as maintained community schools: central government funding is delegated to local authorities, where schools forums – statutory decision-making bodies whose membership will include school leaders from both faith and non-faith maintained schools – determine an agreed funding formula for the distribution of this funding.
Faith academies are funded directly by the Education and Skills Funding Agency, in the same way as academies with no faith designation. Diocesan education services have a relationship with their faith schools, and can provide advice and professional development, but they are not paid to run faith schools. Headteachers run schools, supported by governing boards. As a former chair of governors in a C of E maintained school, I can assure Ms Toynbee that I paid close attention to ensuring that our admissions policy was legal and fair, and the school continues to admit many looked-after and previously looked-after children.Becky LawrenceLeeds
I welcome Polly Toynbee’s article – while debating some conclusions. I have long argued that a secular approach to education is the best antidote to extremism (see my book Unsafe Gods: Security, Secularism and Schooling). Yet my argument is not for a hard secularism, as in France, but a dynamic secularism that is able to accommodate belief in the supernatural as long as this does not harm others. But the Michaela community school case revealed such harm, exposing intimidation and coercion in the name of religion.
The ethos and culture of the school are indeed key here – but not rigid, unquestioning discipline; rather, the discipline of a rights-based approach which enables understanding by students, teachers and parents of what is acceptable. Just like freedom of expression, the right to manifestation of religious expression is a qualified right, not an absolute one. The type of manifestation of religion demanded by the student in Katharine Birbalsingh’s school would have been detrimental and divisive. A dynamic secularism means compromise and pragmatism, but not at the expense of equal rights.
I’m fully with Polly Toynbee about faith schools fostering social segregation, while they pretend not to. I recall arguing with a Catholic school head who claimed that his school valued all faiths equally. But, I said, puzzled, the very existence of your school means you think that Catholicism is better than other value positions – or you wouldn’t need a designated school to promote it. Yet to challenge such religious particularism the answer is not banishment – either banning prayer or banning faith schools. What should be banned is state funding of faith schools – and the implicit state funding of selectivity and hypocrisy.Lynn DaviesEmeritus professor of international education, University of Birmingham
Has Polly Toynbee any idea of what it would cost to “abolish religious schools”? About a third of these schools in England and Wales, 2,200 of them, are Catholic. The land on which the schools stand and the buildings themselves are the property of the Catholic church, bought and built with money given by ordinary Catholics. Let’s say buying out each one would cost on average £2m. That’s £4.4bn. If we include C of E schools, that could be another £8bn. What advantage to society would be gained for such a colossal expenditure by the state? Pointless is hardly the word for it. Or is she suggesting confiscation?Clifford LongleyOrpington, Kent
One definition of hypocrisy is “feigning to be what one is not”. Religion in schools invites hypocrisy. There is the widespread semi-legal hypocrisy that we are a religious country – we are not. There is the educational hypocrisy that religious education is an integral part of the curriculum, yet in practice it is often watered down or almost nonexistent in non-faith schools. There is the hypocrisy of many faith schools claiming to be inclusive but not taking their fair share of disadvantaged pupils. There is the hypocrisy of parents feigning a faith to secure admission to faith schools.
Polly Toynbee is right: faith schools should be abolished, and with them the accompanying whiff of hypocrisy.Prof Colin RichardsSpark Bridge, Cumbria
I couldn’t agree more with Polly Toynbee’s views in this article, but I must take issue with her misrepresentation of French secularism, which, she claims, “tends to cause less social harmony, not more, used as an easy pretext for far-right anti-Muslim attacks”. This has only become the case in the last 20 years or so, when French government policies (as opposed to the French state) began to turn away from the original 1905 law on the separation of church and state.
The promulgation of this fundamental piece of legislation was one consequence of the Dreyfus affair, and sought to enshrine the principle of religious belief as a private matter that should not be allowed to interfere in public life and politics.
Secularism as a principle governing public life in France worked reasonably well for pretty much a whole century, until successive governments began to do the very thing that it was conceived to prevent: they began, as in many other countries, to politicise religion – or rather, a religion – Islam.
In France, the turning point came under Nicolas Sarkozy from around 2008 with the hijab debate. The politicisation of Islam has now become toxic, and it is this, not secularism, that has created “a pretext for far-right Muslim attacks”. The traditional right and the so-called centre quickly adopted the far right’s poisonous conflation of Islam with antisemitism, while many on the left unwittingly reinforced their political opponents’ betrayal of secularism by launching into “the fight against Islamophobia”, instead of recognising Islamophobia for what it is – a form of racism.Ilona BossanyiSaint-Sardos, France

TBWX2GE4CY_JGS74J6PSNQCZ4Y,Labor urged to recognise Palestinian state ‘without further delay’ after Israeli PM’s rejection of two-state solution,Daniel Hurst,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/24/labor-government-palestine-state-recognition-pressure-izzat-abdulhadi-benjamin-netanyahu,"A Palestinian diplomat has implored the Australian government to recognise Palestine as a state “without further delay” after what he called the Israeli prime minister’s “appalling but not surprising” rejection of a two-state solution.
The comments from the head of the general delegation of Palestine to Australia, Izzat Abdulhadi, come after two Labor MPs also urged the government to fast-track recognition of Palestinian statehood, whereas the Coalition said the immediate priority should be “security and stability”.
Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that Gaza “must be demilitarised, under Israel’s full security control” once the conflict against Hamas ended, and he would “not compromise on full Israeli security control of all territory west of the Jordan River”.
Netanyahu declared last Thursday that his stance on Israeli security control over Gaza and the West Bank “collides” with the idea of Palestinian sovereignty. “For 30 years, I have been consistent, saying one simple thing: this conflict is not about a lack of a state, but about the existence of a state.”
The comments reflect Netanyahu’s longstanding position that Palestinian statehood would pose a threat to Israel’s security.
But they contradict the position of the Australian government, which together with the US and other governments has repeatedly pledged support for a two-state solution and generally refrained from outright criticism of Israel.
Some members of the Labor party caucus have criticised Netanyahu’s position.

Julian Hill, a left faction convener, said on Saturday Netanyahu appeared “hellbent on formalising a policy of apartheid”. The term has been used by multiple human rights groups in relation to Israel’s policies and practices towards the Palestinian people, but has been rejected by the Israeli government.
Maria Vamvakinou, a co-convener of the Parliamentary Friends of Palestine, said Australia should “step forward, step up and recognise Palestine”.
Abdulhadi, the head of the general delegation of Palestine to Australia, said Australia had been silent for too long about what he called the “consistent, longstanding position of both the Israeli prime minister and his far-right coalition”.
He told Guardian Australia the comments by Netanyahu were “appalling but not surprising”.
Abdulhadi said the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination had been made conditional on “the endorsement and approval of Israeli leadership” through a Middle East peace process “that has proven to be ineffective for the last 30 years”.
He said Australia should not just express disappointment at Netanyahu’s position but “recognise the State of Palestine without further delay” and “enforce the two-state solution according to international law and a multilateral approach and arrangements”.
Abdulhadi represents the Palestinian Authority, which is dominated by Fatah – a rival to Hamas – and is not in control of Gaza.
He said the Australian government should adopt the position of the EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, who has argued a two-state solution may need to be “imposed” from outside to bring peace.
The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, responded to Netanyahu’s comments by saying her trip to the Middle East last week had reaffirmed the Australian government’s view “that any pathway to peace requires progress towards an independent Palestinian state”.

“And that is the best route to ensure peace, security and dignity for the Palestinian people and also for Israelis,” Wong told reporters in Canberra on Tuesday.
The assistant foreign minister, Tim Watts, was more forthright on Monday when he said Netanyahu’s comments were “deeply disappointing” and an obstacle to peace.
The Australian government is under political pressure over its response to Israel’s military operations in Gaza, where more than 25,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Gaza health ministry. Authorities in the territory say two-thirds of the deaths were women and children.
Israel vowed to destroy Hamas after the militant group’s attack on southern Israel on 7 October when about 1,200 people were killed and more than 240 others were taken hostage. More than 130 people are still believed to be captive in Gaza. The Israeli government has stated it is doing its utmost to reduce civilian casualties.
The Coalition’s foreign affairs spokesperson, Simon Birmingham, said Israel “clearly needs to have confidence that it is not ever going to see a repeat of the types of atrocities that occurred on October 7”.
Birmingham urged Hamas to lay down its arms and return hostages still held in Gaza.
He told Sky News people needed to have “hope for the future” but Israel must have confidence in security and stability “to be able to undertake those negotiations towards the two-state solution or some other lasting settlement”.
The independent MP for Goldstein, Zoe Daniel, who is a member of the Parliamentary Friends of Israel, said she supported Australia’s longstanding bipartisan policy of a two-state solution.
The Israeli embassy in Canberra was contacted for comment.

TEPHF1OLTA_98853BX54HUUPPA,No plans to tighten care worker English language rules after Somerset death,Robert Booth,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/jan/24/no-plans-to-tighten-care-worker-english-language-rules-after-somerset-death,"The minimum level of English language skills required for foreign care workers will not be raised despite the death of a care home resident after staff were unable to explain her critical state to 999 operators.
The senior coroner for Somerset investigated the death of 91-year-old Barbara Rymell in August 2022 and found that the primary school standard of English required to get a health and care visa was “wholly inadequate for those working in the direct care and protection of vulnerable people”. But the Home Office has now ruled out any change.
Indian and Romanian care workers at the Ashley House care home in Langport could not understand the difference between “bleeding” and “breathing” or “alert” and “alive” when talking to the emergency services after Rymell had a fall.
In a prevention of future deaths report, the coroner, Samantha Marsh, warned the government that without tougher tests, “deaths will continue”.
Rymell’s daughter, Elaine Curtis, also called for a change in the rules governing language, saying: “I would hate this to happen to someone else’s family.”
But the Home Office minister, Tom Pursglove, said: “We do not believe raising the level of the English language requirement for skilled workers would be appropriate.” He told the coroner this would be “very difficult” to assess and manage.
Nearly 86,000 foreign care workers and home carers were granted skilled worker visas in the 12 months to September 2023, more than double the previous year’s number. The increase came after ministers relaxed barriers to entry to try to fill 165,000 vacancies in the low-paid sector. Most came from India, Zimbabwe and Nigeria.
Care workers are supposed to pass the secure English language test, which requires comprehension equivalent to that of a year 6 pupil. Nurses are required to have a higher level of English to register with the Nursing and Midwifery Council, but there is no requirement for care workers to be registered with a professional body.
Rymell, who had dementia, had been left unattended in August 2022 when she fell on the stairs and trapped her head in the stairlift. When the staff called 999, they could not explain the gravity of the situation. Paramedics arrived on a category 2 response rather than the fastest response for life-threatening injuries, and Rymell was pronounced dead at the scene.
Care Rights UK, which represents relatives and residents, said it was “beyond comprehension that the Home Office minister does not believe that raising the level of the English language requirement for skilled workers would be appropriate”.
Diane Mayhew, a campaign manager at the charity, said: “The coroner has stated that without tougher tests, deaths will continue, and with nearly 86,000 foreign care workers and home carers granted skilled workers visas in the last 12 months alone, that’s a significant number of lives that may be at risk as a result of foreign care workers unable to speak adequate English to explain the critical state a resident is in.”
Nadra Ahmed, the chief executive of the National Care Association, said she agreed with the coroner about the need for higher language standards, and the Home Office decision to keep language requirements at the same level was “a cop-out”.
She said most care operators ensured staff could communicate well and she urged the government to “disable recruitment by unscrupulous agencies bringing in anybody and everybody”.
“We need a much more responsible way of filling these gaps [in the workforce],” she said. “I am not talking about perfect English, but the skills have to be such that they … understand the needs of the individual we support.”
Pursglove said it was the responsibility of care companies to ensure their employees had adequate English. He also said tougher language requirements would affect people who arrive under visa schemes for asylum seekers and people from Ukraine, Afghanistan and Hong Kong, who can all work in social care without a skilled worker visa. Requiring better English of these people risked defeating the purpose of those visa routes, he said."
TH53Y4PGTC_V6AA9P4WA34L3HL,DeSantis sinks Florida Republican’s plan to help pay Trump’s legal bill,Ramon Antonio Vargas,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/23/desantis-florida-veto-trump-legal-bill,"A day after ending his campaign for the White House and tepidly endorsing Donald Trump, the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, sank an effort to use his state’s funds to pay off the former president’s legal expenses.
DeSantis promised to veto a bill from the state senator Ileana Garcia, a Republican who sought to effectively dedicate up to $5m from Florida’s state budget to help Trump cover his legal costs. The former president faces 91 criminal charges and assorted lawsuits in various jurisdictions.
DeSantis shared a link on social media to a Politico article headlined “Some Florida Republicans want taxpayers to pay Trump’s legal bills”, and he added the caption: “But not the Florida Republican who wields the veto pen.”
Garcia’s proposal had won an endorsement from the elected official who oversees Florida’s state finances, Jimmy Patronis, a Republican. But Garcia withdrew her proposal shortly after DeSantis came out in opposition of it, FloridaPolitics.com reported.
She said in a statement that having Trump in the White House again would be a gain for Florida, where the former president’s Mar-a-Lago resort is located. “And anything we can do to support Florida presidential candidates, like President Trump, will not only benefit our state but our nation,” said Garcia, who argued that Trump’s criminal charges were an example of “weaponizing the courts”.
DeSantis ended his White House campaign on Sunday after finishing a distant second to Trump in the Iowa caucuses. Polls suggested DeSantis was on track to finish in third far in Tuesday’s New Hampshire primary, far behind Trump and the former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley.
Endorsing Trump, DeSantis wrote: “It’s clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance. He has my endorsement because we can’t go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear, a repackaged form of warmed over corporatism that Nikki Haley represents.”
Trump thanked DeSantis. But he told Fox News it “was highly unlikely” that the Florida governor would have a role in a second Trump administration.
“I have a lot of great people, and I have great people that have been with me right from the beginning,” Trump said on Sunday.

Trump’s criminal charges center on his attempts to forcibly overturn his defeat to Joe Biden in 2020, on illegally retaining government secrets after he left office, and on hush-money payments to an adult film actor who has alleged an extramarital sexual encounter with him.
He is also a defendant in civil litigation accusing him of illicit business practices as well as raping magazine columnist E Jean Carroll, with the latter allegation having been deemed substantially true by a judge."
TI73F9Z5IW_9G2W1X5FFZ631KS,Samsara review – a playfully mysterious invitation to contemplate death,Peter Bradshaw,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/jan/24/samsara-review-a-playfully-mysterious-invitation-to-contemplate-death,"Lois Patiño’s film is a delicate, exotic contrivance, a docu-realist diptych spectacle using nonprofessional actors, about the Buddhist concept of “Samsara”, the cycle of birth, death and life, and the transmigration of souls. Set in Laos and Zanzibar, it is mysterious and quietist, but flavoured with something whimsical and even playful; it is one of those ostensibly serious films best appreciated with the sense of humour, which Graham Greene said was the only thing that allowed him to believe in God. An agnostic might find something a little preposterous, even condescending in it: is it addressed to actual audiences in Laos and Zanzibar, or is this a film by and for western cinephiles? Well, there is charm and ingenuous directness here, and perhaps the influence of Thai film-maker Apichatpong Weerasethakul.
In Laos, an old woman called Mon lies dying; a young man called Amid reads to her from the Tibetan Book of the Dead, and she gently tells him of her wish, that she might be reincarnated as an animal. This is not a spiritual demotion and it is only thought of as such because of the cruel way we treat animals. Presently, Mon dies and after travelling in the bardo, the intermediate state between death and rebirth, the old woman’s soul alights in Zanzibar where she is reincarnated as a goat called Neema.
Nor is that all. The film requires us to “watch” the film during this 10-minute intermediate limbo state between Laos and Zanzibar with shut eyes, registering the abstract washes and flashes of light and colour through closed eyelids. It is intriguing, though a little disconcerting, especially because it is not entirely clear when this section is over and you’re allowed to open your eyes again. You might compare this to being asked to listen to a certain stretch of new music with hands over your ears, impressionistically sensing muffled sound shapes. But the reverie you go into is pleasurable; I found myself remembering sunbathing as a child.
The theme of metempsychosis in this film has also been taken up, as it happens, by Lisandro Alonso in his oddity Eureka, though in that film the pivot from one soul-state to the other is more complex and he does not insist on the protagonists’ childlike state in the same way. There is always something interesting in a movie that asks its audience to consider the taboo subject of death, and without the traditional mood-accompaniments of sadness and acceptance. But the tone is always important. The Laotian boy Amid befriends local orange-clad monks and uses his boat to take a party of them to the Kuang Si waterfall, a place of great beauty and spiritual significance (though also an established tourist destination, which you wouldn’t quite realise from this). While there, one monk dreamily dozes off, awakens to find himself alone and, just for a second, Amid plays a good-natured prank on him – in a similar spirit, perhaps, to the “eyes wide shut” midsection or the film as a whole, which nonetheless searches for a glimpse of the sublime.

TP75GKZPN5_CNQ7NXX8NZH0H88,Army chief says people of UK are ‘prewar generation’ who must be ready to fight Russia,Dan Sabbagh,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/24/army-chief-says-people-of-uk-are-prewar-generation-who-must-be-ready-to-fight-russia,"Downing Street has dismissed a warning from the head of the British army that the UK public must be prepared to take up arms in a war against Vladimir Putin’s Russia because today’s professional military is too small.
Rishi Sunak’s spokesperson said the prime minister did not agree with comments made by Gen Sir Patrick Sanders in a speech on Wednesday, and was forced to insist there would be no return to national service, which was abolished in 1960.
“Hypothetical scenarios” involving possible future wars was “not helpful”, the No 10 spokesperson added, as the row opened up a rift between the Conservatives and the military at a time when cuts mean the army is at its smallest for more than 300 years.
The Ministry of Defence (MoD) also distanced itself from the speech, which was released by the British army on behalf of the senior general, who is due to leave in the summer, having missed out on becoming head of the armed forces three years ago.
Speaking at a military conference, Sanders starkly described the British people as part of a “prewar generation” who may have to prepare themselves to fight in a war against an increasingly aggressive Russia. The chief of general staff highlighted the example of Sweden, which has just reintroduced a form of national service as it closes in on joining Nato.
During the speech in London, the army chief said the UK needed to broadly follow Stockholm’s example and take “preparatory steps to enable placing our societies on a war footing”. Such action was “not merely desirable, but essential”, he added.
The foundations for “national mobilisation” could not be confined to countries neighbouring or close to Russia, and as a result ordinary people in the UK would be forced to join the UK’s 74,110 full-time regular army to see off an active threat to mainland Europe.
He said: “We will not be immune and as the prewar generation we must similarly prepare – and that is a whole-of-nation undertaking. Ukraine brutally illustrates that regular armies start wars; citizen armies win them.”
Sanders has previously complained publicly and privately about defence cuts. A year ago, in an attempt to ensure politicians plugged the gap with future spending, he warned that gifts of weapons to Ukraine would “leave us temporarily weaker”.
Such public arguments over money have led him into conflict with the MoD, amid reports of clashes with the chief of defence staff, Adm Sir Tony Radakin. Some allies believe Sanders should have been promoted to replace Radakin, but he was asked to step down early after serving two of three years as army chief.
In his speech, Sanders said the cold war peace dividend was over, noting that “over the last 30 years, the army has been halved in size; in the last 12 years, we’ve absorbed a 28% reduction”. Recruitment remained a challenge, he said, although applications to join were “the highest in six years”.
Before Sanders gave his speech, the MoD issued a clarification, saying it had no plans to advocate a return to national service.

“The British military has a proud tradition of being a voluntary force and there is absolutely no suggestion of a return to conscription,” the MoD said, adding that £50bn was being invested in the military during the current year.
With an election looming, the military is hoping politicians make further pledges over defence spending. Labour has avoided making any firm spending commitments, but has criticised cuts to the size of the army and promised to launch a defence review if elected.
Grant Shapps, the defence secretary, this month repeated that the UK wants to increase defence spending from 2.1% of GDP to 2.5% in the future.
But Sanders said: “The army has a generous £44bn programme over 10 years, but that money is just 18% committed. During an electoral cycle, uncommitted money is vulnerable.”"
TPNXSDI3KP_YOK8OVCOQOFRGRY,Biden’s name won’t appear on New Hampshire ballots – where does that leave Democrats?,Adam Gabbatt,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/22/new-hampshire-presidential-primary-joe-biden-dean-phillips-marianne-williamson,"While Donald Trump and Nikki Haley might draw focus, a shadow presidential primary is taking place in New Hampshire, where Joe Biden could stumble at the first hurdle of his bid to run for president again in 2024 following an internal Democratic party feud.
As a consequence of the party scrap, Biden’s name will not even appear on the ballot in the Granite state on Tuesday. While the president remains the favorite to win his party’s overall nomination, his absence here has opened a window for Dean Phillips, a Democratic congressman from Minnesota, and Marianne Williamson, an author and self-help guru who ran for president in 2020, to mount longshot presidential bids.
The pair have spent weeks campaigning in the state, pitching different visions for the future. Phillips, 55, has touted his reputation as a centrist; his record of working with Republicans to get things done; and the fact that he is 26 years younger than Biden.
Williamson, who withdrew from the 2020 race before the Iowa caucuses, is selling more of a deviation from the current administration. A progressive, she would introduce free college tuition, declare a climate emergency and “Department of Peace” which would be tasked with avoiding war abroad and tackling white supremacy at home.
So far it is Phillips who seems to be drawing the most attention from Granite staters, even if, as he told voters in Salem on Friday, challenging Biden has meant being “excommunicated” from the wider Democratic party.
“I was a darling as of 90 days ago, and now I’m the devil somehow,” Phillips told the Guardian after the event.
“But that’s how it works. I expected this because it is a nonsensical culture, of standing in line playing your role waiting your turn. We can’t do that if we hope to save this country.”
Phillips, who ran his family’s hundred million dollar brewing company before winning a seat in the House of Representatives in 2018, only launched his campaign in October 2023, but he has established a large political operation in the state.
At his events his volunteers scurry around gathering signatures from people in the crowd, and hand out T-shirts and buttons with the legend: “I like Dean” written on the front. Frequently the crowds are large.
An event in Nashua on Saturday, a bitterly cold day with wispy snow falling from the sky, drew more than 200 people, who heard Phillips tout his record as “the second most bipartisan” Democrat in the House of Representatives.
“We believe it is time to segregate the far-left and the far-right and give voice to the exhausted majority of America. Are you ready for that?” Phillips said, to applause.
A man who clearly has a passion for language, Phillips then addressed a Democratic effort to write-in Biden’s name on the ballot on Tuesday by suggesting: “If he wrote you off, why would you write him in,” and claimed that Biden “took the granite state for gran-ted”.
On the stump Phillips sometimes adds: “I did torpedo my career in Congress, so that this country will not be torpedoed by this nonsense.”
New Hampshire polling shows Biden with a commanding lead over Phillips, and an even more commanding lead over Williamson. But given Biden’s name isn’t on the ballot, there’s a possibility Phillips could win.
The unusual situation stems from the Democratic national committee’s decision to ditch decades of tradition this year in choosing South Carolina, a much more racially diverse state, to host the first presidential primary. When New Hampshire said it would host its primary first anyway – South Carolina will vote next week – the Democratic National Committee essentially said it would ignore the state’s results.
It means that Phillips’s and Williamson’s efforts here won’t actually help them become a presidential candidate, but that doesn’t render the time they spend here completely redundant, said Dante Scala, a professor of political science at the University of New Hampshire.
“New Hampshire historically has not been about delegates, because we have relatively few to offer in the big scheme of things,” Scala said.
“It’s about the publicity that comes with a victory or even a better-than-expected performance in an early voting state in the nomination process, and I think they’ve been following that playbook.”
Biden might be absent from the state, but a movement has emerged encouraging people to write his name on voting slips, and in a sign that the Biden campaign sees the potential for embarrassment, a series of high-profile Biden supporters have been dispatched to New Hampshire in recent weeks.
Ro Khanna, a rising Democratic congressman from California, held an event for Biden on Saturday, while Pete Buttigieg, the transportation secretary, is among a slew of Biden’s cabinet officials who have pitched up here since the start of December.
Another problem for Phillips and Williamson is a liberal-led effort to get independent New Hampshirites to vote for Haley in the Republican primary, in an attempt to damage Trump’s chances in the state. PrimaryPivot, the organization running the campaign, has been a regular presence at Republican events.
“There’s a difference between a regular conservative Republican and someone who is an autocrat,” said Robert Schwarz, co-founder of PrimaryPivot.
“For the issues most important to our democracy, Nikki Haley and Donald Trump are night and day.”
For Phillips and Williamson, the write-in Biden campaign, and a separate effort to write-in “ceasefire” on Democratic ballots to critique Biden’s handling of Israel’s actions in Gaza, is an unwanted distraction.
“President Biden doesn’t really care about a write-in campaign. The president would care if a candidate, such as myself, who has called for a ceasefire from the very beginning, got a lot of votes,” Williamson said at a campaign event in Manchester on Saturday.
“I find [the campaign] kind of self-indulgent, performative.”
Williamson, who after dropping out of the 2020 race endorsed Bernie Sanders for president, has a much broader critique of the US than Phillips. Political elites, Williamson said, have a “business model” of “job elimination, and worker exploitation, and demonization of unions, and tax cuts for the very, very wealthy”.
“A majority of Americans live paycheck to paycheck. The majority of Americans can’t even dream of homeownership at this point. A majority of Americans cannot afford to absorb a $500 unexpected expenditure. One in four Americans live with medical debt, 75 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured,” Williamson said.
She has found some support among people like Lisa Swanson, a student at Quinnipiac university who voted for Sanders four years ago. Speaking after the Manchester event, Swanson said she found Williamson “very reasonable”.
“She shares a lot of the beliefs that I’ve had for a very long time, as if she’s plucked them right out of my own brain. So that’s very refreshing,” Swanson said.
But while the campaigns of Williamson and Phillips might be winning support, there is still a sense that this could all be for naught. Neither is expected to seriously challenge Biden in South Carolina primary, let alone in the states to follow.
Like others who attended events for these rebel candidates, Swanson was angry at the Democratic party skipping their state.
“I feel like it’s pretty anti-democratic, quite frankly. It is the opposite of democracy. We are supposed to vote as the people to show what we want, and the DNC doing that with Joe Biden, quite frankly, says that they don’t trust the people to make a decision,” Swanson said."
TQI304SRQ1_JDMB2PMR0Q8HZR1,Asic examines collapsed bitcoin company Blockchain Global after Guardian investigation,Sarah Martin,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/22/asic-examines-collapsed-bitcoin-company-blockchain-global-after-guardian-investigation,"Australia’s corporate regulator will examine details of the collapsed bitcoin company Blockchain Global after a Guardian Australia investigation revealed links between two of its directors and a series of failed crypto investment schemes.
Blockchain Global collapsed in 2021 owing creditors $58m, with the liquidator referring its directors – Allan Guo, Sam Lee and Ryan Xu – to the Australian Securities and Investment Commission for potential breaches of the Corporations Act. This included possible breaches of director’s duties, breaches of trust and unreasonable director-related transactions.
Asic initially advised liquidators Pitcher Partners that it did not intend to take action after it received the first report on the company’s activities in March 2022.
But after a Guardian Australia investigation into the HyperVerse crypto investment scheme, which has links to Lee and Xu, Asic has begun an examination of the liquidator’s report. A final version was filed to Asic in October.
An Asic spokesperson told Guardian Australia: “Asic confirms that it is assessing reports from the liquidator in relation to BGL.”
Guardian Australia has revealed widespread losses to the HyperVerse investment scheme, which escaped regulator attention in Australia despite being flagged by authorities overseas – by one as a possible “scam” and another as a “suspected pyramid scheme”.

Court documents filed in January in the US against Bitcoin Rodney, a senior US promoter of HyperFund and HyperVerse, allege the scheme operated with a network or promoters making “fraudulent promotional presentations” to investors and potential investors. He has been charged with operating and conspiring to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business.
An affidavit filed by the US internal revenue service alleges that early investors were “paid with funds collected from more recent investors”, and the company’s claimed revenue-generating bitcoin mining operations did not exist. There is no mention of Xu or Lee in the court documents filed by authorities in that case.
Lee has denied being behind HyperVerse, saying his involvement was limited to technology provision and the funds management side of the organisation. Both Lee and Xu appeared in the HyperVerse global launch event in 2021, alongside a fake chief executive officer called Stephen Reece Lewis. Xu and Lee also both featured prominently in promotional material for the schemes that preceded HyperVerse, known as HyperFund and HyperCapital.
Reece Lewis has since been revealed by the Guardian to be the British man Stephen Harrison, who said he was hired for a short period via a talent agent to play a “corporate presenter” and that he had no role in the actual business.
Lee relocated to Dubai in 2021, while the whereabouts of Xu is unknown. Guo is not involved in the Hyper group schemes.
The US-based crypto analysis firm Chainalysis estimates losses to HyperVerse in 2022 amounted to US$1.3bn (A$1.97bn).
The move by Asic to examine the Blockchain Global collapse comes as the liquidator also reveals a possible link in the company’s records to the operation of HCash, which was a cryptocurrency linked to the Hyper investment schemes.
“The liquidators have identified two debt transactions totalling $500,000 in Blockchain Global’s main bank account [linked to HCash]. These transactions both occur on 5 August 2019,” Pitcher Partner’s liquidator Andrew Yeo told Guardian Australia.
“It is not clear whether the funds were used for this intended purpose.”
Rewards that were accumulated through the earlier Hyper schemes were converted to HCash before they could be converted to other cryptocurrencies.

According to a “HyperTech group organisational chart”, HCash was one of three Australian companies behind the Hyper investment schemes, in alliance with Blockchain Global, Collinstar Capital and the HCash Foundation.
According to the HyperTech group’s promotional material, Collinstar Capital, Blockchain Global and HCash were a “multi billion dollar group of companies”.
The HCash official Telegram group confirmed its association with HyperTech and HyperCapital in 2019, saying it was “allied with the HyperTech group”.
Asic documents show that HCash Tech Pty Ltd was owned by Xu and Jianbo “Jacob” Cheng and was established in 2017. An application for it to be deregistered was made in May 2023.
Collinstar Capital was owned by Xu until mid 2022, after which it was taken over by Cheng.
Asic documents reveal shares of the company’s 40 founders were transferred from Xu to Cheng for $5.50, while 200,000 noncumulative preference shares were transferred at no cost, with a value of $125,000 listed as unpaid.
Cheng did not respond to questions from Guardian Australia.
Lee did not respond to questions from Guardian Australia before the publication of a previous article about his involvement in the establishment and operation of HyperFund and HyperVerse. He has previously denied the schemes are a scam.
In a WhatsApp message after the article was published he alleged it included “misstatements” about his role in running the Hyper schemes but did not respond when asked what they were. He also claimed that “people on the internet continues [sic] to make things up”.
Lee has also not responded to questions from Guardian Australia about the liquidators’ findings in relation to Blockchain Global."
TS5HDD1W5V_WSR37MNF3IW0B8T,Post-Brexit trade deals: what’s been agreed and what could still come?,Jack Simpson,_,20231227,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/26/post-brexit-trade-deals-whats-been-agreed-what-could-still-come,"Negotiations over a trade deal between the UK and Canada have been halted after disagreements on beef and cheese tariffs.
The ability for the UK to secure its own global free trade deals was sold as one major benefit from the UK’s decision to leave the EU but progress has been mixed. Here we look at what agreements have been struck so far and with whom, and which other important economies are still at the negotiating table and why.
Japan When in late 2020 the then international secretary, Liz Truss, signed the UK’s first major post-Brexit free trade agreement, she said that when it came into force the next year it would boost trade between the two countries by billions of pounds annually.
However, exports to Japan have not quite received the turbo charge promised, falling to £11.9bn in the year to June 2022, from £12.3bn the year before. This included a 4.9% fall in export for goods, to £6.1bn, while services fell 2%, to £5.8bn.
Australia The deal in December 2021 was almost entirely focused on goods, with tariffs being eliminated on exports from both countries for a 15-year period. The government said it would unlock £10.4bn of additional trade with the country by the 2030s while ending tariffs on all UK exports.
Others were not so positive, with UK farmers angry that Australia had been given full access to sell beef and sheep meat in the UK while there was a ban on beef going the other way. A year later, George Eustice, the former environment minister who was part of the negotiations, said it “was not actually a very good deal for Britain” and “gave away far too much for far too little in return”.
New Zealand This February 2022 deal largely mirrored the Australian one, with similar concerns from UK meat farmers about being undercut by cheaper imports. Tariffs of up to 10% on products were removed from most products, while visa restrictions for travel and residency were eased.
The government estimated that this would add £800m a year to the UK economy by the mid-2030s but the overall impact was negligible, representing just a 0.03% boost to GDP by 2035. The Australian and New Zealand trade deals came into effect in last May.
The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership While technically not a new trade deal, the UK’s joining of the CPTPP means a range of export products can be traded tariff-free with the member nations, which include Peru, Singapore, Vietnam, Canada and Mexico but not the US. The deal, agreed last March, also means countries must adhere to certain unified regulations, such as food standards.
However, the CPTPP arrangements can be overridden by individual trade deals with specific countries, which is why the UK is still trying to secure direct deals with member states such as Canada. Analysis has found that exporting to countries in the CPTPP accounted for 8% of UK exports in 2019, less than the UK’s total trade with Germany.
The US Negotiations began in May 2020 and nearly four years later there is no prospect of an agreement any time soon. Last month Joe Biden signalled he had shelved plans for a deal until at least after this November’s US presidential election.
India When negotiations began between India and the UK at the start of 2022, it was hoped that by as early as that October there would be a deal reducing tariffs on exports such as cars and Scottish whisky and providing better access to the world’s fifth biggest economy. However, we are still waiting, with experts saying any pact is unlikely before the Indian national elections this spring.
Others As well as Canada, talks are continuing with other nations including Israel, Mexico and South Korea. The UK began negotiating with the Gulf Cooperation Council, which includes Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, in July 2022. Experts have predicted that a deal with Switzerland, which is the sixth biggest market for the UK to export services to, could be the next reached."
TTQF0HBM77_5KGW95UUR880OVI,Mitt Romney: Trump’s call to stonewall Democrats on immigration ‘appalling’,Martin Pengelly,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/25/mitt-romney-donald-trump-immigration-republicans,"Donald Trump’s directive to congressional Republicans to not agree to a deal with Democrats on immigration and border control is “appalling”, Mitt Romney said.
“I think the border is a very important issue for Donald Trump,” Romney, the Republican senator from Utah, told reporters on Capitol Hill on Thursday.
“And the fact that he would communicate to Republican senators and congresspeople that he doesn’t want us to solve the border problem because he wants to blame [Joe] Biden for it is … really appalling.”
Having won in Iowa and New Hampshire and with only the former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley still in the race, Trump is the clear favourite for the Republican presidential nomination to face Biden in November.
His progress has not been impeded by 91 criminal charges, attempts to remove him from the ballot for inciting the January 6 attack on Congress and assorted civil trials.
It was widely reported this week that Trump has sought to dynamite Senate talks for an immigration deal long linked to prospects of a new aid package for Ukraine.
Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate, reportedly acknowledged that Trump’s opposition makes it highly unlikely immigration talks will succeed, given hardline Republicans’ hold on the House and its speaker, Mike Johnson, a far-right congressman from Louisiana.
Romney is a former Massachusetts governor who became the Republican nominee for president in 2012 before winning a Senate seat in Utah in 2018.
Though he flirted with working for Trump when he won the White House, Romney has since emerged as a constant opponent.

The sole Republican to vote to convict Trump in his first impeachment trial, for seeking political dirt in Ukraine, Romney was one of seven senators to find Trump guilty in his second such trial, for inciting the January 6 insurrection.
On Thursday, Romney said: “The reality is that we have a crisis at the border, the American people are suffering as a result of what’s happening at the border, and someone running for president ought to try and get the problem solved, as opposed to saying: ‘Hey, save that problem. Don’t solve it. Let me take credit for solving it later.’”"
TU6LX2ZFWW_3ERZ5K6FQYCP4P8,Bumblebee among species US wildlife officials consider listing as endangered,_,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/24/us-endangered-species-list,"Federal wildlife officials announced on Wednesday they will consider adding 10 new species to the Endangered Species Act, including a big bumblebee that serves as an important pollinator across the United States.
US Fish and Wildlife Service officials said they had completed 90-day reviews of petitions to add the species to the list and determined that listing may be warranted. The finding triggers reviews of the species’ status.
One of the more prominent species up for consideration is the Southern Plains bumblebee, a large black-and-yellow bumblebee that inhabits open prairies, meadows and grasslands in the midwest, the mid-Atlantic states and the Plains states from Texas to North Dakota. It is also found in the grasslands and savannahs in the south-eastern US, including Florida. Queens can grow as large as an inch (26mm); workers can grow to as large as three-quarters of an inch (18mm).
The Center for Biological Diversity petitioned the US Fish and Wildlife Service in 2022 to include the bee on the endangered species list. According to the center, habitat loss and degradation as well as pesticides have led to sharp population declines in the southern Plains states, including Texas and Oklahoma as well as in Alabama and Mississippi.
The other species under review include the betta hendra and the betta rutilans, freshwater fish found in Borneo; the Hickory Nut Gorge salamander, an amphibian found in western North Carolina; the pygmy rabbit, a small rabbit found in mountainous areas of the western US; and the Railroad Valley toad, a small toad that lives only in the wetlands of the Lockes wildlife management area in Nye county, Nevada.
Also up for review are the south-west spring firefly, an invertebrate native to Arizona that faces habitat loss due to alteration or loss of ground and surface water flows, livestock grazing and mining; the white-margined penstemon, a rare perennial plant found only in the Mojave desert; and the yellow-spotted woodland salamander, which lives on the Appalachian plateau in Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia.
US Fish and Wildlife Service officials decided not to review the status of the eastern hellbender, an aquatic salamander that lives in streams across 15 states. The agency included eastern hellbenders who live in Missouri on the endangered species list in 2021.
More than 1,300 species are listed as either endangered or threatened in the US under the Endangered Species Act. Listing protects organisms from being harmed, killed, imported or exported. Listing also mandates development and implementation of population recovery plans."
TUJQZFFZ92_T7DK4TLO0CD276R,Michelle Mone has £75m of assets frozen as NCA investigates fraud,Ben Quinn,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/26/michelle-mone-assets-frozen-nca-investigates-fraud,"Assets controlled by Michelle Mone and her husband worth about £75m have been frozen or restrained under a court order obtained by the Crown Prosecution Service.
PPE Medpro, a company led by Mone’s husband, Doug Barrowman, is under investigation by the National Crime Agency over government contracts awarded during the pandemic for allegedly faulty personal protective equipment.
It was awarded contracts worth more than £200m to supply PPE to the NHS through a “VIP lane”. The firm is also being sued by the Department of Health and Social Care.
While Mone had previously complained about her assets being frozen – and likened her treatment to that meted out to the Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar – the couple have now confirmed they have agreed to restrictions being placed over a range of assets.
This includes a six-bedroom townhouse in London’s Belgravia and a country estate on the Isle of Man. Prosecutors also targeted 15 accounts at Coutts, C Hoare & Co and Goldman Sachs International, according to the Financial Times.
A spokesperson for Mone and Barrowman said: “This comes as a result of a consensual process during which negotiations took place with the CPS. It allows the wider businesses and assets of the Barrowman family to operate normally and free from any restrictions or uncertainties.
“Doug and Michelle did not contest the application and were happy to offer up these assets, which means they can begin the task of proving their innocence more quickly.”
The order, issued in December after an application by the CPS, blocks the couple from selling some of the assets and applies restrictions to others.
Mone lashed out on her account on X, formerly Twitter, after the existence of the order was reported, claiming that private and confidential matters continued to be leaked by government sources. “It shows how desperate they are to keep attacking us every week,” she added.
However, the order was welcomed by the Scottish National party MP John Nicolson as “good news and not before time”.
The couple confirmed in a statement this month they were under investigation by the NCA, while claiming they were being “hung out to dry” over the government’s failings to source personal protective equipment during the Covid-19 pandemic.
Barrowman accused the government of using the NCA “to threaten criminal proceedings” to force the couple to reach a settlement over PPE Medpro, which is being sued by the UK government for £122m plus costs for “breach of contract and unjust enrichment”.
The NCA is investigating allegations of fraud and bribery surrounding the company. Mone and Barrowman both deny the allegations.
Mone admitted last month she had lied to the media by denying her links to PPE Medpro, which made millions of pounds from a deal to supply PPE via the VIP lane after she referred it to ministers in May 2020.
On Thursday, the former Scotland secretary David Mundell said the former prime minister David Cameron, now foreign secretary, breached “proper process” when he appointed Mone to the House of Lords in 2015.
Mundell, the Conservative MP for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale, said Cameron appointed Mone without No 10 consulting the government’s Scotland Office, which is standard practice before awarding peerages to Scots.
Cameron and other Westminster Tories had been impressed by Mone when she backed the union in the Scottish independence referendum in 2014. She was already well known in Scotland through her lingerie business, Ultimo."

The Boston-based 1st US circuit court of appeals overturned a lower-court judge’s decision dismissing the case on the grounds that a US law barred Mexico from suing Smith & Wesson Brands, Sturm, Ruger & Co and others.
That law, the federal Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), provides the firearms industry broad protection from lawsuits over their products’ misuse.
Mexico’s lawyers argued the law only bars lawsuits over injuries that occur in the US and does not shield the seven manufacturers and one distributor it sued from liability over the trafficking of guns to Mexican criminals.
Judge William Kayatta, writing for the three-judge panel, said that while the law can be applied to lawsuits by foreign governments, Mexico’s lawsuit “plausibly alleges a type of claim that is statutorily exempt from the PLCAA’s general prohibition”.
He said that was because the law was only designed to protect lawful firearms-related commerce, yet Mexico had accused the companies of aiding and abetting illegal gun sales by facilitating the trafficking of firearms into the country.
The Mexican foreign minister, Alicia Bárcena, called the ruling “great news” in a post on Twitter/X. The country’s US lawyer, Steve Shadowen, called it “an important step forward in holding the gun industry accountable”.
“It should now be clear that those who contribute to gun violence must face legal consequences, regardless of borders,” Shadowen said in a statement.
Representatives for the gunmakers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Mexico says over 500,000 guns are trafficked annually from the US into Mexico, of which more than 68% are made by the companies it sued, which also include Beretta USA, Barrett Firearms Manufacturing, Colt’s Manufacturing Co and Glock Inc.
In its August 2021 complaint, Mexico estimated that 2.2% of the nearly 40m guns made annually in the US are smuggled into Mexico, including as many as 597,000 guns made by the defendants.
Mexico said the smuggling has been a key factor in its ranking third worldwide in the number of gun-related deaths. It also claimed to suffer many other harms, including declining investment and economic activity and a need to spend more on law enforcement and public safety.

Research published in the journal Science found that air pollution from the vast Athabasca oil sands in Canada exceed industry-reported emissions across the studied facilities by a staggering 1,900% to over 6,300%.
Academics said this means that damaging reactive pollutants from the oil sands are equivalent to those from all other human-made sources across Canada with severe health implications.
Keith Stewart, a senior energy strategist for Greenpeace Canada, said: “In quantifying the astonishing and largely unreported levels of health-damaging air pollution coming out of oil sands operations, these scientists have validated what downwind Indigenous communities have been saying for decades. This is making people sick, so our governments can and should require these companies to use some of their record-breaking profits to clean up the mess they’ve made.”
Canadian tar sands, also called oil sands, are a massive site of oil extraction in the province of Alberta. They cover an area larger than England, are one of the biggest industrial projects on the planet, and have seen record production levels this year.
The type of oil in the tar sands is called “bitumen”. It is extremely heavy and difficult to extract. Getting it from deep in the ground to the surface can use up massive amounts of water – enough to rival what a small city may use on a daily basis. Even more water and energy is needed to refine it for commercial use and the amount of climate-polluting greenhouse gases emitted per barrel of tar sands oil can be 30% higher than conventional oil.
The study, published on Thursday, reveals the scale of air pollution caused by the process. Using aircraft to measure pollutants, it found that there are many organic compounds being released during the process that are missed by traditional ways of measuring air pollutants – with devastating health consequences.
For decades Indigenous communities in the region have complained about the health impact of toxic air caused by the oil sands operations.
Jesse Cardinal, from the indigenous led group Keepers of the Water, said the report confirmed what many communities had been experiencing for years.
“We are told this is all within the limits and OK but this report backs up what the communities living in these areas experience – it is so bad they cannot open their windows because it hurts their lungs to breathe – especially at night.”
The researchers examined emissions from surface mining operations as well as extraction from deeper deposits of bitumen.

They noted the importance of post-extraction waste management practices, such as “tailings processing” where toxic sludge is left to dry.
John Liggio, one of the research authors, said: “The study featured new measurements of total reactive organic chemicals onboard a research aircraft that reveal underestimated emissions by a factor of 1900% to over 6300% ... These emission underestimates were not just observed at the more well-known surface mining operations, but also from in situ extraction facilities that represent over 50% of production with projected increases.”

U24TUCBXS4_H1BT94QEQ3CSFVH,William Barton: ‘What do I need to do in order to be grounded?’,Dee Jefferson,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/jan/27/william-barton-composer-musician-didgeridoo-songs-sydney-symphony-orchestra,"It’s a long distance and a far cry from his ancestral country, Kalkadoon, in the Mount Isa region of Queensland, but Sydney’s Paddington has a different kind of resonance for Kalkadunga man William Barton. It’s here that the composer and multi-instrumentalist, best known for his virtuoso didgeridoo playing, began what he calls “a significant chapter” in his musical life, with the late, great Australian composer Peter Sculthorpe, who was an early champion of Barton, composing work for the young prodigy.
On the muggy late-January afternoon that I meet Barton, we walk down Holdsworth Street towards the Georgian cottage where Sculthorpe lived, as he enumerates his many connections with the area. A short walk away is Peggy Glanville-Hicks Composers’ House, named for the Australian composer, where Barton undertook a live-in residency with his partner and longtime collaborator, violinist and vocalist Véronique Serret, during Sydney’s Covid lockdowns. It was here that he started work on Of the Earth, commissioned by the Sydney Symphony Orchestra for the reopening of the refurbished Sydney Opera House Concert Hall in 2022.
“I’m very proud to utilise the sonic force of the symphony orchestra to reinterpret the Australian landscape; to help facilitate or amplify the songlines that are already here and just as powerful as western European classical composers,” Barton says.
As we walk he points out Pat Thompson Park, named after the mother of actor Jack Thompson, “an old family friend”. “In the process of writing Of the Earth, I would walk past here most days and acknowledge the park.” He often sent Thompson selfies in these moments, and when he reached Sculthorpe’s cottage he would sometimes put his hand over the brass memorial plaque on the footpath outside.
This sense of ceremony infuses Barton’s life. “Ceremony should be every day, whatever that ceremony is for you as an individual – to become stronger in your art form, and in your connection to other humans,” he says. Walking is a big part of it, and he estimates he covers a minimum of 500km each month, with one of his favourite routes taking him from his and Serret’s home in Surry Hills to Centennial Park, where he passes by its massive ponds teaming with aquatic and bird life.
“[It’s about being] at one with nature and breathing the fresh air and putting those thoughts out there and hopefully receiving whatever that might be back, to help shape a compositional piece,” he says.
Walking serves another vital purpose for Barton: he took it up in his late 30s as part of a weight-loss plan that involved working with a personal trainer, giving up alcohol, and daily fasting. He shed roughly 70kg in a few years. “That came through wanting to be the warrior inside,” he says. “I was looking towards the next 40 years of life and thinking about, ‘OK, what do I have to do to live till I’m 80, but also sustain my level of musicality and my travel lifestyle that goes with that? And what do I need to do in order to be grounded?”
It’s this combination of drive and discipline, as much as raw talent, that has fuelled Barton’s meteoric rise through the Australian, and now international, music world. Even taking into account his early start, listening to classical music from his early years and learning didgeridoo from the age of seven from his uncle, Barton has achieved much in his 42 years. He’s played with and composed for major orchestras at home and abroad, released five albums and holds two honorary doctorates.
In recent years he’s received two awards generally given to senior artists for “lifetime achievements” or contributions to music.
Barton performs and tours almost constantly. This year his busy schedule will include the premiere of a new commission for Musica Viva and Brisbane’s Ensemble Q, and an opera about Adam Goodes. He’ll also release his sixth album.
Barton’s day typically begins about 4.30am: “I like to wake up before the sun rises. I drink my water, meditate, and go for a walk,” he says. At some point, he’ll have an ice bath – for “mental clarity” but also to soothe joint inflammation from walking.

He talks about these smaller daily routines as the “5% [of] ceremony” that allows him to get to the “100% ceremony” of performance. “And I’ve got my house set up so that I can just jump on the guitar, play my scales, play the piano – whatever it is, so I can continue to become good,” he adds. “I do that for me, but I also do that for others, so that I have the technique to convey that story [when I perform].”
When we meet, Barton has two January performances front of mind. First, Sydney Symphony Under the Stars, performing with Serret and his mum, Aunty Delmae Barton, a senior Bidjara song woman and lyricist, alongside the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. The other is the Australia Day Live concert on the Sydney Opera House forecourt. Barton is also creative consultant for the event.
“When I do things like the Symphony Under the Stars and Australia Day Live at the Opera House, it’s about ceremony,” he says. “There’s all these things happening around the world that I can’t affect, but I can share my gift that was given to me by my uncles and my mum and dad, going in [to each event] as neutral as possible to create the safe space, and not talk about things but do it with the feeling. That’s how I intention my music.”
Since the death of his uncle, Arthur Peterson, an elder and lore man of the Waanyi, Lardil and Kalkadunga people, who passed on his cultural and musical teachings to Barton, as well as his didgeridoo, he feels an increased sense of responsibility: “It reinforced my path, in terms of the cultural intention,” he tells me.
“My elders have created [a safe space] so that I can be at the Opera House forecourt on the 26th. But I go in there with no political view but [rather] the aim of connection to each Australian in that audience as well as the global audience watching. And so I have to make that ceremony really strong. If I can make that ceremony strong, I can attain the vision that I have of connection – without talking about it.”"
U2Q6GHXYZZ_WTCKBRN11LY84VG,English Breakfast Society recommends swapping tomato for pineapple,Sammy Gecsoyler,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/jan/26/english-breakfast-society-recommends-swapping-tomato-for-pineapple,"It has already ruined pizzas for some, but pineapples could soon be landing on plates of full English breakfast after a leading society declared that the greasy classic could benefit.
The English Breakfast Society, which is dedicated to the history, heritage, and culture of the English breakfast, said pineapple had been eaten with a full English breakfast in centuries past and has called for it to replace the grilled tomatoes and mushrooms with which modern diners are familiar.
Guise Bule de Missenden, the society’s founder and chair, told the Daily Telegraph: “Interestingly, in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, the pineapple was considered to be a high-status breakfast item in Great Britain.
“Pineapples used to be seen as exotic, expensive, difficult to obtain and were a highly prized breakfast ingredient for wealthy English families, which is why you can find lots of old English pineapple breakfast recipes.”
“King Charles II himself loved them, so if you wanted to add a touch of the exotic to your plate and eat like a 17th-century lord, there is no reason not to give it a try,” he added. “A slice of grilled pineapple can add variety to the English breakfast plate. Simply swap the mushrooms or tomato for a grilled pineapple slice in someone’s English breakfast one day to give them a surprising and unexpected delight.”
He said: “Nobody really likes the tomatoes that usually come with a full English breakfast so why shouldn’t we swap them for a grilled pineapple slice?”
The society has form for causing a fuss over its full English recommendations. Last year, it declared that hash browns had no place on a full English.
Bule de Missenden told the Times last year: “Somebody had to put their foot down. Otherwise we’ll find kebab meat in our English breakfast before long.
“The hash brown – the reconstituted, tater-based fast-food – was popularised by McDonald’s but somehow we now find it in our English breakfast.”
Pineapples were a symbol of high status in centuries past. Charles II commissioned a portrait of himself being presented with one. Hanbury Hall, a stately home built in the early 18th century, has carved pineapples along the top of one of its orangeries.
The status of pineapples in the UK fell during the 19th and 20th century as they became commonplace and affordable after large quantities of the fruit were imported from British colonies."
U3OKNFJWS4_OI3QN4SU86OYDB4,The show inviting Australians into Palestinian life: ‘Artists can move nations if they want to’,Sophia Cai,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/jan/24/the-show-inviting-australians-into-palestinian-life-artists-can-move-nations-if-they-want-to,"Aseel Tayah has been making art for more than half her life. As a child living in occupied Palestine, it became a tool to express feelings of loss and frustration. She would go on to study visual art and photography at Beit Berl College in Israel, where she was the only Palestinian, and the only Arabic-speaking student in her class.
Tayah moved to Australia 10 years ago, to live with her Syria-born husband. Now 36 and based in Melbourne, her work is currently focused on large-scale and collaborative works that share stories about Palestinian life, culture and history – and when we speak over Zoom, she is busy rehearsing and preparing for A’amar, her forthcoming immersive theatre work for the Sydney festival; as well as a series of storytelling events at the 4A Centre for Contemporary Asian Art, titled Untold Palestine.
A’amar means “may it keep going” in Arabic and is Tayah’s attempt at “bringing part of my life as a Palestinian into a 90-minute show”. Seated on cushions on the floor, the audience will watch as a four-course Palestinian meal is prepared, before sharing in the food as Tayah and her cast of performers and musicians tell personal stories through prose, poetry, objects and song.
Premiering at Parramatta’s Riverside theatre on 25 January, the work was in development before the current escalation of violence in Gaza, and its script has evolved continuously in response to the horrors unfolding there daily. The process highlighted the challenge of creating a cultural work in the most turbulent of times: how can Tayah accurately represent a subject – Palestine and its people – that is under an ever-changing threat? “Since the war, instead of talking about bread, we are [now] talking about the lack of bread,” Tayah says. “Instead of talking about life, we’re talking about staying alive.”
Tayah describes her work as “cultural art experiences”, which bring together artists and non-artists, adults and children, on themes of displacement and migration. She sees art-making as vital during times of crisis. “I believe artists are the most beautiful changemakers. Artists can move nations if they want to,” she says. “[They have a] pure channel to transform feelings and emotions into something that goes straight to heart.”
In 2016, she became a founding member of art collective Bukjeh – an Arabic word describing a small pack of belongings carried by travellers, including refugees fleeing war-torn regions. The group specialises in community-based projects that blur the line between art and social activism: one of their earliest works was set within a disaster relief tent at Melbourne’s Immigration Museum, where a group of diaspora artists told their stories of the refugee experience and migration; Bukjeh has also collaborated with local organisations to create a number of “toy libraries” across Gaza, Jerusalem and the West Bank, giving children free access to used toys collected from all over Palestine.
Collaboration is also at the heart of one of Tayah’s most recent works: a 10-metre fabric banner of a watermelon – the fruit has become a symbol of solidarity with Palestine, in the same colours as the national flag – that has featured at the rallies held every Sunday in Melbourne. The banner was sewn with other mothers at her daughter’s school, with each watermelon seed made by a child to represent a hope planted for the future.
The large scale of the watermelon banner – and Tayah’s similarly oversized keffiyeh banner, which has joined the rallies more recently – is essential to its meaning, she says. After a lifetime spent watching the Palestinian experience erased, Tayah wants “to be seen, to make art that is big and visible” and that shows the tenacity of Palestinian identity.
“I make my work first for my daughter and then every other child,” Tayah says. “I’m not wasting time and energy on those who don’t care. I’m trusting those who believe in a better future.”
A’amar runs at Riverside theatre in Parramatta from 25-28 January as part of Sydney festival. Bukjeh’s Untold Palestine event takes place on 31 January and 1 February at 4A Centre for Contemporary Asian Art in Haymarket, Sydney"
UA7IDFBHYA_D7GO04NN958J55O,Alice is among a growing number of Victorians battling this flesh-eating ulcer. Scientists say they now know why,Natasha May,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/24/alice-victoria-flesh-eating-buruli-ulcer-scientists-transmission,"When Alice Mika was bitten by a mosquito last summer in Melbourne’s west, she didn’t think anything of it.
Then, a small raised bump appeared on her ankle more than five months later and wouldn’t go away. She saw her GP who prescribed antibiotics, believing it to be a spider bite.
But over the course of two months, “it was just getting worse and worse”, she said. Her ankle began to swell and the scab of the bite eventually erupted into a gaping hole exposing the layer of fat beneath the skin.

Mika’s doctors initially didn’t think she could have the flesh-eating Buruli ulcer because she told them she hadn’t visited Victoria’s Bellarine Peninsula, one of the coastal areas where the disease was thought to be confined, which also includes the Mornington Peninsula.
However in recent years it has spread. Since 2019, there have been cases reported in the suburbs of Geelong and inner Melbourne areas, including Essendon, Moonee Ponds and Brunswick West.
The Victorian government last week announced a record 363 cases were reported in 2023, adding to the exponential increase over the past two decades since 12 were reported in 2003.
Yet how Australians are ending up with these skin ulcers has been a mystery ever since Australian scientists discovered this bacterium more than 80 years ago, said Prof Tim Stinear, the director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Mycobacterium Ulcerans at the Doherty Institute.
But now research led by Stinear, published Wednesday in Nature Microbiology, claims to have solved the “transmission enigma” with evidence that mosquito bites are spreading the infection between possums and humans.
“The research is building on decades of research where we’ve had an inkling that mosquitoes are involved in spreading this infection, but we’ve been met with a lot of scepticism in the field because it’s unprecedented for this type of bacteria to be spread by mosquitoes,” Stinear said.
The researchers trapped and tested more than 65,000 mosquitoes between 2016 and 2021 in the Mornington Peninsula, which is known to have one of the highest incidences of Buruli ulcer in the world, and built a “hierarchy of evidence” demonstrating the insects are responsible for spreading the infection, Stinear said.
Using forensic level genomics, the researchers found the bacteria in the mosquitoes was an identical match to the bacteria in the people.
They also sequenced the DNA in the blood in the mosquitoes’ abdomens and found the insects had fed on both Australian native possums and humans.
The researchers also carried out a spatial mapping and statistical analysis of the areas where people were getting Buruli ulcer, where possums were carrying the bacteria, shedding it in their faecal pellets, and where mosquitoes were also carrying the bacteria, and found that those areas overlap in space.
Prof Rhonda Stuart, the director of Public Health and Infection Prevention at Monash Health, said “it’s a really significant paper. It fills in the gaps of things we’ve been wanting to know about Buruli ulcer for many years, and the link between human disease, possums and mosquitoes as the probable vectors of transmission.”

Stuart said increasing mosquito prevalence as a result of torrential rain could be among the factors contributing to the spread of the Buruli ulcer.
“We’ve seen it with Japanese encephalitis last summer, where normally Japanese encephalitis mosquitoes were only up north, and then we’ve seen them further down as far as southern New South Wales and northern Victoria,” Stuart said.
Stinear hopes the research’s findings will lead to better control of this infection, including greater awareness of how individuals can prevent mosquito bites, stopping mosquitoes breeding around homes and public health measures.
The infection has a very long incubation period, Stinear warned. From the time that you get bitten by the mosquito to the time symptoms begin to appear, starting with a bite or pimple that doesn’t heal, is usually about four to five months, he said.
“It can be painless, so people ignore it and eventually, the skin breaks down, and you are left with an ulcer, but actually beneath the skin is lots of dead and dying tissue that the victim is unaware of.”
If a GP can diagnose Buruli ulcer early, a PCR test can quickly confirm the infection and specific antibiotics that will effectively treat it.
The infection is not lethal but if left untreated people are left with lesions that can affect quality of life during treatment, and afterwards when they’re left with a lifelong disfigurement or disability, Stinear said.
Mika said her ulcer is healing and “heading in the right direction”.
“Hindsight is 2020. GPs can’t know everything but it’s a shame that they weren’t aware [the disease] was in Melbourne – it might have been diagnosed sooner.”"
UGJWNV1HZN_70E9YUZCYXNCJAR,Danish village under threat from landslide of contaminated soil,Miranda Bryant,_,20230125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/25/danish-village-threat-landslide-contaminated-soil-olst,"People in a Danish village are living in fear of their homes being overrun by a landslide of contaminated soil in one of the worst environmental disasters in the country’s history.
The landslide is slowly moving towards Ølst, a village of 400 inhabitants south of Randers in Jutland, after the soil started moving at a nearby plant, run by Nordic Waste, where it has already demolished buildings.
At least 2m tonnes of contaminated soil is believed to be moving at 2 metres a day – having slowed down from 9 metres a day – and is predicted by experts to be heading towards the village. It is feared it could pollute the Alling Å River.
A report by the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS) into the scandal, which has prompted outrage across Denmark, found the landslide was caused by human, not natural, activity. It is understood to include material from Norway.
Cleanup costs are expected to reach 205m Danish kroner (£23.5m) over the next six months and could eventually run into the billions.
Nordic Waste, whose website tagline is “we give the earth new life”, last week declared itself bankrupt, saying: “Unfortunately, the landslide has reached such a scale that we as a company are unable to take up the task of combating it.”
Rene Møller Larsen, whose business is 500 metres up the hill from the landslide and has lived in the area for decades, said the usually peaceful rural community had been left shaken.
“They have been shocked. And then the garbage [contaminated soil] was moving so fast. The worst case was it came to the village,” he said. While the progress of the landslide has slowed significantly, he believes it will take months before the full impact becomes clear. “What is the meaning of taking garbage to Denmark? They only see one thing: money.”
There had been speculation in Denmark that the landslide may have been caused by recent heavy rain. However Kristian Svennevig, a senior GEUS researcher and one of the authors of the report into the disaster, said it found evidence dating back to 2021 of the movement, which gathered pace last year before becoming public in December.
“What we concluded is that it is not a natural phenomenon, it is a man-made phenomenon and climate change is not to blame,” he said. “It is basically the polluted soil itself that is sliding and it started sliding in the relatively dry years of 2021 and 2022, which is something you would not expect from a natural landslide.”

While some of the most imminent dangers have been mitigated, millions of tonnes of contaminated soil are still on the move and it is not yet certain how fast it is moving or how far it will reach. The environment minister, Magnus Heunicke, has said the disaster is still in “the acute phase”.
Svennevig said the creation of a computer model of the landslide would help to better constrain its future path and that the disaster was “already the biggest in this century and it is still developing”.

UIHID7AY4L_OPQG5NU8TPJJTQZ,Starmer calls for Nottingham attacks inquiry amid sentence review request,Jamie Grierson,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/26/nottingham-attacks-attorney-general-considering-killes-sentence-review-valdo-calocane,"Keir Starmer has added his voice to calls for an inquiry into any failings that led to the fatal Nottingham knife attacks.
The attorney general is considering whether judges should review the sentence of the killer, Valdo Calocane, after receiving a submission that it could be unduly lenient.
A judge handed down a restricted hospital order to the 32-year-old, who has paranoid schizophrenia and whose pleas to manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility were accepted this week.
The families of the three people he killed have reacted angrily to the sentencing and accused prosecutors of a fait accompli in accepting a manslaughter charge rather than pursuing a murder verdict.
They said the search would continue for answers from police, health authorities and the Crown Prosecution Service about “missed opportunities”.
Starmer, a former head of the CPS, said the deaths were “absolutely awful” as he backed the demand for an inquiry into the case.
The Labour leader told ITV’s This Morning: “As far as the sentence is concerned, obviously there are mental health issues in this particular case, and the attorney general has got the power to review it, and I think that probably makes sense, and have it double checked by the court of appeal.
“But I think alongside the sentence, I am very worried by what appear to be a number of points at which action could have been taken that would have prevented this happening. The family are saying there needs to be an inquiry into that. I think they’re right about that. I think somebody outside of this, independent, needs to look at exactly what happened, what were the points at which there could have been an intervention and why it didn’t happen. That is the least that these families are owed.”
Calocane, who goes by the name Adam Mendes, denied murdering Barnaby Webber and Grace O’Malley-Kumar, both 19-year-old students, and Ian Coates, a 65-year-old school caretaker, but admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility due to suffering from paranoid schizophrenia.
He also admitted the attempted murder of three other people whom he ran over in a van. After the crown accepted his pleas, Calocane was sentenced at Nottingham crown court on Thursday to indefinite detention in a high-security hospital.
A spokesperson for the attorney general, Victoria Prentis, confirmed her office had received a referral arguing the sentence been unduly lenient.
It gives the cabinet minister 28 days from sentencing to review the request and decide whether to refer the case to the court of appeal to determine whether the sentence was appropriate. Only one referral is required to trigger the process.
Webber’s mother, Emma, criticised the CPS decision to downgrade the charge from murder. However, the attorney general’s considerations are unlikely to look at whether the correct charge was pursued.
Any person or institution can ask for a sentence to be reviewed if they have reason to think it is unduly lenient.
Calocane, who studied mechanical engineering at Nottingham University, stabbed O’Malley-Kumar and Webber in the early hours of 13 June last year when they were walking home from a night out.
He went on to stab Coates, who was driving to work, before stealing his van and driving it into pedestrians in the city centre. Wayne Birkett, Marcin Gawronski and Sharon Miller sustained serious injuries but survived.
Calocane was sectioned under the Mental Health Act four times before the killings. After he was discharged from hospital in 2022, several attempts were made to contact him but no response was received.
At the time of the attacks, a warrant for Calocane’s arrest was outstanding after he had failed to appear in court nine months earlier for the alleged assault of a police officer while he was being sectioned."
ULE2KY8904_6HDLJQAKRFHKYEC,Met urges public to avoid ‘unhelpful’ comments about baby found in east London,Sammy Gecsoyler,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/26/met-urges-public-avoid-unhelpful-comments-baby-found-newham-east-london,"The Metropolitan police have urged the public to refrain from making “unnecessary and unhelpful” comments about a newborn found alive in a shopping bag last week.
The force used its latest appeal for information to say those commenting had no idea what the baby’s mother was going through, and gave a description of two people they would like to speak to.
The newborn girl, whom hospital staff named Elsa after the main character form Frozen, was found wrapped in blankets last Friday in Newham, east London. Officers said they believed Elsa was born after a concealed pregnancy.
The Met has identified two people it wants to speak to. Ch Supt Simon Crick, lead for policing in Newham, said: “Baby Elsa is safe and well. I’m sure people will have seen recent reporting that she has now left hospital.
“My team are continuing their work. We’ve collected a considerable volume of CCTV footage. While we’re still examining it in detail, we have identified a woman we would like to speak to, and a witness who may have seen her.
“We believe the woman is black, was wearing a large dark coat with a light-coloured scarf or hood around her neck and had a rucksack on her back. We believe this woman entered the Greenway from High Street South and left the Greenway heading in the direction of Fabian Street.
“We’re also keen to identify a witness who we think could have seen this woman in the vicinity of the Greenway. He is believed to be male, wearing a dark-coloured hooded coat with a backpack. The coat or backpack has a reflective strip on the rear of it. He exited the Greenway to the left at about 9.10pm.
“If you have information about these people – or you think I might be describing you – I urge you to please, please contact us immediately. It could turn out that you have nothing to do with it, but it’s still incredibly helpful for us to know so we can focus our efforts on other avenues instead.
“I want to appeal directly again to baby Elsa’s mother. Your daughter is safe and well, but we need make sure that you are too. You might need urgent medical care and support, and we can help you. Please call 999 and speak to us, or go to hospital.
“Lastly, I’d like to say that although comments online have been largely incredibly kind, supportive and understanding, there have been a small number of abusive and negative comments that are both unnecessary and unhelpful. All of us are looking at this from a position of privilege in that we have no idea what baby Elsa’s mother is going through.”
Anyone who believes they know the identity of the child’s mother has been asked to call 999, quoting ref CAD 6876/18 Jan."

Meanwhile, at least 12 people were rescued from rips across beaches in three separate incidents on the NSW south coast on Friday, with 26 January being one of the busiest days on Australia’s beaches.
Austinmer beach in Wollongong was closed earlier in the day after a man and a group of teenagers became stuck in a rip on opposite ends of the beach during unpatrolled hours.
Another group of men was rescued from nearby Woonona beach after being caught in a rip while swimming outside the red and yellow flags.
Surf Life Saving NSW cautioned those who plan to hit the beach that drowning risk climbs by four times on 26 January.
“The statistics show that Australia Day is one of the busiest days of the year on our beaches and is always a big day for our volunteer surf lifesavers and lifeguards,” the Surf Life Saving NSW chief executive, Steven Pearce, said.
“Enjoy the weekend but make sure that if you’re heading to the beach, visit a patrolled location and only swim between the red and yellow flags.”

All drownings occurred at an unpatrolled location, or outside patrol hours and the red and yellow flags.
The warning comes after a nurse, two students and a woman on holiday from India died when they were caught in a rip at Forrest Caves beach on Phillip Island on Wednesday.
The NSW emergency services minister, Jihad Dib, said the dangers of swimming at unpatrolled and remote locations had been tragically highlighted across the summer.
“Surf lifesavers are anticipating an extreme level of activity over the coming days, so we are asking everyone to be water safety conscious and support our volunteers by listening to their advice,” he said."
UQZ380QGST_V87NQDNHH5LIVMD,Fighter review – India’s pizazz-free Top Gun weighed down by patriotic propaganda,Phuong Le,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/jan/26/fighter-review-indias-pizazz-free-top-gun-weighed-down-by-patriotic-propaganda,"Fresh off the megahit Pathaan, director Siddharth Anand is back with yet another star vehicle, this time pairing Indian superstars Hrithik Roshan and Deepika Padukone on screen for the first time. Aiming to valorise the tribulations and triumphs of the Indian air force, Fighter inevitably invites comparisons to the Top Gun franchise. The parallel extends to more than mere visual similarities: these films are all made with the approval and support of the military in their countries.
While the recent Top Gun update Maverick coyly constructs a faceless, stateless enemy, Fighter goes full throttle into an India v Pakistan showdown. Considering the current state of Hindi cinema, such hyper-nationalistic storytelling is to be expected, but the film offers little in terms of action pizazz. CGI-ed to death, the much-hyped scenes of aerial combat are flat, lifeless and utterly forgettable. Sentimental speeches of patriotic allegiance weigh down the love story between Roshan’s cocky squadron leader Patty and Padukone’s fiery fighter pilot Minni. Out of uniform their characters become so much more human that one wishes Roshan and Padukone could have just starred in a propaganda-free romance instead.
The need to wrap jingoism and commercial thrills into one neat package also results in one ludicrous sequence after another. Racy musical interludes – item songs – are haphazardly inserted throughout; at one point, a flight mission awkwardly cuts to an out-of-place daydream in which the two scantily clad stars groove to a sizzling tune in some distant seaside resort. Even when the camera gazes in awe at aircraft shooting through the sky, it dutifully pauses to take in roadside billboards on which ads for house paint are prominently displayed. Patriotism sells, but product placement pays the bills, too.

UUWIQ2MCXI_TZR3P4X59SYJZ93,Ticket to ride: why 2024 could be your year of travelling sustainably,_,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/i-came-by-train/2024/jan/12/ticket-to-ride-why-2024-could-be-your-year-of-travelling-sustainably,"There’s something truly joyful about travelling by train. Swapping roads clogged with cars for a cosy seat on board isn’t just more comfortable and enjoyable – think views of rolling countryside as you snake towards your destination – it’s significantly better for the environment, too.
Taking the train instead of driving creates 67% less CO2*, meaning that switching road for rail is one of the simplest ways regular car users can limit their impact on the environment. If you’re someone who is looking to be more sustainable in 2024, why not swap your car keys for a train ticket next time you travel?
With the climate crisis showing no signs of slowing, the sustainability argument for rail travel is powerful. But there are more than just environmental benefits to taking the train, as people from up and down Britain are keen to point out …
Loves train travel for: WFT (working from train) “I travel by train once or twice a week from Totnes to Paddington for work. We moved to Devon as a family as I run my business from there, but I often have meetings in London so we knew we needed great connections to the capital.
“I love being able to sit and work on the train so that when I get to my destination I can get on with my day. On the rare occasion I do drive, I never know how long the journey will take. It’s also exhausting having to concentrate for four or five hours!
“I do like the fact that train travel is better for the environment – it’s just another benefit on top of all the other great reasons – and knowing how much less polluting it is than car travel is all the more compelling. But I already love it, so I’m easily swayed!”
Loves train travel for: meeting new people “I have a best friend who lives in Oxfordshire, so we meet halfway for a day together every couple of months, and it’s usually in Birmingham or Leamington Spa.
“Travelling by train from my local station in Narborough means I can be in my own little bubble – reading and listening to music, or talking to strangers who by the end of the journey are often friends. In fact, my best friend frequently meets me at the other end and her first question is always: ‘Who did you make friends with today?’.
“Environmental factors absolutely encourage me to use public transport. I have a small car but always think it’s a waste if I’m travelling alone on longer journeys. We should all be doing our bit to look after the planet.”
A simple swap to make an environmental impactCars and planes create 58%* of the UK’s transport CO2 emissions, while the entire rail network adds up to just 1.5%. It’s almost always better to swap a car ride for a train journey, because taking the train instead of driving creates 67% less CO2*.
I came by train is a movement, supported by the digital rail booking platform Trainline, that draws on the combined power of small actions taken by many to create a bigger impact. Whether it’s a commute, a holiday or a family get-together, swap one journey in 2024 and help create a collective impact with the thousands of others who have already pledged to choose train travel for the environment this year.
Loves train travel for: not having to fly! “I don’t drive or like flying very much, so I enjoy the relaxing nature of a train journey, watching the scenery glide past, plus the convenience of travelling point to point without having to hang around in soulless airports. I love trains so much, in fact, I even got engaged on one!
“I’m an advocate of trains anyway, but knowing that travelling by them is less detrimental to the environment is a benefit that cements the case.”
Loves train travel for: watching the world go by“I travel by train once or twice a term between Southampton and Devon. I can use a 16-25 Railcard and get travel cheaper, plus it’s convenient and not overpacked.
“I like watching the world go by, with scenic views of the countryside, and I can while away the time doing work on my laptop.
“Living in the countryside, my car gets me to places that public transport doesn’t go anywhere near, but travelling by train can often be quicker as you don’t run into traffic jams! Both definitely have their benefits.”
Loves train travel for: visiting friends “I regularly use the train to go to seaside towns such as Hastings from London Bridge, or Leigh-on-Sea from Liverpool Street. I meet up with friends, and we walk along the coast and eat at fish restaurants.
“When I was working, some of my jobs came with wonderful cars. But as I now live in the capital, I decided there was no longer a need for one, particularly as the public transport is so good. I gave up my driving licence last year – for health and environmental reasons – so I can’t even hire a car any more.
“As long as it’s easy to get to the station, train travel is infinitely easier than getting about by car. You can walk around, use the bathroom without having to stop, and often meet interesting people along the way.”
Loves train travel for: getting inspired“I usually travel by train a few times a month for work, mostly to London or occasionally farther afield to France, Belgium and the Netherlands. I would always pick the train over a plane.
“Minimising my carbon footprint is definitely a factor in choosing to travel by train – and it’s less stressful than driving.
“On a train you get to see the landscape from a different perspective than when driving or flying. I recently got the train to Italy via Germany, and the opportunity to travel through the Brenner Pass and see the incredible views more than made up for a slower journey. I’m also a writer, and recently travelled around Italy by train while researching my novel – it was truly magical. I love whizzing past people’s houses and wondering what it would be like to live there. On the train, I can’t help people-watching and imagining where others are travelling to and why.”

UWAOYU6C39_SD722IAGXU3GMVV,"Kim Williams is more than just a former Murdoch boss, but his new role does not make it his ABC",_,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/24/kim-williams-new-abc-chair-more-than-just-former-news-corp-ceo,"The ABC has a new chairman in Kim Williams and once again across the media landscape the hares are running.
You can take your pick: he’s a former Murdoch boss who will hasten News Corp’s takeover of a cowed public broadcaster, or he’s Gough Whitlam’s son-in-law who only got the job because he’s a Labor mate.
At times like this, media observers become like Kremlin-watchers, reading deep meaning into tiny snippets of fact, rumour and gossip. The next step will be for someone to send body language experts to his first speech as ABC chair.
In the meantime, here’s what we do know. Williams is a formidable public intellectual with a long history in media and the arts. He was one of the nominations of the independent panel established to choose the best candidates on merit.
Unlike the former Coalition government, Labor actually took the advice of this panel in making the appointment. To that extent, we are off to a good start.
For those keen to see what type of leader the new chairman will be, they won’t have to wait long. The ABC is now embroiled in a series of rolling crises, any one of which has the potential to deeply damage the public broadcaster.
It is facing the perennial challenge of declining audiences, changing media consumption behaviours and clearly inadequate funding. It is under public attack for a range of perceived biases that begin with systemic leftwing sympathies and progress all the way through to strong conservative leanings due to News Corp infiltration, with smatterings of antisemitism and pro-Israeli bias along the way.
To top it off, there is concern about a lack of support within the organisation for its increasingly diverse workforce, and a growing trust deficit between staff and management.
Williams will have a vital role to play in all of these matters. He will need to find ways of bring staff and management together again in pursuit of a common cause, and he will need to build both public and government support for the best that public broadcasting can be.
In my 40 years at the ABC and SBS, the best chairs I saw were passionate, influential and persuasive in their public defence of their organisations, while privately and internally ensuring that management upheld the finest traditions of independence, rigour, impartiality, efficiency and transparency in the way they ran the place.
Public champions, private watchdogs.
As we all settle in to see what kind of leader Williams proves to be at the ABC, there is one other vital factor we need to keep in mind. It is a particularly important factor given his decades of experience in running media organisations.
Over many decades, the ABC has had some extraordinary leaders – people who have built the ABC into one of the world’s best and most trusted public broadcasters. There have also been poor leaders – indecisive, divisive, and prone to putting the ABC on the front pages for all the wrong reasons. You can decide which names belong on which of those lists, but the names were very familiar to each generation of Australians, from the veteran “father” of public broadcasting Charles Moses to Mark Scott, David Hill, Jonathan Shier, Brian Johns, Michelle Guthrie and the delectably named Talbot Duckmanton.
All of them – good, bad and indifferent – had one crucial characteristic of their leadership.
They were managing directors of the ABC, not chairmen. There is no place in any well-functioning ABC for a chair who wants to manage the organisation and drive the decisions, unless of course you “do a David Hill” as chairman, by removing and replacing your managing director so you can do the job yourself.
The ABC board and its chair may help chart the course for a modern ABC, using the ABC Charter as a guide, but it will always be the managing director who has the hand on the tiller to steer the ship.
Ironically, the more impressed we are with an incoming chairman’s breadth of vision and experience as a media manager, the more we have to hope he understands the importance of leaving the managing to those whose job it is.
If the decision proves to be a good one, it will be no more Kim’s ABC than it should have been Ita’s ABC. It’s our ABC, and all of us would do well to remember that.

UWQF2KTD0M_0Y8T97LBIPKP83J,‘It was like a toxic relationship’: the exiled Russian musicians starting again abroad,Graeme Thomson,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/jan/25/russian-musicians-starting-again-abroad-lucidvox-inturist,"‘We can say what we feel,” says Nadya Samodurova, “but we needed to move to another country to do so.” Half of the acclaimed Russian psych-rock band Lucidvox are speaking to me, via video link, from a modest room in the Serbian capital Belgrade. It’s where Samodurova and Anna Moskvitina, the group’s drummer and bassist, have moved to since the war against Ukraine began because, as Samodurova puts it: “It’s really dangerous to speak out in Russia.”
“I felt like I needed to move,” adds Moskvitina, “because I don’t want to pretend that I’m someone else.”
Their two bandmates, Alina Evseeva and Galla Gintovt, have also left, and are now based in Israel and Germany respectively. Like many of their musician friends, the ongoing conflict has made them exiles.
It is a dangerous time to be an outspoken Russian artist. In November, a court sentenced Aleksandra “Sasha” Skochilenko, a musician, artist and activist from St Petersburg, to seven years in prison for “knowingly spreading false information about the Russian army” in March 2022. Skochilenko had replaced five price tags in a local supermarket with pieces of paper urging shoppers to stop the war and resist propaganda on television.
Since the war began in February 2022, the alternative Russian music scene has lost many of its leading players. Not only Lucidvox, who recently released their second album, That’s What Remained, to widespread praise, but also artists such as Gnoomes and Kate NV, who have all based themselves abroad, and see little prospect of returning. “It doesn’t seem possible in the near future,” says Moskvitina. “To be mentally stable, it’s better not to think about it.”
Evgeny Gorbunov is a musician, media artist, indie label owner and guitarist in the band Glintshake. His solo project Inturist blends avant-rock, psychedelia, kosmiche and off-kilter electronica. New album, Off-Season, is his sixth. “It’s ironic stuff about a long term vacation,” he says. “That feeling where you are a bit lost in a new place and don’t know what will happen next.”
Gorbunov now lives in Berlin, his third move since the war began, following spells in Slovenia and Tel Aviv. “The main reason is the war,” he says. “I don’t support the regime. You can go to jail for a long, long time just for posting something about the president.”
For Samodurova, whose day job is in the music industry, there were pragmatic reasons for leaving Russia as well as ideological ones. “I’m involved with a few showcase festivals in Moscow that bring artists from all over the world, and we realised that we can’t bring international artists to Moscow any more. Also, I didn’t want to go on stage and play with artists who support the war.”
Moskvitina emphasises that some musicians who have remained are also anti-war and anti-Putin. Their friends in the band Shortparis have chosen to stay in St Petersburg. “They are against the war but they want to stay and say something and support their friends,” she says. “Underground music has gone even more underground. These people are the bravest we know, because it’s not safe at all.”
This is no exaggeration. “You can say something [negative] on Instagram and go to prison for five years,” says Samodurova. “Day by day, people we know, activists, have this. People are really scared to say something on social networks because they don’t want to go to prison. The last protest I was at after the war started, it was really aggressive for people.”
There is also another risk. “The danger of being recruited into the military is real, but you have a choice,” says Gorbunov. “My friends would prefer jail to going to war.”
I speak to Gnoomes, now a duo consisting of Sasha Piankov and his wife Masha, while they are back in their home city of Perm, 1,200 km east of Moscow, finalising the paperwork that will allow them to relocate permanently to Slovenia, where Masha’s parents have a house. It’s an anxious time. “My parents just received a letter saying I am invited to the military office,” says Sasha. “That’s not the official summons, but it’s still scary. If I receive an official paper about the army, I don’t know how it’s going to be. We don’t feel safe here. Even inside our families, it is tricky to talk.”
Similarly, even in exile, Samodurova is “a little nervous, because I am doing a festival which creates some positive noise against the war, and also we have the band. I want to have the opportunity to go back to see my relatives. I could be nervous, but I don’t want to shut up.”
Gnoomes can’t wait to leave for good. “We wanted to do it for a long time,” says Masha. “The war was a kick in the ass. We were living in a bubble and Covid made it worse. We would destroy our career as musicians if we stayed here.” While in Perm, they take refuge in what Sasha calls “inner emigration”. In their heads, they are already gone.
Gnoomes’ situation highlights a divide. In Moscow, says Moskvitina, “in our environment, among artistic and creative people, I don’t know one person from our generation who supports Putin and the war. But Moscow is not Russia, you know? It’s a very European city, with lots of creative people. In the regions there could be other opinions because they have different lives.”
“It’s not like Moscow in Perm,” Masha confirms. “Here, you cannot find a bottle of Coca-Cola.” All the artists agree that older generations are much less likely to question official news channels and pro-Putin propaganda.

Art can transcend borders, but despite being vocally resistant to the war, some Russian artists have been subject to negative reactions within the global music community. In October, British duo Giant Swan and Swiss-born Aïsha Devi, cancelled appearances at Serbian music festival Changeover because Russians were part of the organising team, which includes Samodurova. “Some artists cancelled because they had a lot of aggression from Ukrainian people,” says Samodurova. “But we have Ukrainian people working on the festival, and my colleague is on the list of people who are dangerous in Russia. He can’t go back. We made some posts explaining our views. I don’t want to answer with aggression. We do what we want to do, to help artists play music and share some feelings.”
She worries that it may affect the way people react to Lucidvox. “I saw a few [negative] comments on Facebook when we released the single. I have a fear that some people will not listen to the album but will just go to the comments and say, ‘Russians, fuck you!’ It’s really sad. Some people don’t know what is going on in Russia and how the government is really dangerous for people. Also, it’s hard for us to live a new life. We’ve had difficult conversations with our relatives. I heard some words from my father, like, ‘You’re not my daughter any more.’”
“When the war started, there was this mass hysteria about cancelling Russian culture, and I was confused,” says Gorbunov. “You want to be part of society, but you also understand that it’s not fair, because in the counterculture in Russia, most personalities oppose the repressive machine. The Russian government withheld funding for modern culture for many years, because it is not traditional. Art is an instrument of protest, so cancelling Russian culture is not really a smart decision.” Happily, he says, “I haven’t met one person who has judged me.”
Lucidvox’s album was mostly recorded in Moscow in 2020. The impact of the war has since made their creative lives much more complicated. “Before, we had very regular rehearsals, we would meet a lot and talk,” says Samodurova. “Now it’s much harder.”
“We didn’t see each other for a year,” says Moskvitina. “We met in Moscow a year ago, and we had one day of rehearsal! Hopefully, it should be easier now that Nadya and I live in the same city and can make music together.”
Along with the disruption, there has also been opportunity. New creative communities are forming, and there is a sense of excitement and regeneration. Belgrade is a hub for émigré Russian artists; one reason Gnoomes opted for Slovenia was because they are now only a five-hour drive from the Serbian capital. Originally, they considered moving to the UK on a global talent visa, but Brexit made it financially impossible to tour mainland Europe from Britain. “We’ve always felt safe in Europe,” says Masha.
Gorbunov has found maintaining his band Glintshake “complicated … our bass player has a son and a big family and he can’t break the connection [to Russia]. Our other members are scattered around the world. We didn’t have a rehearsal for more than a year.”
Yet with Inturist, he is making vibrant connections, including with a creative hub in the Italian city of Brescia. “I left Russia and I think now that I will be out for a long, long time,” he says. “It was like a toxic relationship – you normalise a lot of things that seem wild and crazy from the outside. I don’t really want to go back now. I want to integrate in other societies. There are a lot of people scattered around the world who make something on this niche level, and we understand each other. I feel like a fish in the ocean. Very excited.”
That’s What Remained is out now on Glitterbeat. Lucidvox are touring Europe in March; Off-Season by Inturist is out now on Incompetence."
UX414BO63B_E00VY7QCV33DBLY,Michigan school shooter’s mother on trial for manslaughter in student deaths,_,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/23/michigan-school-shooter-mother-on-trial-manslaughter,"Jury selection began on Tuesday in the trial of the mother of a teenager who carried out a deadly mass shooting at his school on involuntary manslaughter charges in an unusual effort to pin criminal responsibility on the shooter’s parents for the deaths of four students.
Jennifer and James Crumbley are not accused of knowing their son planned to kill fellow students at Oxford high school in 2021. But prosecutors said they made a gun accessible to Ethan Crumbley, ignored his mental health needs and declined to take him home when confronted with his violent drawings at school on the day of the attack.
Involuntary manslaughter has been “well-defined for ages, and its elements are definite and plain: gross negligence causing death”, the assistant prosecutor Joseph Shada said in a court filing.
More than 200 people appeared on Tuesday at Oakland county court, 40 miles (65km) north of Detroit, to begin the jury selection process in Jennifer Crumbley’s trial. James Crumbley is set to face a separate trial in March.
In December, Ethan was sentenced to life in prison after pleading guilty to murder, terrorism and other crimes.
It is a notable case: the Crumbleys are the first parents to be charged in a mass US school shooting. The mother of a six-year-old Virginia boy who wounded his teacher with a gun was recently sentenced to two years in prison for child neglect.
“I think prosecutors are feeling pressure when these weapon-related offenses occur,” said Eve Brensike Primus, who teaches criminal procedure at the University of Michigan law school. “People are outraged, and they’re looking for someone to take responsibility for it.”
There’s no dispute that James Crumbley, 47, bought a gun with Ethan at his side four days before the shooting – the teen called it “my new beauty”. Jennifer Crumbley, 45, took him to a shooting range and described the outing on Instagram as a “mom and son day”.
A day before the shooting, the school informed Jennifer Crumbley that Ethan, who was 15, was looking at ammunition on his phone. “I’m not mad,” she texted him. “You have to learn not to get caught.”
Defense attorneys insist the tragedy was not foreseeable by the parents. They liken the charges to trying to put a “square peg into a round hole”.
“After every school shooting, the media and those affected are quick to point to so-called ‘red flags’ that were missed by those in the shooter’s life,” Shannon Smith and Mariell Lehman said in an unsuccessful effort to get the Michigan supreme court to dismiss the charges. “But the truth of the matter is one cannot predict the unimaginable.”
At his sentencing, Ethan, now 17, told a judge that he was a “really bad person” who could not stop himself.
“They did not know, and I did not tell them what I planned to do, so they are not at fault,” he said of his parents.
A few hours before the shooting, the Crumbleys were summoned to Oxford high school. Ethan had drawn violent images on a math assignment with the message: “The thoughts won’t stop. Help me.”
The parents were told to get him into counseling, but they declined to remove him from school and left campus after fewer than 30 minutes, according to investigators. Ethan had brought a gun from home that day, 30 November 2021, though no one checked his backpack.
The shooter surrendered to police after killing four students and wounding seven more people. The parents were charged a few days later, but they weren’t easy to find. Police said they were hiding in a building in Detroit.
The Crumbleys have been in jail for more than two years awaiting trial, unable to afford a $500,000 bond. Involuntary manslaughter in Michigan carries a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison."
UYM1IEFIXH_GPN7BFKI7HJWDN1,"Constance Marten and Mark Gordon say baby girl died after 16 days, court hears",Caroline Davies,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/26/constance-marten-and-mark-gordon-say-baby-girl-died-after-16-days-court-hears,"A couple whose newborn baby died after they went off-grid camping in freezing winter weather to evade authorities maintain she lived just 16 days and was kept “warm and dry” and “well nourished”, a court has heard.
Constance Marten, 36, and Mark Gordon, 49, are accused of keeping baby Victoria in a Lidl “bag for life” and dumping her body “like it was refuse” in a disused shed inside the shopping bag covered in rubbish.
But for the “reckless, utterly selfish, callous, cruel, arrogant and ultimately grossly negligent” conduct of the couple, whose four other children have previously been taken into care, their baby would still be alive, an Old Bailey jury has been told.
In a defence address to the jury, Gordon’s counsel, John Femi-Ola KC, said the defence would maintain baby Victoria was born on 24 December 2022 and died on 9 January 2023.
The circumstances “heartbreakingly described” by Marten to police after arrest were that Victoria had died inside her jacket as she fell asleep sitting up and cross-legged, and that was “entirely consistent with the findings of the pathologist”, said Femi-Ola.
He added that Marten had said she bought a petrol on 12 January 2023 “to cremate baby Victoria, but she couldn’t do it”.
The defence would question the prosecution’s assertion that Victoria was “alive for several weeks after 12 January” and the assertion that “baby Victoria was carried around in a Lidl bag for life”, he added.
Femi-Ola said Marten had told police she wanted a postmortem and that there had been an attempt to preserve the baby. “She wanted to find out why her beloved baby died, her beloved baby,” said Femi-Ola.
Turning to the accusation that the couple went off-grid to evade authorities, he said: “The crown are saying they went off-grid. As you listen to the evidence, you may ask yourself: ‘were they driven off grid?’”
Tom Little KC, prosecuting, earlier told jurors that the couple had failed to provide warmth and shelter from the cold, wind and rain by camping in mid-winter in the South Downs national park with a baby in a “babygrow and not much else”, and had failed to seek medical assistance when she was cold.
The conditions the baby was in “when sleeping rough rapidly worsened and quickly reached stages that were inhuman”, he said. It was a “clear case of cruelty by virtue of neglect and exposure”.
At the time of their arrest, the defendants were “filthy, exhausted and starving” and plainly in no position to look after a child, he said.
They had “told nobody” of the pregnancy, and made a “sustained endeavour” to conceal the birth by “hiding the body in a place where it is unlikely to be found”, Little added.
“It is difficult to see what accommodating a newborn baby in a flimsy tent, in midwinter, without proper heating, limited access to food and very little clothing creates, other than a serious and obvious risk of hypothermia and death,” said Little.
It was “no mistake”, and “no serious error of judgment” but a “paradigm example of gross negligence”, he said. He continued: “They wanted to prevent the child being taken into the care that she so dearly needed.’”
Marten, whom the jury has heard comes from a wealthy family, and Gordon, both of no fixed address, deny manslaughter by gross negligence of the girl between 4 January and 27 February last year. They are also charged with perverting the course of justice, concealing the birth of a child, child cruelty, and causing or allowing the death of a child.
The court has heard the couple came to police attention when their car caught fire on the M61 on 5 January 2023. While they fled, they left most of their possessions behind, and a placenta was found in the vehicle wrapped in a towel, prompting a nationwide alert.
The couple subsequently took taxis to Liverpool, Harwich, London and New Haven before camping in the South Downs, They were arrested after being spotted in Brighton on 27 February 2023 without the baby, whose body was found in the shed after a search of countryside on 1 March 2023.
The jury heard statements from witnesses who saw the couple but saw no signs of any baby, including from a recovery driver who attended their broken down car on the M18 on 28 December, and a receptionist at the Ibis Hotel at Lymm services, in Cheshire, when Marten checked in at 4.30am looking “very tired”.
A receptionist at the AC hotel in Salford, where Marten checked in at 11pm on 4 January, did not see a baby either, but thought because of Marten’s body shape, and the way Gordon put a guiding hand on her hip, that “at this point I thought she could have been pregnant”.
A few hours after the couple checked out on 5 January, their replacement car caught fire on the M61, the court heard. Kenneth Hudson, who was driving behind them, said he pulled over on to the hard shoulder to call emergency services at 6.19pm and to offer help. He saw Marten dashing from the flames as Gordon began unloading their possessions.
Hudson said: “I could see she was carrying a bundle, and at the top of that bundle was a baby’s head.” He said he asked Marten: “Is the baby OK?’ And she replied: “She’s fine” before telling him it was OK to leave them.
He said he put his hand on the baby’s head. “It felt quite cold but it was January.” In the 10 minutes he spent on the hard shoulder he said he did not see the baby move or make any noise.
Questioned by defence counsel Tom Godfrey, who said Marten disputed that ever happened and said she would never allow someone to touch her baby’s head, Hudson replied: “I touched the baby’s head. The reason I know was because throughout the year I’ve been cut-up myself, because I believe had I stayed with that vehicle that baby might still be alive.”
Hudson’s son, Jack, who was travelling with his father, also told the court he could see the baby’s head out of the top of the blankets.

UYO7CRLKR3_T69A2FVEDRLHUG4,How British American Tobacco lobbied Kenya to water down nicotine pouch warnings,Sarah Marsh,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/jan/23/how-big-tobacco-forced-kenya-to-temper-nicotine-pouch-warning-labels,"The Kenyan government weakened health warnings on nicotine pouches after British American Tobacco said it would pull investment from a new factory in the country’s capital, an investigation has revealed.
Letters between British American Tobacco (BAT) and the Ministry of Health show the government yielded to the tobacco giant’s demand to sell Velo – one of the biggest-selling nicotine pouch brands globally – with significantly smaller health warnings and without mentioning potentially cancer-causing toxicants present in the products.
The letters are among documents shared with the Guardian and Africa Uncensored, and obtained by the investigative news outlet the Examination, which reveal the industry’s influence over policy in the east African country.
Existing tobacco regulations in Kenya stipulate that such labels must cover a third of the package and include information about the health hazards of the product. BAT lobbied to reduce the size of the warning, the letters show. The Ministry of Health agreed that Velo could be sold with a small warning saying: “This product contains nicotine and is addictive.”
In the UK, warning labels also inform consumers that nicotine pouches are “not risk-free” because they contain traces of tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs), cancer-causing compounds that are also present in cigarettes.
Velo pouches have gained global popularity, including among Kenya’s youth. TikTok videos of young Kenyans using Velo have amassed millions of views, and academic research shows the product being is sold in schools.
A draft report by a government taskforce, which was then leaked to the Examination, accuses tobacco companies of targeting young people. Fearing a new generation will become addicted to nicotine and that the pouches could be a gateway to smoking, the taskforce is calling for strict regulation of the products. Other politicians are demanding an outright ban.
The revelations about BAT’s role in shaping health warnings in Kenya come amid an industry-wide drive to sell more “smoke-free” – yet still addictive – nicotine products across the globe.
The global market for nicotine pouches, one of many “smoke-free” products, was $3bn (£2.36bn) in 2021. BAT views Kenya as one of its key “test markets” in low and middle-income countries, according to its financial presentations, and plans to make the country its base of operations for a rollout of the product across southern and eastern Africa.
However, it isn’t clear how nicotine pouches affect human health over the long term.
In September 2021, BAT’s managing director wrote to the Kenyan health ministry asking for permission for Lyft (as Velo was called when it first entered the market) to be sold with a warning covering just 10% of the pack. It said the “resumption of factory operations” hinged on this smaller warning being approved. “Your positive consideration of this request will allow us to operationalise our factory,” the letter said. The Ministry of Health agreed to allow warnings covering 15% of the front of the pack.
In a statement, a BAT spokesperson said the product’s labelling provides “important safety information” and that the language clearly states that all nicotine pouches are for adults only and should “never be used by those who are underage”.
“Like many other companies, we contribute to the public debate on issues that are important to our consumers, in particular tobacco harm reduction,” the spokesperson said.
Velo are white pouches filled with nicotine, flavouring, and plant fibres that are placed between the lip and gum to release a hit of nicotine. They are inspired by Snus, the Swedish moist tobacco product, but are tobacco-free. The pouches come in a range of flavours including “tropic breeze”, “urban vibe” and “ruby berry”. In Kenya, Velo costs 350 shillings (£1.69) for a small can containing 20 pouches, making them affordable for middle-class Kenyans.
Velo are the only nicotine pouches that can be sold legally in Kenya, but others are smuggled in illegally.
The science around the health effects of nicotine pouches is still emerging, and independent research is lacking because most studies so far have been commissioned by the tobacco industry. Industry research says the products expose users to fewer toxicants than smoking, but concludes that more studies are needed to determine if they reduce the risk of disease.
Nicotine pouches can contain extremely high levels of nicotine and deliver the same amount of nicotine into the bloodstream as a cigarette. The long-term effects of nicotine include high blood pressure and increased risk of stroke and heart failure. Some studies show nicotine can damage developing babies’ brains and adversely affect the development of adolescent brains.
The few independent studies that have been conducted on nicotine pouches have also revealed the presence of cancer-causing TSNAs in most brands. These are compounds that form naturally when tobacco is processed, in this case when nicotine is extracted to add to the pouches.
BAT’s own research has found that Velo nicotine pouches contain the two most dangerous TSNAs, although it says they are not found in “quantifiable” levels.
The American Cancer Society said that while there is evidence that exposure to TSNAs in higher doses (for example, as a result of smoking) is associated with cancer, there are no known long-term studies on exposure to low levels. Scientists from Germany’s Federal Institute for Risk Assessment said nicotine manufacturers should improve their processes to make sure carcinogenic substances such as TSNAs are not present.
Nicotine pouches are fast-evolving products that vary widely and are likely to contain several other chemicals that might be cancer-causing, according to the American Cancer Society. BAT says nicotine pouches have a similar safety profile to nicotine replacement products, such as lozenges and chewing gum.
BAT first launched its nicotine pouches into the Kenyan market in 2019.
The company obtained its licence to sell the products through Kenya’s Pharmacy and Poisons Board, a health ministry department that regulates drugs and medicines. Under that licence, the pouches, then sold under the brand name Lyft, were only to be sold in drug stores.
But BAT and its vendors sold the pouches online and in shops. They advertised the pouches through social media influencers and giveaways at universities. Their popularity soared with young people, including children.
A Kenyan DJ and a TV presenter were among the influencers hosted by BAT at the 2019 Formula One Grand Prix in Abu Dhabi, as part of the company’s sponsorship of the McLaren F1 team. BAT paid the social media team to post hashtags such as #GetLyfted, #LyftxMcLaren and #LyftKenya to followers.
In September 2020, the Kenyan health ministry wrote to the Pharmacy and Poisons Board challenging its decision to license Lyft, which it said was also being sold in vending machines, in violation of the law. BAT said it has never sold its products in vending machines.
The ministry asked for a comprehensive report on the circumstances that led to the Pharmacy and Poisons Board granting BAT a licence to sell its pouches in the first place. The Pharmacy and Poisons Board wrote to BAT Kenya in October 2020, saying Lyft should be sold only by pharmacies and must be withdrawn from retail stores and online marketplaces. It said the product must not be advertised.
In response, BAT temporarily suspended Lyft sales. It told investors it would “continue to engage with the local authorities”.
In January 2021, the health ministry wrote to BAT saying the pouches would now be subject to Kenya’s existing tobacco regulations, which require health warnings that cover about a third of the front of the packaging and half of the back. Before BAT suspended sales of Lyft they were being sold with significantly smaller warnings.
“This is when heavy lobbying now started, letters were written and many meetings held in Afya House [the headquarters for the Kenyan health ministry],” a government public health official told the Examination on condition of anonymity.
The key breakthrough came for BAT shortly after it wrote to the health ministry in September 2021 and threatened to pull investment from a new nicotine pouch factory it had pledged to build in Nairobi, which would serve east and south Africa.
In the letter, Crispin Achola, BAT Kenya’s managing director, told the cabinet health secretary Mutahi Kagwe that “our resumption of factory operations and the sale of Lyft in Kenya hinges on the provision of appropriate text health warnings”.
Achola drew Kagwe’s attention to a subclause in Kenya’s Tobacco Control Act of 2007 that allows the cabinet secretary discretion to alter the health warnings on products via a special directive.
Initially, BAT had pledged more than $15m to build a new factory for the nicotine pouches.
Less than a month after BAT made its threat about the investment, Kagwe permitted BAT to cut the size of the health warnings on the nicotine pouch packaging in half and said the only health warning it had to include was the words: “This product contains nicotine and is addictive”, with no mention of the presence of the cancer-causing toxicants.
As a result, the products were given the green light to re-enter the Kenyan market in June 2022. This is when the pouches, rebranded to Velo, flooded back. The health ministry has not responded with a comment
BAT was given special dispensation to sell nicotine pouches without standard-sized health warnings until July 2023. After that permission expired, the tobacco giant wrote to the health ministry in August asking for an indefinite exemption, “pending the development of specific regulations on this product and related categories”.
The health ministry has not yet responded to BAT. Velo is still on sale although there are shortages in shops. In October and November 2023, multiple shipments of nicotine pouches were impounded at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. It is unclear why but in total, almost 20 tonnes of the product have been seized.
BAT says Velo pouches are targeted only at adult smokers or nicotine users, but experts argue that the products are popular among young Kenyans. This is despite smoking rates being low in that age group.
As data on Velo sales is not made publicly available either by BAT or the Kenyan government, the number of customers, including of young people buying the product, is unknown.
Preliminary data from an unpublished survey by Cyprian Mostert, an assistant professor of global health economics at Aga Khan University’s Brain and Mind Institute in Nairobi, indicates that the nicotine pouches are used mainly by gen Z (those born between 1997 and 2012). The pouches have become especially popular among urban youth, particularly among girls, the research indicates.
“Teachers told us they [nicotine pouches] have already infiltrated the schooling system in Kenya, especially the secondary schools. There is a very drastic upswing into those cohorts because they are marketed as something cool,” Mostert says.
“About 70% of this product is traded online. There are ‘pushers’, illegal guys operating at a community level, that can push these products directly to schools, and security guards that are working in many schools are also part of the pushers and introducing it to the children,” he says.
The drivers of motorcycle taxis, called “boda boda” riders in Kenya, are pushing the products, Mostert says. He was told by a school district official interviewed for the study that teachers had faced disciplinary hearings for selling nicotine pouches to kids.
“School principals are seeing an upswing in the consumption of the product because local traders are driving a misinformation campaign that it is a cool product that can make children feel calm,” he says.
In a statement, BAT told the Examination that it works with retailers “to educate them on minimum age laws and conduct spot checks to ensure minimum age information notices are in place”.
The government taskforce debating the legality of nicotine products is considering new laws that would regulate these products separately from cigarettes, as well as labelling that includes warnings of the health risks.
Joel Gitali, the chair of the Kenya Tobacco Control Alliance, says the government is at a “crossroads”, where it must choose between public health and the economic benefits BAT claims the nicotine pouches will bring to Kenya.
“Kenya is being misused and we have given these people a very good landing ground where they can operate and do anything,” he said. “We are making BAT feel that its home in Africa is Kenya, which is something that is so bad for the region and to the entire generation that we are subjecting to this kind of addiction. It must stop.”

V14JFF9OG5_OAWWHHPDPL50XL7,HyperVerse crypto scheme targeted developing countries before collapse left some investors ‘suicidal’,Sarah Martin,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/24/hyperverse-crypto-scheme-targeted-developing-countries-before-collapse-left-some-investors-suicidal,"The HyperVerse cryptocurrency scheme targeted investors in developing countries across Asia, Africa and the Pacific before its eventual collapse left many people unable to access funds.
In Nepal, some people who took out bank loans to buy packages in HyperVerse said they felt suicidal when they were unable to withdraw their money, with some cases of self-harm, according to one investor.
A UK-based promoter of HyperVerse who went on a tour of five African countries in 2022 told one radio station in Ghana that there were millions of people around the world benefiting from blockchain “without really understanding it”.
HyperVerse, which was linked to an earlier scheme known as HyperFund, was launched by the Australian blockchain entrepreneur Sam Lee and his business partner Ryan Xu, two of the founders of the collapsed Australian company BlockChain Global.
A Guardian Australia investigation has revealed widespread losses to the schemes that escaped regulatory warnings in Australia, despite one overseas regulator warning they were a possible “scam” and another calling HyperVerse a “suspected pyramid scheme”.
The drive to expand the scheme, which encouraged existing members to earn financial rewards for bringing in new ones, appears to have resulted in its spread to previously untapped markets, including developing countries.
In January 2022 the Central Bank of Nepal issued a public warning that named HyperFund and some other unrelated schemes, saying people were being enticed to engage in such crypto currency products with the promise of “high returns in a short period”.
“Given that Virtual Currency/Cryptocurrency is not legally recognized as foreign exchange or currency in Nepal, engaging in the aforementioned illegal financial tools could deceive the public and result in illegal capital flight from the country.”
In a Zoom meeting between Nepali Hyper members and Lee in February 2023, the members said people were angry because they were unable to withdraw funds from the platform.
One member told Lee he was “sad and grumpy”, and was managing demands from people he had brought into the scheme who were unable to access funds.
“You need to do something really fast, mate, because you are somewhere far away and maybe you’re not under pressure directly, but people like us, we are the people who live in the neighbourhoods and our relations have deteriorated, and whenever we wake up in the morning we’ll have people on our doorstep.”
Investors were offered “memberships” to the HyperVerse, which was a “blockchain community” that allowed members to “explore the HyperVerse ecosystem”.
The minimum membership amount was $300USD, which was converted to HyperUnits once invested.
The scheme offered minimum returns of 0.5% a day, with a 300% return over 600 days.
Members were incentivised to “reinvest” their earnings, with more HyperUnits offered if funds were not withdrawn once they became available.
Members were also paid HyperUnits to recruit new members, with referral commissions paid on a sliding scale according to how many people were recruited. Further commissions were paid based on how many people these recruits then recruited, down to 20 levels.
HyperUnits were linked to various crypto tokens and once matured could be withdrawn and converted to other cryptocurrencies.
While early investors profited and were able to make withdrawals, the scheme has left many investors unable to access their funds.
A Nepali man living in the UK told Lee that some people in his home country were suicidal, having taken out bank loans to buy packages in HyperVerse, saying one person he knew had engaged in self harm.
“It was presented in such a lucrative manner that there have been instances where people loaned money to buy packages in this company,” he said. “I know that’s wrong, we never told them to do that, the leaders never told them to do that, but … the benefits outweighed the risk therefore people took some loans from banks and they bought packages in this project.
“I don’t want to say the name but there has been a case of self-harm back home [in Nepal]. We are receiving several SOS-es, you know, because people are in such a condition it’s better for them to just take a suicidal sort of step rather than wait for this company to come out with a plan to pay them back.”
In response, in the Zoom call, Lee said he hoped vulnerable people could be prioritised to get their initial investment back, but denied he was responsible.
“I don’t want to say anything about these individual cases because, you know, I’m not in a position of knowing these cases to be empathetic, right? But, you know, we have to just realise that … a lot of people have been misled in many other industries, this is just the newest industry to be misled in,” Lee said.
“And the way we prevent this from happening again is we need to increase everybody’s literacy around the technology and how these opportunities operate.”
Lee blamed the “corporate” team behind HyperVerse for the situation.
He denied he was involved in HyperVerse, despite speaking at its official launch, saying he was only involved in the funds management side through his role in the HyperTech group, of which he is chairman.
Another person in the February 2023 meeting challenged Lee on this claim.
“Community leaders have always projected you as the man with the Midas touch – HyperTech, HyperVerse, HyperFund, whatever, it’s Sam Lee, it’s Sam Lee, it’s Sam Lee, that is all we have been told day in, day out,” they said.
In response, Lee said: “I cannot really disappear from HyperVerse if I’m never involved.”
“Corporate has put out misleading information, which of course leadership used to drive sales, so ultimately the buck stops with corporate. But I am not 100% free from this because when things have been misinterpreted, I could have always at any time put out a press release or a statement to clarify,” he said.
“But that delay in doing so was because I’ve always trusted corporate to do the right thing because they are very old partners that I’ve worked together with for many, many years. So they’ve always done very well and have done things in a manner that generated the results, but in this case have failed spectacularly the community as well as failed me.”
In December 2021, HyperFund members were “migrated” into HyperVerse, with a global launch event promising to build a metaverse to rival Facebook. The launch event included presentations from Lee, Xu and a chief executive introduced as Steven Reece Lewis, who, in fact, was an Englishman named Stephen Harrison contracted to act the role of a corporate “presenter”, as a Guardian Australia investigation revealed.
Harrison has denied having any contact with either Xu or Lee, playing any role in the underlying business or benefitting from any investor losses.
Shortly after the HyperVerse launch, in March and April 2022, a UK man named Des Amey headed a “financial revolution world tour”, running in-person seminars in Ghana, Nigeria, Tanzania, Kenya and Zambia.
Amey is a director of Amey Finance Academy Ltd, which in July 2022 was the subject of a UK Financial Conduct Authority warning that said: “We believe this firm may be providing financial services or products in the UK without our authorisation” and goes on to confirm “This firm is not authorised by us and is targeting people in the UK. You will not have access to the Financial Ombudsman Service or be protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS), so you are unlikely to get your money back if things go wrong.”
Amey’s website – ameyfinance.com – included a guide on how to join HyperVerse, with a “concierge” service offered to sign people up to the scheme. The website has since been taken down.
In July 2022 Amey was interviewed in a HyperCommunity leadership training video broadcast on Zoom, in which he was presented as a “VIP5 STAR” leader within the group.

Members achieved a star ranking based on how many people they attracted into the scheme, with VIP5 STAR the highest level.
According to the presentation, Amey joined Hyper in April 2021 when the scheme was being run as HyperFund and he subsequently recruited more than 22,000 members across HyperFund and HyperVerse.
In the video, Amey said he was just back from a tour of 11 countries. As well as the five African countries promoted for the speaking circuit, Amey also said he had visited the Seychelles, US, Canada, Jamaica, Germany and the United Arab Emirates. This was unrelated to any promotional material presented in Nepal and there is no evidence to suggest he recruited members there.
“There was real impact, you know the world is now alight with all things Hyper,” he said.
“I’m now a VIP five-star node leader on this platform. This industry and this platform completely changed my life. Now I travel around the world teaching people, you know, mindset – how to become financially independent, not just the theory but giving people practical solutions like the Hyper platform,” he said.
Videos of the events he headlined in Ghana, which were open only to those who had bought tickets, reveal HyperVerse material being promoted.
In media interviews, Amey spoke in general terms about making money through blockchain technology without mentioning HyperVerse.
In an interview with the Ghanaian radio station Starr FM about the “largest blockchain alliance”, Amey said people did not need to understand blockchain technology to take advantage of its rewards.
“There are millions of people around the world who are benefiting from blockchain without really understanding it,” he said.
“And that’s because there are many companies who say, ‘OK, we will do all the legwork … we will do all of the investing, we’ll do all the technical aspects of blockchain, and we will just allow you to benefit financially from all of that’.”
Amey also visited Nigeria in late 2021 and told the Nigerian news service Business Day about a “membership rewards program” that allowed people to buy “houses for cash”.
“We’ve now partnered with a multi-billion dollar company and we have a rewards program where people are paid every single day, and through the compound effect they are able to grow a very small amount of money into a large amount of money in a very short timeframe,” Amey said.
“And people now in Africa, in Asia, and in so many developing countries, are able to use this rewards program to buy houses for cash. It’s a very clear system, it works like clockwork and it does exactly what it says on the tin – our members get paid every single day.”
Amey did not name HyperFund, and at one stage the interviewer asked: “You don’t want to mention that [company] do you?” He replied: “No, no, no.”
He said Nigerians had been interested in becoming involved in the membership scheme and “we’ve had several events … and meetings.”
Amey did not respond to questions from Guardian Australia.
In 2021, the New Zealand-based Kaniva Tonga newspaper reported that Tongans across the diaspora were also being urged to join the scheme. This was unrelated to Amey’s promotional activity.
In February 2023, a US-based Tongan promoter reportedly warned members not to put any more money into the scheme.
“Those of you who have invested tens of thousands, thousands, and hundreds and have yet to withdraw it, Sam Lee will be here in an attempt to refund their money,” the Tongan promoter was quoted as telling her members. According to the report, she claimed that Lee wanted to obtain the names of investors who couldn’t get money out so he could help them retrieve their money.
Lee, who has previously denied the scheme was a scam, did not respond to questions from Guardian Australia.

The government’s offshore petroleum licensing bill passed its second reading on Monday night with 293 votes to 211 against. No Conservative MPs voted against it, and Sharma – the former business secretary who served as president of the Cop26 climate talks – abstained. The legislation would place the North Sea Transition Authority under a duty to run annual applications for new offshore oil and gas licences.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, made up of hundreds of scientists, has said no new oil and gas licences should be granted if the world is to limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Going beyond this would cause climate catastrophe, ruining the lives of millions. UK ministers promised to phase out oil and gas at last year’s Cop28 conference in Dubai.
Referring to minister Graham Stuart who represented the UK at the conference, Sharma said: “My right honourable friend tweeted himself at Cop28 that there must be an unabated phaseout of fossil fuels to meet our climate goals. But today we have a bill before this house, the sole purpose of which is to double down on granting more oil and gas production licences. I do not believe, and it pains me to say this, that this bill will advance that commitment to transition away from fossil fuels.”
He said the bill would not lower bills or create jobs, despite the claims of the energy secretary, Claire Coutinho. Sharma said: “This bill is about improving domestic energy security. But I think we all understand that the oil and gas extracted from the North Sea is owned by private enterprises and the government does not control who it is sold to. We all understand that this does not necessarily lower bills. We have to acknowledge that 200,000 jobs supported by the oil and gas industry have been lost over the last decade, and that is despite hundreds of new drilling licences being issued.”
He added that skills in the oil and gas industry were fully transferrable to green energy and said the government should instead focus on “more wind power, more solar, more nuclear”.
Ed Miliband pointed out that a host of Tories including former net zero tsar, Chris Skidmore, who resigned as an MP over the government’s plans, former prime minister Theresa May and Sharma had all criticised the bill.
The shadow energy secretary referred to the bill as “climate vandalism”, telling the Commons: “We face massive challenges as a country but it isn’t the scale of our problems that is apparent today, it’s the smallness of their response.” He said the bill was “risible” and would not make any difference to Britain’s energy security.
But Coutinho said the bill would “improve energy security here and in Europe”, adding: “We do not live in a world where we can simply turn off oil and gas.” She said the UK was “blessed” with the North Sea and the fossil fuels contained within.
Some Tory MPs expressed concern over the bill. Vicky Ford, MP for Chelmsford said: “The perception internationally is that by granting these licences, the UK may be walking away from our promises on climate change.”
However, she and fellow Conservative Environment Network member, Jerome Mayhew, said they would be voting for the bill but at a later date would vote for amendments that would force the UK oil and gas industry to operate in a lower carbon way.
It was thought Theresa May could rebel as she is understood not to agree with the bill, and she was the prime minister to sign net zero into law. However, she was away from the Commons and therefore abstained.
Skidmore urged his colleagues to vote against the bill. He said: “As I stated in my resignation letter, the future will judge harshly any MP that votes for new additional fossil fuels. Today’s legislation makes no economic sense, will deliver no additional energy security, and breaks the UK’s international commitments on climate action.”
Greenpeace UK’s political campaigner, Ami McCarthy, said: “The government may have won this vote but the planet and everyone on it has lost as a result. Literally no one benefits from this nonsensical, climate-wrecking bill except the oil and gas industry and its shareholders.”
Alasdair Johnstone, from the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, added: “The North Sea is in terminal decline and this only serves to distract from actual solutions to securing the UK’s energy independence which lie in reducing our need for gas in the first place. That means building out renewables and insulating cold, damp homes, areas where the government’s recent track record is questionable.”"
V48FTPHGAH_VAKJ4CRPZRSQDDA,‘It’s an expression of identity’: the TikToker taking the western Sydney accent to the world,Pamela Rontziokos,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/jan/25/its-an-expression-of-identity-the-tiktoker-taking-the-western-sydney-accent-to-the-world,"For young people living in western Sydney, Mahmoud Ismail is “that TikToker that reports on the area”. He attracts millions of views to his interviews with locals.
But why? Ismail says it’s not just his face and name that reflects an ethnic identity, but also how he sounds.
“It’s the representation and the relatability,” he says. “Some people hate my accent. Some people say I sound like I have three sausages in my mouth.”
Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup
What Ismail describes is the perception of a Lebanese-Australian ethnolect – not a geographic accent as found in different parts of the UK, US and many other countries, but rather a way of speaking where his English is influenced by Arabic, even though he was born and raised in Australia and learned English as his first language.
The 26-year-old is representative of a global phenomenon of culturally influenced ways of speaking that is the subject of research in Canada, the UK, Sweden, Germany and Belgium, according to James Walker, a professor of linguistics at La Trobe University in Melbourne.
Walker says ethnolects come about as a result of immigrant parents and grandparents passing on speech patterns to their children, even when the children do not become fluent in their ancestral language.
Yet the Lebanese-Australian ethnolect has also been adopted by many people in the suburbs of western Sydney who have no Lebanese heritage.
Heba Bou Orm, a second-year PhD student in linguistics at the Australian National University in Canberra who is of Lebanese background, is investigating perceptions of Lebanese youth voices through the Sydney Speaks Project.
She says people tell her “they’re hearing Asians, they’re hearing a lot of different ethnic backgrounds adopting that way of speaking”.
“You know, if you say, ‘They have a Leb accent,’ people will know exactly what you’re talking about.”
She says the western Sydney accent “is more than just a way of speaking, it is an expression of identity”.
The Sydney Speaks Project also aims to capture the change of Australian English through speakers from Anglo-Celtic background, as well as second-generation Australians of Chinese, Greek and Italian background.
But there are complex attitudes towards the Lebanese-Australian ethnolect in the broader Australian community.
“For some, it doesn’t sound classy, doesn’t sound sophisticated, it sounds like someone who is less intelligent, [it’s] associated with that kind of street identity,” Orm says.
And that is reflected in the fact that the accent is rarely heard in the mainstream media, except as a parody.
Ismail says he would like to pursue a career in journalism but fears being stripped of the sound and aura that stems from his Lebanese background.
He added while Asian-Australians, Muslims and other non-white Australians are appearing on mainstream social media platforms and TV, there is still a “white-washed” sound.
“Why are we trying to diversify media but not letting them be themselves?” he says.
Catherine Travis, a linguist at the Australian National University and an expert on the study of language in relation to social factors, says traditional mainstream media view the Anglo-Celtic sound as normal, while the western Sydney accent is understood to be culturally influenced.
“And so in the news media you try and be objective – not put your personal side forward – and there is a perception [that] putting this accent forward [is] not appropriate in that setting,” Travis says.
Travis says there are diverse ways of speaking within Australian communities that should be recognised as normal too.
Simone Amelia Jordan from Media Diversity Australia says  casting directors and producers of drama may also have biases about what accents appeal to a broader audience, which can influence their choices.
“The Lebanese-Australian accent from western Sydney is often only heard as a parody on mainstream television” she says.
Jordan says the media should work with linguistic experts and cultural consultants to break established norms in the media landscape.
“It’s like leaving a big part of our identity out of the picture, which might lead some to think only one type of accent is genuinely Australian, which is far from the truth and [is] harmful and divisive”.
Ismail says his audience is crying out for the Lebanese-Australian ethnolect to be heard in the mainstream, just as it is on his social media channels.
“The amount of people who have to said to me, ‘I wish the news was like this,’ is countless,” he says."
V4K1P8Z6G3_LUK5C64YM04YCZ3,Ron DeSantis condemned as Florida removes sociology as core college class,Richard Luscombe,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/26/florida-sociology-classes-ron-desantis-condemned,"Educators are warning that college enrollment in Florida will plummet after the state removed sociology as a core class from campuses in the latest round of Ron DeSantis’s war on “woke ideology”.
The Republican governor’s hand-picked board of education voted on Wednesday to replace the established course on the principles of sociology at its 12 public universities with its own US history curriculum, incorporating an “historically accurate account of America’s founding [and] the horrors of slavery”.
The board faced a backlash last summer for requiring public schools to teach that forced labor was beneficial to enslaved Black people because it taught them useful skills.
The removal as a required core course of sociology classes, which Florida education commissioner and staunch DeSantis acolyte Manny Díaz insisted without evidence had “been hijacked by leftwing activists”, follows several other recent “anti-woke” moves in education in Florida.
They include the banning an advanced placement class in African American studies, and last week’s board ruling crystalizing a plan by DeSantis, who dropped out of the race for the Republican presidential nomination over the weekend, to abolish diversity, enquiry and inclusion (DEI) programs in Florida’s universities and colleges.
The American Sociological Association said there was no evidentiary basis for replacing the sociology course.
“This decision seems to be coming not from an informed perspective, but rather from a gross misunderstanding of sociology as an illegitimate discipline driven by ‘radical’ and ‘woke’ ideology,” the American Sociological Association said in a statement to the Guardian.
“Sociology is the scientific study of social life, social change, and the social causes and consequences of human behavior, which are at the core of civic literacy and are essential to a broad range of careers.
“Failure to prioritize the scientific study of the causes and consequences of human behavior is a failure of Florida’s commitment to providing high-quality civics education and workforce readiness.”
The association called for the board to reverse its “outrageous” decision.
Anne Barrett, a professor of sociology at Florida State University, said the ruling was the latest attack by DeSantis and his allies in the “culture wars they are waging” on campuses.
“These regulations are devastating for sociology in Florida. Enrollments will plummet. The opportunity to recruit majors will almost disappear. Weakened sociology departments are ripe for elimination and, ultimately, faculty layoffs,” she said in an essay for the National Education Association.

“The costs to society are higher still. Sociology students learn how to use empirical research and logic to assess the accuracy of claims made about the social world. They also gain skills to critique how power is distributed.
“In short, they are positioned to be engaged citizens, armed with the power to destabilize right-wing policy makers’ agendas, and this is the threat these regulations seek to neutralize.”
Ray Rodrigues, chancellor of the state university system of Florida’s board of governors, praised the ruling for the “positive impact the addition of this [US history] course will have on our students and their future success”.
Díaz, however, has taken a more political approach to the board’s recent rulings, echoing DeSantis’s stance that college campuses are a hotbed of radical left activism in need of reform. Last year the governor engineered a rightwing takeover of a popular liberal arts college.
“Higher education must return to its essential foundations of academic integrity and the pursuit of knowledge instead of being corrupted by destructive ideologies,” Díaz said following last week’s DEI ruling.
“These actions today ensure that we will not spend taxpayers’ money supporting DEI and radical indoctrination that promotes division in our society.”"
V8EFAN903L_L262YPRJHYDKVIC,Michael Blakstad obituary,_,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/jan/24/michael-blakstad-obituary,"My father, Michael Blakstad, who has died aged 83, was a television producer and director whose credits include the popular BBC science programme Tomorrow’s World. He was also an entrepreneur and, in later life, a campaigner on behalf of people with dementia.
Born in Penang to Jill (nee McGrath) and Cliff Blakstad, an official in the Malay civil service, Michael was still a baby when the second world war struck the region. His father was captured and tortured in the Changi PoW camp; Michael was evacuated with his mother to her native Australia.
After the war, the family remained in Malaya, but Michael was sent away to school from the age of eight, first to Bourke Hill in New Brighton, Australia, then to Ampleforth college in North Yorkshire. In 1957, after Malayan independence, the rest of the family joined him in the UK and Cliff took a job teaching mathematics at Michael’s school.
The following year, Michael went to Oriel College, Oxford, to study classics. On graduation he joined the BBC as a trainee. After a spell in the North American radio department, he moved to television production, directing factual programmes whose subjects ranged from Bertrand Russell and TS Eliot to the newly discovered Twiggy.
While at the BBC, he met Tricia Wotherspoon, who worked as a designer. They married in 1965, and had twins, Karen and Sofie, in 1966, followed by me a year later.
In 1969 Michael moved to Yorkshire Television. Shortly after, the presenter Alan Whicker also left the BBC for YTV, and Michael became producer-director of the ITV version of Whicker’s World, globe-trotting with the series and arranging interviews with figures such as the brutal president of Haiti “Papa Doc” Duvalier.
He returned to the BBC as a freelance in 1970, and the family settled in west London. Among the notable documentaries Michael made was the 1974 film Children in Crossfire, which followed the lives of Northern Irish children from both sides of the sectarian divide.
Taking up a permanent contract in 1974, he became series producer and editor of The Risk Business, a prize-winning series on industry, along with The Burke Special and Tomorrow’s World.
After again leaving the BBC, in 1981, he became programme controller of Television South and founded two production companies, first Blackrod, with the former Tomorrow’s World presenter Michael Rodd, then Workhouse Limited, through which he produced content on emerging digital formats for corporate clients.
In retirement, from 2002, Michael remained busy in Hampshire as a member of the East Meon historical society and as a keen theatregoer. But in the 2010s, his diagnosis of Parkinson’s and Tricia’s of Alzheimer’s necessitated a move to a retirement community in Eastleigh.
During the Covid lockdowns Tricia’s dementia worsened and she had to move into a care home where, owing to the isolation imposed by quarantine rules, her condition deteriorated rapidly. Angered by the policy choices that had caused her plight, Michael began to campaign for the rights of people with dementia, making regular appearances on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. Tricia died in 2022, and in spite of his increasing disability, he spent his final months establishing Media versus Dementia, an organisation promoting media technology to help people in the early stages of the condition.
He is survived by his children, and his sister, Judi."
VCDWS1W8C9_P69APGWC2VUBFFU,The Guardian view on environmental protest: dissent is vital to protect democracy,Editorial,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/23/the-guardian-view-on-environmental-protest-dissent-is-vital-to-protect-democracy,"In the last few years, environmental protesters in Britain have pulled off some striking – and strikingly irritating – acts of civil disobedience. These have caused indignation and aggravation, especially by disrupting people’s lives. But their actions grabbed our attention. The purpose is to denounce an injustice by intentionally breaking the law in a non-violent way. The justification is a climate emergency that threatens humanity’s future.
There is nothing new in this: the suffragettes smashed windows and set buildings alight. Today we honour their cause and courage. Yet the government appears intent on criminalising protest, a move rightly criticised by Michel Forst, the UN special rapporteur on environmental defenders. He warns that a pillar of democracy – the right to protest – is under threat in Britain. The demonisation of environmental activists and the erosion of civil rights without adequate scrutiny from lawmakers, or protection by the courts, are undermining the UK’s guarantees of freedom and the rule of law. It had been almost unheard of since the 1930s for demonstrators to be imprisoned for peaceful protest in the UK. Last month, he said, a climate protester got six months behind bars for slow-walking on a road.
The UK would like to swat away such criticism – as it did last August when another UN special rapporteur warned that lengthy jail time for activists could curb freedoms. But the British government has to tread more carefully. Mr Forst’s statement is an invitation to aggrieved parties to complain to him directly. He is empowered by an international treaty signed by the UK and could take it up with ministers. An unsatisfactory response from them could see Britain declared as acting unlawfully.
There’s plenty that Mr Forst sees as wrong. He was aghast to learn that some environmental defendants in criminal trials were forbidden from explaining their motivation for participating in a given protest, or from mentioning climate change when their liberty was at stake. A jury’s power to acquit had been seen for decades as a “constitutional safeguard” – insurance that the criminal law should conform to the ordinary person’s idea of what is fair. That notion is held in contempt, evidently, by ministers.
Juries have for years acquitted activists after listening to their rationale for seemingly unlawful protest. It is Orwellian to think the answer would be to abolish their role. Yet Gail Bradbrook, the co-founder of Extinction Rebellion, was found guilty last year of criminal damage after the judge banned her from explaining her motivation. Worse could follow if the attorney general, Victoria Prentis, wins a test case in the court of appeal next month. She wants to narrow the defences available in climate protest cases about criminal damage. She may win. Judges sided with her predecessor, Suella Braverman, by saying that the toppling of a statue of the slaver Edward Colston was not a “proportionate exercise” of the right to protest, removing a defence for protestors.
Democracies are easily broken. They need political leadership that prizes the rule of law and a truthful media. But they also depend on a public determined to retain their freedoms. Since 2016, Brexit has fuelled a reckless attitude toward Britain’s democratic structures. Dissent is urgently needed, as is the ability for a jury to know the reasons for that dissent. Once in possession of the facts, people are likely to be more impressed with climate activists than with the condescension visited upon them. The modern world is increasingly complex. It needs a politics of tolerance, not intolerance."
VD0I4RF9TL_YX09WBFFIUDXUQF,"US launches inquiry into AI deals by Microsoft, OpenAI, Google and Amazon",Blake Montgomery,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/25/ftc-ai-inquiry-microsoft-alphabet-amazon,"The United States trade regulator launched an inquiry on Thursday into investments and partnerships made by some of the biggest companies in the generative artificial intelligence space.
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) said in a statement that it issued orders to five companies requiring them to provide information on the matter, including Google parent company Alphabet, Amazon, Anthropic, Microsoft and ChatGPT maker OpenAI.
The inquiry will focus on what authority and rights the tech giants’ investments in the fledgling AI companies have conferred and whether those deals harm competition, the agency’s statement said.
“Our study will shed light on whether investments and partnerships pursued by dominant companies risk distorting innovation and undermining fair competition,” the FTC’s chair, Lina Khan, said in a statement. The British Competition and Markets Authority is conducting a similar examination.
The inquiry represents the first concrete effort from the agency to scrutinize AI firms and their use of partnerships to expand reach and influence in the rapidly growing industry.
Microsoft’s years-long relationship with OpenAI is the best known of the partnerships. Google and Amazon have more recently made multibillion-dollar deals with Anthropic, another San Francisco-based AI startup formed by former OpenAI leaders.
Microsoft’s Rima Alaily, vice-president of its competition law group, said in a statement: “The US has assumed a global AI leadership position because important American companies are working together. Partnerships between independent companies like Microsoft and OpenAI, as well as among many others, are promoting competition and accelerating innovation. We look forward to providing the FTC with the information it needs to complete its study.” The company has said in the past that OpenAI is not a subsidiary under its control, though it is OpenAI’s largest shareholder after a $10bn investment. Microsoft holds an observer, non-voting seat on OpenAI’s board.
Anthropic and Amazon declined to comment. Amazon and Google and OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Khan, an antitrust scholar who has long argued for renewed enforcement against monopolies, has represented a threat to big tech’s power since her appointment to the FTC in 2021.

Under her direction, the FTC successfully fined Amazon for privacy violations involving its Ring doorbell camera and in May 2023 announced a separate settlement with the company over allegations it violated children’s privacy rights by failing to delete recordings by virtual assistant Alexa.
In past complaints, such as the FTC’s case against Meta in 2021, the agency has targeted tech giants with allegations of anti-competitive behavior over acquisitions of competitors. With Thursday’s announcement, the FTC has turned its attention to the AI space, where companies have opted to increase investments in smaller firms rather than acquire companies outright.
“We’re scrutinizing whether these ties enable dominant firms to exert undue influence or gain privileged access in ways that could undermine fair competition,” Khan said on Thursday in opening remarks at an AI forum."
VD5A5C4IUH_38E45LVOHT9FSP3,‘€600k to pay off her overdraft’: aide lifts lid on Monaco royals’ lavish spending,Jon Henley,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/26/monaco-royals-ex-accountant-lifts-lid-on-lavish-spending-prince-albert,"For more than two decades, Claude Palmero held the purse strings of the House of Grimaldi, hereditary rulers of the millionaire-packed Mediterranean principality of Monaco since the 13th century and among Europe’s glitziest royals.
For 22 years as principal asset manager to the house’s current head, Prince Albert II, the bespectacled accountant handled its investments, oversaw its expenditures and – as best he could – balanced its books.
Now he is spilling the beans, and in devastating fashion.
Unceremoniously sacked last summer amid unverified allegations made on an anonymously run website of financial impropriety at the palace, Palmero, 67, is not only suing for €1m but is also, it seems, bent on doing more than mere pecuniary damage.
Five black notebooks filled with details of the family’s dealings have found their way to the French media, and Palmero has spoken at length to Le Monde for a series of articles shocking even in a playground for the super-rich.
“I think everyone knew their lifestyle was … glamorous,” said an employee of a company supplying domestic staff to some of the principality’s moneyed residents. “[But] I’m not sure we knew they managed to get through quite that much. Even in a place that’s used to the way billionaires behave, it’s raised some eyebrows.”
Among the notebooks’ more sensational revelations, according to Le Monde, are the spending habits of Albert’s wife, Princess Charlene, 46, a former swimming champion who as Charlene Wittstock represented South Africa at the Sydney Olympics in 2000.
Charlene, who married Albert in 2011 and gave birth to twins Jacques and Gabriella three years later, has an annual allowance of about €1.5m, the notebooks reveal. In December 2019, Palmero noted she had spent “about €15m in the past eight years”.
The notebooks record that Albert, the son and heir of Prince Rainier III and the former Hollywood star Grace Kelly, who has a personal fortune estimated at €2bn, has routinely topped up his wife’s allowance.
In 2010, before their marriage, the prince approved an additional payment to Charlene of €700,000, Palmero recorded, adding: “Be careful not to increase these allowances at a time of [economic] crisis.”
In 2016 the princess received €77,000 in cash, “less than the year before, but still far too much,” and in 2017 there was €600,000 “to pay off her overdraft”. In 2020, Palmero recorded a one-off payment of €200,000, plus €5,000 in cash.
Palmero did not sign off on everything. When Charlene wanted a catamaran, he noted “AVOID” in capitals. He objected to the cost of her proposed office renovation (nearly €1m) and to her spending a similar sum on two months’ rental of a villa in Corsica.
In 2021 he put his foot down again when the princess suggested she needed more staff, writing: “There are already 8.5 at her service, more than ever before.” He did, though, authorise three payments of €300,000 to her brother Sean “for his house”.
The Wittstock family are not the only ones to benefit, the notebooks show. The prince’s two sisters, Stéphanie and Caroline, receive annual allowances of €800,000 and €900,000 respectively, “to manage their day-to-day”.
Expenditure on Albert’s two children from relationships before he was married, with Nicole Coste and Tamara Rotolo, are also recorded in notebooks.
The palace bought Jazmin Grace Grimaldi, now 31, a €3m apartment in New York and pays her a quarterly allowance of $86,000, according to Palmero’s records. Alexandre Grimaldi-Coste, 20, benefits from kidnap and ransom insurance.
Alexandre’s mother meanwhile, receives funding for her fashion business, to the tune of “getting on for €1m a year”, the notebooks record – including €350,000 to open a store in Knightsbridge, London.
Libération newspaper, which also interviewed Palmero, reported that Albert kept a private BNP bank account labelled AG (for Albert Grimaldi), allowing him to transfer money to the former girlfriends and their children without Charlene’s knowledge.
Nicole Coste also demanded a flat, the notebooks show, which was to be “entirely in Alexandre’s name” since “Nicole fears big problems with Charlene” if Albert died. The prince’s name had to be kept out of the deal “at all costs”, Palmero wrote.
The notebooks further record Palmero’s alarm at the number of staff the palace employed illegally: Charlene’s personal cook, paid €300 a day in cash, and Filipino nannies who had entered Monaco on tourist visas or false passports.
Le Monde also reported on the existence of “special funds” that were allocated up to €600,000 a year for “secret missions” and “parallel activities” – such as paying a police officer a retainer for “useful information” and “recovering compromising photos”.
Albert’s lawyer Jean-Michel Darrois told the paper that the palace budget and the prince’s own funds were kept separate at all times, any illegal hires were ultimately Palmero’s responsibility, and the prince did not approve and was not aware of any slush funds.
Palmero, who inherited the job of palace asset manager from his late father, André, said that if his name appeared on the deeds of parts of the family’s property portfolio, it was because they had asked him to be the registered owner, partly for tax reasons.
“I never took a centime,” he told Le Monde. “This is a 100% denial. I am neither corrupt nor a thief, all the improbable things of which the royal family, to whom I devoted myself for two decades, unjustly accuses me today.”
In a statement to the paper, Albert said Palmero’s actions “show his true nature and the little respect … he has for the family and the principality”, adding: “His duties imposed on him an absolute discretion, which he has violated.”
In firing Palmero, the prince added, “I exercised my right to choose the asset manager of my choice. Events have shown how much this decision was the right one.” In the mild-mannered accountant, however, he may have made a powerful enemy."
VHOLTBPKRY_5J13V1ZKQ2QK2I0,‘This should not be ridiculed’: the link between hypochondria and early death,Matthew Cantor,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/jan/22/link-between-hypochondria-anxiety-early-death,"In an English churchyard, the Irish comedian Spike Milligan’s gravestone has a chastening message for those who knew him: “I told you I was ill.”
We can all identify with Milligan’s concerns. Who hasn’t panic-researched supposed symptoms, fearing the worst? His joke speaks to our fear that legitimate health concerns will be shrugged off as nothing to worry about –  “Oh, it’s just hypochondria.”
But there’s a difference between the occasional appointment with Dr Google and long-term, serious anxiety over health. This persistent fear of an undiagnosed illness may lead to endless doctor’s visits, or the opposite: total avoidance of medical care. What if we’re not taking hypochondria itself seriously enough?
That’s the takeaway from a recent Swedish study that found that people with what is now called illness anxiety disorder may die earlier than others. It’s a disturbing finding that makes the disorder sound like a self-fulfilling prophecy. As one anxious observer put it: “It’s not enough just to have worries – now you have to worry about your worries.”
But that doesn’t mean those with the disorder should despair. The study has an important, and ultimately hopeful, message. “This is a serious mental disorder. This is not a peculiarity or something that should be ridiculed,” says its lead author, David Mataix-Cols of Sweden’s Karolinska Institute. The deaths recorded in the study were largely preventable, the researchers noted. Their findings underscore the need for diagnosis and treatment – and the good news is that treatment is highly effective.
The study, which appeared in JAMA Psychiatry, examined records on about 45,000 people, comparing death rates among those with diagnosed hypochondriasis (about 4,000 people) against those without it (about 41,000 demographically similar individuals). They found people with the disorder were 84% more likely to die in the study period, and that they died an average of five years younger than those without the diagnosis, at 70 versus 75 years old.
It all might sound counterintuitive: surely the people most concerned about their health would be taking good care of it? But “like all anxiety disorders and chronic stress over many years, decades, we know that that’s not good for your health”, says Mataix-Cols, though he emphasizes that the study does not investigate the reasons behind the disparity.
Subjects with the disorder died at higher rates of both natural and unnatural causes, with most of the unnatural deaths a result of suicide. That, in particular, might seem surprising among people seen as having a great fear of death. But people with illness anxiety disorder may experience a “great deal of suffering and hopelessness”, Mataix-Cols says, including feeling that others don’t understand them. As for natural causes, the researchers noted that anxiety is associated with cardiovascular diseases, and Mataix-Cols says some subjects with the condition also struggled with chronic stress, as well as drugs and alcohol. (He also points out that while the disparity might seem grim, the absolute risk of death among people with health anxiety remained low.)
And then there’s the lack of access to treatment. The “biggest surprise” to Mataix-Cols was how few people had actually been diagnosed with the disorder compared with the number known to be living with it. Studies have shown about 3-5% of people have “what we call pathological health anxiety”, Mataix-Cols says. “According to those numbers, we should have found 100,000 to 200,000 people [in Sweden] with this diagnosis over 20 years. And we only found 4,000,” meaning the disorder is “severely under-diagnosed” and thus under-treated.
Diagnosis of illness anxiety disorder calls for sensitivity, especially in a world in which patients’ real physical ailments – for instance, women’s pain – can be wrongly dismissed. Ideally, doctors aren’t telling patients to take solace in the idea that “it’s all in your head”. Instead, they’re recognizing mental health challenges as part of the bigger picture.
When doctors see a patient seeking what appears to be excessive care, they might decide to refer the patient to a therapist.
Dr Jessie Borelli, a clinical psychologist and a professor at the University of California, Irvine, says she gets these referrals “frequently”. She’s heard some “horror stories” about that handoff, but she’s also seen doctors approach it with care. “I think the way that they do this best is talking about the stress of having health concerns or health anxiety – how much stress and difficulty that causes, and the need for additional support in managing that,” Borelli says. “People are receptive, usually, to that conversation.”
Fortunately, experts say treatments for the disorder are very effective, particularly cognitive behavioral therapy. Therapists and patients may, for example, work together to identify behaviors that are rooted in anxiety and work through them through gradual exposure to the situations that worry them.
If a patient wants to get an additional medical screening, Dr Nora Brier says “we collaboratively talk about it” to determine whether it’s necessary or an anxiety-based decision. If it’s the latter, “the exposure then would be to not make the appointment and to not Google or double-check, and to tolerate that anxiety of just sitting at home and thinking ‘maybe I should have gone to that appointment’”, says Brier, who is a psychologist and assistant professor of clinical psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania. Medications, including the antidepressants known as SSRIs, can also be helpful.
Illness anxiety patients may continue to seek physical care, but that can be done in conjunction with therapy. And not everyone comes to therapy through their doctor – for instance, patients may refer themselves for therapy if they are too fearful of a diagnosis to see a doctor and recognize they need help navigating that anxiety.
It all gets at the heart of anxiety more broadly: the struggle to live with not knowing. “Hypochondria is, in some ways, a challenge to medicine’s need for certainty,” says Dr Catherine Belling, an associate professor of medical education at Northwestern University. The best doctor in the world can’t be 100% sure that there’s nothing physically wrong with a patient. Not only does the patient have to tolerate that, the doctor does, too.
It requires a doctor to say, “Well, I don’t know. We have to watch and wait and see, but in the meantime, we could do something about your anxiety,” Belling adds. In fact, doctors are familiar with these worries themselves: in their first years, medical students are known for suddenly realizing they have every disorder in the book.
One big threat for people with health anxiety right now: spending hours on the internet. Among the key elements of illness anxiety disorder is reassurance seeking, says Mataix-Cols, and with Google, we’re all self-diagnosing medical students. There’s even a term for it: cyberchondria.
The pandemic also brought health concerns to the forefront (though it’s too soon to say for sure that it increased the prevalence of the disorder itself, says Brier). A 2021 study warned of a growing risk of excessive health anxiety amid Covid, with a very real disease constantly on our minds, and an Iranian study published last year pointed to higher health anxiety among people whose relatives had had Covid.
Mataix-Cols hopes his study, which has drawn international press, will get more patients into treatment by improving diagnosis and communication between physicians and psychotherapists.
Borelli, who was not involved in the Swedish study, also sees some hope in it. “In the case of something like illness anxiety, where it’s pretty clear that there’s not an underlying serious disease, it’s also the case that being very worried about your health can actually cause significant health concerns, as is evident in this study,” she says.
“We know that we do need to take stress and anxiety very seriously. And the way in which we take it seriously is by shining a light on it.”

VJ5CVT1T7H_HSB6Z8UN48OJ306,First Thing: US Navy Seals declared dead after raid on Houthi-bound arms,Clea Skopeliti,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/22/first-thing-us-navy-seals-declared-dead-raid-houthi-bound-weapons-desantis-trump,"Good morning.
Two US Navy Seals who went missing during an operation to seize Iranian weapons said to be bound for Houthi rebels in Yemen have been declared dead, the US military has said.
The development followed a 10-day “exhaustive” search that failed to find the special forces personnel, US Central Command said. The operation during which the Seals went missing was said to be “the first seizure of lethal, Iranian-supplied advanced conventional weapons” to the Houthis since attacks on shipping began last November.
The US and Britain launched strikes on dozens of Houthi rebel targets in January, and US forces have since hit a number of missile sites that Washington says posed a threat to vessels.
What’s happening now? The Houthis have not been deterred and continue to attack ships. Ordinary Yemenis are paying the price in a country with some of the highest rates of acute malnutrition.
What about shipping? The attacks have caused about 70% of shipping that normally passes through the Bab el-Mandeb strait to be diverted thousands of miles around Africa.
The situation in the Middle East has probably “never been worse” since the UN humanitarian agency began collating records in 1991, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has warned.
With tens of millions of people across the region dependent on aid, UN agencies believe an “apocalyptic” humanitarian crisis is under way. Four overlapping crises – Gaza, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen – are piling pressure on agencies, while Israel’s war in Gaza is intensifying historical tensions and connecting conflicts.
It is likely that even worse times are to come, said Jens Laerke, a senior official at OCHA in Geneva. Laerke asked whether the world was “entering an age of war”, as global leaders were “reaching for the gun to resolve their differences as a first option”.
Israeli forces are “besieging” the Palestine Red Crescent Society’s ambulance centre, leaving vehicles unable to reach the injured in Khan Younis, southern Gaza.
The death toll in Gaza has reached 25,295, with 63,000 injured in Israeli strikes, according to the Gaza health ministry.
After Ron DeSantis dropped out of the Republican presidential race, the Guardian’s Washington DC bureau chief examined whether DeSantis misjudged timings on culture war topics.
“DeSantis was billed as Trump without the baggage. He turned out to be Trump without the votes,” wrote David Smith after Florida’s governor endorsed Trump. DeSantis positioned himself to the right of Trump on several issues, but his awkward persona and a series of campaign missteps, including a disastrous launch on social media, combined to undermine his chance at challenging the former president for the Republican nomination.
What did he try? DeSantis made a lot of political hay in Florida by criticizing responses to the Covid-19 pandemic, but those attacks appear to have lost their resonance nationwide, while his encouragement of groups that aim to keep race and LGBTQ+ issues out of schools also played badly nationally. DeSantis’s six-week abortion ban in Florida is broadly unpopular, too.
Has ‘anti-woke’ had its day? Maybe not quite – but Trump has recently spoken in vaguer terms on some culture war issues (though not immigration, where he speaks in chilling fashion about newcomers “poisoning the blood” of the country) and abortion.
More than 45 people have been buried in a landslide in Yunnan province, south-west China, according to state media. Authorities launched an emergency response that included more than 200 rescue workers. The cause has not yet been explained, though China has experienced a series of natural disasters in recent months.
UN staff in Iraq are allegedly demanding bribes for helping companies win contracts on postwar reconstruction projects, a Guardian investigation has found. The alleged kickbacks are just one type of corruption claim the Guardian has learned about in the $1.5bn program, backed by 30 countries.
The UK has shown a panel of UN experts satellite images of North Korean cargo shipments to Russia amid efforts to trigger an official investigation into weapons deals violating international sanctions. North Korea has been accused of supplying arms to Russia since September and the relationship between Pyongyang and Moscow looks like it is expanding.
Asbestos kills between 12,000 and 15,000 people in the US each year, with about 2,500 deaths related to mesothelioma, an aggressive type of incurable cancer linked to asbestos exposure, annually. Now, those affected by asbestos are accusing a Koch Industries-owned company and its lawyers of using a controversial bankruptcy maneuver to dodge paying millions in compensation to its former employees. “He didn’t know that he was being poisoned,” said the daughter of one victim.
Last time Ryan Gilbey interviewed the director Abel Ferrara, it was 1996 and Ferrara nodded off before asking Gilbey to score some cocaine. Almost three decades on, Ferrara has been sober for 11 years and is preparing for the release of his latest feature, Padre Pio, starring Shia LaBeouf as a priest at the end of world war one. Ferrara, 72, talks about his journey to sobriety, seeing Donald Trump in New York nightclubs, and US politics: “My country’s been fucking crazy since the day I was born. It’s business as usual.”
The Guardian’s Emma Beddington – a self-proclaimed a black-belt starer into space – asks whether this is the year meong, a Korean suffix used for activities involving staring into stillness, could achieve hygge-like status. South Korea is home to an annual “space-out” competition.

It adds to a string of recent rulings that have reprimanded countries across Europe over the treatment of lone minors who are seeking asylum.
Spain’s supreme court ruled that the government’s decision to deport hundreds of Moroccan youths, after a 2021 mass border crossing into the enclave of Ceuta, was illegal.
The unaccompanied children were among thousands of people who crossed into the seven-square mile territory as Madrid and Rabat argued over the status of the Western Sahara.
Months later, around 700 youths were sent back to Morocco. The court said that the exceptional circumstances of the mass crossing did not warrant the deportations, ruling instead that the collective expulsions amounted to a breach of the country’s domestic immigration laws and the European convention on human rights.
The leftist coalition government had failed to consider the interest of the minors or verify their individual circumstances, the court noted, meaning the children were “put in serious danger of suffering physical or psychological harm”.
As the deportations loomed in 2021, the Spanish broadcaster RTVE spoke to 10 children, all of them between the ages of 13 and 16, who said they had fled state care and were now living rough amid fears of being deported.
“We would be worse off than we are here,” one child told the broadcaster, as others said authorities had not asked them about their individual circumstances or where they would go.
Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Fernando Grande-Marlaska, Spain’s interior minister, defended the deportations, saying that the authorities had acted “with the full conviction of complying with the legal system and guided by the principle of the best interests of the child”.
The ruling was made days after the European court of human rights (ECHR) said Hungary had violated the rights of a 16-year-old Iraqi Kurd asylum seeker after police pushed him back into the Serbian wilderness.
The boy said he had told police that he wanted to request asylum, the court noted. “The court cannot ignore that at the time of his removal the applicant was an unaccompanied minor, and therefore in a situation of extreme vulnerability,” it added, noting that the age of asylum seekers “should take precedence” over the child’s status as an irregular migrant.
The ruling was welcomed by the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, the NGO that had helped to lodge the case. “The Hungarian state treats children in need of asylum this way,” it said in a statement.
“Instead of deporting children without due process, it would be much better for everyone if Hungary were to review asylum applications under a fair asylum system. Because the Hungarian government has been causing suffering and harm for years,” it added.
A decision published by the ECHR on Tuesday also condemned Greece for failing to protect the rights of a teenage asylum seeker who was left homeless for nearly six months starting in November 2018.

In its ruling, the court noted that the asylum seeker, from Afghanistan, “had been left to fend for himself in an environment that was entirely unsuitable for minors – whether in terms of security, accommodation, hygiene or access to food and care, or in terms of the measures taken to provide for him more generally – and in unacceptably precarious circumstances, given his status as an asylum seeker and unaccompanied minor”.
At the end of 2020, at the urging of the UN, the Greek government ushered in new mechanisms aimed at better protecting unaccompanied children. “The majority of them are now staying in official shelters,” it noted in a 2021 report.
The rulings are the latest pronouncements by the courts over how European countries have treated lone child asylum seekers.
Similar decisions, however, stretch back years and involve several countries; in 2019, for example, the ECHR ruled that France had subjected an 11-year-old asylum seeker to inhuman or degrading treatment by failing to provide care for him.
He instead lived in a shantytown in Calais in what the court described as “overcrowded conditions without even the most basic sanitation”.
The environment, it added, was “completely unsuited to his status as a child and in a situation of insecurity rendered unacceptable by his young age”.
Last month a British high court order banned the UK’s Home Office from routinely placing unaccompanied child asylum seekers in hotels. Since June 2021, more than 400 children had gone missing from asylum hotels. Officials recently told a parliamentary committee that 132 of them remain missing."
VL9UZWZK4T_I1DGAOMUGD16N1G,Why are European defence leaders talking about war?,Dan Sabbagh,_,20240119,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/26/why-are-european-defence-leaders-talking-about-war,"A wave of anxiety has gripped European defence ministers and armed forces as politicians and military leaders believe that Nato-sceptic Donald Trump could be elected as the next president of the US – and that Russia may not be forced out or defeated in Ukraine. This febrile mood has prompted growing warnings that Europe could find itself involved in a war in Russia, even though at present Russia is embroiled in Ukraine.
At the same time, tensions in the Middle East have continued to rise. Israel’s assault on Gaza continues; hostilities with Iran-aligned Hezbollah in Lebanon increase; and the US and the UK launched bombing raids on Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen to halt raids on shipping in the Red Sea.
Adm Rob Bauer, the chair of Nato’s military committee, said last week that it was “not a given that we are in peace” and that was “why we are preparing for a conflict with Russia and the terror groups if it comes to it” before the start of what the military alliance said was its largest exercise in decades, involving 90,000 troops.
Grant Shapps, the British defence secretary, used even stronger language, arguing the cold war peace dividend was over and that the UK and its allies were “moving from a postwar to a prewar world” with idealism replaced by “hard-headed realism”. It was time, he argued, for re-armament to protect Europe from “Putin’s fury”.
Boris Pistorius, the German defence minister, gave an interview last week suggesting that while a Russian attack was not likely for now “our experts expect a period of five to eight years in which this could be possible”. Europe, he added, was “dealing with a military threat situation … that has not existed for 30 years”.
Norway and Sweden have also made similar warnings in the past month.
Planning for warfare, a remote contingency, is what militaries do and there is always pressure from generals and defence ministries to spend more. But the war in Ukraine – which will have run for two years next month – is exhausting western stockpiles of munitions.
It looks increasingly likely, meanwhile, that the US Congress will not vote through a new $61bn (£48bn) military aid package for Ukraine as Republicans ratchet up the pressure over a quid-pro-quo deal to boost security on the US southern border.
A wave of western weapons given so far to Ukraine, including German Leopard 2 and British Challenger 2 tanks; US Bradley fighting vehicles; American, British and French long-range rocket artillery, as well as ammunition and artillery shells have failed to make a dent in the Russian frontlines – and, if future US military aid were to halt as a result of the deadlock in Congress, Europe would struggle to make up the gap.
Experts fear that without the US, Russia could gradually turn the tables.
At the same time, Trump looks set to sweep the Republican nomination after primary victories in Iowa and New Hampshire. Memories of his previous presidency linger in Europe, amid questions about the closeness of his relationship with Putin and his threat at the Nato summit in 2018 that the US might “go it alone” and quit if other countries did not lift their own military spending.

Manfred Weber, leader of the conservative European People’s party in the European parliament, used an interview in Politico on Thursday to promote the idea that the EU should take over from Nato in defending the continent, proposing “a European pillar of defence” that should include a nuclear umbrella, provided by France, the only nuclear-armed state in the EU. “When I look at this year as a European politician, the first thing that goes through our minds is Trump,” he said.
There is talk among some EU politicians about the need to create an EU defence commissioner, but the reality is that this manoeuvring is unlikely to supplant Nato, whose members with large militaries include the UK (whose own nuclear weapons are pledged to the alliance) and Turkey as well as the US. Nato members are more likely to try to bed down and endure a Trump presidency as they did from 2016.
Gen Sir Patrick Sanders, the head of the British army, suggested that the UK’s professional army was too small to last long in an all-out war with Russia and it would take a “citizen army” to win one, hinting at a return to conscription in an all-out emergency. Though that scenario was rejected by Downing St as a “not helpful” hypothetical, other European countries such as Latvia and Sweden have been reviving forms of military service, and Pistorius said in December he was “looking at all options”.
But it is far from clear that Russia, however aggressive Putin wants to be, would have the capacity to attack Nato member states. It is estimated by western intelligence that 315,000 Russians have been killed or injured in Ukraine and Moscow’s forces have failed repeatedly to break through its smaller neighbour. The anxiety about US support may be real, but the threat is not so significant."
VN2ADMZ9T7_ZC4Z0V2ZL4X0R2L,Ministers urged not to play culture wars over species reintroductions in England,Helena Horton,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/26/ministers-urged-not-to-play-culture-wars-over-species-reintroductions-in-england,"Culture wars by ministers over the reintroduction of animals such as the beaver and the lynx must end if we are to restore nature in England, the head of the government’s taskforce on the issue has said.
Dr Andy Clements, an ornithologist who helped establish the government regulator Natural England, runs the species reintroduction taskforce, and he’s well placed to do so. He was one of those behind the hugely successful reintroduction of red kites into England.
He said he was frustrated by the debate over reintroducing species because it was based on “anecdote, not evidence”, when it is clear that increasing the abundance of rare and locally extinct species by releasing them into the wild can help restore nature.
The taskforce, which was created to advise the government on re-establishing species from the slipper orchid to the wolf, met for the first time last year and has been providing officials with evidence on how to reintroduce species.
“Our main task is to improve the quality and quantity of species reintroductions that contribute to nature’s recovery and that they’re done in a way that society finds acceptable or even delights about. Which is not necessarily the case at the moment because as you’re probably aware, there’s a lot of controversy about species reintroduction,” Clements said.
So far, however, their counsel has been ignored. The former environment secretary Thérèse Coffey said last year that a Conservative government would not reintroduce species such as the lynx or the wolf.
“That was a very interesting thing to hear from the taskforce’s perspective,” he said. “When you look at the evidence around wolf and lynx, bracketing them together in the same statement is very odd, because the evidence shows that the species are very, very different in the roles they would play, if they were reintroduced.”
He chose not to speak out at the time, but hopes the debate will become more evidence-led in future. “And while the taskforce hasn’t overtly gone and said anything about that, one of the pieces of work we are doing is to look at the social and ecological implications of reestablishing the broad predator guild in England.
“That would include things like pine marten, wildcat, lynx, wolf, white-tailed eagle, probably eagle owl, things like that. There is evidence of course that these used to be native, and they’re no longer here because they’ve been persecuted out of existence.”
The farming lobby, led by the National Farmers’ Union, has led opposition to the recovery of species such as the beaver and white-tailed eagle. Clements said recent ministers had skewed the balance between nature and farming on th issue, with the benefits of species reintroductions ignored.
The government’s nature watchdog, the Office for Environmental Protection (OEP), found last week that ministers were failing on almost all their legally-binding targets to restore nature in England.
On the white-tailed eagle, Clements said: “One of the frustrations that I had at the start of this was the NFU’s objections on their return rather focused on anecdote and not evidence. The NFU talked about white tailed eagles taking lots of lambs. That is a good example of anecdote, not evidence.” Recent scientific evidence shows that white-tailed eagles are most likely not a threat to lambs.
He said the government was listening to such anecdotes rather than the science. “It seems to me that when Michael Gove was Defra [the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs] secretary, we had a better balance between paying attention to the evidence around the needs of the environment against the needs of land managers and farmers, he said. “It’s a tricky balance and it’s been in favour of farming for a very long time.”

Gove, who held the position from 2017 to 2019, seemed relatively in favour of the release of beavers, attending and celebrating some caged reintroductions. Coffey said beaver reintroductions were not a priority, and her successor, Steve Barclay, has declined to give his view.
Natural England has endorsed the reintroduction of beavers into the countryside to help mitigate drought and flooding and enhance biodiversity, after a rigorous study found in 2020 that the rodents were hugely beneficial for fish and reducing local floods. Officials have created a licensing programme which would give conservation groups permission under certain conditions to release beavers into the wild, but ministers have so far refused to sign it off.
Clements said: “This drives beaver reintroductions underground, so there’s lots more illegal releases as a result. Also there are examples such as Purbeck in Dorset where the National Trust have this fantastic project on reintroducing beavers ready to go, and the landscape they have control over would enable the beaver population to spread out without controversy at all.
“It would enhance the landscape, it would recover nature, but they’re unable to go ahead with it because the government hasn’t okayed Natural England’s further regulated and licensed reintroductions of beavers.”
Barclay has yet to met the taskforce, and it is unclear if he plans to. Clements said he was disappointed by ministers so far and hoped the new environment secretary took a more evidence-based approach.
“One of the things that is very disappointing for the taskforce is that species reintroductions can make a really significant contribution to the government’s targets on nature’s recovery. And there are two specific targets that I would really draw out. One is about stopping extinctions and the other is about increasing abundance of biodiversity.
“Species reintroductions speak very well to both of those targets, and up to now it’s been a bit disappointing to me that the politicians haven’t really followed through on that. That would be what I would want to talk to Steve Barclay about if I get a chance.”"

Holmes, who is also chair of ABC Alumni, emphasised that he was not saying that journalists from diverse backgrounds could not be objective, rather that the very nature of having different perspectives was sometimes at odds with the idea of “one objective truth”.
Williams, an arts and music buff and former News Corp Australia chief executive, will take over from Ita Buttrose in March.

In interviews after the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, announced he had been chosen from a shortlist, Williams has been repeatedly asked about upheaval at the national broadcaster. It has been criticised most recently over its coverage of the Israel-Gaza war and the termination of journalist Antoinette Lattouf, leading to questions about its impartiality and the diversity of its journalists, and how those journalists are treated.
Asked if he agreed that diversity and impartiality could be seen as being at odds with each other, Williams said on Thursday morning that the situation was “complex”.
Holmes told Guardian Australia he was “comforted” that Williams recognised it was an issue.
“He knows that in the United States in particular, even more than here, this is a very live debate in newsrooms around the country – how do you marry the need for diversity in newsrooms, the need for different perspectives, with the old ideal of the objective journalist, which tends to imply that there’s really only one objective truth out there? That’s the dilemma I’m trying to get at,” Holmes said.
“Diversity’s really important. At the same time the ABC is legally obliged to portray the objective truth.
“A debate that hasn’t really happened yet is why do we want diversity if all we’re expecting is the same story from everyone?”
Holmes pointed to comments last year from ABC journalist Sarah Ferguson that the ABC was having a “very uncomfortable moment” with a generational divide. Younger journalists often had “a different approach to activism, to the expression of ideas through their journalism”, she told an Adelaide Writers’ Week audience.
Balancing diversity and impartiality is “complex”, Williams told ABC radio on Thursday morning.
“I think I probably share a common view with Jonathan that this is a complex matter and something that requires extended discussion until one arrives at a workable, appropriately informed view,” he said.
Williams referred to work by former Washington Post editor Martin Baron about the importance of striving for objectivity. Baron has said that objectivity in journalism is often misunderstood to be neutral, leading to false balance or “both-sidesism”. It also does not mean that journalists are free of bias, he has said, rather that they need to recognise that they are full of biases and must work to ensure those biases do not undermine accuracy.
On Thursday, Williams was asked about criticism of the ABC’s coverage of the war. He said such scrutiny was “inevitable”. Conflict produces “a variety of different viewpoints and very intense emotions”, he said.
“What is important is that one has a set of editorial rules of engagement that are reliable, that are coherent and that are resilient and that represent the best standards one can have in ensuring independence and integrity and impartiality.”
“Those things are non-negotiable.”

Williams also told ABC Radio National that the broadcaster’s culture “is pretty relentless in its focus on matters of interior dialogue … at times, nothing more or less than gossip”.
“I would like to see the ABC culture transform from being one that is obsessively interior in focus to being obsessively exterior in its focus – on audiences, on the nation, on the policy direction of the nation, on the intellect of the nation, the creativity of the nation,” he said.
“Sometimes the interior culture of the ABC can be quite all-consuming.”
Williams said some aspects of the ABC had “become bland”, but he declined to say which aspects.
Asked about News Corp attacks on the ABC, he said they were sometimes “unusually ferocious” and “destructive”.
“I think some of those attacks are unusually ferocious and are based on unstated but clearly very different views of what the ABC should be … The implicit agenda is one that is fundamentally, unhelpfully destructive,” he said.
In an excerpt from Williams’ book, Rules of Engagement, published in the New Daily in 2014, Williams wrote his relationship with News came unstuck after he agreed to launch the then Labor treasurer Chris Bowen’s book. “All hell broke out,” he wrote, and “by the start of August [2013] I no longer had a job”.
He said he stood by the speech, in which he said that “all countries need books like this and politicians like Chris”, along with other flattering statements that his News colleagues were outraged by.
The speech had been misrepresented, he wrote – and he thought Rupert Murdoch had not even read it, although he said he did.
Denis Muller, a senior research fellow at the University of Melbourne’s Centre for Advancing Journalism, wrote in the Conversation on Wednesday that Williams “fell victim to the brutal internal politics of News Corp, where he was resented by the editors as an outsider, and resigned”."
VROH2M7D2A_TWCBU6WWBL1J572,UK ‘reserves right to respond’ after oil tanker set alight off Yemen,Amy Sedghi,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/26/vessel-on-fire-after-being-struck-off-coast-of-yemen-amid-houthi-threats,"The UK government has said Britain and its allies “reserve the right to respond appropriately” after an oil tanker was struck and set alight off the coast of Yemen. The blaze on the British-linked oil tanker was put out after firefighting efforts continued through the night.
Yemen’s Houthi rebels claimed their naval forces had carried out an operation targeting what they described as the “British oil tanker Marlin Luanda” in the Gulf of Aden. Shipping data suggests the vessel sails under the flag of the Marshall Islands.
They used “appropriate naval missiles, the strike was direct”, the Houthi military spokesperson, Yahya Sarea, said in a statement.
The US military has also confirmed the attack, posting a statement on X saying: “Iranian-backed Houthi terrorists fired one anti-ship ballistic missile from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen and struck the Marshall Islands-flagged oil tanker.”
The statement adds that the ship issued a distress call and reported damage, but no injuries had been reported so far, adding that “other coalition ships have responded and are rendering assistance”.
The commodities group Trafigura said the vessel was operated on its behalf.
The company, which has offices in Britain, said a fire in the ship’s cargo tank had been extinguished with the help of Indian, US and French Navy vessels and that all crew were safe.
A Trafigura spokesperson said: “The vessel is now sailing towards a safe harbour. The crew continues to monitor the vessel and cargo closely.
“We would like to recognise the exceptional dedication and bravery of the ship’s master and crew who managed to control the fire in highly difficult circumstances, as well as the essential assistance provided by Indian, US and French navy vessels to achieve this outcome.”
A UK government spokesperson said: “We are aware of reports that the M/V Marlin Luanda, a Marshall Islands-flagged tanker, has sustained damage from attack in the Gulf of Aden. Current reports suggest no casualties and nearby coalition vessels are on the scene.
“We have been clear that any attacks on commercial shipping are completely unacceptable and that the UK and our allies reserve the right to respond appropriately.”
The tanker was carrying Russian naphtha bought below the price cap in line with G7 sanctions, a Trafigura spokesperson said.
It comes after another incident in the region on Friday in which two missiles were reported to have exploded in the water. Both vessel and crew were reported safe and with no damage.
The Yemeni forces claimed on Friday they had targeted a “British oil” vessel after “American-British aggression against our country”.
Reuters reported that the vessel Free Spirit, chartered by Vitol to carry crude oil, U-turned before reaching the Gulf of Aden shortly after the attack on the Marlin Luanda, according to data from LSEG.
The Houthis have repeatedly launched attacks on ships in the Red Sea since November over Israel’s war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
But they have frequently targeted vessels with tenuous or no clear links to Israel, endangering shipping on a key route for global trade.
Alongside numerous airstrikes on key Houthi targets, the UK and US are also targeting key figures in the Iran-backed militant group with sanctions.
A second series of UK and US airstrikes, carried out at the start of the week, appears to have done little to deter Houthi action.
On Saturday, UK Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) reported that a vessel 780 nautical miles east of Hafun, Somalia, was also approached by a small craft with four people.
Automatic rifles and a rocket-propelled grenade were spotted, but the boat retreated after the onboard security team fired warning shots as it approached to within 300 metres, it said.
About eight hours after the oil tanker was hit, the US military said it had destroyed a Houthi anti-ship missile that was aimed into the Red Sea and ready to launch. The missile “presented an imminent threat to merchant vessels and the US Navy ships in the region”, US central command said in a statement.
Earlier on Friday, a spokesperson for Rishi Sunak said: “We continue to call on [the Houthis] to step back from such action. We’re clear that this is illegal and unacceptable.”
The foreign secretary, David Cameron, is finishing a trip to the Middle East, in a diplomatic attempt to reduce tensions as the Israeli bombardment of Gaza continues.

VRV3AXGQO9_I2VXLLLHTOBCTCQ,Pakistan accuses Indian agents of two assassinations on its soil,Hannah Ellis-Petersen,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/25/pakistan-accuses-indian-agents-of-two-assassinations-on-its-soil,"Pakistan has said it has credible evidence that Indian agents carried out two assassinations on Pakistani soil, and drawn comparisons to the killing of a Sikh activist in Canada.
In a press briefing on Thursday, the foreign secretary, Muhammad Syrus Sajjad Qazi, said India was running a “sophisticated and sinister” campaign of “extraterritorial and extrajudicial killings” inside Pakistan.
He said: “Indian agents used technology and safe havens on foreign soil to commit assassinations in Pakistan. They recruited, financed and supported criminals, terrorists and unsuspecting civilians to play defined roles in these assassinations.”
India dismissed the allegations as “false and malicious anti-India propaganda”.
The accusations add fuel to claims that the Indian government has been carrying out targeted attacks against dissidents in foreign countries. Earlier this year the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said there were “credible allegations” linking Indian intelligence agents to the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a prominent Sikh activist who was killed in Canada in June. India denied the accusations as “absurd”.
The US made similar accusations against India, accusing Indian agents of directing an attempted assassination plot against Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a New York-based lawyer and prominent Sikh activist, which was foiled by US agents. The Indian government has said it is investigating these allegations.
The Indian government had deemed Nijjar and Pannun to be terrorists connected to the Khalistani movement, which fights for an independent state for Sikhs in Punjab and is outlawed in India. Both had been very vocal in stirring up diaspora support for the Khalistani movement.
At the briefing in Islamabad on Thursday, Qazi said there were similarities between these alleged assassination plots and those that he said took place in Pakistan.
“I see a modus operandi quite similar to the killing in Canada,” he said. “It was done at the behest of Indian government. We have the passport details of both Indian agents who orchestrated the killings on Pakistani soil.”
He added: “Clearly the Indian network of extrajudicial and extraterritorial killings has become a global phenomenon.”
India and Pakistan are arch-rivals and India has long accused Pakistan of giving a safe haven to terrorists, in particular militants responsible for violence in the disputed region of Kashmir, which has been home to a long-running insurgency with an allegiance to Pakistan.
Qazi said the government had evidence to show direct links between Indian agents and the murders of two Pakistani nationals, Muhammad Riaz in September and Shahid Latif in October last year. Riaz was shot dead while praying at a mosque in Rawalakot and Latif was killed outside a mosque in Sialkot.
An investigation by Pakistani agencies into Latif’s killing found that “an Indian agent based in a third country orchestrated the assassination”, Qazi said.
Similarly, after Pakistani authorities arrested the man accused of carrying out the murder of Riaz, he allegedly revealed that he had been recruited and guided by two Indian agents.
Qazi said the murders were orchestrated by Indian intelligence using a “sophisticated international set-up” spread over several countries, and that social media was used to recruit teams of financiers, locaters and assassins within Pakistan and outside to carry out the murders. He claimed Pakistani authorities had evidence of transactions linking the killings to an Indian agent.
He said investigations into other incidents were continuing. Calling the alleged killings “completely unacceptable”, Qazi said India needed to be held accountable.
“India must be held accountable internationally for its blatant violation of international law,” he said. “India’s assassination of Pakistani nationals on Pakistani soil is a violation of its sovereignty and a breach of the UN charter.”"
VRVC1MBHK9_4RZ8JQPT6IVICP1,Will Biden ever stand up to Benjamin Netanyahu? Don’t bet on it,Chris McGreal,_,20240118,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/25/biden-benjamin-netanyahu-israel-palestine,"Joe Biden has expended a lot of effort to avoid taking Benjamin Netanyahu at his word.
The Israeli prime minister has spent his political life opposing a Palestinian state and acting accordingly. And although Biden has trotted out a rote commitment to the two-state solution when confronted with a crisis in the Middle East, there was barely a murmur from the White House as Netanyahu’s far-right government ramped up creeping colonisation of the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem and hardened its domination of the Palestinians who live there.
So last week’s pronouncement by Netanyahu that there will be no Palestinian state, and that he intends to perpetuate Israel’s brand of apartheid through permanent military control of the West Bank, was no great revelation to Washington. The timing, however, means that this time it cannot be so easily shunted aside.
One effect of the Hamas attack on 7 October has been to push the Palestinian question back into the diplomatic spotlight after the US and its allies all but abandoned any real attempt to resolve the conflict in recent years and consigned it to the shadows.
During Netanyahu’s long tenure as prime minister of Israel, politicians in Washington, Brussels and London have continued to pay occasional lip service to two states but in talking to them privately it often seemed that they had concluded that the Palestinians were a defeated people – and so colluded in the Palestinians’ oppression by leaving Netanyahu to get on with his land grab.
Occasional objections to particularly egregious statements or actions by Netanyahu’s racist cabinet ministers might be raised, but no one was going to back up words with consequential action, least of all the Biden administration. This White House went a long way to avoid confrontation with Israel even before its largely unconditional support for the present war in Gaza, which has claimed more than 25,000 lives, most of them children and women, according to the health ministry there.
As Stephanie Kirchgaessner revealed in the Guardian last week, the US state department has a unit working to undermine American human rights laws by, in effect, covering up suspected crimes against humanity in the occupied territories in order to protect weapons shipments to Israel. The White House wouldn’t even stand up for a US citizen, the journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, when she was shot in 2022 in what looked very much like a cold-blooded killing by the Israeli army. And the US, as ever, has continued to wield its veto at the UN security council in support of Israel.
Netanyahu has repaid all of this by humiliating Biden.
Two weeks after the Hamas attack, Biden said that the Israel-Gaza crisis should result in a “concentrated effort” to create a Palestinian state. Last week, as attention shifts to what comes next, Netanyahu bluntly rejected any such plan.
In his desperation to sidestep reality, Biden even tried to deny that Netanyahu meant what he said. The White House claimed that the Israeli prime minister told the president in a phone call that he remains open to two states under certain conditions.
Netanyahu responded with an abrupt tweet killing that idea: “I will not compromise on full Israeli security control over the entire area west of Jordan – and this is contrary to a Palestinian state.”
Why would Netanyahu make such a statement at this time, publicly embarrassing the president of Israel’s most important and powerful ally? Because he’s learned that he can so without any real cost.
Netanyahu would have had one eye on domestic politics: he wants to shore up support in his far-right coalition by putting a damper on the sudden revival of talk in foreign capitals about getting a Palestinian state back on track, including reports that the White House is looking to a deal with a future Israeli government and Arab countries.
But the statement also reflects Netanyahu’s sense of impunity. Israeli leaders used to take pains to at least stay on the right side of the White House. But Netanyahu found that there were no real consequences for open contempt when he ran up against Barack Obama. The military aid and diplomatic protection continued to flow uninterrupted.
Obama came to power in 2009 saying he regarded the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a “constant sore” that “infect[s] all of our foreign policy”. His national security adviser, Gen James Jones, told a European leader that the administration would be “forceful” with Israel, and that the US, EU and moderate Arab states must define “a satisfactory endgame solution”.
When Netanyahu rejected Obama’s demand for a halt to settlement construction, the president suggested that Israeli intransigence endangered America’s security, a dramatic departure from the standard Washington line about the Jewish state as the US’s closest ally.
Netanyahu responded to the pressure by publicly lecturing Obama on a 2011 visit to the White House, and even used a clip of his humiliating treatment of the president in a later election campaign ad.
In the end, Obama wasn’t ready to risk the political capital required to press the Palestinian cause and retreated. He then signed the biggest-ever military aid bill to Israel – $3.8bn a year. Biden learned the lesson.
Even Donald Trump, who firmly sided with Netanyahu, had few illusions about the man who goes by the nickname Bibi.
“Bibi never wanted peace. He just tapped us along. Tap, tap, tap, tap …,” the Israeli journalist Barak Ravid says Trump told him in 2021.
It’s tempting to think that things might be different when Netanyahu is gone. Opinion polls show that most Israelis blame him for the political and military failures which allowed Hamas and other militant groups to slaughter 1,200 people and abduct more than 200 others on 7 October. But there’s not much sign of a serious commitment to negotiating a viable deal with the Palestinians among Netanyahu’s prospective successors, and it’s unlikely to come without serious US pressure.
Biden has shown that he is prepared to pay a political price for his support for Israel, which has angered many progressive Democrats at home and large parts of the rest of the world, which see the assault on Gaza as a vengeful bloodletting and further evidence of the systematic oppression of the Palestinians.
It is probably too much to hope that, in the face of Netanyahu’s intransigence, Biden will take the political risks to fight for a Palestinian state just as forcefully as he defends Israel. But if the president is not prepared to do so, it will be clearer than ever to the rest of the world that the US has chosen to stand with oppression.

VVAWHVTLTG_FPUSHLO4Q7CTMI0,‘Dark forces’: how US corporations turned to courts in fight against unions,Michael Sainato,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/26/anti-union-lawsuit-conservative-courts-musk-starbucks-trader-joes,"A multi-pronged legal attack under way by Elon Musk, large corporations, business groups and anti-union litigators threatens to “raise havoc” with US labor law and hobble a resurgent labor movement, according to experts.
So far efforts to scale back or undermine workers’ rights through the US courts have centered on the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) – the US top workplace watchdog and overseer of union elections. But other laws – including trademark and property rights statutes – are also being used.
Both Musk and Starbucks are pursuing cases that would undermine the NLRB.
Musk’s company SpaceX filed a lawsuit championed by the Federalist Society and other conservative groups against the NLRB in January. The lawsuit claims the board is unconstitutional because its members can only be removed for cause, not at will, and claims the board violates due process protections. The suit was filed in Texas by Musk’s attorneys with the union avoidance law firm Morgan Lewis in response to a board complaint that SpaceX fired workers in retaliation for writing a letter over concerns about Musk’s behavior.
“This is one of the most audacious and bold attempts to reverse the decisions of the 1930s and the way in which American labor law has operated for nearly 90 years,” said William Gould IV, Charles A Beardsley professor of law, emeritus, at Stanford Law School and chairman of the NLRB from 1994 to 1998. “This would raise havoc with the effective administration of labor law in our country which is designed to be for the benefit of workers and the collective bargaining process.”
Starbucks is challenging the NLRB’s ruling that the world’s largest coffee chain must rehire seven fired union activists in Memphis, Tennessee. The board won an injunction ordering Starbucks to reinstate the workers with backpay and a lower court ruled the firings probably discouraged other employees from exercising their rights under US labor law.
Starbucks Workers United union has won elections at more than 350 stores but has yet to agree a union contract at any location. NLRB regional offices and administrative law judges have found dozens of labor law violations committed by Starbucks since the union campaign began in late 2021.
The US supreme court will now hear the case, which centers on whether the NLRB has the right to ask courts to reinstate workers while litigation is ongoing – referred to as 10(j) injunctions. Unfair dismissal cases can take years to hear and the agency – which asked the supreme court not to take the case – has argued removing the power will have a chilling effect on union organizing.
Starbucks praised the decision: “We are pleased the supreme court has decided to consider our request to level the playing field for all US employers by ensuring that a single standard is applied as federal district courts determine whether to grant 10(j) injunctions pursued by the National Labor Relations Board,” a Starbucks spokesperson said in response to the decision.
Gould argued this case involves the most important tool that the NLRB currently has at its disposal to enforce the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).
“My labor board, when I was chairman in the 1990s, used this provision more than any other labor board in the entire 90-year history of the board. This is the most effective weapon we had,” Gould said.
“The ramifications are enormous,” he continued. “Everyone has recognized labor law reform is necessary to make the NLRA statute work. All Congress has given in the nature of labor law reform is section 10(j). The effect of this is to make wrongdoers less concerned about engaging in misconduct because they will not be brought to justice in the foreseeable future. The only way that the statute can work effectively is to operate judiciously so that workers when confronted with a choice about whether to join a union or not, will not be faced with a choice that means that they will have to wait two, three, four years before their rights can be realized. Section 10(j) is a way of providing for effective enforcement of the statute and this will discourage, I’m afraid, unionization, and will discourage workers who are interested in unionization.”
Given the supreme court’s conservative make-up, and recent decisions and opinions from some of the court’s most rightwing judges, Gould warned that the justices will likely rule in Starbucks’ favor. “This is a court that is hostile to unions, working people, and also my belief is it’s hostile [to] elected representatives altogether predicated upon the view that the unelected judges know more than the other branches of government,” he concluded.
But it is not just the watchdog that is under attack. Starbucks also filed a lawsuit late last year against Starbucks Workers United, alleging trademark infringement. Trader Joe’s filed a similar lawsuit against the union Trader Joe’s United, which a judge in California recently threw out. Medieval Times also filed a lawsuit against its workers’ union, claiming trademark infringement, which was also thrown out by a judge.
Seth Goldstein, a labor attorney representing Trader Joe’s United, said the trademark suits were part of an “emerging toolbox” of anti-union law firms “where they are really using everything they have to try to stop the new organizing movement”.
“I think that there are some dark forces here trying to stop the emerging organizing movement by perhaps throwing out the National Labor Relations Act, and the right of unions like Trader Joe’s, Starbucks or Medieval Times to have their own identification because they know they are losing the union elections and more young people, gen Z and millennials, are attracted to unionizing.”
A spokesperson for Trader Joe’s said in a statement: “Trader Joe’s consistently takes legal action to protect our brand when we become aware that someone other than Trader Joe’s is selling merchandise using our trademarks and trade dress. We will continue to take all appropriate action to protect our brand.”
Cathy Creighton, director of Cornell University’s Industrial and Labor Relations Buffalo Co-Lab and a former NLRB field attorney, said corporations have long used a number of tactics to prevent and dissuade their workers from organizing unions. These tactics have included firings, closing facilities, surveillance, offering increases to pay and benefits or withholding increases, refusing to bargain a first contract with units of workers who have unionized, and employing legal maneuvers to create delays and deplete the union’s resources.
“They’re trying to kill the movement. Corporate America is going full bore after the labor movement and that’s what they’re trying to do is to really annihilate them on every level that they can, including these legal maneuvers,” said Creighton. “There’s a whole body of NLRB case law that it is a violation of federal labor law to sue as a means to prevent organizing and bargaining, so there will be NLRB charges brought in this regard if there haven’t been already.”
Another increasingly popular tactic has been to argue that property rights supersede the rights of workers in workplaces, said David Muraskin, managing director for litigation at the legal advocacy group FarmSTAND.
Muraskin represented groups challenging a North Carolina state law that would have prevented whistleblowers from speaking with legislators, regulators or the media, a law that the North Carolina farm bureau federation defended in court. The US supreme court declined to hear an appeal of a lower court ruling that struck down four provisions of the law.
The North Carolina Farm Bureau did not return requests for comment.
“What the farm bureau and the state came in and said was, well, sure, there’s a first amendment right to record and there’s a first amendment right to speak. But all that is really trumped by the right to property. What’s so shocking about that argument is there is no constitutional right to property,” said Muraskin. “I think this is a way in which the right has turned a weak argument into an anti-social justice tool across a variety of areas, and they’re using it pretty aggressively.”
In New York and Colorado, agricultural business groups are fighting against legislation that ensures farm workers have access to essential services such as legal representation or healthcare, with business groups arguing that their property rights supersede the law.
Colorado passed the Agricultural Workers’ Rights bill in 2021, which would ensure farm workers can access essential service providers while on breaks. The Colorado Livestock Association and a group of farm owners and ranchers filed lawsuits to halt the law from being implemented, claiming the provision in the law violates employers’ rights to exclude people from their property.
“What the Colorado Livestock Association is doing in Colorado to try to weaponize the supreme court’s more business-friendly precedent is happening across the country,” said Kelsey Eberly, a senior attorney with FarmSTAND who is representing farm workers in an attempt to dismiss the lawsuit opposing the bill.
Jenifer Rodriguez, managing attorney of the Colorado Legal Services Migrant Farm Worker Division, argued opposition to the Colorado law is based on outdated precedence as US labor laws passed in the early 20th century excluded farm workers and domestic workers from basic protections that are afforded to other US workers.
She said laws placing the owners’ interests and their property rights over the rights of farmworkers were “based on laws that were originally designed to exclude Black people and immigrants that apply to other working people”.
Farm workers often work in isolated rural areas, and during harvest seasons do not have the time or means of transportation to access basic services, said Rodriguez. She also dismissed arguments against the law given property owners under the law are allowed to develop and enforce rules for visitors.
“Every person regardless of where they come from, what kind of work they do, or where they live, should have access to fundamental services like healthcare, education and legal help,” said Rodriguez.
A spokesperson for the Colorado Livestock Association said in an email on the business group’s attempt to block the law, “since the enactment of Senate Bill 21-087, there has been confusion and instances of individuals entering private property and businesses under the auspices of providing services to those employed on-premises. Colorado Livestock Association (CLA), along with others, has challenged through litigation the unlawful trespass by those posing as service providers for employees on private property as a part of these new labor laws. Additionally, CLA challenged the constitutionality of this provision in law. Given the nature of takings and the application of laws in this pretense, CLA believes compensation should be required by the enacting government entity. The real question is why Agribusinesses are not to be afforded the same reasonable expectation of private property as any other employment entity.”"
VVQL72ORCK_TKABB197RWC85HF,Natalie Dower obituary,_,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2024/jan/24/natalie-dower-obituary,"My friend Natalie Dower, who has died aged 92, was a highly respected artist whose abstract paintings, sculpture and 3D reliefs featured in many notable exhibitions exploring Systems and Constructivist art from the early 1980s onwards, including Rhythm and Geometry at the Sainsbury Centre, Norwich (2021).
Natalie was a wonderfully direct and inspiring person, whose work reflected a searching intelligence and true independence of character. An “artists’ artist”, she was deeply committed, painted every day and paid little attention to developing a public career. Paula Rego described her in the Art Newspaper in 2019 as one of the UK’s “most underrated” cultural figures.
She was born in London, the only child of Lavender (nee Clerk) and Col Alan Dower. Her father was the Conservative MP for Penrith and Cockermouth, and Natalie spent her early childhood at High Head Castle, in Cumbria, before becoming an unenthusiastic boarder at Benenden school in Kent. Trained at Camberwell School of Art (1949-52) and the Slade School of Fine Art (1952-54) in London, she made lifelong friendships with fellow artists including Craigie Aitchison, Patrick George and Rego.
Following art school she lived in Kent for 10 years with the painter Euan Uglow before moving to Morocco and later Estoril, in Portugal, where she established a studio in 1973.
While many of her contemporaries developed their work in relation to figurative traditions, Natalie took a different path. From the late 1960s she become increasingly influenced by the language of abstraction, crediting Malcolm Hughes for introducing her to a constructivist approach. She followed a personal, sometimes idiosyncratic route into systems art, producing a significant body of work over the next 50 years.
Natalie was highly experimental and never afraid to use new materials. Her work ranged from delicate, small-scale oils on panel and intricate painted wooden reliefs and sculpture, to majestic large-scale canvases and wall-based installations. She had solo exhibitions in London with, among others, Air Gallery, Curwen Gallery, Francis Graham Dixon Gallery, Jonathan Clark Fine Art and the Eagle Gallery/EMH Arts. In 2012 EMH Arts published Line of Enquiry, which traced her artistic development from 1947 onwards. She began showing in exhibitions that placed her work alongside that of much younger artists, who appreciated her influence and curated her into new contexts.
Diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in 2018, she faced illness with great fortitude and continued to paint using preparatory drawings she had made in earlier years. Her deep appreciation of music continued over this time and brought her great comfort.
Natalie is survived by a cousin, Rosanna Westmacott."

When Lauchlan Pritchard, 25, was finally stopped in Kent after driving through red lights, going the wrong way along a dual carriageway and trying to hit a police car, he told officers he thought his driving had been “brilliant”.
Pritchard, from Cheltenham, admitted dangerous driving and not having insurance or a valid licence and was jailed for 12 months at Gloucester crown court.
Steven Young, defending, said: “The reason he was driving to Kent was that his partner had gone into labour and that was where he was heading. That’s why he took the route he did. Luckily for all concerned there was no collision, but admittedly there were numerous examples of dangerous driving during the long pursuit.”
The judge Rupert Lowe told Pritchard: “You seemed to enjoy the police chase. You even claimed your driving was brilliant. You travelled at 90mph for long periods of time.”
Neil Treharne, prosecuting, told the court that on 20 November last year at about 9pm Gloucestershire police were alerted to a Suzuki Vitara being driven around Cirencester on cloned number plates.
Police began to follow the driver, who turned out to be Pritchard, as he joined the M4 heading towards London. When the officer activated their blue lights, he accelerated to 90mph and swerved across all three lanes of the motorway trying to get away.
Police followed him down a string of A-roads and motorways, and after he reached the M26 in Kent, police tried to pass him.
“As they did so Pritchard swerved the car about, narrowly missing the police vehicle,” Treharne said. “Pritchard then tried to hit the police vehicle many times but all his attempts were thwarted.”
Later, Pritchard drove into the market town of West Malling, Kent, at speed. Treharne said: “There were members of the public walking in the area. He suddenly stopped and began reversing and tried to ram the police vehicle before driving off at speed again.
“As Pritchard went through temporary red lights, a [police] stinger was deployed. It deflated the Suzuki’s tyres and brought the 141-mile pursuit to an end.”
The court heard that Pritchard immediately admitted he did not have a driving licence or any insurance but claimed he had no knowledge of the vehicle having cloned number plates."
VY5YQS1IY5_E404DM4Q8M0JX72,Man who stole Duke of Westminster’s watches given suspended sentence,_,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/26/man-who-stole-duke-of-westminsters-watches-given-suspended-sentence,"A decorator who stole three watches worth more than £30,000 from the Duke of Westminster’s home has been told he “escaped prison by the skin of your teeth”.
Matthew Turner, 24, was given a 20-month sentence, suspended for two years, at Chester crown court after admitting the burglary of three watches from Hugh Grosvenor’s bedroom while he was doing renovation work at Eaton Hall in August 2022.
The court heard Turner, who was addicted to cocaine at the time, took a Cartier London Tank JC watch, bought for £18,000, a Panerai Luminor Marina watch, worth £7,000, and a Breitling watch, bought for Grosvenor’s 21st birthday by his mother and late father and worth about £7,000.
The burglary was revealed only when Harry Fane, who sold the Cartier watch to Grosvenor, spotted it for sale on an auction website in November that year in what was described in court as an “astonishing coincidence”.
The other two watches had never been recovered, the court heard.
In a statement read to the court, Grosvenor said the watches were “of huge sentimental value, beyond their financial worth”.
He added: “My bedroom is a private, extremely personal space within my home. I feel very uncomfortable knowing someone who is trusted to do a job has entered my room and stolen my personal possessions.”
During sentencing, Judge Everett told Turner: “You have escaped prison by the skin of your teeth.”
He said it was clear Turner had declined to tell police where the other two watches were. “You made that decision not to, suggesting at least one of the watches went to your drug dealer.”
At the time of the offence, Turner was employed by a firm that had worked on Grosvenor’s estate, south of Chester, for more than 50 years and were “well and truly trusted” by the family, the court heard.
Grosvenor, 32, is one of the UK’s richest men and is godfather to Prince George. He inherited his family’s billion-pound fortune and estate when his father, Gerald, died in 2016.
Myles Wilson, defending, said Turner had been spending hundreds of pounds on cocaine.

“It’s a typical scenario where his debts increase, his dealers become more desperate, he becomes more desperate and he’s committed crime and really self-destructed,” Wilson said.
Peter Hussey, prosecuting, said Turner had admitted a separate offence of theft after stealing £60 from the wallet of a colleague, Callum Parry, while working at Top Gear Tyres, in Ellesmere Port, in December 2022.
Everett said although the financial backgrounds of both victims were “entirely different” the end result was the same.
Turner, who was supported in court by his father and stepmother, nodded in the dock when told he must complete 200 hours of unpaid work and 30 days of rehabilitation.
The judge ordered him to pay £500 compensation to Parry but said no order he could make could “possibly compensate” for the loss to Grosvenor."

But in recent months fiery volcanic fissures have been bursting open, spilling straight lines of lava across the landscape. This month several homes in Grindavík were destroyed as molten rock spilled into the town. The fires have dampened down for now but the rock record suggests there are more to come.
“Reykjanes is fed by five volcanic systems, many of which come to life every 800 to 1,000 years,” says Dave McGarvie, a volcanologist at Lancaster University. The last time this happened was about 1,100 years ago – soon after the Vikings had established themselves on Iceland – and the Reykjanes fires, as they were known, erupted on and off for about 300 years.
Today the peninsula is a busier place and home to an airport, a geothermal power plant and a number of small towns including Grindavík and Þorlákshöfn. The airport does not sit on any of the volcanic systems but the power plant – which supplies heat and hot water to around 30,000 people – straddles a magma reservoir. If history repeats, Iceland can expect decades of Reykjanes fires, but its people are good at preparing for volcanism and finding ways to live alongside it."
W0MRVJ3K5P_ZHW5PO8SHXDVTAG,Tantrums and threats: key takeaways from Trump’s E Jean Carroll trial,Victoria Bekiempis,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/26/key-takeaways-trump-e-jean-carroll-trial,"E Jean Carroll won $83.3m in her New York defamation trial against Donald Trump. The decision on Friday came some nine months after another Manhattan federal court jury awarded Carroll $5m in a separate defamation and sexual assault trial against Trump.
In 2019, Carroll came forward with a rape claim against Trump in her then forthcoming book, What Do We Need Men For? A Modest Proposal, an excerpt of which ran that June in New York magazine. Trump responded to Carroll’s claim – that he sexually assaulted her in a high-end department store dressing room around early 1996 – by saying she was a dishonest political operative.
Carroll sued him for defamation, as the statute of limitations barred her from suing over the assault. When a New York law in 2022 granted accusers a one-year window to sue their abusers for incidents outside the civil statute of limitations, Carroll commenced another civil action – this time for the assault and his defamatory statements about her post-presidency.
That lawsuit went to trial in April 2023; as the jury found that Trump sexually abused and defamed her, Judge Lewis Kaplan decided that these findings would be accepted as fact in this second trial. As they were, jurors only weighed damages.
Here are some key moments from the proceedings:
Similar to her testimony at the first trial, Carroll said that the tone of Trump’s denials destroyed her reputation and, by impugning her as dishonest, laid waste to her journalism career. “I’m here because Donald Trump assaulted me, and when I wrote about it, he said it never happened,” Carroll said.
“He lied, and it shattered my reputation,” she also said, at another point, testifying: “I expected him to deny it, but to say it was consensual, when it was not. But that’s what I expected him to say.”
“The thing that really got me about this was, from the White House, he asked if anyone had any information about me, and if they did, to please come forward as soon as possible, because he wanted the world to know what’s really going on – and that people like me should pay dearly,” she told jurors.
Carroll was presented with some of those threats on the stand. “I hope you die soon. I hope someone really does attack, rape and murder you,” one message stated. Another missive read: “Rape Jean rape jean.”
The writer said that she got a pit bull that roams leash-less on her property. “He now patrols very eagerly and enthusiastically,” Carroll told the court. Carroll also said she bought bullets for a gun that she inherited from her father.
Asked where she kept the gun, Carroll said: “By my bed.”
The ex-president’s lead attorney on this case, Alina Habba, tried to discredit the former Elle columnist – who wrote about relationships and sex – by pointing to her cheeky tweets and social media posts. “Did you ever post any tweets that could be considered sexually explicit?” Habba asked.
While that question was shot down with a sustained objection, Habba hammered on.

“Ms Carroll, what does this say: ‘What CAN be done about the penis? It gets large when you want it small, and stays small when you want it large,’” Habba asked, showing a 2013 tweet. “Those were your words, correct?”
Carroll answered in the affirmative and also said yes when Habba asked whether she had posted that question to social media. “You discussed penises?” Habba said shortly thereafter. Carroll replied, “Yes.”
Trump repeatedly had outbursts in court as Carroll testified, her lawyers told Judge Kaplan. “The defendant has been making statements again [that] we can hear at counsel table,” Shawn Crowley, one of her attorneys, said. “He said it is a ‘witch-hunt’, it really is a con-job.”
Because Judge Kaplan had ruled that this trial would not re-litigate Carroll’s rape and defamation claims, the jury was only charged with assessing damages. As a result, Kaplan limited what Trump’s lawyers could ask him, as well as the extent of his answers.
One of the questions Habba was permitted to ask was: “Do you stand by your testimony in the deposition?”, in which Trump had rejected Carroll’s claims. “One hundred percent, yes,” Trump said.
“Did you deny the allegation because Ms Carroll made an accusation?” Habba asked, presaging the beginning of trouble for Trump.
“That’s exactly right. She said something, I consider it a false accusation. No difference,” Trump responded, spurring an objection from Carroll’s lawyers. Kaplan deemed that every word following “yes, I did” would be stricken.
The next exchange didn’t go that well, either. “Did you ever instruct anyone to hurt Ms Carroll in your statements?”
“No. I just wanted to defend myself, my family, and frankly, the presidency,” Trump said, prompting still another objection. Kaplan said that everything after “no” be stricken, which meant that jurors had to disregard this commentary."
W1DUQ16625_35CYXTDI25LXHYL,Man in Welsh-language parking penalty battle claims company ‘harassed’ him,Steven Morris,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/26/man-in-welsh-language-parking-penalty-battle-claims-company-harassed-him,"A Welsh-language campaigner embroiled in a three-year legal battle after refusing to pay a car park fine written in English has claimed the management firm is “threatening” him with a £10,000 legal bill.
Toni Schiavone was given the £70 penalty notice in a car park managed by One Parking Solution in the seaside town of Llangrannog, west Wales, in September 2020.
He has said he is happy to pay the penalty notice, but only if the parking company, which is based in south-east England, translated it into Welsh, which he estimates would cost them about £60.
At a hearing on Friday, the judge, Gareth Humphreys, said it was unfortunate the case, which has become a cause celebre among Welsh language champions, had dragged on for so long and asked the company to consider whether it was worth pursuing. Otherwise, a county court hearing to decide the case will take place at a later date.
Schiavone told the court: “This issue could have been resolved very easily and very quickly by providing a Welsh or bilingual notice, which would have cost around £60 to translate.”
He said he felt he was the victim of “harassment” and told the judge he had received in the post on Thursday a letter from One Parking Solution stating they were claiming more than £10,000 in legal costs.
“I think that’s wrong, threatening, without need,” he told the court, adding that he thought it showed the company wanted revenge rather than justice.
The judge, sitting in Wrexham, north Wales, confirmed that the cost schedule he had received was for £10,156 and dated 24 January. He said this “certainly would not be allowed” because Schiavone had not acted unreasonably. The company’s barrister, Richard Mullan, said it would not pursue costs.
During the hearing, Schiavone and the judge spoke in Welsh, the company’s barrister in English. Schiavone has twice before thought he had won the case but the company appealed and Humphreys agreed that mistakes had been made in how it had been previously dealt with.
After the hearing, Cai Phillips, of Cymdeithas yr Iaith, the Welsh Language Society, said: “We call on One Parking Solution to drop the case. This company has chosen to make an example of Toni rather than provide a very simple Welsh service.”
Cymdeithas has long criticised the Welsh Language Measure 2011, which places duties on bodies to provide services in Welsh, for being weak, ambiguous and not always enforced.
It says it is particularly poor in areas of the private sector such as banking, post offices and supermarkets. Car parks are not covered by the law. It wants the Welsh government and the Welsh language commissioner to revise the measure to include aspects of the private sector."
W1T4IQ7Q6R_984W3C4W9EV37ZH,Underground hydrogen discovery in France raises hopes for clean energy,Jeremy Plester,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/25/underground-hydrogen-discovery-france-raises-hopes-for-clean-energy,"Hydrogen has long been seen as a wonder fuel that does not give off greenhouse gases when used, and which could help replace fossil fuels. But there is at least one major drawback to this idea because the production of hydrogen largely uses fossil fuels and so making clean hydrogen from the process of splitting water needs renewable sources of electricity. Lots of power is required and it is expensive.
Less well known are deposits of natural hydrogen buried underground. Scientists at the University of Lorraine were searching for methane in north-east France, when they unexpectedly discovered a large deposit of natural hydrogen more than 1,000 metres deep underground. This hydrogen is produced by groundwater reacting with iron-rich minerals, splitting the water into hydrogen, possibly renewing itself almost indefinitely.
Natural hydrogen deposits have been found before and there is already a small well in western Mali. Larger deposits are thought to exist elsewhere, such as the US, Australia and some European countries. But the discovery in France could be the largest naturally occurring deposit of the gas ever found, possibly 250m tonnes of hydrogen, enough to meet current global demand for more than two years. The challenge is how to transport that gas to where it is needed."
W6NPD990QW_RBHK9WFHJ3TPDEN,Johnny Marr blasts Donald Trump for playing the Smiths song at rally,Sian Cain,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/jan/24/johnny-marr-the-smiths-songs-playing-at-donald-trump-rally-rallies,"The Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr has signalled that he will move to stop Donald Trump’s presidential campaign from using the band’s music at his rallies.
Marr responded on X after a user shared footage of a Trump rally in South Dakota in 2023 in which the Smiths song Please, Please, Please Let Me Get What I Want can be heard playing as the crowd waits for the former president to come on stage.
“Ahh…right…OK,” Marr wrote in reply to the video. “I never in a million years would’ve thought this could come to pass. Consider this shit shut right down right now.”
Ahh…right…OK. I never in a million years would’ve thought this could come to pass. Consider this shit shut right down right now. https://t.co/M6eYROedOy
The Smiths’ music has reportedly been heard at multiple Trump rallies recently, including at his rally in Laconia, New Hampshire on Monday.
Musicians including Adele, the Beatles, Bruce Springsteen, Elton John, the Rolling Stones, Queen, Pharrell Williams and the estates of Prince, David Bowie and Tom Petty have objected in the past to Trump and his team playing their music at public events.
Some acts, including the Rolling Stones, have issued cease-and-desist directives to prevent Trump’s campaign playing their music. However, in the case of the Rolling Stones and Prince, Trump’s campaign has, on occasion, continued to use their music after pledging not to.
The Guardian has contacted Marr’s representative to clarify what he may do to stop Trump from playing Smiths music.
Marr co-wrote Please, Please, Please Let Me Get What I Want with Smiths frontman Morrissey in 1984. Where Morrissey has praised Brexit and expressed support for the far-right political party For Britain, Marr has spoken out against rightwing politics and politicians who like the Smiths.

WAIL6RGVO6_91M4DPX52PDII0Q,ICJ ruling increases pressure on Israel to prevent civilian deaths in Gaza,Haroon Siddique,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/26/icj-ruling-increases-pressure-israel-prevent-civilian-deaths-gaza,"Israel is under renewed pressure to avoid civilian deaths in Gaza and enable the delivery of humanitarian aid after the international court of justice (ICJ) ordered it to prevent its forces from carrying out genocide against Palestinians.
In a historic interim judgment, the UN court in The Hague told Israel it must “take all measures within its power” to desist from killing Palestinians in contravention of the genocide convention, and to prevent and punish the incitement of genocide and facilitate the provision of “urgent basic services”. But the ruling stopped short of ordering a ceasefire to the war in Gaza.
After Friday’s ruling, attention turned to whether Israel would comply with the order – given that the court has no enforcement powers – and what pressure its diplomatic and military backers would bring to bear on it to do so.
In a televised address, South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, said: “Today, Israel stands before the international community, its crimes against the Palestinians laid bare … We expect Israel as a self-proclaimed democracy and a state that respects the rule of law to abide by the measures handed down.”
He criticised those who “told us we should mind our own business and not get involved in the affairs of other countries”.
Germany, which backed Israel, and the EU and Turkey also called for Israel to comply with the ruling.
There was disappointment among Palestinian supporters that the court did not go further and order Israel to stop its assault on Gaza, as South Africa had demanded. The ICJ previously ordered Russia to stop its invasion of Ukraine, although it was ignored by Vladimir Putin.
The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who previously vowed that “no one will stop us, not The Hague”, did not indicate whether the ruling would lead to any changes in its military campaign but expressed satisfaction that the court had not ordered a ceasefire.
“Israel’s commitment to international law is unwavering. Equally unwavering is our sacred commitment to continue to defend our country and defend our people. Like every country, Israel has an inherent right to defend itself,” he said. “The vile attempt to deny Israel this fundamental right is blatant discrimination against the Jewish state, and it was justly rejected.”
Israel’s biggest ally, the US, which had described the case as “meritless”, said it continued to believe that allegations of genocide were unfounded and noted the court did not make a finding about genocide or call for a ceasefire in its ruling.
The US judge Joan Donoghue, who read out the order, said Israel’s response had left the civilian population of Gaza “extremely vulnerable”, resulting “in tens of thousands of deaths and injuries and the destruction of homes, schools, medical facilities and other vital infrastructure, as well as displacement on a massive scale”.
“The court notes that the operation is ongoing, and that the prime minister of Israel announced on 18 January 2024 that the war, I quote, ‘will take many more long months’.”
More than 1% of Gaza’s population – 25,700 people – have been killed according to authorities in the strip, and most of its 2.3 million population displaced by Israel’s bombing, which began after the 7 October attacks by Hamas in which militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 240 hostage.
Many Palestinians are living in makeshift accommodation, including tents, UN-run shelters in schools or on the floors of hospitals, or outside in freezing, unsanitary conditions. There is a shortage of food, water and medical supplies.
The measures, all backed by at least 15 judges, also required Israel to ensure the preservation of evidence of alleged genocide and report to the court within a month.
Donoghue said the court was “gravely concerned” about the fate of the hostages abducted from Israel on 7 October “and calls for their immediate and unconditional release”.
The ruling is not the final word from the court on whether Israel’s actions amount to genocide, but it provides a strong indication that the judges believe there is a credible risk to Palestinians under the 1948 genocide convention, enacted after the mass murder of Jews in the Nazi Holocaust.
Granting South Africa’s application for special measures, the court did not have to find whether Israel had committed genocide, which will be determined at a later date, but only that its acts were capable of falling within the convention, which defines the war crime as “acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group”.
Donoghue said the court “considers that the catastrophic humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip is at serious risk of deteriorating further before the court rendered its final judgment [on whether Israel has committed genocide]”.
She said the court had “taken note” of statements made by senior Israeli officials including Yoav Gallant, Israel’s defence minister, who called for a total siege of Gaza and said Israel was fighting “human animals”.
While Israel has been scathing of the case against it and South Africa for bringing it, it was significant that it hired a strong legal team to rebut it rather than choosing not to cooperate.
In a direct riposte to the US, the Palestinian ambassador to the UN, Majed Bamya, tweeted: “Not so ‘meritless’ after all! Hope all the states that made dismissive statements on this case brought forward by South Africa against Israel on genocide finally stop bending the law and breaking its rule to fit Israeli crimes and atrocities against the Palestinian people.”
The Palestinian foreign minister, Riyad al-Maliki, called it a decision “in favour of humanity and international law”.
Outside the court building, protests organised by pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli supporters gathered under different video screens to watch Donoghue deliver the interim ruling.
Loud cheers erupted among the pro-Palestinian crowd – which included the climate activist Greta Thunberg – when the court said Israel must prevent acts within the scope of the genocide convention, but others expressed frustration that the judges had not ordered a ceasefire. Many in the pro-Israeli demonstration held photographs of hostages held by Hamas.
The UN agency for Palestinian refugees said on Friday it had opened an investigation into several employees suspected of involvement in the 7 October attacks in Israel by Hamas, and that it had severed ties with those staff members after information was provided by Israel. The US state department said it would not provide additional funding to the agency until the allegations were addressed."
WGNVB9OZ3Q_OD182Y6SPGWMYUJ,‘The destruction was intense’: the photos which capture Gaza’s humanitarian crisis,Graeme Green,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2024/jan/25/ten-days-in-gaza-photography-dawton-mcfarlane,"In February 2010, Australian photographer Jim McFarlane was documenting local children at an after-school club in Gaza City. Teachers had asked each child to bring in a sentimental item – something important to them. “One young boy, maybe 12 years old, brought along a blue plastic bag,” McFarlane tells me, his voice breaking. “Inside the bag were some bomb fragments and a tin, and inside the tin were the ashes of his father, who he saw get killed. That’s something I’ll always remember.”
The emotional encounter was one of many during a 10-day assignment in Gaza, where McFarlane was working as part of a trio of international photographers. They were there to document the lives of people in the wake of the Israeli incursion of December 27, 2008, known as Operation Cast Lead, which took place a year previously, and killed 1,417 Gazans, including 313 children. Thirteen Israelis, including three civilians, were killed in the period’s violence, four from friendly fire.
The driving force behind the photographic mission, which was supported by Save the Children, was Lebanese-English photographer Anthony Dawton, who’d been working in the West Bank with children’s charity Al Madad Foundation. Dawton brought along McFarlane, a colleague and close friend he’d met while living in Melbourne in the 1980s, and Italian photographer Giuseppe Aquili, who’d started out as Dawton’s assistant. Their backgrounds were in commercial photography, including weddings and advertising, but all found documentary photography more rewarding. “We want to show the reality of life in the places we work,” McFarlane says.
The trio’s 2010 Children of Gaza exhibition raised more than £150,000 for Save the Children in Gaza. Their images have been collected again for Ten Days in Gaza, a new book that the photographers crowdfunded after the recent Israeli offensive, following Hamas’s 7 October terror attack, with all funds from sales again going to FQMS: Al Quds Foundation for Medical Schools in Palestine.
It took six months to arrange permissions for their 2010 trip, the three men entering from Israel via the Erez crossing. “The destruction was intense,” says Aquili. “It was evident everywhere we went: people trying to rebuild or places still literally falling apart. The invasion had levelled so many buildings. People were dejected.”
Currently, 2 million people live on 365 square kilometres of land in Gaza, which contains eight refugee camps. “It was dreadful to see the conditions people were living in,” Dawton tells me. “Even the houses that were still standing had nothing you could call a modern convenience. People lived on nothing but they were kind and hospitable. All they were left with was education. We went to a girls’ school that had been bombed. The teachers were still teaching in the rubble. They were reading Charles Dickens – they asked me to take the class for 10 minutes. Moments like those uplifted me.”
Photographers working together is unusual, but the trio found benefits in their partnership. “It gave me freedom and safety,” explains Aquili. “When you work on your own, you worry about missing the moment – you’re trying to capture everything. But as there were two other photographers, I knew I could open my eyes, look around more, and maybe listen to a story, instead of taking pictures of everything.”
Since Gaza, Dawton and McFarlane have collaborated on other projects, including Syrian refugee camps in Jordan, Palestinian camps in Lebanon, and the city of Cox’s Bazar in Bangladesh, home to more than 1 million Rohingya Muslims who fled Myanmar. Aquili now works as a pastry chef in Italy.
Their experiences in Gaza made a lasting impact. “It made me realise how alike we all are,” says Aquili. “If you take away the regional and cultural differences, and look at the kids and families, they’re just people trying to make the best with what they have. Even among all the destruction and sacrifices they have to make, that was what the parents were thinking about: to try to better their lives and give their children hope for the future.
Anthony Dawton “We were taken to a shelled building on the edge of Beit Hanoun. Apart from this boy, his sister and baby brother, the house seemed deserted. The boy took me to this shell hole in the wall and said the shell only just missed him. He adopted a look that made him seem older. I realised, belatedly, that I was looking at shellshock.”
Giuseppe Aquili “I found this scene just outside Beit Lahiya. This Gaza road laid bare the contrast between the two countries, with smooth tarmacked roads and modern cars in Israel set against the scene here: donkeys pulling makeshift carts, no pavements and the piled-up steel wire evidence of severe bomb damage.”

Anthony Dawton “We came across this street in Gaza City and saw a bunch of kids on our first day. It’s the cliche for photographers in conflict zones to show children reflecting the environment they have known since birth: the “Kalashnikov”, the stone-thrower, and the already traumatised child. Although some of that was true, we were to find the effect of growing up in Gaza was more complex and surprising.”
Giuseppe Aquili “At this bombed playground, the destroyed slide looked like a stretcher. Had children been playing when the bomb fell? Would the strongest photograph involve children? After all, we had come to Gaza to photograph the children who lived there. I compromised. The children are walking in the middle distance, ghost-like.”
Anthony Dawton “I observed this young girl in what turned out to be the ruins of her family house in Gaza City. She had a toy mobile phone hanging around her neck. I was told her mother had been killed when the house was bombed, and that the girl had tried to call her on her ‘phone’. It was one of those photographs I felt bad about taking, about intruding, even though it was taken using my longest lens, but I knew it had to be taken.”
Main image: Jim McFarlane“The photograph was taken in Rafah in the south of Gaza, where the tunnels were. This was an area we were asked to avoid on safety grounds but the tunnels are such an important part of the Gaza story. The boy running across my frame gave the image scale and contrast to the destroyed building, and his energy gave poignancy to the photograph, or even hope.”
Ten Days in Gaza is published on 12 March (Hood Hood Books, £40). An exhibition is also planned for a London venue (TBC) in March. More of Dawton and McFarlane’s work.

WI5G059T2G_3QU4KU1FLPJ06G4,Valdo Calocane: what are high-security hospitals and could his sentence be changed?,Jamie Grierson,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/26/valdo-calocane-what-are-high-security-hospitals-sentence,"On Thursday, Valdo Calocane, an engineering graduate diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, was sentenced to a hospital order with restrictions for killing three people and attempting to kill three others in a violent spree across Nottingham.
The decision enraged the families of his victims, who believe he should have been prosecuted for murder, with one saying they were “railroaded” into accepting Calocane’s plea to the lesser charge of manslaughter.
Here is a breakdown of the sentencing – and what could happen next.
The attorney general is looking at Calocane’s sentence after it was referred for being “unduly lenient”. This is a process that can be triggered by just one referral from an individual or institution.
The situation is complicated because the attorney general is unable to look at Calocane’s charge: he was originally charged with murder but this was converted to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility because of severely poor mental health, to which he pleaded guilty.
The restricted hospital order was handed down by the judge based on the medical evidence provided by doctors on Calocane’s condition, schizophrenia.
A more severe sentence would presumably be a prison sentence, in which case if the attorney general were to progress the case, they would have to argue that Calocane’s condition was not as severe as presented by the doctors, which is a highly unlikely scenario.
If a person is found guilty of a crime that can be punishable with a prison sentence, the courts can send them to a hospital instead. The judge can do this under section 37 of the Mental Health Act.
If the judge believes the person is a risk to the public, they can add a restriction to the hospital order under section 41 of the same act. The restriction means that the person subject to the order can only be discharged from hospital if the justice secretary agrees.
Before the courts issue a hospital order under section 37, two doctors need to assess the defendant. They must agree that they have a mental disorder that means they should be in hospital. One of these doctors should be from the hospital where the person will be staying.
In order to add a restriction under section 41, one of the doctors who assessed the person must speak in court to give evidence about their condition.
Since 2007, a restricted hospital order does not have a time limit. This means the hospital order does not have a fixed end date and does not need to be renewed. The responsible clinician will decide when a person is well enough to leave hospital and the Ministry of Justice must agree for them to be discharged.
According to the NHS, high-security hospitals’ physical security arrangements are equivalent to those of a category B prison, although they are able to treat individuals who in a prison setting would be in a category A environment.
An inpatient can be given treatment without their consent for the first three months, and can then be treated without consent only if a second doctor agrees.
There are three in England. Perhaps the most well known is Broadmoor hospital in Crowthorne, Berkshire. The other two are Ashworth hospital near Liverpool and Rampton secure hospital in Nottinghamshire.
According to the most recent data, there were 7,796 restricted patients as of 31 December 2022. There were 1,524 disposals and discharges in that year, a 1% decrease from the previous year. The annual number of discharges and disposals has fluctuated between 1,350 and 1,550 since 2011.
There have been many well-known inpatients of high-security hospitals, including the Moors murderer Ian Brady, who died in hospital; the Yorkshire Ripper, Peter Sutcliffe, who was transferred to prison later in life and died behind bars; and the London gangster Ronnie Kray, who died in Broadmoor in 1995."
WLJKXCZTE0_IHZI9A6IHZMGV3D,Oldest known Scottish tartan ‘brought back to life’ for people to wear,Charlie Moloney,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/22/oldest-known-scottish-tartan-piece-glen-affric-peat-bog-recreated,"The oldest known piece of true tartan ever found, which was discovered in a peat bog, has been recreated by experts.
Uncovered about 40 years ago in a bog in Glen Affric in the Highlands, the tartan underwent rigorous testing last year to confirm it was the oldest surviving true piece of the traditional patterned cloth.
The Glen Affric tartan dates from 1500 to 1600, the Scottish Tartans Authority confirmed. It went on to be exhibited at the V&A Dundee.
It has now been recreated for people to wear by a manufacturer and distributor of tartan fabrics, the House of Edgar, under the guidance of a tartan historian.
The tartan features the colours that dye analysis of the original material had confirmed – this included the use of green, yellow and red, which would have come from woad or indigo to create the green, along with other natural dyes.
Emma Wilkinson, the designer for House of Edgar who worked on the project, commented: “I create new tartans every day but this project is truly special – a once in a lifetime opportunity to recreate a piece of history.
“Tartan is such an iconic piece of Scotland’s identity and it has been a true pleasure to see this fabric come back to life to be enjoyed for generations to come.”
The historian who guided the manufacturer in recreating the product, Peter E MacDonald, who is head of research and collections at the Scottish Tartans Authority, said: “It was a privilege to examine the Glen Affric specimen, which represents an extraordinary survivor of our textile history.

“The dye analysis, carbon-14 dating and a detailed study of the piece, together with a collaboration with House of Edgar, has brought back to life a tartan that allows us to reach back in time and touch history.
“It is quite special to see the tartan remade as it could have been 500 years ago.”
James Wylie, assistant curator at the V&A Dundee, said: “The Glen Affric tartan took the world by storm when it was revealed prior to the opening of V&A Dundee’s Tartan exhibition and continued to be a major draw for many visitors over the past nine months.
“I am excited its legacy can now live on through the studious efforts of the Scottish Tartans Authority and House of Edgar in reinterpreting its design, for the enjoyment and interest of all who cherish tartan’s historic allure.”"
WQ464L4JPP_TPEA2PNY09QRBI0,James Dyson’s £6m donation to primary school approved despite concerns,Sally Weale,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/22/james-dyson-donation-to-primary-school-approved-despite-concerns,"A £6m donation from Sir James Dyson to help fund the expansion of his local state primary school has been approved by the government, despite concerns about the potential impact on neighbouring schools.
The education secretary, Gillian Keegan, announced on Monday that she had given the green light for the inventor’s donation to Malmesbury Church of England primary school in Wiltshire, which is close to Dyson’s research and development campus.
It will pay for a “first-class” science, technology, engineering, art and maths (Steam) centre plus additional classrooms and, subject to planning permission by Wiltshire council, will open from September 2027, providing capacity for an additional 210 pupils, taking the total to 630.
It is understood the James Dyson Foundation stopped short of welcoming the education secretary’s announcement and said it is carefully examining the detail of the decision.
In a letter to the Times last year, Dyson said the donation via his charitable foundation had been blocked by officials. “It’s incredibly depressing,” he told the paper. “It is a sorry example of how hard it is to get anything done in Britain.”
His claim was denied by Downing Street, but there was local opposition. Laura Mayes, Wiltshire council’s cabinet member for children’s services, said there were already sufficient places in three local schools to meet demand.
Reports have suggested that many of the 3,500 employees who work at Dyson’s UK headquarters in Malmesbury would like to send their children to the school, but it is currently not big enough.
Keegan said: “I welcome this generous donation from the Dyson Foundation which will support cutting-edge education for local pupils, helping to develop the scientists and engineers of the future.
“This new centre will provide world-class facilities for pupils in Malmesbury and the surrounding areas to inspire them and develop the skills we need to compete on the world stage.
“The £6m donation builds on the work we have been doing to boost the uptake of Stem subjects in schools and through apprenticeships and further education, boosting growth and opportunity in these vital sectors.”
Steve Heal, the headteacher at Malmesbury primary school, told the Times: “We are incredibly grateful to Sir James Dyson, and the James Dyson Foundation, for enthusiastically backing the project from its inception. It’s been a long journey to get to this point.”
He said it was “a wonderful thing for Malmesbury. It is also a phenomenal opportunity to shape the future of learning through an innovative curriculum created with Dyson. This will open up a world of opportunity for children in Malmesbury and beyond.”
After the government’s announcement, Mayes said: “We have an important responsibility to ensure all our school pupils can access opportunities that inspire them and help them achieve their potential.
“Our school places strategy is our long-term plan, based on clear evidence, which maps out how we will secure sufficient school places for the future.
“Our strategy shows we have sufficient places in the three local schools to cater for expected demand and we have expressed concern about the impact that adding 210 additional places at Malmesbury primary school could have on neighbouring schools.
“However, we now have the government’s final decision and we will work with everyone involved to ensure we achieve the best outcomes for all our pupils.”
Kenneth Baker, who was education secretary under Margaret Thatcher, had backed Dyson. In a letter to the Times, he said: “It is almost unheard of for any large industrial company to support education in this very extended and committed way.
“If the government rejects the proposal, over misplaced concerns about excess school places, why should other industries and entrepreneurs be remotely interested in trying to improve technical education in schools?”"
WQC5S6BKQX_G8X8A6GDQZZKFSM,"UK parents worried about screens, but children say they now feel safer online",Sally Weale,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/25/uk-parents-worried-about-screens-but-children-say-they-now-feel-safer-online,"UK parents are worried that screen time is taking over family life and damaging their children’s physical health, yet young people say they feel more confident online and their “digital wellbeing” has improved, according to a major survey.
More than half of parents (57%) who took part in the survey said they thought screen use was having an adverse effect on their child’s sleep, while nearly two-thirds (63%) said it had a negative impact on health, up from 58% last year.
Although parents were more anxious, their children provided a more positive view of their lives online, and reported feeling safer, more confident, more independent and empowered. “There’s a positive story to tell this year,” the report said.
“The index scores reveal a rise in positive developmental, emotional and social experiences of children – a reversal of the downward trend observed in the previous two years.”
The report is the third annual Internet Matters Index, which attempts to track the impact of digital technology on children’s physical, social, emotional, and developmental wellbeing.
One of the main areas of concern the report highlights is the growing number of children being messaged online by strangers, particularly girls who are significantly more likely to experience the harms of being online.
Almost half of 15- to 16-year-old girls reported being contacted by people they did not know, up from three in 10 a year earlier, while overall two-thirds of participating children (67%) reported harmful experiences online.
Internet Matters, which is an internet safety organisation, asked parents to measure on a scale of 0-10 how far they agreed with the statement: “We often find ourselves spending time on our own devices rather than doing things together.” Nearly a third (31%) selected scores of between eight and 10, up from 20% – “one of the most notable shifts” over the past year.
Carolyn Bunting, the co-CEO of Internet Matters, said: “Parents need to ask how families can get the balance right between the time spent online and time spent offline, and whether they are always setting the best example for their children when it comes to using phones and other tech devices.”
Dame Rachel de Souza, the children’s commissioner for England, said: “Over the last few months, I have been travelling all over England as part of my Big Ambition survey asking children and young people about what they want the next government to do and one issue that came up as being a big concern was online safety.
“Too many are seeing really disturbing material and feel vulnerable online, which is why I am calling on the tech companies to step up and take immediate action to keep our children safe from online harm.”
Children who took part in the survey felt less affected by online harms than they did last year. A quarter (24%) saw racist, homophobic, or sexist content as really upsetting or scary, down from 35%, while one in 10 (9%) saw content promoting unrealistic body types as upsetting, down from 22%.
“However,” the report notes, “this could be because experiencing harm online might be becoming normalised in the eyes of children, something they see as inevitable and part and parcel of their online lives.”

Other more positive findings include two-thirds (65%) of children saying spending time online makes them feel mostly happy and 75% viewing technology and the internet as important to their independence.
Almost a quarter of children, however, admitted their online activities were having a physical impact, including fatigue, concentration difficulties, vision problems and poor posture.
In a separate development, the NSPCC children’s charity said young people were increasingly contacting its helpline, Childline, about AI child sexual abuse material and other harms linked to generative AI.
A 15-year-old girl told the helpline a stranger had made fake nudes of her. “It looks so real, it’s my face and my room in the background. They must have taken the pictures from my Instagram and edited them.
“I’m so scared they will send them to my parents. The pictures are really convincing, and I don’t think they’d believe me that they’re fake.” The NSPCC has joined forces with the US-based Common Sense Media to address the impact and risks of AI for children."
WT75SZAOA2_3SN2QIYICJ72XPJ,Russia and Ukraine trade accusations over fatal military plane crash,Pjotr Sauer,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/25/russia-and-ukraine-trade-accusations-fatal-military-plane-crash,"Russia and Ukraine have traded accusations over the fatal crash of a military transport plane that Moscow claims was carrying Ukrainian prisoners of war and was shot down by Kyiv’s forces.
The Russian Il-76 was filmed crashing on Wednesday in a huge ball of fire in a rural area of Russia near the border with Ukraine. Moscow quickly accused Kyiv of downing the large aircraft and said it was carrying 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war who were being transported for a prisoner exchange.
Ukrainian officials on Thursday did not explicitly deny shooting down the aircraft but said they could not confirm that Ukrainian soldiers on their way to a prisoner exchange were onboard the plane.
Some officials in Kyiv cast doubt on Russia’s claim that PoWs were onboard.
Dmytro Lubinets, Ukraine’s human rights ombudsman, wrote on X: “Currently, there are no signs of the fact that there were so many people on the Il-76 plane, be they citizens of Ukraine or not.
“Ukraine demands a transparent international investigation regarding the downing of this plane.”
The cause of the crash remains unknown.
Kyiv previously confirmed a prisoner exchange was due to take place on Wednesday at the border between the two countries but said Moscow did not inform them that any prisoners of war would be transported by plane.
Ukraine’s SBU security service on Thursday opened a criminal investigation into the crash, saying it would look into possible “violations of the laws and customs of war”.
On Wednesday evening, the Ukrainian president called for an international investigation into the crash, accusing Moscow of “playing with the lives of Ukrainian prisoners of war”.
Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his nightly video broadcast: “It is clear that the Russians are playing with the lives of Ukrainian prisoners, the feelings of their loved ones and the emotions of our society.”
Russia’s access to the area where the crash happened is likely to hamper any future investigation and no independent groups have yet visited the site.

Both sides offered conflicting narratives over the hours preceding the plane crash. A senior Russian lawmaker said Ukrainian military intelligence had been given a 15-minute warning before a Russian military transport plane carrying Ukrainian prisoners of war entered an area where it was shot down.
Andrey Kartapolov, who heads Russia’s Duma defence committee, told lawmakers on Thursday: “The Ukrainian side was officially warned, and 15 minutes before the plane entered the zone they were given complete information, which they received and the main intelligence directorate of the Ukrainian armed forces confirmed receipt of.”
Ukraine rejected Kartapolov’s claims, stating that Moscow had not informed it of the flight arrangements.
The Ukrainian military intelligence spokesperson Andriy Yusov said on Thursday that contrary to practice before previous PoW swaps, Kyiv had received no requests from Russia to refrain from offensive actions.
Nevertheless, Yusov appeared to hint that Ukrainian PoWs could have been onboard, telling Radio Svoboda: “Unfortunately, we can assume various scenarios, including provocation, as well as the use of Ukrainian prisoners as a human shield for transporting ammunition and weapons for S-300 systems [being used in the war].”
The Kremlin on Thursday stuck to its position that Ukraine had downed the plane, with Vladimir Putin’s spokesperson describing it as “a totally monstrous act”.
Conflicting narratives from both sides have become a daily occurrence in a war that is now nearing the end of its second year. Many of Russia’s denials and accusations during the war have proved to be demonstrably untrue, including Moscow’s claims that the country has not targeted civilians in Ukraine."
WXRBQV4BCY_04IQCLU2BTM7VKV,Chair of Arizona Republican party resigns after leak reveals alleged bribe,Rachel Leingang,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/24/arizona-republican-jeff-dewit-resigns-over-kari-lake-bribe,"The leader of Arizona’s Republican party resigned on Wednesday after leaked audio of him surfaced, appearing to show him offering a bribe to the Republican candidate Kari Lake by asking if there were a dollar amount she would take to stay out of the US Senate race there.
Jeff DeWit, the chair of the state party, was captured in audio secretly recorded by Lake telling her “there are very powerful people who want to keep you out” of the Senate race and that “they’re willing to put their money where their mouth is, in a big way”.
DeWit said that rather than fight to keep his job, he was stepping down because Lake’s team threatened to release more secret recordings unless he resigned: “I am resigning as Lake requested, in the hope that she will honor her commitment to cease her attacks.” (Lake’s team has denied this, saying no one on her campaign threatened or blackmailed DeWit.)
Lake, a Trump ally who has been campaigning for the former president, previously lost the race for governor to the Democratic candidate, Katie Hobbs, and is now running for the Senate against the Democrat Ruben Gallego and, possibly, the incumbent independent, Kyrsten Sinema.
In the audio, obtained by the Daily Mail, Lake objects to the idea that she can be “bought” and rejects any attempt at a bribe. DeWit repeatedly asks Lake not to tell anyone about the conversation.
“They should want me. I’m a great candidate, people love me. These people are corrupt,” Lake said in the leaked audio.
The secret recording fiasco highlights the schism among Arizona Republicans over the party’s direction during an election year in which Arizona will again be a close swing state. In recent years, the state party moved further to the right and embraced Trumpism at a time when the state itself moved more toward the center. Many Republicans there have continued to insist the 2020 election was stolen, a frequent refrain Lake has made on the campaign trail.
In a statement on Wednesday, DeWit called the audio “selectively edited” and a “deceptive tactic” and said that Lake was actually employed by his private company at the time the conversation took place 10 months ago, raising legal questions. Lake, a former television anchor, often wears a microphone to record footage that gets used to boost her brand online.
While Lake and her allies have cast DeWit’s comments as an attempt to bribe her, DeWit characterized the conversation as “offering a helpful perspective to someone I considered a friend”.
The party’s far right wanted DeWit out of his role before the audio was leaked, though the leak came out just before Trump was scheduled to return to Arizona for a visit later this week, followed by the state party’s annual meeting."
WYAVZN0KTZ_O30G8MIVDUW1I66,Trump takes stand and gives brief testimony in E Jean Carroll trial,Victoria Bekiempis,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/25/e-jean-carroll-defamation-trial-trump-covid,"Donald Trump took the witness stand in E Jean Carroll’s second defamation trial against him, marking the first time he has provided court testimony relating to her sexual assault claim against him.
Trump’s testimony lasted less than five minutes as the judge in this case, Lewis Kaplan, significantly limited what the ex-president could say in court. In May last year, a jury awarded Carroll $5m after finding that Trump sexually abused and defamed her; Kaplan said jurors’ factual determination in the first proceeding would be accepted at this trial, meaning they are only weighing damages.
“Ms Habba, you may call your next witness,” Judge Kaplan said to Alina Habba, Trump’s counsel, at about 2.15pm local time.
“Thank you, your honor,” Habba said. “The defense calls President Donald Trump.”
Trump walked to the witness stand and sat after being sworn in.
“Do you stand by your testimony in the deposition?”
“One hundred percent, yes,” Trump replied.
Habba then started to ask whether Trump denied the allegation.
“That’s exactly right. She said something. I considered it a false accusation.”
Trump was cut off by Kaplan, who did not allow him to testify about denying the claim.
“Mr President, did you ever instruct anyone to hurt Ms Carroll in your statements?”
“No, I just wanted to defend myself, my family and, frankly, the presidency.”
“I have no more questions. Thank you,” Habba said.
On cross-examination, Roberta Kaplan asked: “Sitting here today, Mr Tump, are you aware there was another trial between you and Ms Carroll?”
Trump replied: “Yes.”
His team objected to the question.
“Mr Trump, is this the first trial between you and Ms Carroll that you attended?”
He said yes.
Habba had an opportunity to question Trump once more. She asked whether he had an attorney at his last trial.
He answered in the affirmative. When Habba started to ask whether he listened to his lawyers’ advice, there was another objection. Habba said the defense rests.
Before Trump took the stand, as both sides were discussing the potential scope of his testimony prior to jurors entering, Trump grumbled: “I never met this woman.”
Judge Kaplan shot back: “Keep your voice down”
There was another outburst.
“I’m sorry, Mr Trump. You’re interrupting these proceedings by talking loudly while you’re counsel is talking,” and that is not permitted, Judge Kaplan warned again.
Carroll’s team called her former Elle editor, Roberta Myers, as their final witness. Her testimony lasted about 20 minutes.
Myers was questioned about her work history and she described a 30-year magazine career which, in addition to helming Elle, included stints at Rolling Stone and Interview.
She also said in court that she had previously met Donald Trump. It was “when I was on an episode of Celebrity Apprentice. I was there as an editor of Elle to present what was known as a challenge to apprentices.”
Myers described Carroll as a talented “truth-teller” and so popular that Elle considered her a destination for readers – who liked her so much they would pick up the magazine and immediately flip to her column. Myers said Carroll’s performance was so good she decided to give her a raise.
“I think her column was sort of the leader of the pack,” Myers said of Carroll’s writing and described how her column inspired others to launch similar concepts. Carroll’s team also tried to establish that Myers did not have a deep personal relationship with Carroll, to undermine suggestion of bias.
“Did she ever tell you about her personal life?”
Myers said: “No.”
When asked: “Did she ever tell you she was sexually assaulted by Donald Trump,” Myers also responded: “No.”
Trump’s lead attorney, Alina Habba, began her cross-examination of Myers by suggesting that she was biased. “You didn’t vote for Donald Trump in 2016, right?” Habba asked. “Or in 2020?” She further pressed: “You don’t plan on voting for him in 2024, do you?”
Before a morning break, Carroll’s team presented a handful of exhibits to jurors, including a television appearance in which Trump repeated a denial and an excerpt of an April 2023 video deposition in which he described his wealth.
Carroll’s camp played one of the most shocking deposition excerpts of Trump, in which he mistook a photo of Carroll for his ex-wife, Marla Maples. This snippet, from an October 2022 deposition, was also played in Carroll’s first trial against the ex-president.
This questioning starts with Carroll’s lawyer Roberta Kaplan showing Trump a photo in which he, Carroll, and their then respective spouses appear. “You have in front of you a black-and-white photograph that we’ve marked as DJT 23. And I’m going to ask you: Is this the photo that you were just referring to?”
“I think so, yes,” Trump responds in the deposition.
“And do you recall when you first saw this photo?” Kaplan asks.
“At some point during the process, I saw it. I guess that’s her husband, John Johnson, who was an anchor for NBC. Nice guy, I thought. I mean, I don’t know him, but I thought he was pretty good at what he did. I don’t even know the woman. I don’t know who – it’s Marla.”
Kaplan continues: “You’re saying Marla is in this photo?”
Trump replies: “That’s Marla, yeah. That’s my wife.”
Habba then steps in and tries to correct Trump, but he still struggles to identify the woman in the photo.
“Which woman are you pointing to?” Trump is asked.
“No, that’s Carroll,” Habba says.
Trump says: “Oh, I see.”
“The person you just pointed to was E Jean Carroll,” Kaplan notes.
“That’s your wife,” Habba corrects.
“And the person – the woman on your right was –” Kaplan presses.
Trump says: “I don’t know. This was the picture. I assume that’s John Johnson.”
“That’s Carroll,” Habba notes.
“That’s Carroll?” Trump asks.
Carroll’s team rested after presenting these exhibits.
Habba started the defense case by calling Carol Martin, a retired news anchor whom Carroll told about the alleged rape. Martin testified for Carroll in the first defamation trial.
Carroll and Martin both worked at America’s Talking, a now-shuttered television network started by Roger Ailes. After they both finished work one day, Carroll had asked if they could hang out, Martin testified in Carroll’s first trial.
In the first trial, Martin told jurors they were in her kitchen when Carroll “started telling me what had just happened”. Martin recounted how Carroll told her about the alleged incident.
“What, if anything, did you say to Ms Carroll about what she should do in the future?” Martin was asked.
Martin said: “She explained that she thought she was doing the right thing by not doing anything.
“But she wasn’t asking me what I would do, and so at some point, I just volunteered that I didn’t think she should do anything because he was Donald Trump, and he had a lot of attorneys, and I thought he would bury her, is what I told her.”
“I have questioned myself more times than not over the years as to why I told her that,” Martin said in the first trial. “I am not proud that that’s what I had told her.”
As one might expect, Habba was trying to use Martin to undermine Carroll’s credibility in this trial. She asked about their time at America’s Talking.
“Do you know whether Ms Carroll was reprimanded at work for inappropriate work directed at Mr Ailes?” Carroll’s team objected and the judge, Lewis Kaplan sustained their objection.
“You’ve also previously described Ms Carroll as a drug addict and a druggist herself?” Habba later asked, prompting an objection.
“And that the drug is herself, didn’t you?” Habba pressed.
“The question is: Did you say it?”
“It is written there, yes,” Martin said, referring to a written message."
X2HK2ESMJ1_SFVNKTCOCYLZLVG,UK sends UN experts photographs of North Korean shipments to Russia,Andrew Roth,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/22/uk-sends-un-experts-photographs-north-korean-shipments-russia,"The UK has provided satellite photographs of North Korean cargo shipments to Russia to a panel of UN experts as part of an attempt to trigger an official investigation into arms deals in violation of international sanctions.
North Korea has been accused of supplying ballistic missiles and hundreds of thousands of artillery shells to the Russian government for its war in Ukraine since Vladimir Putin met with Kim Jong-un in Russia’s far east in September.
Their bilateral relationship appears to be expanding. Putin met the North Korean foreign minister, Choe Son-hui, in the Kremlin this week during a rare, five-day trip by the senior Pyongyang official. The two discussed “further development of our relations in all areas, including sensitive ones”, according to a Kremlin spokesperson.
An unpublished UK defence intelligence report seen by the Guardian shows imagery taken between September and December of three Russian ships, the Maia, Angara and Maria, loading containers at North Korea’s revived Najin port before transiting to Russian ports in the far east. While the agency said it could not identify what was in the containers, it followed a US announcement last week that ballistic missiles from North Korea had been used by Russia in Ukraine last week.
“Russia’s use of North Korean weapons in Ukraine is a violation of multiple UN security council resolutions,” said a UN diplomat. “It undermines international efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and exposes just how desperate Russia has become in its failed invasion. This and other evidence submitted to the UN sanctions committee should trigger a full investigation into Russia and DPRK’s [North Korea’s] flagrant breaking of international sanctions.”
The report, along with other evidence from the United States and other countries, was provided to the UN panel of experts on North Korean proliferation, which is expected next month to publish its first final report since suspected North Korean shipments of ammunition to Russia sharply increased this year.
The ships in the report were all placed under sanctions by the US government in 2022 for their links to the Russian ministry of defence’s shipping company, Oboronlogistika OOO, which has “been involved in Russia’s illegal seizure and occupation of Crimea since 2014, as well as private Russian maritime shipping companies that transport weapons and other military equipment for the [government of Russia]”.
Two of the three ships were also identified in a recent report by the Royal United Services Institute thinktank. It showed a growth in transshipments from North Korea to Russia that “reveal that Russia has likely begun shipping North Korean munitions at scale”. A third was identified by NK News, an independent news website focusing on North Korea, as “part of a group of commercial vessels that have completed multiple deliveries of military equipment and munitions provided by the DPRK to Russia”.
The deliveries have been cited as enabling military strikes against Ukraine in December and January that “killed dozens of people and injured hundreds more”.
Prosecutors in Kharkiv told the Guardian that suspected fragments of North Korean-made Iskander missiles had been sent to Kyiv for analysis and said the missiles had subtle differences: hand-drawn lettering for serial numbers, and a different nozzle exhaust cone and welding.
A statement released by eight members of the security council, including the UK and US, said: “These heinous attacks were conducted, in part, using ballistic missiles and ballistic missile launchers procured from [North Korea].”
The White House’s senior director for arms control, Pranay Vaddi, said this week that the military cooperation between Russia and North Korea was “unprecedented” and warned that Russian military assistance to North Korea could undermine the US nuclear deterrence policy in South Korea and Japan.

“I think the nature of North Korea as a threat in the region could drastically change over the coming decade as a result of this cooperation,” he told the Center for Strategic and International Studies thinktank.
Choe met Putin, the foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and the deputy prime minister Alexander Novak during her visit to Russia.
North Korea also signalled that it may be receiving Russian help for its space programme.
Before the meeting with Putin, a member of the North Korean delegation was photographed with a document apparently titled Observation List in Space Technology Field, according to South Korea’s Yonhap news agency.
The list appeared to include the Progress Rocket Space Centre and the Voronezh mechanical plant, known to produce engines, although the writing was not completely clear, the news agency wrote.
Putin had previously pledged to help North Korea build satellites, and North Korea managed to launch its first spy satellite in November. South Korea alleged that Russia had helped build the spy satellite."
X4AJE9XGSB_ZCU4M7ZYOUIO9T2,French Holocaust denier found in Fife loses extradition fight,Tom Ambrose,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/26/french-holocaust-denier-fife-loses-extradition-fight-scotland,"A Holocaust denier who was arrested in a Scottish fishing village will be extradited back to France after spending two years on the run from the authorities.
Vincent Reynouard lost his extradition battle after his arrest in November 2022. He had been discovered living a double life in Anstruther, Fife, where he worked as a private tutor, according to reports.
Reynouard, 54, was remanded in custody while French authorities launched an extradition bid, citing videos in which he allegedly denied the existence of gas chambers in concentration camps, PA Media reported.
A domestic warrant issued by a French court referred to seven videos made between September 2019 and April 2020, including one in which he allegedly described the Nazi atrocities as “crude slanders” and another where he spoke of “the Jewish problem”.
The alleged offences include “public trivialisation of a war crime” and “public challenge to the existence of crimes against humanity committed during the second world war”.
Holocaust denial has been a criminal offence in France since 1990, and Reynouard has been convicted on previous occasions, including being given prison sentences in November 2020 and January 2021.
After a hearing at Edinburgh sheriff court in October last year, Sheriff Christopher Dickson said the YouTube videos were “beyond the pale of what is tolerable in our society” and were a breach of the Communications Act. He ruled that extradition could go ahead.
Reynouard challenged the extradition but his application for leave to appeal was refused. A written judgment by Lord Carloway at the court of appeal, issued on Friday, said extradition “cannot be regarded as disproportionate” and that “any reasonable person” would be offended by the videos.
He said the criminality involved in sharing offensive videos online was “one of relative seriousness judged by Scottish standards”.
The judgment said: “The videos were, taken at their highest, racist denials of the existence of the Holocaust and other war crimes.”
It added: “The phenomenon of ‘fake news’, in the context of the internet and social media, is well known, as are its damaging effects.”

X4FBTNGD8V_WKJ7K4B06VTHMC6,Biden’s delay of ‘carbon bomb’ projects could be a big deal – but will it last?,Oliver Milman,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/26/why-biden-delay-cp2-fossil-fuel-climate-change,"Joe Biden has, at least for a while, defused a ticking carbon bomb. Climate activists and the fossil fuel industry are now left wondering how long it will last.
The decision on Friday by the Biden administration to pause all pending export licenses for liquified national gas (LNG) to consider the climate impact of the projects has been hailed as a momentous shift in the status quo by those concerned by the unfolding climate crisis.
“World leaders agreed to transition away from fossil fuels at the Cop28 climate negotiations last year and president Biden’s decision today to pause new permits for LNG exports shows that he is taking that pledge seriously,” Al Gore, the former US vice-president, said.
From nothing a decade ago, the US now has eight LNG export terminals and is the world’s largest exporter of the gas, which is extracted, piped, chilled and sent overseas on ships. The pace of growth is extraordinary – the Calcasieu Pass 2 (or CP2) project, a vast planned hub on Louisiana’s coast, would ship up to 24m tons of LNG each year once built and become one of the biggest such terminals in the world.
CP2 is at the vanguard of a frenzy of new gas export infrastructure along the Gulf of Mexico coast that would, if fully realized, result in an estimated 3.2bn tons of greenhouse gases each year, close to the annual emissions of the entire European Union and severely imperiling hopes of avoiding catastrophic global heating.
Stopping CP2 and a dozen or so other proposed gas facilities has become a priority issue for US environmentalists and Biden’s decision, which should delay projects until after the November presidential election, provoked jubilation. The delay is “the biggest thing a US president has ever done to stand up to the fossil fuel industry”, according to Bill McKibben, the veteran climate campaigner.
Biden has come under severe progressive pressure over the gas buildout, which only heightened after his administration approved the controversial Willow oil project in Alaska. The world cannot afford any new major fossil fuel projects if it is to avoid dangerous global temperature rises, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has found.
CP2, which would have an emissions impact 20 times larger than that of Willow, has therefore become framed as a test of Biden’s climate credentials before an election where he will be looking for the votes of those concerned about global heating while also fending off Republican attacks over energy costs and the need to supply European allies with gas in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Key questions remain unanswered, such as whether the delay is merely a tactic to remove an awkward issue before November or if it will lead to a more lasting reform of federal permitting that explicitly accounts for climate change concerns alongside more nebulous “public interest” criteria that haven’t been updated since the 1980s.
US government agencies have, until now, typically disregarded climate as an issue when waving through oil and gas facilities and pipelines. That looks like it may change.
“To preserve a livable planet, we need a public interest test that denies any new project that would drive us further into climate catastrophe and violate US commitments to transition away from fossil fuels,” said Jean Su, the director of the Center for Biological Diversity’s energy justice program.
Climate considerations should slow but would likely not stop the growth of an LNG export industry that is set to double in size over the next four years, according to Jeff Navin, who was chief of staff at the energy department during Barack Obama’s administration.
“It’s not shocking the administration would at least consider the impacts of these projects on climate change and it’s entirely possibly they could decide they are a net positive for the climate because the gas would displace dirtier coal overseas,” said Navin, now a consultant.
“Not every terminal is going to be stopped. But it’s going to put pressure on facilities to think about how gas is produced and transported in terms of methane leaks.”

While the delay has been welcomed by climate activists, it will likely prove ammunition for the fossil fuel industry and its Republican allies including Donald Trump, who has vowed to “drill, baby, drill” and attacked Biden for hindering the industry, even amid a record glut of oil and gas production.
Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the US Senate, said that the pause is “directly at odds with America’s interests on the world stage”. A coalition of oil and gas industry groups has written to the Biden administration to complain that the decision will “only bolster Russian influence” and risk American jobs.
Critics, however, point to evidence that boosting LNG exports drives up domestic gas prices for Americans and that the raft of planned terminals would take several years to build anyway, beyond a 2027 timeframe in which European Union countries have vowed to end reliance upon Russian gas and pivot to renewable energy. According to the IEA, European gas demand will fall 8% by 2026.
“Expanding LNG infrastructure in the USA and in the EU is a high economic risk that will very likely end up as stranded assets,” warned Claudia Kemfert, an economic expert at the German Institute for Economic Research and Leuphana University in Germany.
For those living amid the tumult of new gas infrastructure along the Gulf coast, the pause is a relief, if a rather tenuous one. The terminals could still be built even with Biden as president, and will almost certainly go ahead if Trump is to win the election.
“A pause can be unpaused anytime,” said Travis Dardar, a fisherman in Louisiana who has campaigned against the LNG expansion in his community.
“We know first-hand how ruthless these gas export companies can be. They shoved these gas export terminals down our throats, destroying our fishing grounds, clogging the channel we use with their massive tankers, and constantly sending poisonous smoke into our air.”
Biden, Dardar said, needs to “deny all gas export terminals, and let this sinking industry fall to the bottom of the sea”."
X6PKOXZNZT_960ZXV5H1EOPL0F,Shakespeare’s Globe criticised for casting non-disabled actor as Richard III,Chris Wiegand,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/jan/25/shakespeares-globe-criticised-for-casting-able-bodied-actor-as-richard-iii-michelle-terry,"The announcement of a summer production of Richard III at Shakespeare’s Globe in London has created wintry discontent for the casting of a non-disabled actor in the lead role.
In May, Michelle Terry, the Globe’s artistic director, will play the role of Shakespeare’s scheming king who describes himself as “deformed, unfinish’d”. In recent years, the character has been played in several major productions by disabled actors, including Mat Fraser for Northern Broadsides and Hull Truck in 2017, Kate Mulvany for Australia’s Bell Shakespeare in the same year and, in 2022, Arthur Hughes for the Royal Shakespeare Company. Such portrayals have “reclaimed” the character, who in real life had scoliosis, as revealed when his skeleton was discovered beneath a Leicester car park in 2012. The part has also continued to be played on stage and screen by non-disabled actors including Benedict Cumberbatch and Ralph Fiennes.
Reacting to the Globe’s summer season announcement, Brittanie Pallett, a professionally trained actor with a disability, posted a thread on X, in which she asked: “Why is an artistic director of any theatre hiring themselves to play the lead when it’s not their casting or lived experience? Before anyone says it doesn’t matter, every time this happens more harm than good is done to disabled communities through misrepresentation.” Pallett said that “in an ideal world I could see an argument for any actor to play a disabled or non-disabled character (I don’t personally agree)” but added that “we are far from that day”. Drama, she continued, “whether we like it or not, is in varying degrees a reflection of our society and our beliefs about the people we share this world with. Most people’s only experience of disabled life is through the stories we tell, so yeah it’s bloody dangerous when we get that wrong.”
The Globe responded to Pallett with a statement, saying: “We recognise the barriers to access in our industry and to our organisation and are working hard to address that. Representation and equity of opportunity, both on stage and off, are hugely important values to the Globe which is why we employ conscious casting and take positive action on every production. We believe the Shakespearean canon is based on a foundation of anti-literalism and therefore all artists should have the right to play all parts in, and the casting across all our work year-round is no different.”
The actor Ben Wilson, who is blind, wrote in a blog about the Globe’s announcement that he “thought the battle for Richard III was starting to be won, but this feels like taking about 10 steps backwards”. He described it as a case of “cripping up”, a term used to describe non-disabled actors who do not have lived experience to match the character they are playing. That criticism was made against the casting of Bradley Cooper (on stage) and Stranger Things’ Charlie Heaton (on screen) as Joseph Merrick in recent versions of The Elephant Man.
The Globe’s statement said its Richard III was at the beginning of a research and development process and would explore the usurping 15th-century king of England’s “abuse of power and pathological narcissism, why some of the characters in the play seem to support his path to tyranny in an age of impunity, and why we the audience seem so endlessly seduced by the charisma of evil”. Further casting for the show, directed by Elle While, has not yet been announced.
The Globe’s summer season has five Shakespeare plays including Antony and Cleopatra, directed by Blanche McIntyre and billed as “a groundbreaking bilingual production using spoken English and British Sign Language”. Cleopatra will be portayed by deaf actor Nadia Nadarajah, who played Celia in As You Like It and Guildenstern in Hamlet for Terry’s opening season at the Globe. Terry has played several roles at the Globe, including Lady Macbeth and Hamlet, since she took over in 2018.
Upon the new season’s launch Terry said that the Globe hoped “to provide an opportunity for all people to engage and participate in stories, told carefully, kindly, boldly, and bravely, with rigour, heart, and beautiful imperfection infused with a life-affirming desire to question what it means to be human and hopefully inspire us all to engage in the conversation”."
XA1ZZG7YTH_DGM5QOK0VHZESVV,Hospital consultants in England reject government pay offer,Denis Campbell,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/jan/25/hospital-consultants-in-england-reject-government-pay-offer,"Hospital consultants in England have narrowly rejected the government’s improved pay offer in a move that could lead to further strikes in the NHS.
In a referendum run by the British Medical Association (BMA), consultants voted by 51% to 49% against a deal that would have given them an extra 4.95% pay rise on average for the last three months of the 2023-24 financial year on top of the 6% award for the year that they have already received.
Despite rejecting the offer, consultants have not announced an immediate resumption of strikes. The BMA is instead urging ministers to reopen talks to try to end a pay dispute that has led consultants to stage nine days of walkouts since last July.
“The vote has shown that consultants do not feel the current offer goes far enough to end the current dispute and offer a long-term solution to the recruitment and retention crisis for senior doctors”, said Dr Vishal Sharma, the chair of the BMA’s consultants committee.
“With the result so close, the consultants committee is giving the government a chance to improve the offer.”
Ministers need to make more money available if they want consultants – senior hospital doctors – to view the offer as acceptable and avoid further strikes, Sharma said.
They have a legal mandate to resume industrial action and take it until 18 June, if they choose to do so, but the BMA hopes the dispute can be settled without further walkouts.
NHS bosses, weary after 13 months of stoppages by various staff groups that have forced them to postpone 1.3m appointments and operations and cost the service more than £1bn, urged both sides to resume talks, as they did for a month last autumn.
Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said: “This is a very narrow outcome and health leaders will hope that it will be used as a basis for reopening negotiations with consultants to address their concerns rather than as a stepping stone to call for more damaging industrial action.”
More walkouts would bring further instability for the NHS as it deals with winter pressures, he said.
The BMA said 23,544 consultants had voted in the referendum, a 65% turnout, of whom 11,507 or 48.9% voted to accept the offer and 12,037 or 51.1% voted to reject it.
In an emollient response to the vote, the health secretary, Victoria Atkins, held open the prospect of further negotiations.
“I hugely value the work of NHS consultants and I am disappointed that after weeks of constructive negotiations the BMA has, by the narrowest of margins, rejected this fair and reasonable offer.
“I want to build on our progress on waiting lists and for us all to be able to focus our efforts on offering patients the highest quality care. The government is therefore carefully considering next steps”.
Junior doctors in England remain locked in a separate and increasingly bitter dispute with the government over their demand for a 35% pay rise to address the significant drop in the real-terms value of their salaries since 2008-09.
The BMA’s junior doctors committee announced on Wednesday that it would ballot its members again about their willingness to continue striking in pursuit of that goal, because their legal mandate to strike expires at the end of February.
The new ballot will also ask if junior doctors are prepared to take action short of a strike, such as refusing to work overtime, as a potential alternative tactic to full walkouts."
XFRCE94U3Z_E4KSUY7ETTPWL1B,‘I was an idiot!’ Ambika Mod on nearly turning down the romcom role of a lifetime,Emine Saner,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/jan/26/i-was-an-idiot-ambika-mod-on-nearly-turning-down-the-romcom-role-of-a-lifetime,"There is a date next month that Ambika Mod cannot think past. It’s the release of One Day on Netflix, which I suspect is going to catapult her to stardom – even if she says she doesn’t know what to expect and is trying not to think about it. Adapted from the bestselling novel by David Nicholls, the drama follows Emma (played by Mod) and Dexter (The White Lotus’s Leo Woodall), who meet as they’re about to leave university, and then visits that exact July date every year for the next two decades as their lives unfold. The funny thing is, she says, her life is developing its own One Day – with the date that the series is going to be released. It was also that February day in 2022 when the BBC drama This Is Going to Hurt came out, which was Mod’s breakout role.
She read Nicholls’s novel when it was published in 2009, and she was about 13. “It’s one of my favourite books,” she says, which is one of the reasons she originally turned down the chance to audition. “I was an idiot,” she says now, when we meet in a London restaurant. “This Is Going to Hurt had just come out, and I was feeling very overwhelmed. I think it was a combination of that and really loving the book, and thinking: ‘I can’t do this, I shouldn’t do this, I’m not Emma.’” About a month later – “and this is not hyperbole” – her eyes snapped open in bed and she realised she’d made a mistake. She rang her agent in the morning and sent in a taped audition. The longer the process went on, the more she wanted it. “I was just ready for the challenge, I wanted to push myself. This was by far the best opportunity [following This Is Going to Hurt] and I just love the character and the book. I feel I’ve manifested my 13-year-old dream, so it felt quite magical.”
Mod is perfect: she captures Emma’s loyalty and hard-done-by air, and the way she uses humour as a defence mechanism. Watching it made me ache for the 90s and the possibilities of youth. Emma is a northerner, trying to make it in London as a writer; Dexter, powered by the charm and confidence of his social class, seemingly skips through life, at least at the start. In Emma’s feeling as an outsider, says Mod, “there’s so much to identify of myself in her, especially when I started out in this industry”.
The other day a friend described her as a serious actor, which surprised Mod, whose career has until recently been in comedy. “I still don’t think of myself as an actor. I sort of fell into it accidentally.” She grew up in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, the daughter of an accountant and a vet. She wasn’t the kind of kid who put on shows, and she never got cast in anything at secondary school. “I’m not a performative, extroverted type at all. I’m still quite shy and introverted, but I don’t think that’s mutually exclusive from wanting to perform.”
At Durham University, after failing to get parts in plays, she instead joined its comedy group, the Durham Revue, which she ended up running in her final year. “Writing and performing comedy is never something I thought I would do, but I didn’t really have anything else, and I happened to be good at it. Also, I remember the first time I did a sketch on stage, I was like: ‘Oh, making people laugh is the best feeling in the world.’ There really is no substitute for it. There’s something about being on stage and hearing that laughter, this visceral response you’ve created in somebody, that is what I love and crave.” She smiles at herself. “And seek for validation.”
After university, Mod moved to London and got jobs – she worked in the stock department at John Lewis for a while, and at the publishing house Condé Nast as a PA – while performing standup in the evenings. She would write with her comedy partner, Andrew Shires, at the weekends, including shows they would take to the Edinburgh fringe. One, Children of the Quorn, was based around a seance, with sketches woven in – random, slapstick and silly – including one about a failing Simon and Garfunkel cover band, and another inspired by Gollum in The Lord of the Rings.
For a couple of years, progress seemed slow and frustrating “and that felt like a massive fail”. But in 2019 things started to pick up – their comedy duo, named Megan from HR, was getting attention and good reviews, Mod got an agent and did a few small acting jobs, and then This Is Going to Hurt came along. Mod played a junior doctor struggling with her mental health and, despite having very little acting experience and no training, was a revelation. Comedy, she thinks, and the experience of occasionally dying on stage, gave her a confidence to try things out, not be too self-conscious, but she still suffered impostor syndrome. “I massively felt like I didn’t belong there, I didn’t know what acting was or how to act, or what I should be doing. But my philosophy was just do everything and you’ll figure out what works for you.”
As a child, Mod watched almost exclusively Bollywood movies but when she got older, drawn to more British and US TV, she started noticing that there weren’t many roles for women of south Asian heritage on screen. After This Is Going to Hurt, lots of opportunities were coming her way, but it also felt, she says, “like there was a ceiling because I am a young, brown woman. I often wonder what kind of parts would have come to me if I had that same sort of breakout role and if I’d been white, and there were just more opportunities out there for me.” Quality, too, has been an issue. “I do occasionally get asked to [audition for] the best friend role to a white lead,” she says. “While I’m really grateful for the opportunities I am getting, I’m learning to stand up for what I think I deserve, and what I’ve proven of myself. I have to honour that by not settling for things I don’t think my white counterparts would be offered.”
When she gets recognised in the street or contacted on social media, it’s almost always by young women of south Asian heritage. “That says so much. My image represents so many people who haven’t seen themselves on TV. If I can be that to a young south Asian girl, even if she doesn’t want to be an actor, but she sees One Day, and thinks: ‘I’m worthy of love, I’m worthy of achieving my dreams,’ what an amazing thing to give someone.”

Mod had role models when she was growing up – Mindy Kaling, the US comedian and writer especially – but it would have helped to have more. “When I was a teenager, there wasn’t the same discussion we have now about representation and why it matters. I’ve always had a difficult relationship with my physical appearance and I think a lot of that is being told, specifically or implicitly, that brown women aren’t the standard of beauty. That’s quite insidious, [and] gets fed to you by way of not seeing yourself on screen – that is very specific to young women of colour. It still sits with me. I remember when I got One Day I was like: ‘What business do I have playing a romantic lead?’” She is, for the record, a wonderful romantic lead – warm, empathetic, someone you want to succeed, and the chemistry between the leads makes their 20-year relationship completely believable.
In One Day, Emma and Dexter’s student conversation about what they imagine their lives to be at 40, as if it’s some far-off age, is alarming for anyone past that milestone. What does Mod, who is 28, hope to be doing at 40? She reminds me with a laugh that she currently can’t see past February, when the show comes out. But playing Emma, subtly aged for the older version, must have made her think about the trajectory of her own life? Yes, she says. “I think when you’re young, it’s about all the big things – changing the world and having an impact, having an amazing career and finding the love of your life. And as you get older, without wanting to sound like a cliche, life is so much in the small moments. I’m very lucky and thankful that I’ve had the success I’ve had so far, but it doesn’t fill you up. You get to an age and you look back and realise how the smallest things, over years later, have impacted your life in the most profound ways – ways you would never have expected. I think that’s really beautiful.” She catches herself and laughs. “Ah, so wanky.”
She hopes that in the future, she says, “I’m still doing things that excite me”. She has such a raw acting talent and a beautiful, expressive face, I’d watch her in anything. She’d like to get back to comedy, “to go back to writing and focus on doing my own thing and finding my own voice again”. Forty doesn’t seem scary – she has worked with a lot of older women, and has been inspired by their confidence. “I’m looking forward to that aspect of things, because I care way too much what people think of me right now. I can’t wait to, hopefully, get to a point where I don’t feel that any more.”
One Day is on Netflix from 8 February."
XHAXMPIIPX_F4JFQOX0HCLTQ10,Minnesota state trooper charged with murder in shooting of Ricky Cobb,_,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/25/ricky-cobb-shooting-minnesota-state-trooper-charged,"A Minnesota state trooper was charged with murder on Wednesday in the shooting of the motorist Ricky Cobb II, who failed to get out of his car during a July traffic stop and took his foot off the brake when officers tried to arrest him.
In announcing charges of second-degree unintentional murder, first-degree assault and second-degree manslaughter, the Hennepin county attorney, Mary Moriarty, said the trooper Ryan Londregan’s use of deadly force against Cobb, a 33-year-old Black man, was not justified.
“As with all Minnesota law enforcement officers, state troopers may only use deadly force when it is necessary to protect a person from a specific identified threat of great bodily harm or death that was reasonably likely to occur. That did not exist in this case,” Moriarty said.
Londregan’s attorney Chris Madel called his client “a hero”, saying Londregan, 27, was trying to protect himself and a fellow trooper. Madel filed papers seeking to have the case dismissed or at least to have Moriarty removed from the case.
“This county attorney is literally out of control. Open season on law enforcement must end. And it’s going to end with this case,” Madel said in a video statement.
Londregan has not been arrested. Moriarty said her office will not seek to hold him on bail but will ask the court to require him to surrender his passport and firearms. She expected his first court appearance to be scheduled for later this week or early next week.
The 31 July shooting occurred in Minneapolis, where the murder of George Floyd by police nearly four years ago spurred sometimes violent protests and a nationwide reckoning on racial justice. In that case, Derek Chauvin was sentenced to more than 22 years for second-degree murder.
The shooting has some similarities to the 2022 death of the motorist Daunte Wright, who was trying to drive away from a traffic stop in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Center when an officer, Kim Potter, shot him. Potter said she meant to use her Taser but accidentally grabbed her gun. She served about 16 months of a two-year sentence for second-degree manslaughter.
Londregan shot Cobb after two other troopers pulled him over on Interstate 94 in Minneapolis when he saw the lights were out on the Ford Fusion that Cobb was driving, according to the criminal complaint.
One of the troopers, Brett Seide, checked Cobb’s record and found he was wanted for violating an order for protection in neighboring Ramsey county. There was no outstanding arrest warrant, however, so the troopers checked with Ramsey county officials to find out if they wanted Cobb taken into custody, the complaint said.
Ramsey county asked that he be arrested. By then, Londregan had arrived.
Seide approached the driver’s side of Cobb’s car while Londregan went to the passenger door, according to the complaint.
The troopers asked Cobb to get out of the car, whose doors were locked and front windows down. Seide told Cobb he was under arrest while Londregan reached inside, unlocked the doors and began opening the passenger door. The complaint said Cobb then shifted the car into drive and took his foot off the brake.
According to the complaint, Cobb’s car began to slowly move forward. Londregan reached for his gun. Cobb stopped the car. The trooper pointed his gun at Cobb and yelled: “Get out of the car now!” Cobb took his foot off the brake again. Within less than a second, Londregan fired his handgun twice at Cobb, striking him both times in the chest, the complaint said.
The car accelerated forward while Seide’s torso was still inside. Seide and Londregan tried to keep up with the car for several feet before falling. The car collided with a concrete median about a quarter-mile (400 meters) away.
The troopers caught up, pulled Cobb out and attempted lifesaving measures. Cobb was pronounced dead at the scene.
The defense filing quotes written statements to investigators by Seide and the trooper Garrett Erickson that they believed lethal force was necessary.
“At that time, I knew that Trooper Londregan and I were in danger of being run over by Cobb’s car, being hit by an oncoming car on the highway, or otherwise being dragged away at a high rate of speed,” Seide said."

Mia Janin, a year 10 pupil at the Jewish free school in Kenton, north-west London, was found dead at her family home in Harrow on 12 March 2021.
The inquest into her death concluded that Mia “took her life while still a child and while still in the process of maturing into adulthood”, Barnet coroner’s court heard on Friday.
In a statement, Mia’s father, Mariano Janin, said: “For almost three years we have sought answers for the loss of Mia. Today we found some of those answers and the failure of the people who [we] trust and were meant to keep her safe.
“My daughter experienced prolonged and sustained bullying in various ways in person and online. In a way it’s a relief this has now been recognised, however, there does need to be accountability. Another family cannot live what I have lived.”
North London area coroner Tony Murphy said Mia was last seen alive at about 10pm on 11 March 2021, when she said goodnight to her parents in their family home.
She was found dead by her parents at about 6.50am the next morning, with two undated letters in Mia’s handwriting found on her bed addressed to “her loving family and friends”, which “explained that Mia decided to end her life”, Murphy said.
He added that Mia had “close friends including at her secondary school, but she also experienced bullying from some male students” and that neither her family or teachers were aware of that before her death. Murphy said: “Mia’s secondary school has introduced systemic changes following her death.”
During the inquest, Mariano Janin paid tribute to his daughter, saying “she was fantastic, she was very bubbly, good sense of humour, she was beautiful, she was very kind, very creative”.
He said that “school is not only for the curricula” and they need to have “clear values” to respect one another and have a better society, adding: “Unfortunately, I’m a victim of this failing system.”
“To protect our kids I think we need to do a lot of things. I think we need to put some limits on the access of the kids on the internet and how we can recollect the data if something like this has happened. We need to create a safe environment for our kids.”
He told the inquest that his daughter asked if she could move schoolon 11 March. The inquest heard that Janin’s wife, Marisa, who has since died, told Mia she could be home-schooled for the rest of the school year, and that they would look into moving her to a new school after.
Mia’s friends said in statements made to police after her death, and read out in court, that she was bullied by other pupils at the school and that their friendship group was nicknamed the “suicide squad” in the months leading up to her death.
One of Mia’s TikToks was shared to a Snapchat group chat run by male pupils at JFS, where they made fun of her, a statement said.
One child said the boys used the group chat to share nude photos of girls. “They took screenshots of girls’ faces on social media and made fun of them. They shared a video of Mia’s TikTok and made fun of her,” the child added. The child said the boys also Photoshopped girls’ faces on to the bodies of pornography performers.

XM1LYG6D2F_9CQZQFW9BCUBAK7,Tropical Cyclone Kirrily forms as category one storm with Queensland coastal crossing likely on Thursday,Andrew Messenger,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/24/tropical-cyclone-kirrily-queensland-category-landfall-bom-map-radar-tracker,"Tropical Cyclone Kirrily has officially been declared, developing into a category one storm in the Coral Sea, the Bureau of Meteorology has announced.
The storm is “expected to continue strengthening as it tracks west south-west towards the Queensland coast”, the BoM said on Wednesday evening.
“A coastal crossing is likely Thursday evening between Cardwell and Bowen,” the weather bureau said.
Kirrily is expected to “quickly weaken to a tropical low” after it crosses the coast, before moving “further inland and then west south-west across central Queensland”.
“This would bring heavy to intense rainfall to areas across northern interior and western Queensland during Friday and into the weekend,” the BoM said.
The bureau advised Queensland communities to stay up to date with forecasts and warnings.
Coastal and island communities were likely to begin to feel the effects of Kirrily on Wednesday night and Thursday morning, the BoM said.
⚠️🌀Tropical Cyclone Kirrily, category 1, has developed in the Coral Sea. The latest track map shows the system crossing the coast tomorrow evening between Cardwell & Bowen, with damaging winds developing overnight tonight in coastal areas. Latest advice: https://t.co/oUQdMnys3h pic.twitter.com/3YNWVXNJmC
Warning zone areas ranged from Cardwell to Sarina, including Townsville, Mackay, Bowen, the Whitsunday Islands, and extended inland to Charters Towers. The area from Innisfail to Cardwell was labelled a watch zone.
“People between Innisfail to Cardwell, and inland to Charters Towers, should consider what action they will need to take if the cyclone threat increases,” the BoM said.
Those located between Cardwell to Townsville and Bowen to Sarina, including Mackay and Bowen, were advised to take precautions and listen to the next advice.
The bureau urged people between Townsville and Bowen, and in the Whitsunday Islands, to “immediately commence or continue preparations, especially securing boats and property using available daylight hours”.
Hazards including gales and damaging wind gusts of up to 120km/h were likely to develop on Thursday, the BoM said.
The bureau also warned intense rainfall that could lead to dangerous and life-threatening flash flooding was possible during Thursday and Friday.
The storm is expected to become a tropical low on Friday, and heavy rainfall “may develop across the northern interior and western Queensland into the weekend as the system tracks inland”, the BoM said.
The bureau’s senior forecaster Laura Boekel told media earlier on Wednesday that the system brings with it a “really large” amount of water, warning of “long” and “widespread” impacts in its wake.

“So there is certainly a high chance of that riverine and specifically flash flooding, as we see the rainfall accumulate with this system,” she said.
Earlier on Wednesday, the Queensland fire and emergency services acting commissioner, Stephen Smith, said the state’s saturated catchments “will respond incredibly quickly”.
He said that would bring “significant inherent risk to life”.
Recovery crews have already been deployed to the highest-risk areasas have about 100 firefighters, including many from interstate.
The deputy commissioner of disaster and emergency management, Shane Chelepy, urged residents to get prepared.
“Now’s the time to start having a conversation with your family: the ‘what if’ conversations,” he said.
“What if my house gets damaged? What if my house gets flooded? Where do I go and how am I going to get there? We do expect wind gusts, and rain starting this evening, and today is our final day for preparation.”

XPTN1OIAHY_KNDD8KO0LMI2366,Former police deputy commissioner known for ‘vagina whisperer’ comment running for Cairns mayor,Eden Gillespie,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/25/former-police-deputy-commissioner-paul-taylor-vagina-whisperer-comment-cairns-mayor-campaign,"A former Queensland deputy police commissioner who resigned after referring to his friend as a “vagina whisperer” at a policing conference is running for Cairns mayor.
Paul Taylor apologised in August 2022 for the lewd comment after it was aired during a commission of inquiry into police responses to domestic violence.
The inquiry heard Taylor referred to his friend, who was a gynaecologist and obstetrician, as a “vagina whisperer” at a formal policing conference attended by 100 senior officers four months earlier.
The state’s police commissioner, Katarina Carroll, told the inquiry Taylor was dealt with through “local managerial resolution” and she had personally counselled him.
Counsel assisting the commission, Ruth O’Gorman, asked Carroll: “There is a real risk, isn’t there … that the use of that language by such senior members in a formal setting does set a standard for those below them, constables and sergeants, who then might use disgusting language in their own stations?”
“Yes, it does,” Carroll responded.
Carroll later told the inquiry Taylor was facing a second separate complaint that could have led to his dismissal. The nature of the allegations was never revealed.

While announcing his resignation, Taylor said he was “deeply apologetic” for the harm his comments had caused and it was never his “intention” to offend anyone.
But former female members of the Queensland police service have expressed shock over Taylor’s decision to run for mayor.
“It certainly doesn’t send a good message for any form of government … as to tidying up or correcting the image of wanting to attract more women to politics, if that’s what they deemed to be appropriate,” one woman told Guardian Australia.
Another former officer said Taylor’s comment was not appropriate.
“There’s a reason you don’t see the CEOs of major corporate companies standing up in front of public forums making these comments,” another former officer said.
“Cairns is beautiful and the people of Cairns deserve better.”
Suzy, a Cairns local who requested her surname not be used due to her profession, said she was “appalled” by the comment.
“I wonder about the culture he will bring to Cairns,” she said.

But local anti-crime campaigner Perri Conti says Taylor has her vote.
“I don’t see what the big issue was about saying vagina whisperer. I think it’s stupid,” Conti said.
“Crime is a huge issue in Cairns and Paul is the only [candidate] that [has] addressed it … Him being an ex-police officer, he knows how it works.”
In a statement, Taylor told Guardian Australia he has “significant leadership experience through 45 years on the Queensland Police Service [QPS]”.
He did not directly respond to questions about the “vagina whisperer” comment but said his experience in QPS was built on “resilience, reliability and leadership”.
“I much prefer to look forward than backwards, having many memories from my time in the service,” he said.
“I have been a mentor to many young women and men throughout my career. I actively encouraged more women to enter the service and supported many female officers to advance to senior and executive positions.”
Taylor said if elected, he will hold an open forum on community safety within 100 days and establish an advisory committee “to report back on the community sentiment”.
“I will ensure strong levels of governance, transparency and accountability in council.”"
XRPOOO4BXB_TNI2J9MK9VL9NDZ,My month in rehab: alcohol was killing me – until I made that crucial call,_,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/jan/23/my-month-in-rehab-alcohol-was-killing-me-until-i-made-that-crucial-call,"I was sitting on the bathroom floor, sobbing. The room was spinning. It was the heart of lockdown and I wasn’t coping – or, rather, I was attempting to cope by drinking heavily. My nascent alcoholism, bobbing at a functional level since I was 14, was finally dragging me under.
Beneath the hopelessness was utter self-loathing. As a full‑time crime author with eight published books under my belt, I had a packed schedule – editorial deadlines, publicity commitments – and, on top of it all, the next morning I had to home school my two small kids. Deep down, I already knew that tomorrow would be a write-off. My alcoholism had been like a hard seed, digging uncomfortably into my life for the past 25 years. Now, it was blooming into a blowsy acceptance. My addiction was killing me. The worst thing was that I didn’t care.
The next morning, hungover and shot with anxiety and shame, I made the call that would change reality as I knew it: I booked myself into rehab.
My memory of what happened next is hazy. Checking in while still clamped in the sweaty embrace of alcohol withdrawal was a horrible blur. Alongside the humiliation of being searched for drugs and the ringing shame of admitting my addiction, I remember the gothic styling of the building, with a lot of carved wood. It’s hard to describe the strange juxtaposition of a facility that is luxurious yet clinical.
In that moment, I felt caught between two worlds: one where I would die and another where I would live a death-like life. Each felt equally unbearable. In the end, it wasn’t a choice at all. My shaking limbs and rampant nausea made it physically impossible to do anything more than stay the course. So began the endless schedules, classes, group therapies and shared living of rehab.
Over the next few days, I gradually adjusted to life in the clinic. With the help of counsellors and other patients, I started the hard work of unpicking the path that had brought me there. I kept a journal at the time and, looking back now, it reads like the words of another person. “I started drinking too heavily because I couldn’t finish a book,” I wrote with naive assurance during the first week.
Back then, I thought the reason for my addiction was obvious. Almost a year before my lowest point, an appalling tragedy had struck my family – something so unbearable I still struggle to put it into words.
I had already been taking the most disturbing events from my life and trapping them in crime thrillers. My novels drew deeply on my own emotions – it was how I got material, but it was also what I used alcohol to numb. Alcohol became my creative anaesthetic.
Now, though, it wasn’t working. This new trauma had struck so deep that the alcohol couldn’t reach it. I needed to write about how I felt, but the words died on the page. I drank more and more, then despaired as the book that ached to be written floundered, unable to draw breath.
A few days into rehab, I shared this “cause” of my uncontrollable drinking with the small selection of addicts with whom I had been assigned group therapy. Not one of them was convinced that my “couldn’t finish a book” diagnosis even stroked the surface of my problem with alcohol.
When a wonderful young doctor and ex-cocaine addict whom I’ll call Liz voiced this in group therapy, I finally questioned my own spin.
“You drank a lot before that happened,” she pointed out. “A long time before.”
Liz was right. It brought me up short – initially in a thorny and resentful way, later with expansive gratitude. The truth was that I was using my recent tragedy to hide; my addictions had started in childhood. But admitting that meant recognising the frightening fact that I had never experienced adult life sober.
That night, in the room I shared with Liz and another former addict, I started writing in my journal for real. I began to poke at the shreds of truth that I had been hiding from myself. Ghosts of childhood memories took on solid edges and, along with them, some fledgling threads of the book I had previously struggled to write began to emerge, a smatter of green shoots poking through dark soil.
The next day, I shared my revelations with my counsellor – a former alcoholic with a caustic, no-nonsense style. My addiction, I ventured, went back to my school days. She greeted this with a small smile. “Congratulations,” she said. “I was wondering when you’d figure that out.”
For the first time, we began talking about my younger years. I couldn’t stop crying. Between sobs, I explained how my childhood had been relatively “normal”: I had had loving parents and a safe home. Nothing to complain about – except for the fact that one parent was an alcoholic and the other was addicted to their work. This combination gave me a bone-deep addiction to overachieving and an abandonment complex that hovered, spectre-like, over every human contact.
Then came secondary school – a violent bear pit of feral teens who drank whisky at 8am on the school bus and hospitalised academic kids like me on the way home. I quickly adapted. By 13, I smoked, drank and sought out drugs as if I was working my way through a hedonistic bucket list.
By 14, I had taken acid, speed and every type of prescription pill. I would skip school to inhale thick drafts of cannabis on an almost daily basis. Low on cash, I started shoplifting to fund my habits – a memory that fills me with terrible guilt and shame. When I was 15, I travelled cross-country to Glastonbury festival, alone for nine hours on packed trains and buses, swigging lager and smoking all the way.
But, for all my swagger and independence, I was oversensitive, struggling with relationships and bolting at the first sign of abandonment. I dismissed people without addiction issues as “boring”, never realising how uninteresting alcohol-induced emotional torpor made me.
For all the utter chaos inside, outwardly I held it together. Only someone who looked very closely would have seen the tape and string. My addiction to overachieving meant I got straight As at school, followed by a first in English at university. I even won a prestigious scholarship to take an English MA. By the time I left university, I was freelancing full‑time for newspapers, covering a mixture of travel, lifestyle, finance and, ironically, health. True, I couldn’t hold a romantic relationship; any suggestion of commitment paralysed me with fear. But no one would have looked at my life and imagined the vast, loveless void at the heart of it, a hunger pulling everything into its vacuum.
In my 30s, I was able to out‑wrestle my commitment phobia just enough to find my soulmate. Two beautiful children followed. I would love to be able to tell you that my deep adoration for them cured my addiction. But it didn’t. In fact, a mixture of postnatal depression, combined with my insatiable work addiction, dragged me lower still. While I didn’t drink during pregnancy, I managed to find test strips for breastmilk online so I could check my milk was alcohol-free before feeding. Even then, I didn’t accept that alcohol was a problem.
Years of denial were broken down and dissected over 30 days of rehab, the painful memories of my addiction drawn out like poison from a wound. For more than two decades, I had stitched my emotions under a thick jacket of addiction. Now, the jacket had been turned inside out and I was wearing my most tender feelings on the outside. It was absolutely excruciating, as if someone had sandpapered away my skin, revealing a wall of open nerves. I was experiencing feelings I hadn’t felt since I was 13, because, emotionally, I had never really grown up. It was a realisation I found embarrassing and fascinating in equal measure.
I started to remember fragments that I had forgotten; I didn’t know what was real and what wasn’t. At the time, it was incredibly frightening. I sweated, I shook, I struggled with the overwhelming desire to walk out and down a bottle of wine.
Slowly, I got better. The shakes and anxiety switched to clarity and calm. By the time my stay drew to a close, I felt like Sleeping Beauty, awaking from a 100-year slumber. I was 40. What a lot of time I had wasted.
But what a lot of time I had won back, too. I entered rehab broken, using alcohol as my armour. When I left, I wasn’t alone and afraid any more. I had taken my first steps towards asking other people for help when I needed it. I felt as if I had changed on a cellular level. But I knew there was a long road ahead.
Deep down, I feared I would never be able to write another book. Then, several months into recovery, something happened that I could not have expected. The book that I hadn’t been able to write, the one that I believed to have been integral to my undoing, suddenly bloomed into being, inspired by the experiences and people I had met in rehab. Struck by the notion of setting the action inside an addiction clinic, everything came together. The half-built chassis of a manuscript was given wheels in a way I could not have predicted. I told my agent I wanted to write a murder mystery set in rehab. I called it The Clinic.
This was the first book I had written sober – and by far the most terrifying for it. It was only when librarians across the US voted it among their Top 10 reads for this month that I breathed a sigh of relief that I didn’t realise I had been holding. Perhaps it was possible I could write without using alcohol. With that promise, another door opened.

XUJ2A3YH67_8L1PFX1TTN8E7KQ,British dancer dies in US after eating mislabelled biscuit containing peanuts,Mark Brown,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/jan/26/british-dancer-dies-in-us-after-eating-mislabelled-biscuit-containing-peanuts,"Tributes have been paid to a dancer from Lancashire who moved to the US and died after eating a biscuit that contained peanuts.
Órla Baxendale, 25, had a peanut allergy. She died on 11 January after going into anaphylactic shock caused by the mislabelled vanilla florentine cookie she ate.
Baxendale, originally from east Lancashire, had moved to New York to pursue her career as a professional dancer.
Her sister, the actor Ciara Baxendale, known for playing Izzy in E4’s My Mad Fat Diary, paid tribute on Instagram, describing Órla as radiant and a dreamer who was cherished by everyone.
“I will never ever, as long as I am on this earth, stop talking about how radiant, how beautiful, how kind, how cool, how hilarious, how witty, how vibrant she was.
“She had a golden touch. Everything about her was magical, she was just so otherworldly. She looks just like an angel, and I just cannot believe that she has gone.”
In a statement, her family said: “Órla was truly one of a kind. She was a beautiful, radiant, brave soul who always believed she would achieve her biggest dreams – and that’s exactly what she did. She danced her way across the world and lived life to the fullest every day.
“We will never recover from the pain of having her taken from us so soon, in the prime of her life. But we are also so proud to call her our daughter and sister, and to have had the privilege of sharing 25 years with such an incredibly special person.”
Elmhurst ballet school in Birmingham, from where Baxendale graduated in 2018, described her as a “radiant force” on and off the dance floor.
“Her authenticity and ability to stay true to herself resonated with all who had the privilege of knowing her, and she had a remarkable gift for lighting up any room she entered,” the school said.
Baxendale trained and competed in Irish dancing from an early age before training at the Northern Ballet Academy and Elmhirst. She was cast in the world premiere production of Matthew Bourne’s Romeo and Juliet and last June joined MOMIX Dance Company.
The biscuit was bought from a branch of Stew Leonard’s in Connecticut.
Baxendale’s lawyers in the US have said the death was preventable. In a statement, they said Órla’s family had been “overwhelmed and comforted by the outpouring of love, support, and tributes from around the world.
“Órla’s vibrant spirit and her relentless pursuit of excellence in her art have left an indelible mark on all who knew her.”
They said Baxendale had been “careful and hyper-vigilant” about everything she ate and always carried an Epi-Pen.
The cookies were produced by the Long Island-based wholesaler Cookies United and labelled with the Stew Leonard’s brand name, according to state officials.
Stew Leonard Jr, the retailer’s president and chief executive, said in a video post that the supplier had changed soy nuts to peanuts in the recipe without notifying their chief safety officer.
Cookies United said it had notified Stew Leonard’s last July that the product contained peanuts and that all products shipped to the retailer had been labelled accordingly. Cookies United said the incorrect label was created by Stew Leonard’s.
Stew Leonard’s has recalled all the mislabelled biscuits in partnership with the US Food and Drug Administration."
XVYWPZ844K_WD0UKIWQ1DG8MR9,How South Africa’s genocide case against Israel played out in The Hague,Haroon Siddique,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/26/how-south-africas-genocide-case-against-israel-played-out-in-the-hague,"Shortly after 10am local time on 11 January a hush descended over the ornate courtroom at the Peace Palace in The Hague as the judges of the international court of justice entered to hear South Africa’s case alleging genocide by Israel in Gaza.
Outside the court, protesters noisily made their feelings known and more than 3,000km away the bombardment of the Palestinian enclave continued, as the US president of the court, Joan Donoghue, began the formalities, opening the hearing into the war in Gaza.
Once the formalities were dispensed with it was then left to Vusimuzi Madonsela, South Africa’s ambassador to the Netherlands, to open the case, which pitted two countries with painful histories against each other.
The delegations from each side included “some of the lucky ones who managed to get out of Gaza”, and relatives of Israelis taken hostage by Hamas.
The crux of South Africa’s case was that the proof was in the devastation wreaked upon Gaza by Israel in response to the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023 in which militants killed about 1,200 Israelis, mainly civilians – plus the now parlous state of the Palestinian enclave, and the words of Israel’s leaders.
The South African lawyer Adila Hassim told the court: “Genocides are never declared in advance but this court has the benefit of the past 13 weeks of evidence that shows incontrovertibly a pattern of conduct and related intention that justifies a plausible claim of genocidal acts.”
She cited the death toll in Gaza, then about 23,000 (although it had increased by the time Hassim read it out in court), mostly women and children, as well as the 7,000 people trapped under rubble, presumed dead, the thousands more injured, and 85% of the population being displaced. Then there was the destroyed or damaged infrastructure and ruination of an estimated 355,000 Palestinian homes, the court heard.
The humanitarian crisis bringing starvation and dehydration was well documented by international humanitarian organisations, and was compounded by Israel’s refusal to allow aid into Gaza, the judges heard.
Unlike a definitive ruling on genocide (defined as “acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group”), which would take years to resolve, the application for provisional measures made by South Africa in the hope the ICJ would order a ceasefire, requires only that some of the alleged acts fall within the genocide convention.
Israel, whose response came the following day, claimed that South Africa had failed to do this. Its legal team claimed it was acting in self-defence, only doing what it had to in order to protect its citizens after the 7 October attacks, and that a ceasefire would leave them at the mercy of Hamas, which was dedicated to Israel’s annihilation.
Tal Becker, the Israeli foreign ministry’s legal adviser, called the ceasefire request “unconscionable” saying: “If there were acts of genocide, they have been perpetrated against Israel.”
Becker said that civilian suffering was “sadly” inevitable in warfare but not proof of genocide. Israel blamed Hamas for civilian deaths, both directly and indirectly. It alleged Hamas’s misfiring rockets, booby traps and mines killed Palestinian civilians and its use of human shields and civilian buildings put them in the firing line. Hamas’s tunnel network was blamed for the collapse of buildings.
Israel denied bombing hospitals and said it had gone to “extraordinary efforts” to provide humanitarian assistance, playing footage to the court of aid vehicles crossing into Gaza, and said it gave advance warnings before bombing areas.
South Africa’s legal team highlighted alleged examples of “genocidal intent”, including the reference by Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to the Old Testament story in which the Israeli people of King Saul were commanded to destroy all men, women, children and animals of the Amalekite people.
Other statements from current ministers quoted in court included calling Gazans “human animals”, holding them all responsible for the actions of Hamas, and calls for another Nakba (the 1948 displacement of Palestinians from the newly founded state of Israel), or even for a nuclear bomb to be dropped on the enclave.
Tembeka Ngcukaitobi, another South African lawyer, said Israeli soldiers “proved they understood the prime minister’s message” when they were recorded dancing and singing about there being “no uninvolved” and wiping out “the seed of Amalek”.
In response, Prof Malcolm Shaw, representing Israel, said that Netanyahu’s words about Amalek were “partially and misleadingly quoted” and that the prime minister had said, in the same comment, “the IDF does everything to avoid harming the uninvolved”. He said other comments highlighted by South Africa were “clearly rhetorical”, made in the aftermath of the traumatic 7 October attacks, and in no way reflected “official and binding policy”.
In more prosaic submissions Shaw spent considerable time arguing that the ICJ did not have jurisdiction because of procedural mistakes made by South Africa.
At other times the claims were much more incendiary, echoing Israel’s reaction to the launch of the case, when it accused South Africa of a “blood libel” and of cooperating with Hamas.
While the language in court was more tempered, Becker said: “The delegitimisation of Israel since its very establishment in 1948 in the applicant’s submissions, sounded barely distinguishable from Hamas’s own rejectionist rhetoric.” This came after Madonsela referred to “Israel’s colonisation” of Palestine.
Israel also accused South Africa of “making almost no mention” of the suffering of Israelis and treating the hostages held since the 7 October attacks as an “afterthought”, which Madonsela robustly denied on the steps of the Peace Palace.
Feelings were running high outside the court, where supporters of both sides, allocated separate areas by police, waved Palestinian and Israeli flags. Some pro-Palestinian protesters carried baby dolls stained with red, representing blood, while Israeli supporters had empty chairs for the hostages.
On the first day of proceedings the Israeli contingent broadcast images of the hostages on an LED screen, while on the second day Palestinian supporters showed images of Gaza and a documentary about the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement targeting Israel. As they watched proceedings on the screen they shouted “liar, liar” as Becker spoke.
After the hearing, Germany, which, like the US and UK, backs and arms Israel, said it would make a third-party intervention on behalf of its ally, saying that in view of its history – as perpetrator of the Holocaust against Jews – it “sees itself as particularly committed to the genocide convention”. It called the case against Israel “completely unfounded”.
For his part, Netanyahu pledged “total victory” and said “no one will stop us, not The Hague”, amplifying existing doubts about whether any judgment by the ICJ, which lacks enforcement powers, could bring an end to the bloodshed.
In a highly anticipated ruling on Friday, Donoghue granted the application for provisional measures that ordered Israel to ensure its forces did not commit acts of genocide in Gaza but fell short of requiring a ceasefire.
It meant South Africa and the Palestinians could hail a landmark victory but Netanyahu, while railing against the “outrageous charge of genocide”, could welcome the fact a ceasefire “was rightly rejected”. While hopes were expressed that Israel would comply with the order, it remained uncertain that it would do so."
XYCH5MMUN1_DBA892HBKDQWJKM,"Roaches, rats and rotten food reported at Chicago shelter for asylum seekers",_,_,20240126,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/26/chicago-asylum-seeker-shelter-rats-expired-food,"Appalling conditions have been uncovered at a Chicago warehouse turned migrant shelter where more than 2,500 asylum seekers are staying.
Complaints about cockroaches, rats, rotten food, exposed pipes, sewage issues, illnesses spreading and inadequate food and water provision have been made to the city authorities, in emails first reported by WTTW, the PBS member station in Chicago.
Serious public safety concerns about the shelter, in the city’s South Side, were prompted in December when five-year-old Jean Carlos Martinez, who was staying there with his family, died there, while others were hospitalized. Though the cause of death has not been specified and is under investigation, Borderless magazine, which first reported the boy’s death, spoke to a migrant at the shelter who said the boy had a high fever and was convulsing before going to the emergency room.
The report by Borderless concluded that conditions relayed by residents at the shelter do not reach UN minimum standards for emergency refugee shelter.
The city is now under fire since email complaints about the shelter were sent to Mayor Brandon Johnson’s office two months earlier, in October 2023.
Kely Ramos is currently staying at the shelter, called the Pilsen shelter, while her application for asylum in the US is assessed by the federal authorities. She arrived nearly a month ago after a three-month journey by foot from Venezuela with her husband and six-year-old son. She expressed mixed feelings about the situation, saying on the one hand she was grateful to be at the shelter because she’s no longer sleeping on the street but on the other she is also alarmed because a lot of people at the shelter are constantly getting sick, she said.
“People get sick a lot here,” she said last week by phone. Media are not given access to the shelter. Many of the migrants at the shelter have high fevers, she said. “Even my son has lost a lot of weight. He doesn’t want to eat the food, and that really hits me hard.” Ramos has had to go outside the shelter to find milk and cereal for her son, given to her by volunteers.
When people fall sick at the shelter, Ramos explained, generally they are moved to a place more isolated from others – but that sometimes then staffers forget to bring them food. When they do bring food, she doesn’t think the it is healthy to eat, such as sticky pasta with an unpleasant-tasting sauce, she said.
“But again, who are we to be demanding?” she said.
Annie Gomberg, an organizer with the Police Station Response Team of volunteers, said that a contractor used by the city, Favorite Healthcare Staffing Services, was hired to provide food, medical assistance, bedding, laundry services and more at the hastily-established, city-run shelters for migrants.
“City shelters have been a problem since their inception,” she said. The company “is making millions and millions of dollars to run the shelters”, she added.
Chicago last fall renewed its contract with Favorite Healthcare Staffing. The Kansas-based company has faced criticism over the last year for charging what some local elected officials have described as “exorbitant” fees.
At a separate shelter, in the city’s Greektown neighborhood, some of the migrants said the situation there is also problematic. Maria, a Venezuelan migrant, has been staying there for five months with her husband and two young children aged 10 and 11. She said she hardly eats because people often get sick from the food. She said she isn’t sure if what is provided is actually meat or “something else.”
She asked to withhold her last name for fear of retaliation. “Then they’ll kick me and my family out of here,” she said. the Guardian spoke to Maria on her daughter’s birthday. “I feel sorry that I don’t have anything to offer her, like a cake.
Maria said he often wakes up feeling depressed. “Sometimes [my children] see me cry and they tell me, ‘Come here, give me a hug’ and I have to hide so they don’t see me cry.”
She said shelter staff have made it clear to everyone there that they cannot take photos and videos while in the shelter and share them with anyone.
There are long lines to use the two bathrooms available, there is constant surveillance with regular “checks” and curfews are part of everyday life. Staff calls each family by an assigned number that is located in each cot. “It feels like you are in prison,” Maria said.
Regarding allegations about shelter conditions, a statement from Johnson’s office said the city was aware of those allegations, is working on improvements in the shelters and has been meeting weekly with food providers.
A spokesperson added that “because of the rapid expansion of this shelter population, the city had to make improvements to the shelter, while, at the same time, intaking hundreds of new arrivals”.
Favorite Healthcare Staffing did not return the Guardian’s request for comment about standards at shelters.
With winter temperatures in Chicago dropping to dangerous levels and some people sheltering in tents outdoors, the city began in November to clear people out of police station lobbies, where hundreds of migrants slept for months.
City officials have been able to move people out of police stations and more shelters have opened. More than 14,500 migrants are living in 28 of those shelters. Migrants who are not temporarily housed in shelters are sleeping in library basements, spare rooms in churches, and some are inside tents and sleeping inside buses at Chicago’s “landing zone” where last week, the Chicago Tribune reported migrants were digging for food in trash bins.
Since August 2022, about 31,000 people have been sent to Chicago from the US-Mexico border in Texas, by bus, without coordinating with city authorities or organizations, as part of an effort by the Republican governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, to oblige the city, and other Democratic-run major cities, to deal with accommodating asylum seekers, while also deliberately embarrassing the Biden administration."
Y0757843K0_ENY8PFO6A99J36H,‘This is urgent’: the UK is scrambling to stem an alarming tide of measles,Andrew Gregory,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/jan/24/this-is-urgent-the-uk-is-scrambling-to-stem-an-alarming-tide-of-measles,"In September 2017, Britain was basking in the glory of a public health success story. No indigenous cases of measles had been recorded for three years. Decades after a sham study threatened to permanently undermine trust in the MMR jab, which protects against measles, mumps and rubella, the World Health Organization declared the disease had been eliminated for the first time in the UK.
Dr Mary Ramsay, then head of immunisation at Public Health England (PHE), expressed delight. “This is a huge achievement and a testament to all the hard work by our health professionals in the NHS to ensure that all children and adults are fully protected with two doses of the MMR vaccine.”
The WHO accolade came with a warning shot, however. “We cannot become complacent,” said Zsuzsanna Jakab, then WHO regional director for Europe. “Outbreaks continue to cause unnecessary suffering and loss of life. Routine immunisation coverage is decreasing.”
Less than two years later, the UK had been stripped of its measles-free status.
Today, the country is in the midst of a measles emergency. Public health officials are scrambling to stem an alarming tide of infection. And the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), which replaced PHE during the Covid pandemic, has been forced to declare a national incident, signalling a major public health risk from one of the world’s most contagious viruses.
Hundreds of children have been sickened by measles in recent weeks. Officials fear a growing outbreak in the West Midlands could spread to other towns and cities unless urgent action is taken to boost vaccination uptake.
A staggering 3.4 million under-16s are at risk of getting the virus, officials believe, and letters are being sent to parents of unvaccinated children. GPs are setting up extra clinics and vaccine buses are targeting communities with low vaccination rates.
The unfolding crisis has alarmed the UK’s top health officials.
“We’re at a point where there’s a very large susceptible population of children,” Prof Sir Andrew Pollard, chair of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, told the Guardian in an interview this week. “To keep measles at bay, we need to have over 95% of children vaccinated. The NHS figures suggest that we’re at about 85%.”
Data released by the UKHSA showed there have been 216 confirmed measles cases and 103 probable cases in the West Midlands since 1 October last year. Four-fifths (80%) were found in Birmingham, while 10% were identified in Coventry. Most were in children aged under 10.
“Now that it’s got started, with a virus that is so infectious – it’s much more infectious than Covid was – then if there are people who are unvaccinated, it can spread like wildfire,” said Pollard. “The reason why that’s so worrying is that it then finds individuals who rather than just getting a horrible illness, will actually get serious complications or die from it.”
In some people, measles can affect the lungs and brain and cause pneumonia, meningitis, blindness and seizures. Pollard said: “There are some risk groups: people whose immune system doesn’t work well, children on cancer treatments for example. Younger children are more at risk than older children from severe complications. But there will also be some completely healthy children who can get very severe illness or even die from this virus.
“It’s extremely worrying to be in this situation where the spark of this fire has started, we don’t quite know where it will end, but we could stop it if we got vaccines out there to protect children.”
So how did Britain go from eliminating measles to the brink of a measles catastrophe? Why have MMR vaccination rates fallen? And how can the country get out of this mess?
Experts say a combination of factors is likely explain the fall in vaccination rates – and the measles crisis now engulfing Britain.
The rise in cases is partly a legacy of the pandemic, says Prof Stuart Neil, head of the department of infectious diseases at King’s College London. Vaccinations against many diseases, including measles, were neglected as people focused on Covid. “Vaccine uptake has fallen across the board over the pandemic partly because of hesitancy to go to doctors during it,” he said.
Another challenge is that the children who missed their first jabs between 2020 and 2022 are now older than the age group typically seen routinely at GP surgeries for vaccination programmes. In the UK, children are offered two MMR doses – first at age one, then at three years and four months. But if your child was born during the pandemic, they may have been missed and need to catch up.
“It is never too late to get vaccinated,” said Dr Doug Brown, chief executive of the British Society for Immunology. “We encourage parents to ensure their children are up to date with their MMR vaccines and catch up on any missed ones as soon as possible.”
Pollard said there had been a “gradual decline” in MMR coverage for years before the pandemic, which had cumulatively increased the threat of a full-blown measles crisis.
“In one year that’s manageable but successively over years you build up this increasing pool that allows the virus to transmit,” he said. “If you think about the accumulation of cohorts of children over several years, each year that you have low coverage, there’s more and more children added to this pool of susceptible people, which means that when the virus does arrive, you can have these explosive outbreaks.”
Falling vaccination rates and the demise of Britain’s measles-free status also stems from people not knowing – or forgetting – about the risks of measles. “Due to the success of the UK immunisation programme, many parents will have no first-hand experience of measles,” said Dr David Elliman, a paediatrician at London’s Great Ormond Street hospital. “It would be a great tragedy if we have to learn from the sad deaths of children, before the disease is taken seriously.”
Bogus claims made in 1998 by Andrew Wakefield about the MMR vaccine still have an impact, says Prof Helen Bedford, professor of children’s health at the UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health. Not because the false claims still hold weight with the public, but because children not vaccinated due to the scare are now adults – and may be helping the virus to spread.
“Over 25 years ago, MMR vaccine uptake fell because of highly publicised but subsequently discredited research suggesting a link with autism,” said Bedford. “Unsurprisingly, given the intense media coverage at the time, many parents preferred not to have their children vaccinated. Those children are now young adults.
“Over the years, the number of unvaccinated people has accumulated in the population, enabling measles to take hold and spread quickly within communities.”
Most experts agree that misinformation about the MMR jab is very unlikely to play a significant role in declining vaccination rates. “It is too easy to blame anti-vaccine sentiment for the measles outbreaks,” said Bedford. Although some mistrust of vaccines may play a small part, research shows that parental vaccine confidence remains high, she added.
“Asking questions about vaccination is to be encouraged, but we need trained staff to do this, and the NHS and general practice are under significant pressures, with cuts to funding and staffing.”
Pollard believes families struggling to access vaccination programmes is a much bigger factor than misinformation. “We know the greatest pockets of low coverage are in the parts of the country where families find it hardest to access vaccination services,” he said.
Nationally, strategies promised by the NHS and government to boost vaccination rates urgently need to be enacted, says Dr Ronny Cheung of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health.
NHS England recently published its vaccination strategy, which focused on addressing challenges around access and included proposals to provide flexible and convenient vaccination services. “This is an extremely welcome development but we are concerned that implementation plans for this strategy are not nearly as ambitious as we need them to be,” said Cheung. “The current aim is full implementation by 2025-26.
“Two years seems an unacceptably long wait. We’re already arriving late to this work and are feeling the effects of low uptake, particularly in the MMR vaccine. This is urgent – we must get to work straight away.”
Pollard points out that the UK is not unique when it comes to rising cases of measles. Seven years after the WHO warned the then measles-free UK against complacency, this week it warned of a 30-fold rise in cases across Europe.
More than 30,000 cases were reported by 40 of the region’s 53 member states between January and October last year, compared with 941 cases in the whole of 2022. Two in five cases were in children aged one to four, while one in five were among people aged 20 and over.
“There are measles outbreaks happening all over the world,” said Pollard. “This is a worrying moment globally.”
The only way out? Increase vaccination rates by encouraging parents to get their children jabbed against measles, experts say. “The virus is spreading today so we need to be vaccinating children today,” says Pollard. “There isn’t any time to wait. This is urgent and tomorrow may be too late.”"
YBV395O5OJ_0D1INWYQRJHXPOM,Disposable vapes ban ‘could lead to relapse in people trying to quit smoking’,Tobi Thomas,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/jan/24/disposable-vapes-ban-e-cigarette-use-quitting-smoking-research-study,"A ban on disposable vapes could discourage the use of e-cigarettes among people who are trying to quit smoking, research has found.
The government is considering a ban over concerns that children are using the products and becoming addicted. However, a study by academics at University College London and funded by Cancer Research UK has found it would also affect 2.6 million adults across Great Britain, 1.2 million of whom smoke and a further 744,000 who have previously.
The research, published in the journal Public Health, was based on a survey of 69,973 adults. It found that between January 2021 and August 2023 the percentage of the population using disposable e-cigarettes grew from 0.1% to 4.9%.
The researchers said that although preventing the uptake of vaping by children and those who have never smoked was a “public health priority”, the ban may inadvertently discourage the use of e-cigarettes among people who are trying to quit smoking. The study said: “Vaping is substantially less harmful than smoking, so it is essential that a ban on disposables does not discourage people who smoke from switching to vaping.”
Dr Sarah Jackson of UCL’s Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care, and the lead author of the study, said: “Our study suggests a ban on disposable e-cigarettes would affect an estimated 2.6 million people in England, Wales and Scotland.
“While banning disposables might seem like a straightforward solution to reduce youth vaping, it could have substantial unintended consequences for people who smoke.
“In the event of a ban, it would be important to encourage current and ex-smokers who use disposables to switch to other types of e-cigarettes rather than going back to just smoking tobacco.”
Prof Jamie Brown, the senior author of the study, said: “There is a need for action to reduce disposable vaping among young people who have never smoked. However, trade-offs need to be carefully considered. A ban may discourage use of e-cigarettes among people trying to quit smoking and may induce relapse among those who have already used disposables to quit.

“Cigarettes are far more harmful to our health and are not currently banned, and a ban on disposable e-cigarettes may signal to large numbers of people that these products are worse for our health or that their harm is comparable to that caused by smoking tobacco.”"
YC0OGF3VZF_UHY99ZHJULI698D,Rishi Sunak warns of further Yemen airstrikes if Houthi attacks continue,Dan Sabbagh,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/jan/23/rishi-sunak-pressure-mps-commons-red-sea-yemen-airstrikes-houthis,"Rishi Sunak has warned there could be further bombing of Yemen if Houthi attacks on shipping continue, as he came under mounting pressure from MPs to clarify Britain’s long-term strategy for tackling the deepening crisis.
The prime minister told parliament that a second round of RAF airstrikes, conducted on Monday night with the US, were taken in self-defence and rejected calls for MPs to be allowed a vote on whether to endorse the military action.
The Houthis, who control the north and west of Yemen, said on Tuesday they would continue to fight on in support of Gaza, and told British and American aid workers to leave the part of the country they control within 30 days.
Sunak said the UK and the US “are not seeking a confrontation” with the Houthis, but complained that the group had conducted at least 12 attacks on western shipping since the first round of British and American airstrikes on 12 January.
That was sufficient to justify Monday night’s bombing raid, which saw RAF Typhoons strike two targets near Sana’a, the prime minister said, adding that the bombing of Yemen, one of the world’s poorest countries, may continue.
“If necessary, the United Kingdom will not hesitate to respond again in self-defence,” said Sunak.
“We cannot stand by and allow these attacks to go unchallenged. Inaction is also a choice,” he said, and went on to hint there could be additional efforts to halt the supply of weapons to the Houthis from Iran.
“We must end the illegal flow of arms to the Houthi militia,” Sunak said, noting that the UK had “intercepted weapons shipments in the region before, including components of the very missiles used by the Houthis today”. Britain would work with “allies and partners” to try to disrupt and deter their supply in the future, he added.
The foreign secretary, David Cameron, will visit the Middle East “in the coming days”, the prime minister said, as part of a fresh effort to ease tensions.
The tour, which begins on Wednesday, will see him visit Qatar, Israel, the Palestinian territories and Turkey to press for an immediate temporary humanitarian pause in the fighting, saying the situation in Gaza is desperate.
Earlier this month the US and UK became engaged in bombing the Houthis in an attempt to halt a string of missile, drone and small-boat attacks mounted by the rebel group against international shipping in the southern Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, through which an estimated 15% of world seaborne trade passes.
Experts believe the airstrikes, aimed at launch sites, radar facilities and underground bomb storage, could go on for several weeks because Houthi targets are dispersed and hard to hit, partly because the rebel group has endured nine years of civil war, including a bombing campaign led by Saudi Arabia.
Sidharth Kaushal, a naval expert with the Royal United Services Institute thinktank, said: “We should expect a protracted crisis if the Houthis are not deterred from further action by the prospect of a protracted air campaign against them.”
Houthi leaders remained defiant on Tuesday. The Houthi army spokesperson, Brig Gen Yahya Saree, said the allied attacks would not go unpunished or unanswered. Eighteen targets were struck overnight, he added, but no casualty figures were given.
British and American aid workers were also asked to leave Yemen within 30 days, according to a letter sent to aid agencies by the Houthi-controlled foreign affairs ministry.
Aid workers already fear the series of airstrikes will dangerously weaken Yemen’s fragile humanitarian situation, in a country where imports of food and medicines have been in decline for several weeks.
The Houthis say their attacks on shipping in the Red Sea, which began in mid-October, are in support of Gaza. Propaganda put out by the group on social media juxtaposed pictures of Sana’a under attack with similar pictures in Gaza, or images of what appeared to be killed and wounded Palestinians.
Jeremy Quin, a former defence minister and the new Conservative chair of the Commons defence committee, called on Sunak to acknowledge there might need to be “a prolonged, persistent, targeted campaign” in order to protect shipping in the Red Sea region.
In reply, the prime minister sought at first to downplay the prospect. “I want to be absolutely clear that no decision has been taken to embark on a sustained campaign of the nature that he mentioned,” Sunak said, before emphasising: “We do reserve the right to take action in self-defence.”

Labour and Scottish National party MPs all pressed Sunak to set out the UK’s strategy for resolving the Red Sea crisis, calling for diplomatic efforts and humanitarian relief in addition to military action.
Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, said his party would judge further action against the Houthis on a case-by-case basis and that it backed the current “targeted action to reinforce maritime security in the Red Sea”.
However, he also asked whether the military action would be effective, what efforts the UK was taking to build and enlarge support for a maritime coalition protecting merchant shipping, and what “concrete steps” were being taken “to help the people of Yemen who have suffered terribly as a result of that country’s civil war”.
In reply, Sunak said an initial analysis showed “all intended targets were destroyed” and, in a later answer, added that there was “no evidence to suggest” there were civilian casualties caused by the latest round of bombing – or from the previous round of British strikes earlier in the month.
Debbie Abrahams, a backbench Labour MP, said she shared concerns about “what the strategy is, what the contagion to the rest of the Middle East will be and that we are potentially bolstering the Houthis’ position in Yemen”.
Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, called for MPs to be given a vote on military action against the Houthis, arguing that “the huge cross-party support for limited strikes” would “surely strengthen the signal he intends to give” to the Yemeni rebels.
Sunak said MPs would be allowed a “general debate” in the Commons on Wednesday over the military intervention. But by convention such a debate is not followed by a vote.
Recent parliamentary precedent has been to give MPs the right to approve military action, including the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the bombing of Islamic State in Iraq and Syria in 2014 and 2015.
However, formally the power is part of the royal prerogative reserved with the government, allowing for military action to be taken in self-defence without consulting parliament first.
Summary legal advice released by the government sought to emphasise this point, and said that “dozens of serious attacks on shipping” by the Houthis had targeted “British flagged vessels, as well as the vessels of many other states”.
The rebel group’s campaign had “culminated in an attack against HMS Diamond, involving multiple drones” in the Red Sea on 9 January, therefore justifying the UK in joining the US in attacking Yemen, using force to prevent further attacks."

Malkinson, who spent 17 years in prison for a rape he did not commit, is today calling for the chair of the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), Helen Pitcher, to be sacked and to return her OBE after the latest revelations in his case.
In 2013, DNA evidence exonerated a different man, Victor Nealon, of an attempted rape that he also wrongly spent 17 years in prison for. After that case, the CCRC said in an internal report seen by the Guardian that it should consider reviewing all similar cases.
Malkinson and Nealon’s cases were strikingly alike, yet no such review was undertaken for Malkinson – and it took another decade to clear his name.
Malkinson was convicted of the rape of a woman in Salford in July 2003. There was never any DNA linking him to the crime and he was exonerated last year after fresh forensic work linked DNA on a sample of the victim’s clothing to male DNA on the police database.
As with Malkinson’s case, the CCRC twice refused to refer Nealon’s case back to the court of appeal without conducting its own DNA testing. Both convictions relied solely on eyewitness evidence and were only overturned after the men’s lawyers commissioned forensic work.
The 2013 “lessons learned review” of the Nealon case by the CCRC, released under freedom of information laws to Malkinson’s legal team, called for the body to conduct a “trawl for similar cases” where DNA evidence opportunities had been missed. Yet no fresh tests were made in Malkinson’s case.
The latest evidence has prompted Malkinson to call on Pitcher to be removed from her post and to return the OBE she was awarded in the 2015 Queen’s birthday honours list for services to business.
Pitcher was in charge when the CCRC refused his second application in 2020 – again without ordering fresh forensic testing.
Malkinson, who turned 58 on Tuesday, said: “This report proves there has been a serious corporate failure at the CCRC, yet the body’s chair, Helen Pitcher, still refuses to apologise to me. She should be sacked and stripped of her OBE.
“New scientific discoveries are made every day, yet it did not even occur to the CCRC to use new DNA advances to spare myself and Victor Nealon extra years wrongly imprisoned.”
The CCRC’s report on Nealon’s case claimed that forensic awareness among casework staff had increased, giving them a “high degree of confidence” that DNA testing opportunities would not be missed in future.
Nealon received a letter of apology in 2014 from the then chair of the CCRC, Richard Foster, for its handling of the case. Foster assured Nealon: “We are doing what we can to prevent anything similar happening in the future.”
Nealon’s solicitor, Mark Newby, said: “He said they would learn lessons but plainly they never did.”
The late investigative journalist Bob Woffinden wrote an article in 2014 urging the CCRC to apply the lessons of Nealon’s case to Malkinson’s. Yet in internal records, the CCRC concluded there was no “reasonable basis for exploring further testing”.
The CCRC knew by 2009 that there was DNA not matching Malkinson on a crime-specific area of the victim’s clothing, yet did not conduct further testing until his legal team commissioned their own forensic tests.
James Burley, the investigator at Appeal who obtained the internal report, said it revealed that “the CCRC effectively learned nothing from its failure to properly investigate Victor Nealon’s wrongful conviction – and Andy Malkinson paid the price in the form of extra years behind bars for a crime he did not commit”.
“[It] complacently concluded with a ‘high degree of confidence’ that what happened to Victor Nealon could not happen again. Yet the CCRC failed Andy Malkinson in a strikingly similar way,” he added.
A man was arrested for the 2003 rape and released under investigation in December 2022. A spokesperson for Greater Manchester police said: “Senior detectives are continuing to lead a live investigation. Securing justice for the victim remains the priority in this case.”
An independent review of the CCRC’s handling of Malkinson’s case is being led by Chris Henley KC as well as an independent inquiry established by the Ministry of Justice.
A spokesperson for the CCRC said that while the review and inquiry are continuing “it would not be appropriate for us to engage in a detailed discussion as we are committed to maintaining the integrity of the inquiry process and to preserving the impartiality of the conclusions drawn in the Chris Henley review”.
They added that Pitcher “has previously acknowledged the profound impact that Mr Malkinson’s wrongful conviction has had on his life and the unacceptable time he spent in prison for a crime he did not commit” and has offered to meet him once the review and inquiry have concluded."
YNBWQDP5JQ_L0QBRPQHH7XG2SD,Protest in Britain has long been repressed,_,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/24/protest-in-britain-has-long-been-repressed,"In your editorial on the right to protest (23 January), you rightly note that the freedom to dissent is currently under threat in Britain. However, you are wrong to say that it has been “almost unheard of” for peaceful protesters to be imprisoned since the 1930s.
For instance, 22 people spent Christmas in prison in 1958 after staging a peaceful anti-war protest at the North Pickenham missile base. In September 1961, 32 people – including Bertrand Russell – were sentenced, most to a month in prison, for organising peaceful protests against nuclear weapons in London and Scotland.
In February 1962, six people were sentenced, most to 18 months, for organising peaceful protests at missile bases. In 1967, two people (one my father, Nicolas Walter) were sentenced to two months in prison after interrupting a speech by George Brown, the then foreign secretary. In 1983, 36 women were sentenced to 14 days after dancing on a silo at Greenham Common. In 1996, 10 women spent six months in prison for damage to a Hawk jet.
These are a few examples of the many nonviolent protesters who have been imprisoned since the 1930s. It is startling that the Guardian – which reported on all these incidents at the time – is erasing this long history of resistance and repression in Britain.Natasha WalterLondon

Legend states King Oswald was killed in battle against King Penda at the battle of Maserfield. An eagle lifted, flew and then dropped his arm at this site from whence a spring of water has since bubbled.”
This is Maserfield in Oswestry, where the terrible battle was fought on school playing fields, open-plan lawns of 60s semis and bungalows, between dwarf conifers and trees reaching from a bloody seed bank underneath. Here, on a cold, January night, flowers of Prunus x subhirtella ‘Autumnalis’, the winter-flowering cherry, open from pink buds under streetlights. It is quiet; there’s someone with a dog, someone running, no sign of gore pouring under drain covers towards the well, where the bird dropped his arm in the miraculous world of 642.
As the night sky clears and the moon grins like a cat, there are a few stars above Penda’s Mercian field, where the last pagan king brought his warbands and the Powys boys from across the border to kill Northumbrian king Oswald, chop him up according to ancient ritual, and hang his bits from trees in the little rosy cul‑de-sacs up Maserfield.
Birds still talk about the arm business: was it the Brythonic eagle, the Germanic raven or another of the guilds of excarnation of sacrificial flesh? The worm-pullers, seed-crackers and fat-ball nibblers on Maserfield bird tables are indifferent to human history and whether the battle happened here or somewhere else, or if there was a sacred spring here before one of them dropped Oswald’s arm on it. But they watch the sky, sing to it, then, when the bells of nearby St Oswald’s ring, they shut their beaks in clipped-hedge darkness. And the liverworts still grow on wet stones of the wellhead, though they are so much older. These strange plants, survivors in dark corners of catastrophe, are the inheritors of a 1,382-year-old wonder.

YPGL7GUEST_HHKV64ENHMATZWR,Scott Morrison to resign from politics for ‘new challenges in the global corporate sector’,Paul Karp,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/23/scott-morrison-resigns-politics-retirement-former-pm-liberal-party-details,"The former prime minister Scott Morrison has announced he will quit parliament at the end of February, triggering a byelection in his seat of Cook.
In a statement on social media on Tuesday, Morrison said he had decided “to take on new challenges in the global corporate sector and spend more time with my family”.
“By giving advance notice of my intention to leave parliament at the end of February, this will give my party ample time to select a great new candidate who I know will do what’s best for our community and bring fresh energy and commitment to the job,” he posted on Facebook.
Morrison intends to join a series of global strategic advisory roles and private boards, focused on the US and the Indo-Pacific, in sectors including defence and funding of defence startups.
While these roles are mostly based in Washington, Morrison said on Facebook he intended to remain in Australia. He said he looked forward to “enjoying local life here in the shire and my church community at Horizon with my family and friends”.
Earlier on Tuesday, the shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor – who is opposition leader Peter Dutton’s representative on the NSW Liberal executive – said he was unsure of Morrison’s plans.
But Taylor praised Morrison’s “big legacy” regarding the Aukus alliance to secure nuclear-powered submarines; his leadership during Covid; and income tax reform which he said was a “critical legacy” that Morrison drove and “championed” as treasurer and prime minister.
Morrison was first elected in 2007 and holds Cook with a comfortable 12.4% margin.
A byelection is unlikely to be held before April, setting up another test for the Albanese government and the Coalition just weeks after the 2 March byelection in Dunkley in Victoria.
Early frontrunners to replace Morrison include the mayor of Sutherland Shire, Carmelo Pesce, and the Liberals’ former candidate for Bennelong, Simon Kennedy, who lives in Maroubra, near the north end of the electorate of Cook. Sources in Cook also expect calls to nominate a woman to improve gender balance in the party.
Morrison, who is not expected to endorse a successor, said he hoped “to see, and invite, a strong field of candidates to bring their experience, passion and dedication to our community, to the job”.
Morrison previously served as the minister for immigration, presiding over operation sovereign borders, Australia’s policy of deterring asylum seeker boats by turning them back to their country of origin.
He served as treasurer to prime minister Malcolm Turnbull before becoming PM himself during a leadership coup – when Turnbull’s leadership was destabilised by Dutton.
Morrison won the 2019 federal election in an upset victory built on concerns over Labor’s tax policies and their leader Bill Shorten, but his popularity waned over his handling of the 2019-20 black summer bushfires and his response to the Covid pandemic.
He lost the 2022 election to Labor under Anthony Albanese but remained in parliament.
Morrison’s internal critics have argued his continued presence harmed the Coalition’s ability to move on from defeat.
In November 2022, Morrison became the first former prime minister censured by parliament over his decision to secretly appoint himself to colleagues’ ministries during the Covid pandemic.
In a separate statement on Tuesday, Morrison said he was “pleased to see how the Coalition has been able to move forward in opposition after the last election, maintain the stability and unity we were able to achieve in government during my leadership with Josh Frydenberg and is performing well under Peter Dutton’s leadership”.
Dutton thanked Morrison “for his service to our nation, for his dedication to the Liberal Party and for his personal friendship”.
Dutton labelled Aukus the “standout achievement of his government” but also praised Morrison’s broader legacy “stopping the boats as immigration minister [and] keeping our economy well-managed”.
In July 2023, Morrison was the subject of adverse findings in the robodebt royal commission report, including that he “allowed cabinet to be misled” about whether the debt recovery scheme required legislation to be lawful. He denied all wrongdoing.
The report led to pressure from colleagues including the Nationals leader, David Littleproud, Liberal MP Bridget Archer and Senator Andrew Bragg – although others suggested at the time the report made it less likely Morrison would pull the pin immediately.
Morrison is due to release a memoir in May called Plans for Your Good – A Prime Minister’s Testimony of God’s Faithfulness."
YXIO7SP1Z5_8PAVD90IZS2Q4UH,Trump the sinister playground bully in New Hampshire victory lap,David Smith,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/23/trump-victory-speech-haley-playground-bully,"The cruelty is the point.
As Joe Biden acknowledged on Tuesday night, Donald Trump now has the Republican presidential nomination sewn up. But like a Roman emperor or mob boss, Trump used his victory speech in New Hampshire to humiliate his former opponents – and make sinister threats against his last primary rival.
The former US president had followed up his record win in the Iowa caucuses with victory over Nikki Haley, his former ambassador to the UN, with a double-digit triumph in less favourable political territory. As Republican politicians and donors scramble to jump aboard the Trump train, it is clearly game over for the Never Trumpers.
Trump could have been magnanimous in victory and congratulated Haley on a race well run. Instead, he was palpably irked by her refusal to drop out of the race. Petty and vindictive, he became a playground bully punching down for the benefit of an audience that glories in metaphorical violence.
Addressing a crowded hotel ballroom in Nashua, he gave Haley a dark warning: “Just a little note to Nikki. She’s not going to win. But if she did, she would be under investigation by those people in 15 minutes, and I could tell you five reasons why already.
“Not big reasons, little stuff that she doesn’t want to talk about, that she will be under investigation within minutes, and so would Ron [DeSantis] have been, but he decided to get out.”
There were echoes of the political operative Lee Atwater or Roger Stone’s dirty tricks campaigns, or the Trump senior campaign aide Chris LaCivita’s Swift Boat veterans takedown of John Kerry in the 2004 presidential election. It was also redolent of Trump’s own vicious attacks on Senator Ted Cruz’s wife and father (whom he baselessly linked to the John F Kennedy assassination) in 2016.
But Trump has plenty of humiliation to serve around, even to people on his own side. He invited his former opponent Vivek Ramaswamy to speak but only “if he promises to do it in a minute or less” (admittedly, given Ramaswamy’s fiendishly irritating debate performances, many will take Trump’s side on that one).
Then there was Senator Tim Scott, another ex-rival who has already debased himself with a fawning endorsement of Trump. With his unerring ability to get under people’s skin, he said to Scott that, since the former South Carolina governor Haley appointed him to the Senate, “You must really hate her.”
There was an awkward silence in the room and a rare grunt of dissent from someone. To rescue the situation, Scott stepped forward to the lectern, looked at Trump and grovelled: “I just love you!” The crowd exhaled in relief. Scott was the hapless father in The Godfather who had accepted: “For justice, we must go to Don Corleone.”
Like Chris Christie in 2016, Scott has surrendered his principles to the inevitability of Trump. Haley now stands alone in a Republican party that belongs to him. Did she ever have a chance? Perhaps she could have done more to make it a choice rather than a coronation.
Haley could have emphasised her spouse’s military record and gone after Trump on his description of fallen solders as “losers” and “suckers”. She could have celebrated her identity as a daughter of Indian immigrants to contrast herself with Trump’s bigotry, nativism and racism. She could have played up her gender and what masterstroke it would be for Republicans, not Democrats, to produce America’s first female president after nearly 250 years.
She could also have been more forceful in making the electability argument, taking her cue from Christie who hammered Trump over his defeat in election after election.

But none of these are deemed viable in today’s party. Instead, when Haley did go bold and against the grain, it was on foreign policy, ardently pro-Israel and anti-Russia, and constantly bashing China. It was never going to win many extra votes but it was sure to alienate the isolationist “America First” wing of the party, personified by Ramaswamy.
Other flashes of courage arrived too little too late. Early on Tuesday Haley appeared on Fox News’s Fox & Friends and said, bluntly, she did not know if they would “tell the truth” about her campaign. Later, in her concession speech, she pushed the electability argument: “The worst-kept secret in politics is how badly the Democrats want to run against Donald Trump.”
If it was such a badly kept secret, why not shout it from the rooftops months earlier?
But like many bullies, Trump’s ostentatious show of strength was motivated by inner weakness. Haley did well enough among independents to raise red flags for Republicans in the general election.
The Lincoln Project, an anti-Trump group, commented: “It’s clear that Trump is political poison to moderates. Sane and moral Republicans said their conscience won’t allow them to vote for a chaos-driven maniac who is under 91 criminal counts, a proven sexual predator, and authoritarian wannabe who will shred the constitution and burn this country down.”
Biden, meanwhile, won the unsanctioned Democratic primary without even being on the ballot. He, not Trump, was the winner of the night when judging how things will play out in November.
Trump rules by fear in his party but lacks the love of his nation. For many voters, it is not love but loathing."
YYSLCUIG1L_5VN7OBG38V2YCCV,Ukraine hits out at HBO for casting pro-Russia actor in new season of White Lotus,_,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/jan/25/ukraine-hits-out-at-hbo-for-casting-pro-russia-actor-milos-bikovic-in-new-season-of-white-lotus,"Ukraine’s foreign ministry has criticised the US TV network HBO for giving a Serbian actor it says backs Russia’s invasion a starring role in the next season of the White Lotus.
Miloš Biković was given Russian citizenship in 2021 and was personally honoured by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, for his contribution to Russian arts and culture. In 2019, he said he had been banned from entering Ukraine for national security reasons.
HBO announced earlier this month that Biković would star in the third season of the White Lotus, triggering an immediate backlash from Ukrainian social media users.
“Miloš Biković, Serbian actor who has been supporting Russia since the start of the full-scale invasion, is now set to star in HBO’s The White Lotus Season 3,” the Ukrainian foreign ministry said on social media on Wednesday. “@HBO, is it all right for you to work with a person who supports genocide & violates international law?” it added.
There was no immediate response from HBO.
Biković, 36, has starred in a number of Russian productions and spoken regularly about his admiration of Russian culture.
Kyiv has said he filmed shows in Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula Russia annexed in 2014, and that he has backed Russia’s ongoing invasion of the country.
Putin awarded Biković the Pushkin medal, one of Russia’s top cultural prizes, for advancing Russian culture, at a ceremony in the Kremlin in 2018. He was also awarded Russian citizenship by presidential decree in 2021. “It is a great honour to say today: Russia is my homeland,” he wrote at the time on Instagram, adding that he was “an active member of Russian society”.
Filming of the third season of Emmy-winner the White Lotus will begin in February in Thailand, with the show set to air in 2025, Variety reported."
Z0PJXKPOCG_CB1DBIY1D6U8TDG,I’ll level with you – I truly love Britain’s flat landscapes,_,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2024/jan/23/i-love-britains-flat-landscapes-norfolk-fens-lancashire-cambridgeshire-suffolk,"If you visit the flat fenlands of Cambridgeshire on a clear day, and walk along the ruler-lined channels and droves, you might – if you’re lucky – see a freight train pulling itself out of the horizon like a conjuror’s endless scarf. Stand and watch, as long as you can. The train traces the top of the level land, wagon by coloured wagon, until the whole distance is trimmed with its purpose. Your attention will drift off, and drift back in, and that train will still be there, streaming along. And even when you can no longer hear its roar – when the wind’s slap of silence takes over your ears again – you’ll still be able to see the freight carriages, taking their time to vanish from that bare landscape.
We don’t talk much about Britain’s flat places. From the Cambridgeshire fens to the West Lancashire coastal plain, we pass over them hurriedly, looking for forests or rivers or mountains. Flat places seem hardly to count as places. They’re just the gaps between landmarks. If people think about flatlands at all, it’s usually to call them boring. Nothing to look at, nothing to focus on, no hidden places to discover. To be flat is to be dull: a cut-and-dried equation. So in Noël Coward’s play Private Lives (1930), divorcee Amanda demolishes her ex-husband’s new wife – met at a party in East Anglia – with the bland statement: “Very flat, Norfolk.” Norfolk has been trying to live this down ever since. “There are a lot of misperceptions about Norfolk,” pleads the Visit Norfolk website, “not least that the county is flat, far away and the weather isn’t great. Read on and we’ll debunk them all …”
But Norfolk doesn’t need to woo me with undulations. Its Beacon Hill and Beeston Bump leave me cold. Because whether it’s drained farmland, shingle beach or bare moor, I love flat landscapes more than any other. In 2021 and 2022, I travelled around some of Britain’s flattest landscapes – Cambridgeshire, Suffolk, Morecambe Bay, Orkney, Newcastle Moor – and I’m still not tired of them. Flat places continue to seduce me. Go to any beach when the tide is out, and you get a taste of their magnificence. You don’t need golden sands: mud will do perfectly. The point is to find that ruler-straight line of the horizon, cut with such confidence and swagger against the big sky. When I gaze at a flat space, a weight falls from me and energy rises up through my body. I feel utterly free in body and mind; I want to run and yell and cartwheel.
If you feel strange in the world – a little bit alien, perhaps, as so many of us do – you might find a home for yourself in flat places. As I discovered, watching that freight train run through the Cambridgeshire fens in 2021, the smallest things become weird in a flat place. Normal rules are suspended. Without landmarks to ground me, time and distance warped and shrank. A faraway white seagull seemed the size of a sheep; speck-like human figures loomed large with bewildering speed. Flat landscapes even invite mirages, those false glimmers of water luring thirsty travellers in the desert. No wonder, therefore, that flat places such as the Somerset Levels are rich with myth and folklore. King Arthur lingers in the Avalon Marshes. Hereward the Wake leaves his trail from Oakham to Thetford. When I find myself in a flat landscape, this magic tingles through my body. What is strange in me starts to feel special.
When you stand in these spaces, a sense of power fights with vulnerability. On one hand, you’re the tallest thing in the landscape. On the other – without the shelter of trees and hills – you’re wholly unprotected. You can see anything or anyone coming for miles – but equally, they can see you too. And these spaces bring up bigger philosophical questions, if we let ourselves notice them: how do we look at a flat landscape at all? What do we focus on, in a space with no landmarks? No wonder people often find flat landscapes frightening. They trouble our sense of our own importance, and our confidence about how we interact with our environments.
So the western reaction to flat landscapes, historically, has been to get rid of them. To build on them; to colonise them (think of the frontier myth in North America); to disrupt their inscrutable weirdness. But flat places have also goaded people into art: to working with, not against, the strange levelness. Flat expanses appear again and again in the work of eccentric or outsider artists: Craigie Aitchison’s crucifixion scenes, LS Lowry’s seascapes, Georgia O’Keefe’s prairies and clouds. And the landscapes themselves make room for art, ceremony and ritual. It’s hard for me not to see Orkney’s standing stones as a response to its vast bare stretches. Faced with those exquisite horizontals, people thousands of years ago erected tall stones as counterpoints, emblems of the perfectly vertical. Rather than challenging the flatness, these 90-degree slates create accent, allowing the flat islands to seem more themselves.
At the other end of Britain, in one of my very favourite landscapes – Shingle Street, a divinely flat shingle beach in Suffolk – friends Lida Cardozo Kindersley and Els Bottema, resting together from the exigencies of cancer treatment, made a line of white whelk shells that stretched almost three hundred metres. The landscape made space for them to play, experiment and simply be: in return, the Shingle Street shell line wound through the shingle without overwriting it.
Most existing level landscapes in the UK were recovered, painstakingly, from water. The fens of East Anglia were drained in the 17th century, at tremendous expense. And, of course, that water keeps trying to come back: towns such as March, 17 miles east of Peterborough, flood more and more often as the climate shifts. It’s the same in flat landscapes across Britain. The magnificent glittering flatness of Morecambe Bay, in the north-west, is only ever a temporary delight; every day the water rushes back in, reclaiming its rightful property, keeping the flatland safe from development. The sea tactfully covers and recovers breathtaking expanses: it gives us a peep now and then, but knows we can’t be trusted with them for long. So stop and look, next time you see a flat place. Let your eye run out over the expanse, relaxed, intent without purpose. Feel that strong, unapologetic horizon line like a sensation in your body. It’s weird and alien, but so are you.

Z1K8W1G5J6_2E69KHD47KJ1WR4,We must start urgently talking about the dangers of a second Trump presidency,Margaret Sullivan,_,20240125,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/25/second-trump-presidency-dangers-democracy,"With Trump’s victory in New Hampshire, the battle lines are drawn for November. Unless something very weird happens, we’re looking at a Joe Biden and Donald Trump rematch.
It’s time – past time, really – to sweep away any remaining delusions about the viability of a more moderate Republican challenger or what a second Trump term would bring.
Now the question isn’t who’s running but whether American democracy will endure.
To put it bluntly, not if Trump is elected.
He’s already told us, many times over – and in abundantly clear terms – what he will do with a second term:
He’ll prosecute his perceived enemies with the full power of the government. He’ll call out the military to put down citizen protest. He’ll never allow a fair election again.
“Twelve more years” is no longer just a joke to pander to the raucous and red-capped faithful.
“The serious scholars of fascism are now saying that the ‘F-word’ is merited,” Jeff Sharlet, a Dartmouth professor and author of The Undertow: Scenes from a Slow Civil War, told me in an interview on Wednesday.
Do Americans really want to live in a fascist or authoritarian nation? Some may believe it will work out just fine – that the loss of freedom may hurt others, but not them – but most of us don’t want that. Or we wouldn’t if we were fully aware of the consequences.
I talked with Sharlet about the actions that the mainstream press and regular citizens can take now that we know what we know.
Newsrooms big and small, he believes, need to educate their staffs about the dangers of fascism.
“There needs to be a pause,” he said, in coverage as as usual, and an internal reckoning. Sharlet suggests that media leaders bring in scholars – for example, Yale’s Timothy Snyder, who wrote On Tyranny – to lead newsroom discussions, based on clear historical precedent. Ruth Ben-Ghiat, author of Strongmen: Mussolini to the Present, would be another excellent choice.
After the New York Times wrote that Trump’s New Hampshire win “raises questions” about Nikki Haley’s path forward, Sharlet scoffed, noting that such questions have been settled for some time “but a press built for the horse race keeps touting a path that never existed when it should be retooling itself to cover a rapidly mutating fascism”.
Is such a retooling really possible? Of course it is.
The fact that many newsrooms now have democracy teams or democracy reporters suggests that they understand the problem to some extent. But they need to get much more urgent about it.
That kind of change takes clear leadership from the top.
The New York Times – now more influential than ever, as other news organizations shrink and fade by the day – should set an example. Its top editor, Joseph Kahn, with his background as a foreign correspondent in China, is extremely well positioned to take the lead.
As NYU professor Jay Rosen so memorably put it, coverage must refocus: “Not the odds but the stakes.” We do see “stakes” stories, of course, including on the Times front page, but it’s inarguable that horserace coverage still dominates.
What, exactly, we are racing toward is a question worth asking in every day’s politics coverage.

What about regular citizens?
Perhaps most importantly, they need to stop tuning out. They shouldn’t throw up their hands and decide not to care about politics or the future of the country.
“People need to pay attention to the exhaustion they feel and know that it is a symptom of acquiescence and adaptation,” Sharlet told me.
As Ben-Ghiat told me on my American Crisis podcast, that exhaustion is part of the strongman’s playbook.
Trump creates chaos, and we grow tired of it. Weary of the relentless flow of bad news, the dire warnings, the anxiety, we retreat into our personal lives or our political bubbles.
More advice from Sharlet for citizens: form a “boring book club” and read – for example – Project 2025 from the Heritage Foundation, the shocking (and nearly 1,000-page) rightwing plan to dismantle the federal government and install political allies after a Trump election.
As the Associated Press wrote: “Trump-era conservatives want to gut the ‘administrative state’ from within, by ousting federal employees they believe are standing in the way of the president’s agenda and replacing them with like-minded officials more eager to fulfill a new executive’s approach to governing.”
Neither politics reporters nor regular citizens need to become full-blown scholars of authoritarianism over the next nine months.
But failing to understand and act upon what’s at stake – either out of ennui or because “we’ve always done it that way” – is dangerous.

Z5TN8W3L5O_O01FRZE3SA78JJ3,"Can you breathe your way to health, happiness and a psychedelic trip?",Madeleine Aggeler,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/jan/24/is-breathwork-effective-health-happiness,"The promise of breathwork is appealingly simple: that the key to physical health, inner peace, improved performance and self-actualization is something we are already doing roughly 20,000 times a day. According to its adherents – which include Simone Biles, Michael Phelps, Gisele Bundchen, and a woman I met at a party last weekend – by manipulating your breath, you can better regulate your mind and body.
But what kind of breathing technique works best? I’ve heard breathwork can give me a psychedelic trip – is that true? And if breathing exercises can help us feel better, why aren’t we all doing them all the time?
“Breathwork is any type of regulation of breathing,” says Dr Sundar Balasubramanian, a researcher at the Medical University of South Carolina, and founder of the company PranaScience.
As Balasubramanian notes, breathwork has been around for thousands of years, and cultures across the globe developed their own practices: Chinese Qigong, Hawaiian piko piko, Indian yogic breathing, also known as pranayama. Over the years, more techniques have emerged, like holotropic breathwork, box breathing, Buteyko breathing and the Wim Hof method (developed by the Dutch motivational speaker Wim Hof, also known as the “Iceman,” who Justin Bieber once described as “a G”). These methods vary in intensity, speed and outcome. Are you trying to feel more energized? More relaxed? Is this exercise spiritual or are you just trying to calm your nerves?
“I always think [breathing techniques] are like varieties of chocolate,” says Balasubramanian. “There are so many different types.”
When it comes to choosing one, he says it depends on how you feel and what you’re trying to achieve in a given moment. If your nose is runny, for example, maybe skip alternate nostril breathing. If you want to feel energized, try an exercise with shorter, sharper breaths, and if you want to feel calm, try one with longer, deeper breaths.
Firstly and most importantly: our breath keeps us alive.
Beyond that, slowing the rate of our breathing to roughly six breaths a minute can have numerous physical and mental health benefits, explains Dr Alessandro Colasanti, a reader in psychiatry at Brighton and Sussex Medical School, and consultant psychiatrist at Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust. “These effects include relaxation, wellbeing, reduction of stress.”
Balasubramanian adds that by fully expanding our diaphragms on inhales and exhales, we can improve blood circulation in the body. “Most of the problems in terms of how tissues start deteriorating with age are because of a lack of proper circulation,” he explains, “This is easily changeable by your breathing.”
One Wednesday afternoon, I joined over 200 other participants in Sylvie Horvath’s Zoom breathwork class. Horvath is a yoga instructor, breathwork facilitator and founder of the company Soul Dimension. She started teaching weekly free breathwork classes on Zoom during the pandemic and attendance quickly grew. “I wasn’t sure how it would work online,” she said on a call later that week. “But I found that you can really get into it. You can feel the energy, even online.”
I was in a bad mood when I started the class, which seemed perfect. What better way to see if breathwork helps one feel good? Horvath took us through three cycles of breathing in which we inhaled and exhaled through our mouths 40 times. This, she said, would manipulate the oxygen levels in the blood – oxygen levels would go up, carbon dioxide levels would go down. “You could feel hot. You could feel cold. You could feel emotions,” she said. At the end of each cycle, we held our breaths on an exhale for one minute, though she added: “If you need to breathe in sooner, you can.”
During the first round, I found the sensation of breathing through my mouth unpleasant – my mouth and lips felt cold and dry – and holding my breath on an exhale made me tense with panic and I had to inhale deeply long before the minute was over.
As class went on, I got used to the open mouth breathing. I held my breath longer each cycle. At the end, I felt pleasantly woozy. My thoughts and movements felt slow, like I was floating through water. I wasn’t in a bad mood anymore. I scanned through the comments to see how other participants were feeling. “I really felt a tingling sensation and I cried,” someone had typed.
A recent New York Times story looked into the potential therapeutic applications of holotropic breathwork, an exercise that can transport practitioners into an “altered state of consciousness”.
I couldn’t help but be curious about this more transformative experience. Over the next few days, I sought out practices that were trippy (but also free). I found a breathwork video on YouTube that promised a “NATURAL HIGH” but just made the inside of my nose feel cold. The free meditation app on my phone offered a pranayama practice that promised a “transcendental experience” but just made my arms and legs twitch and left me with a bit of a headache.
Can a person really have a psychedelic experience from breathwork though?
“Some elements of it,” says Colasanti. He says studies have shown that certain fast-paced techniques have yielded results similar to psychedelic experiences, “particularly with regards to feelings of living in a mystical experience, being in a dreamful or blissful state, and feeling that the self and the surrounding were blurred”. As to why this happens, Colasanti says: “Short answer: we don’t know yet, but we are investigating it.”

Though everyone breathes, intense breathwork exercises aren’t for everyone. Because breathwork can constrict or expand blood vessels, Balasubramanian urges individuals who have had strokes or who have cardiovascular issues to proceed with caution, and to only do breathing exercises offered by individuals trained to deal with those conditions.
Horvath also warns that individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma, or those who are pregnant should talk to a doctor before doing specific breathwork practices.
Trauma survivors should also tread carefully when it comes to breathwork, as some might not feel comfortable focusing on physical sensations. In these cases, it’s best to start slowly, or focus on finding other coping strategies, ideally with the help of a professional.
As with any new practice, experts recommend starting slow.
“First, just become aware of how you’re breathing throughout the day,” says Guy Fincham, a breathwork researcher at the University of Sussex. From there, he suggests switching to nose breathing a majority of the time if you’re not already doing so, and then trying slow paced practices like box breathing (where you inhale for a count of four, hold for a count of four, exhale for a count of four, hold for a count of four, and repeat) or coherent breathing (where you inhale for a count of six and exhale for a count of six). Techniques that involve hyperventilation, he warned, should always be undertaken in a safe environment, meaning a space where one can lay down safely and comfortably, away from water and hard surfaces.
As for how often you should do breathwork, generally some is better than none, says Balasubramanian, though he cautions: “This is true for slow breathing exercises.” Meditative exercises, he says, can be done for longer because they are slow, but fast breathing hyperventilation exercises should be done carefully and with plenty of intermittent rest.
The traditional, slow pranayama practice, Balasubramanian explains, involves 24 minutes of breathing in the morning, afternoon and evening. But he recognizes that might be a lot to start with. “Even five minutes of some breathing exercises before each meal is good enough to cause some change.”
BOTTOM LINE
How much did it cost? $0.
Did it work? Sadly, I did not have a psychedelic trip, but I did generally feel more relaxed after my breathing sessions.
Would I do it again? Yes.
Did it fix me? Tiny, easily surmountable inconveniences can still send me into paroxysms of rage at any point, but several times a day I will try to take a few slow, deep breaths into my stomach, and that often helps a little.
Overall rating: Four (inhales) out of five (exhales)."
Z6QRD9TMHI_BMOVYQ89R6WJ2FZ,I gave my phone a bedtime so I could take back my evenings. Could it work?,Rhik Samadder,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/jan/22/phone-quitting-diary-screen-time-distance,"Last week, Rhik’s attempt to get off his phone made some progress as he met a woman he’s romantically interested in. Will it last?
I’m dog-sitting with my friend Tom. Let’s chew the fat, I say, the way people did before phones. “About what?” he replies. I hadn’t thought this far ahead.
What was the hundred years war? I eventually manage. How could a war last a hundred years? Tom offers to look it up. I throw up my hands. I was trying to revive the lost art of conversation. “This isn’t a conversation,” he says, already on his phone. “It was a series of Anglo-French conflicts in the Middle Ages. They actually lasted more than a hundred years.”
The decline of conversation is often blamed on Google, and the ability to fact-check anything in seconds. But Tom actually uses DuckDuckGo, which doesn’t collect user data. Results aren’t quite as relevant as Google, he explains, but inconvenience is a small price to pay for privacy. I’m not so sure.
Keeping Dr Bishop’s mantra in mind – “what gets measured, gets managed” – I decide to start my day with a walk in the park. Instead of scrolling in bed wasting the morning, I want to walk 10,000 steps a day. Forty-five minutes in the morning, then 45 to close my working day. I buy an alarm clock, so I can leave my phone charging in another room at night. I give my phone a “bed time” when I plug it in – I can still use it after this time, but I have to go to it.
My offline friend E has, in his words, “reinvented the mixtape”. He hands me a digital radio, which he has pre-loaded with 5,000 curated songs on a memory disc, to be played at random. This is light years away from Spotify where, in the face of unlimited choice, I often blank and play the last album I listened to again. The thing about convenience is, it’s sometimes nice not to choose.
I’m reading more in the daytime. A good book is more nourishing to me than most of the content on my phone. But reading is more work than scrolling, and by the evening, it’s hard to resist the siren call. I stay up late watching TV, so I can remain in the room with the plugged-in phone in it, standing over it like a weirdo.
Knowing my phone is out of reach, my senses wake up differently. The objects in my room swim into clarity, and I have a strange feeling of being returned to my life.
But it’s not a fairytale. Many of the objects in my room look tired, unglamorous. I have the heavy sense of being a person in a place, anchored to circumstance. This is the lumpen reality beneath the infinite fantasy of our phones. I don’t love it. My screen time creeps up again.

I have lost no work checking my emails twice a day; in fact it’s made me more productive. I don’t want to check in twice a day with texts though. Part of the joy of messaging is repartee, the back-and-forth banter. I can’t conference call my friends to do this. But checking in feels administrative. I still can’t think of a way to be on my phone less, without losing the sparky daily contact with my friends.
I’ve been speaking every day on the phone with Almond, my new dating interest. I’m not as funny as on text. I also don’t have to be, which is a revelation.
Things are going well. My social media use has dropped to about 90 minutes a day. Morning walking has replaced scrolling. I buy a pedometer, and determine to leave my phone at home.
There is hardly a second of my day in which I’m not stimulated, I’ve realised. On my walk, I listen to podcasts. In the shower, I listen to music. Doing my shopping, I wear noise-cancelling headphones. The artificial silence is created of anti-phase sound waves, pumped into my ear to cancel out the real world.
We haven’t had smartphones very long, yet it’s impossible to remember who we were without them. I find that amnesia disturbing. I suppose this is the way of all paradigm shifts. It’s not just how we do things that changes. It’s how we conceive of things at all. This loops in friendship, relationships, work and leisure, but most far-reaching of all, our sense of ourselves.
As Price promised, this now becomes the question underpinning everything. Who am I without distraction, and what is my life for? I honestly have no idea. And so I devise one final, make or break experiment, that will give me an answer.
Next week: Rhik goes to the woods."
Z7ZBAS605E_VS3U2MAMLGR3GYN,"More than 200 NSW taxi drivers ignored initial penalties for overcharging customers, data shows",Elias Visontay,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/23/nsw-taxi-drivers-ignored-penalties-fines-overcharged-passengers-customers-data,"More than 200 taxi drivers in New South Wales were found to have ignored initial punishments for overcharging passengers and were further disciplined for repeat offending, data covering the last 12 months reveals.
The industry is now pleading with the Minns government to crack down on the behaviour by establishing a centralised driver database, with leaders saying dodgy drivers who get sacked from one cab network are easily moving to rival companies whose administrators have no clue about their history of misbehaviour.
Data released to Guardian Australia under NSW’s equivalent of freedom of information laws shows that from December 2022 until the beginning of December 2023 – a period covering the first year of the point to point commission’s complaint hotline and campaign to end taxi overcharging – 536 individual drivers had disciplinary action imposed as a result of more than 2,000 complaints.
These complaints to the NSW point to point transport commissioner relate to drivers not using their meters, overcharging customers, attempting to negotiate upfront fares and refusing shorter trips.
Of those 536 drivers disciplined, 228 drivers – more than 40% – were disciplined more than once due to multiple complaints. Of the 536 drivers disciplined, there were 99 occasions where companies forced drivers into retraining, 53 temporary suspensions and 33 dismissals from a network.
Other forms of disciplinary action that taxi companies have taken which was not tallied in the commission’s data include forcing drivers to go a week without radio work from a network – meaning they can only take trips from the street and ranks.
In addition to the hotline, the commission’s crackdown on rogue drivers also included plainclothes officers entering taxis and issuing fines to drivers who refused to use their meters or overcharged.

In June, the government increased the penalty amount for on-the-spot fines from $300 to $1,000. However, data shows the behaviour continued in the months after the fine amount was increased.
Between December 2022 and the beginning of December 2023, officers issued more than 500 on-the-spot fines to cabbies. More than 350 of these fines were issued between June and the beginning of December – the months when the fine amount was at $1,000.
In December, Guardian Australia revealed that in the first six months of the point to point commission’s crackdown on taxi overcharging, authorities progressed 742 complaints against three operators – including 342 against just one operator, GM Cabs.
Taxi companies who spoke to the Guardian acknowledged the scale of the issue and lamented the deregulation of the taxi industry in 2017 meant operators no longer have access to a database showing a taxi driver’s record.
GM Cabs told Guardian Australia “as a taxi network, we hate what it’s becoming. We need to push for regulation again. Taxi drivers should be made accountable for their actions.”
Nick Abrahim, the NSW taxi council’s chief executive, wrote in December to the transport minister, Jo Haylen, asking for the return of a centralised accreditation process – whether run by the government or the council – so disciplinary action could include a driver being booted from the taxi industry and rideshare platforms, not just one company.
“The handful of drivers who want to overcharge are seeing a big loophole in the laws. They don’t think they have a lot at stake here, they know if they get booted they’ll just go to the next company,” Abrahim said.

“It’s network hopping, I hate to say it but there are those drivers where this behaviour will continue,” he said.
Abrahim noted the now-defunct Roads and Maritime Services previously maintained a centralised accreditation database and was the sole issuer of authority to drivers. He said while the state still regulates the bus industry in this way, “we’re seeing the consequences” of not doing it for taxis.
“If the government doesn’t want to do it again, no problem, we can issue IDs now, we just need the [legal] ability to do so,” Abrahim said.
Natalie Ward, the opposition’s transport spokesperson, expressed concern at the data which illustrated reoffending.
“The stats show that 40% of dodgy taxi drivers are consistent reoffenders, likely ripping off unsuspecting tourists and the elderly who rely on a safe and fair service,” Ward said.
“If the industry and the opposition are in lockstep that the fastest way to solve this issue is to build a centralised driver database and have more enforcement on Sydney’s streets, then the only person standing in the way of a solution is the transport minister,” Ward said.
A spokesman for Haylen said the point to point commission was discussing how to improve driver accreditation for drivers with the taxi council.
“We’re happy to hear any suggestions from the taxi industry that could deliver a fairer deal for passengers, especially at a time when people feel like they’re paying more for everything,” the spokesperson said."
Z9QXZVY993_7G8RNQEX3AU8II5,Oregon Democrats move to undo key part of drug decriminalization law,_,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/24/oregon-drug-decriminalization-law,"Democratic lawmakers in Oregon on Tuesday announced a sweeping new bill that would undo a key part of the state’s first-in-the-nation drug decriminalization law, a recognition that public opinion has soured on the measure amid rising public drug use during the fentanyl crisis.
The bill would recriminalize the possession of small amounts of drugs as a low-level misdemeanor, enabling police to confiscate them and crack down on their use on sidewalks and in parks, its authors said. It also aims to make it easier to prosecute dealers, to access addiction treatment medication, and to obtain and keep housing without facing discrimination for using that medication.
“It’s the compromise path, but also the best policy that we can come up with to make sure that we are continuing to keep communities safe and save lives,” Kate Lieber, a state senator and Portland Democrat, told the Associated Press.
Voters passed the pioneering decriminalization law, measure 110, with 58% support in 2020. But Democratic legislators who championed it as a way to treat addiction as a public health matter, not a crime, are now contending with one of the nation’s largest spikes in overdose deaths, along with intensifying pressure from Republicans and growing calls from a well-funded campaign group to overhaul it.
Researchers say it is too soon to determine whether the law has contributed to the state’s deadly overdose surge, and supporters of the measure say the decades-long approach of arresting people for possessing and using drugs did not work.
The bill, announced by Lieber and other Democrats serving on a recently created committee on addiction, is set to be introduced during the legislative session that starts in February. The legislature adjourned over the summer, but concern over the state’s drug crisis led Democrats to launch the committee in between sessions. Since September, the committee has held multiple hearings and heard testimony from law enforcement and substance use disorder experts on the law’s accomplishments and shortcomings.
Measure 110 directed the state’s cannabis tax revenue toward drug addiction treatment while decriminalizing “personal use” amounts of illicit drugs. Possession of under a gram of heroin, for example, is currently subject to a ticket and a maximum fine of $100.
Those caught with small amounts can have the citation dismissed by calling a 24-hour hotline to complete an addiction screening within 45 days, but those who do not do a screening are not penalized for failing to pay the fine.
In the year after the law took effect in February 2021, only 1% of people who received citations for possession sought help via the hotline, state auditors found. As of last June, the hotline received an average of 10 calls per month that were related to citations.
Opponents of the law say it has not created an incentive to seek treatment, a criticism the new bill seeks to address.
The measure’s details have yet to be finalized, but “personal use” possession of illegal drugs would become a misdemeanor punishable by up to 30 days in jail or a $1,250 fine. The bill would not affect Oregon’s legalization of cannabis or psychedelic mushrooms.
Those arrested for small amounts would be referred by police to a peer support specialist to schedule an assessment or intervention. If the person shows up to the meeting, they would not be charged. If they do not, the offense could be referred to the district attorney’s office.
If charges are filed, they could avoid jail by agreeing to certain conditions of probation, or by agreeing to have their case diverted to drug court, where judges place people in treatment programs rather than jail.
“We’re trying to give people off-ramps while also introducing some accountability into the system,” Lieber said.
Republican lawmakers said the bill did not go far enough. They called for mandatory treatment and “personal use” possession to be a higher-level misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in jail or a $6,250 fine.
“A low-level class C misdemeanor only provides 30 days in jail as an alternative. This is nowhere near the amount of time needed to address addiction,” the state representative Kevin Mannix said in a statement.
Advocacy groups that have backed Oregon’s decriminalization law opposed the proposal to once again make “personal use” possession a crime.
“You don’t need a criminal penalty. You need services, and you need to make sure that you’re investing in those services,” said Tera Hurst, executive director of the Health Justice Recovery Alliance. “Criminalization is not an effective tool to getting people into treatment, and it does more harm than good.”
Regarding drug dealing, the bill would make it easier to prosecute people for selling drugs and create harsher penalties for doing so in parks and near homeless shelters and substance use disorder treatment centers.
The bill also aims to expand access to treatment, particularly medications used to treat opioid addiction. It would allow doctors to prescribe such medication without prior approval or review from insurance companies, and make it easier for pharmacists to refill prescriptions in certain emergency situations.
Additionally, it would expand fair housing standards to protect people prescribed such medication from being discriminated against when trying to maintain or access long-term living facilities, such as permanent supportive housing for people exiting homelessness.
Lawmakers will have just 35 days to pass the bill once the legislative session starts on 5 February."

The suspect is accused of murdering 17-year-old Muhammad Hassam Ali, who was found seriously injured in Victoria Square, Birmingham, shortly before 3.30pm on Saturday. He was taken to hospital but died later the same day.
The charged youth, who cannot be named because of his age, will appear before Birmingham magistrates court on Thursday, West Midlands police said.
A second boy, also aged 15, has been released on conditional police bail.
DI Michelle Thurgood said: “Our thoughts remain with the family and friends of Muhammad. We have now charged a boy over Muhammad’s death but our inquiries continue.
“We are still keen to speak to anyone who was in the area on Saturday just before 3.30pm and would urge anyone with information to get in touch.”"
ZFC8LCBUMY_EXCRY607OWJVG14,Ohio pastor fights court battle with city over shelter for unhoused people,Erum Salam,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/23/ohio-church-religion-homeless-countersues-housing,"A Christian pastor is fighting back against a city in Ohio after it charged him with breaking a municipal law by opening up his place of worship to unhoused people as well as others who need shelter.
Police in Bryan, Ohio, filed 18 charges accusing Chris Avell – the pastor of Dad’s Place – with zoning violations at his rented church building. Officers alleged that the church lacked proper kitchen and laundry facilities, safe exits and adequate ventilation, as required.
Avell pleaded not guilty. Then his church sued Bryan’s government in federal court on Monday, arguing the city has violated the pastor’s constitutional rights to religious freedom.
Despite Avell making changes trying to address the city’s complaints, including the installation of a stove hood and closing its laundry facility, the church alleges in its lawsuit that officers are still harassing and intimidating them.
An attorney for Avell and the church, Jeremy Dys, said he suspects city leaders do not want a ministry for the unhoused in the middle of town. He described it as a “not in my backyard” – or, colloquially, “Nimby” – issue that his client’s lawsuit seeks to reframe as a test of the federal rights of free religious exercise and protection against government intrusion on religion.
“Nothing satisfies the city,” Dys said on Monday, hours after the lawsuit was filed. “And worse – they go on a smear campaign of innuendo and half-truths.”
Dys also accused the city of “creating problems in order to gin up opposition to this church existing in the town square”.
The defendants in the church’s lawsuit – the city of Bryan, its mayor, Carrie Schlade, and other municipal officials – deny allegations that any religious institution has been dealt with inappropriately.
“The city has been and continues to be interested in any business, any church, any entity complying with local and state law,” an attorney for the city, Marc Fishel, said.
The church said in its lawsuit that its leaders decided in March to remain open at all hours as a temporary, emergency shelter “for people to go who have nowhere else to go and no one to care for them”.
On average, eight people stay there each night, and a few more do so when weather is bad, the church said.
The city said police received complaints of criminal mischief, trespassing, theft and disturbing the peace and requests to investigate generally inappropriate activity at the church.
The church said its policy had been to let anyone stay overnight and not to ask them to leave “unless there is a biblically valid reason for doing so or if someone at the property poses a danger to himself or others”, according to the complaint.

The church holds a “rest and refresh in the Lord” ministry from 11pm to 8am, which includes scriptural readings piped in under dim lights. It is open to anyone.
The city argues these actions constitute housing, and the church is in a zone that does not permit residential use on the first floor of a building.
Bryan’s planning and zoning administrator gave the church 10 days to stop housing people. After an inspection, police in December sought charges against Avell for code violations.
The church wants a federal judge to enforce its rights to free exercise of religion and protection from government hostility. It also seeks a restraining order keeping Bryan officials from taking action against the church in connection with the charges in the case that were obtained by police, and the church additionally is pursuing damages along with attorneys’ fees.
“No history or tradition justifies the city’s intrusion into the church’s inner sanctum to dictate which rooms may be used for religious purposes, how the church may go about accomplishing its religious mission, or at what hours of the day religious activities are permitted,” the church said in its lawsuit.
Dys added in a statement: “Instead of supporting a church that is trying to help citizens going through some of the worst situations in their lives (and in the dead of winter), the city seems intent on intimidating the church into ending its ministry to vulnerable citizens or relocating it somewhere out of mayor Schlade’s sight. The constitution and the law say otherwise.”

ZG6ZLFVTV8_OO5NAHAHUO2QBHS,Tin can alley: the return of the Sad Man in Space,Nicholas Barber,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/jan/22/tin-can-alley-the-return-of-the-sad-man-in-space,"The Sad Man in Space is back! He was last seen orbiting our cinemas five years ago, when the average big-screen astronaut was less inclined to explore strange new worlds or fight bug-eyed monsters than to sit in a tin can feeling sorry for himself. Ryan Gosling was grief-stricken in First Man, Brad Pitt had issues in Ad Astra, Robert Pattinson was in low spirits in High Life, and Matthew McConaughey sobbed his eyes out in Interstellar, to name just four of the men who were lost in space in more ways than one. Floated around in zero gravity, but weighed down by their woes, they were so common that critics coined the terms “Sad Man in Space”, “Sad Dad in Space”, and “Sadstronauts” to describe them, while various articles traced the sub-genre back to Tarkovsky’s Solaris via Duncan Jones’s Moon. Being thousands of miles from home, separated from every other living being by cold, dark emptiness … this, film-makers realised, was a handy metaphor for being a bloke.
Now another Sadstronaut is on the launchpad. Earlier this week, Netflix debuted the first trailer for Spaceman, a science-fiction drama that premieres at the Berlin film festival in February. Adapted from Jaroslav Kalfar’s novel, Spaceman Of Bohemia, it stars Adam Sandler as Jakub, the titular astronaut – and you know it’s one of Sandler’s serious outings, because he’s got a beard. Jakub is on a solo mission through the solar system to investigate a mysterious dust cloud, but his main preoccupations seem to be his aching loneliness, his existential angst, and his separation from his pregnant wife, played by Carey Mulligan. His malaise is so severe that he has to talk it over with an enormous super-intelligent spider which is either an alien or a figment of his imagination. “I wish to assist you in your emotional distress,” says the spider, an offer which was never forthcoming from the Klingons. Judging by the mood of the trailer, it’s not likely that Sam Ryder’s euphoric Eurovision anthem, Space Man, will be on the soundtrack.
Where has the Sad Man in Space been since Gosling, Pitt and co were doing their intergalactic brooding? The answer, I’d argue, is that he fell to Earth, and now he’s everywhere. Countless major films in the last 12 months have revolved around masculinity in crisis: men without purpose, men perplexed by relationships, and men being generally depressed about being men. This has been the year of the Sad Man in Cinema.
Just look at some of the most prestigious films of 2023 and early 2024. Hollywood biopics tend to glorify the achievements of world-changing giants, but the central theme of Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer is a scientist’s guilt and doubt, and Ridley Scott’s Napoleon depicts a stroppy, sulky adolescent (Joaquin Phoenix) who is only really relaxed in the company of the children he meets in his final years. Even when he is in his pomp, moany Boney is reduced to grovelling dependency by Josephine (Vanessa Kirby), so someone braver than I am should probably ask Scott why his last three films, The Last Duel, The House of Gucci and Napoleon, have all been fixated on the disastrous consequences of an unwise marriage.
But Napoleon isn’t the only Sad Man who has been ground down by woman troubles. In Barbie and Poor Things, Ken (Ryan Gosling again) and Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo) both believe that they have found the ideal mate, and both have full-on, identity-shattering breakdowns when they’re rejected. Anatomy of a Fall, the Palme d’Or winner at last year’s Cannes Festival, and Fair Play, a smart Wall Street thriller, both feature men who crumble because their female partners have better careers than they do. In Wes Anderson’s Asteroid City, a widower (Jason Schwartzman) is so melancholy that he isn’t even cheered up by meeting a top Hollywood actor (Scarlett Johansson): he’s a Sad Man in a Space Camp. Todd Haynes’s May December introduces another top Hollywood actor (Natalie Portman). She is shadowing the woman (Julianne Moore) she is due to play in a biopic but, after the screening I attended, most people were talking about the woman’s much-younger husband (Charles Melton), who is bewildered and broken because he missed out on a normal youth.
Not that it’s always women who make cinema’s Sad Men so sad. Whatever the story, whatever the genre, film after recent film has had a relatively privileged straight man being crushed by the pressures of life. Some have been book-loving intellectuals – Jeffrey Wright’s disgruntled author in American Fiction, Paul Giamatti’s misanthropic teacher in The Holdovers – and some have been musclebound athletes. The Iron Claw tells the tragic true story of a family of wrestlers, but, as Ann Lee noted in the Guardian, the scenes of grappling in the ring are no more significant than the scenes of blubbing out of it. “I think the more crying men, the better for our society,” the film’s writer-director, Sean Durkin, said in an interview in Slashfilm. And that’s lucky, because even some of cinema’s out-and-out villains have been miserable messes lately, among them the vain and petulant King Magnifico in Disney’s Wish, and the lowly creep played by Leonardo DiCaprio in Killers of the Flower Moon.
So there we have it. Sad Man in Barbie Land, Sad Man on the Battlefields of Europe, Sad Man in the Kingdom of Rosas. Go back a bit further to 2022, and we have a Sad Batman in Gotham City: no caped crusader has ever moped more than the one played by Robert Pattinson (again). But perhaps this gloomy trend was inevitable. A lot of men are sad at the moment, whether they’re the world leaders who behave like mewling, permanently aggrieved toddlers, or the proles, like me, who are distraught about the state of the planet. Over the past year or so, Caitlin Moran’s What About Men? and Richard V Reeves’s Of Boys and Men have discussed our “cultural redundancy” and lack of “ontological security”, so maybe a film about a strong, competent, optimistic male would seem absurdly far-fetched. Still, we’re talking about the movies. Shouldn’t they provide us with some role models? Some paragons we can dream of being?

Well, it turns out that one is on his way. In Wim Wenders’s Perfect Days, which comes out in February, Hirayama (Koji Yakusho) pays the bills by cleaning Tokyo’s public toilets, and he lives alone in a flat which is smaller than Jakub’s rocket in Spaceman, and yet he is content in his own company, he takes pride in his work, and he enjoys tending plants, taking photos, reading paperbacks, and basking in the sunshine that peeps between the skyscrapers. There are hints that Hirayama once had a crisis of his own, but he has put it behind him, and learned how to live a useful, serene and satisfying life.
In 2024, he could be the hero we need. If any male cinemagoers are searching for inspiration, they shouldn’t look up to the Sad Man in Space, they should look over to the Happy Man in Tokyo."
ZRIE92R7NJ_Z7KX7T9ZCU0XTAG,Iraq accuses US of ‘reckless escalation’ of regional violence after latest strikes,Oliver Holmes,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/24/us-military-strikes-iran-targets-iraq-ain-al-asad-airbase,"US strikes against militias in Iraq have prompted the most scathing criticism yet from Baghdad, with the prime minister’s office accusing Washington of contributing to a “reckless escalation” of regional violence.
The Pentagon announced earlier on Wednesday that it had carried out overnight retaliatory strikes against three facilities linked to Iran-backed militias in response to its own forces coming under attack at an Iraqi airbase at the weekend.
The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, said in a statement that the attacks on Kata’ib Hezbollah and other Iran-linked groups were “necessary and proportionate”.
“These precision strikes are in direct response to a series of escalatory attacks against US and coalition personnel in Iraq and Syria by Iranian-sponsored militias,” Austin said. “We do not seek to escalate conflict in the region.”
Iraqi officials, however, disagreed, especially as some of the paramilitaries targeted are now integrated into the country’s regular armed forces.
A spokesperson for the prime minister, Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, called the attacks an “act of aggression”.
“This unacceptable act undermines years of cooperation, blatantly violates Iraq’s sovereignty and contributes to a reckless escalation … at a time when the region is already grappling with the danger of expanding conflict,” said Yahya Rasool, the Iraqi leader’s spokesperson for military affairs.
Another Iraqi official, national security adviser Qassem al-Araji, said the US strikes “do not help bring calm”.
The US has repeatedly warned that the devastating war in Gaza could lead to a broader conflict across the region. At the same time, Washington has conducted bombings in Iraq, Syria and Yemen, and continued to arm its closest regional ally, Israel.
Iraq is a rare ally of both Tehran and Washington but the Middle East crisis has tested those relationships, with both countries bombing its territory.
Late on Wednesday, Reuters cited two sources as saying that an armed drone had targeted a base housing US forces near Erbil in northern Iraq – a possible retaliation in this deepening tit-for-tat conflict.
On Saturday, four US personnel suffered traumatic brain injuries after Iraq’s Ain al-Asad airbase was hit by multiple ballistic missiles and rockets fired by Iranian-backed militants from inside Iraq.
US troops in Iraq and Syria have been attacked about 150 times by Iran-aligned militants since the Israel-Gaza war started in October, and Joe Biden has decided to respond militarily despite political sensitivities in Baghdad and the risk of a regional war.
The attacks against the US are seen as retaliation for its support of Israel in its war against Hamas, although Washington accuses Tehran of seeking to exploit the chaos for its own ends.
The US has 900 troops in Syria and 2,500 in Iraq, advising and assisting local forces to prevent a resurgence of Islamic State, which in 2014 seized large parts of both countries before being defeated.
The war in Gaza has been spreading in recent months, with US forces hitting Houthi targets after the group launched attacks on ships in the Red Sea.
Early on Wednesday, the US military announced it had carried out two more strikes in Yemen, destroying two Houthi anti-ship missiles that were aimed at the Red Sea and were preparing to launch. The raid marked the ninth round of US strikes on Houthi targets.
The Houthis say they are targeting Israel and its western allies in support of Palestinians in Gaza with their attacks on shipping in the Red Sea – and there has been no sign that these have slowed after the first wave of attacks.
After US strikes on Monday, which were launched in conjunction with the UK, a Houthi army spokesperson said the allied attacks would not go unanswered.

ZVWMSIXD27_IIKOAEGUZHTUUPZ,How best to avert nuclear Armageddon,_,_,20240122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/22/how-best-to-avert-nuclear-armageddon,"Reviewing Jane Corbin’s BBC2 documentary (Nuclear Armageddon: How Close Are We? review – TV that leaves you asking ‘Is that it?’, 18 January), Lucy Mangan praises its historical sweep, but detects insufficient rigour in some of its analysis.
She is right: while certainly highlighting the role of Russia, in particular, in stoking nuclear confrontation, the programme closes with the bizarre claim that “after a long battle [the Greenham women] succeeded” in forcing the government to rescind the decision to station Nato intermediate-range nuclear forces (INF) here. This is at least the second time that the BBC has promoted such disinformation.
On the 25th anniversary of the initial encampment at Greenham Common, the Guardian invited me to comment on this claim. The resultant article (from 2006) is still on your website; it sets out the timeline in detail, showing how – at the end of 1987 – “the moderate leadership of the Soviet Union concludes an INF Treaty with Nato, based explicitly on [President Reagan’s 1981] ‘zero option’ offer. The 572 Nato warheads and nearly 2,000 Soviet warheads are subsequently scrapped.”
This multilateral deal, which eliminated hundreds of missiles on both sides, could never have happened if the one-sided nuclear disarmers had had their way.Sir Julian Lewis MPChairman, Defence Committee, 2015-19
“Is that it?” asks Lucy Mangan in her review. “Would a global razing be the worst thing?” Fortunately, 59% of us oppose plans to station US nuclear bombs in the UK, while more than three-quarters are in favour of a global ban on nuclear weapons.
Whatever the shortcomings of Jane Corbin’s investigation, it opens an opportunity for serious public discussion on the deadly implications of nuclear weapon possession and use.
Notably, the British government – and nuclear weapons industry representatives – were absent from the documentary. But the public must have better than that; politicians must be held accountable for decisions affecting public safety and security – and where our money is spent.Tom UnterrainerChair, Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament

ZWH4VJ8LI6_4AO2TFEMAXEADB8,"The Guardian view on Royal Mail: when letters arrive is a social, not market, decision",Editorial,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/24/the-guardian-view-on-royal-mail-when-letters-arrive-is-a-social-not-market-decision,"When Royal Mail was privatised, one of its putative competitors predicted that within 10 years the universal postal service, guaranteeing six-day delivery, would appear as outdated as red telephone boxes. On Wednesday, the communications regulator, Ofcom, appeared set on fulfilling that prophecy. It said that Royal Mail should be able to cut postal deliveries to as few as three days a week. Ofcom wants a debate about whether anything gets done urgently by letter in an age of electronic communication. The discussion with voters is likely to be a short one, a thought not lost on the prime minister, who quickly ruled out any change to deliveries.
The watchdog argues that, while Royal Mail’s “universal service obligation” has not changed since 2011, the volume of letters sent in the UK has halved over the same period. The company, it reckons, could save £650m if it delivered letters just three days a week and £200m by stopping Saturday deliveries. The logic of this wrong-headed policy is to socialise the pain and privatise the gain. The fallout will be worst for those least able to deal with the change: people in rural areas, small businesses and elderly people. These groups are also the most sensitive to price increases, which has not stopped the cost of first-class stamps more than doubling since privatisation.
In private hands, Royal Mail has been badly run. It had a damaging strike, making threats of it being pushed into administration. Ofcom fined it £5.6m for failing to hit delivery targets. Customer dissatisfaction resulted in Royal Mail losing its monopoly on delivering parcels from Post Office sites. Yet the parent company, International Distributions Services, said last July that its Royal Mail division will be profitable next year. While pleading poverty, the company will pay out dividends, making its largest shareholder – the Czech billionaire Daniel Křetínský – happy. Chutzpah doesn’t come close, really.
Parcels are increasingly important to people’s daily lives, with 3.6bn items sent last year. However, this was down 10% from its pandemic peak. Royal Mail’s market share dropped as weaker online shopping trends were compounded by industrial strife. In the past, this would have been offset by revenues from the parent firm’s successful international parcel business, GLS. In retrospect, the “crisis” in Royal Mail seems to have had its origins in a July 2022 statement from directors that they didn’t want to subsidise its losses with GLS earnings.
Mail services should be more socially determined. The postie is often a key point of contact in many towns and villages. The government spends £50m a year to support 3,000 “last shop in the village” postal branches. The Post Office scandal provides an opportunity to recast the network of shops as social hubs, which could be more effectively buttressed with a more robust Royal Mail.
Before it was sold off, Royal Mail was a successful public sector enterprise. Privatisation has not seen consumer interests properly protected, and its staff have been in a race to the bottom with tech behemoths such as Amazon in terms of pay and conditions. When privatised companies have failed to deliver, governments – including Tory ones – have taken them back into public hands. Ministers also allow state-owned utilities in the water and rail sectors to borrow capital and run themselves in the wider social interest. NHS foundation trusts are public benefit corporations. There appears no compelling reason why Royal Mail could not be too."
ZYZXL2Z38H_JF9UVLSQL4NUTMG,‘We want everybody walking out’: UAW chief outlines mass strike for May 2028,Michael Sainato,_,20230122,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/22/autoworkers-uaw-shawn-fain-may-2028-national-strike,"Shawn Fain, the United Auto Workers president, criticized Donald Trump on Monday but declined to back Joe Biden as he reaffirmed plans to lead a general strike in the US in 2028.
Speaking to union members at the UAW national political conference in Washington DC, Fain said it was time for union members to come together.
“We have to pay for our sins of the past. Back in 1980 when Reagan at the time fired patco workers, everybody in this country should have stood up and walked the hell out,” Fain said. “We missed the opportunity then, but we’re not going to miss it in 2028. That’s the plan. We want a general strike. We want everybody walking out just like they do in other countries.”
He reaffirmed ambitious plans to organize a general strike for 1 May 2028, coinciding with International Solidarity Day or May Day.
The UAW rescheduled the expiration of their union contracts with the US’s big three automakers to align on this day in the contracts it reached late last year and has been encouraging other labor unions to schedule contracts to expire on this day to maximize the participation from workers across different industries.
A general strike is a mass strike across various industries around similar demands or bargaining positions. In the US, they have been virtually non-existent in recent decades given the passage of the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947 that restricted secondary strikes and the decline of labor unions in the US since the 1970s.
After successfully taking on the US auto companies, Fain has emerged as a potent political figure, courted by Trump and Biden.
Fain also used his speech to criticize Trump, telling reporters that Trump “is as a person ... pretty much contrary to everything we stand for”.

But the UAW has yet to formally endorse Biden, who was the first president to walk on a picket line with striking workers in September 2023. Fain told reporters the union will be holding formal discussions on an endorsement amid rumors that Biden may address the union in person later this week.

ZZGSR9GIYF_0C015LMMAS5HAY6,Is a lack of diversity holding back the fashion industry?,Ellie Violet Bramley,_,20240123,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2024/jan/23/fashion-industry-diversity-lack,"The top jobs in the British fashion industry are still overwhelmingly held by white men, according to a new report. While that might feel like old news, the business case for making workforces better reflect society is perhaps less regularly made.
The inaugural Fashion Diversity, Equality and Inclusion (DEI) report, released today, finds that only 9% of executive and 11% of so-called power roles, which include chief executive, chief financial officer, chair and creative director positions, are held by people of colour. 39% of executive teams and 24% of power posts are occupied by women.
Across industries, a diverse workforce, it points out, “improves decision-making up to 87% of the time – the result of expanded perspectives”, which, in turn, “feeds through to the bottom line”. It finds that diverse businesses are 39% more likely to outperform financially, while improving DEI is important for companies looking to attract talent, with “39% of global job seekers [having] turned down or decided not to pursue jobs because of a perceived lack of inclusion.”
Alongside this, consumers are increasingly choosing to leverage their spending power with companies that they perceive as reflecting their values, with about 50% of millennials saying “it is important or very important to choose brands that have a gender equity stance”.
“The whole point now is to reposition DEI as a business imperative and a lever for profitability and financial success,” says Jamie Gill, founder of the Outsiders Perspective, a not-for-profit incubation platform for people of colour in fashion that co-authored the report. In the current turbulent economic climate, he argues, DEI should not be sidelined. “Having the right people around the table, having those fresh perspectives from all different walks of life is really what we need to look at,” he says.
The report, which is also the work of the British Fashion Council, the (Fashion) Minority Report and McKinsey & Company, lands at a time when diversity in the industry has been under renewed scrutiny, after the announcement of Seán McGirr to replace Sarah Burton as creative director at Alexander McQueen in October. While noone was questioning his talent, but his appointment means all the creative director positions at Kering, the luxury conglomerate that owns McQueen, are held by white men. It also follows a Paris men’s fashion week at which some of the buzziest, most interesting shows were the work of designers Martine Rose and Grace Wales Bonner, both women of colour.
The need for greater diversity and inclusion runs deeper than good commercial sense, but, says Gill, “we haven’t moved the needle in the last three and half years, since the conversation was brought to the world stage … We’ve been saying there’s a need for humanity and that hasn’t landed.”
Also revealed in the report is the dissonance of beliefs around diversity and inclusion in the industry. In illuminating but perhaps unsurprising figures, 86% of white men in the industry believe it to be diverse, while only 46% of women of colour believe the same to be true.
The report highlights that fashion has made some progress in what it calls “outward-looking” contexts, meaning areas such as catwalk representation, but that is less true when it comes to boardrooms and workplaces.
“We really want to highlight and, to a certain extent, celebrate that as a collective the fashion industry has been integral in changing our marketing. Our external space has become very diverse, very representative – catwalks, ad campaigns, events are very inclusive and representative, which is fantastic and shows, in a short space of time, how quickly we were able to accelerate that change when we focused on it.” Now, he says, “We need to look internally because there’s such a disconnect with the workforce and moving it forward.”
To shift the dial, the report stresses the importance of leadership, with the need for company heads to set out diversity ambitions – the research indicates that commitment to action at board level is most likely to deliver change.
Gaping holes in data also need to be filled. “We, as an industry, are not collecting our data,” says Gill. There is, according to the report, a particular lack of data on LGBTQIA+, neurodiversity, socioeconomic background, size, age, religion and gender. Gill sees this report as a call to action “to gather that data around all underrepresented groups”.
“Fashion is a leader. We’re an industry that leads on everything and right now we’re not leading on this,” says Gill."
ZZHMFST4A5_IYJ0H08FKVZ7KI0,EU fossil fuel CO2 emissions hit 60-year low,Ajit Niranjan,_,20240124,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/24/eu-fossil-fuel-co2-emissions-hit-60-year-low,"The European Union pumped out 8% less carbon dioxide from the fossil fuels it burned in 2023 than it did in 2022, the Guardian can reveal, pushing these emissions down to their lowest level in 60 years.
The fall in planet-heating pollution is the steepest yearly drop on record behind 2020, when governments shuttered factories and grounded flights to stop the spread of Covid-19, according to analysis from the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (Crea).
“EU CO2 emissions have finally fallen back to levels apparent in my parents’ generation in the 1960s,” said Isaac Levi, an analyst at Crea. “Yet, over this time period, the economy has tripled – showing that climate change can be combated without foregoing economic growth.”
More than half of the drop in emissions came from the use of cleaner electricity, the report found. The EU built record levels of solar panels and wind turbines in 2023, according to industry data, and was able to make more electricity from dams and nuclear power plants that had been struck by drought and repair work the year before.
The report found that lower demand for electricity, aided by good weather, contributed to 8% of the fall in fossil CO2 emissions. Cuts in sectors such as industry – where high gas prices have led some firms to become more efficient and others to make fewer goods – and transport made up the remaining 36%.
The figures do not include sectors such as agriculture, dirty chemical processes such as cement-making, or other greenhouse gases such as methane. Analysts say emissions overall are still falling too slowly.
“The 8% reduction in emissions should be celebrated,” said Levi, “but more must be done to wean the EU off fossil fuels, reduce reliance on petrostates such as Russia, whilst also leaving the world a better place for the next generation.”
The EU bears some of the greatest responsibility for having heated the planet and made extreme weather more violent. To keep temperatures under control, it has promised to cut its greenhouse gas pollution by 55% by the end of the decade from 1990 levels before reaching net-zero emissions by 2050.
Last week, the EU’s own climate advisers said “the pace of reductions needs to increase considerably” if the bloc was to achieve its 2030 target. The 27 member states need to cut emissions about twice as fast as they have done on average over the last 17 years, according to a report from the European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change.

The group laid out a list of 13 recommendations that include urgently phasing out fossil fuel subsidies, expanding the European emissions pricing scheme to include agriculture, and passing the final laws in the European green deal.
“The EU has made great progress in recent years to strengthen its climate policy framework,” said Prof Ottmar Edenhofer, the chair of the advisory board, when the report was published. “But reaching climate neutrality by 2050 is a race against the clock and we cannot afford to lean back now.”
Sarah Brown, from the clean energy thinktank Ember, which was not involved in the analysis, said: “This substantial fall in emissions, particularly from the power sector, shows that the EU is accelerating its shift away from risky and expensive fossil fuels. But with the expected increase in electricity demand due to wider electrification over the coming years, renewables deployment and energy efficiency must keep pace.”"
