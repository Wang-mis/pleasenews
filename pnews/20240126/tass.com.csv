Prime Minister of Slovakia Robert Fico said after his meeting with Ukrainian Prime Minister Denis Shmygal that an agreement was reached on the probable continuation of Russian gas moving via Ukraine to Slovakia in particular.
""A serious topic [during the talks] was the issue of Russian gas passing through the territory of Ukraine to Slovakia. An agreement emerged that the transit of Russian gas via Ukraine will probably continue. This is an excellent piece of news, meaning that we in Slovakia will be able to continue transiting this gas. Not merely our plants but Austria and Italy will also benefit from that,"" Fico said in a video on his page on Facebook [banned in Russia due to its ownership by Meta designated as extremist].
The details of the agreement will be finalized soon, he added."

China will monitor the living environment of giant panda bears located abroad, given that there are currently 56 cat bears in foreign zoos, Zhang Yue, a representative of the National Forestry and Grassland Administration of China, said at a press conference.
""In an effort to improve the protection and supervision of giant pandas overseas, effective from 2023, the Chinese National Forestry and Grassland Administration has established entities to conduct on-site inspections and evaluations of 23 foreign facilities in 19 countries to acquire comprehensive information on the living conditions of all giant pandas abroad,"" the official said. He noted that those conditions are so far ""generally appropriate"" in terms of enclosure structure, breeding and medical treatment, as well as illness prevention.
""The health of the pandas abroad is generally well maintained, with some older bears in poor condition being given proper diagnosis, medical treatment and good care,"" Zhang said.
Plans call for expanding international cooperation in this area, arranging daily monitoring of the pandas' health condition, and further improving the inspection and supervisory system. Through partnerships with foreign institutions, 41 panda cubs have been born outside of China since the 1990s, Zhang clarified.
Giant pandas are considered the unofficial symbol of China. Their natural habitat is the bamboo forests of Sichuan Province and some other areas of China."

The United States and other Western countries are implementing a ""business project"" to their benefit in Ukraine, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said at the meeting of the UN Security Council.
""US Secretary of State [Antony] Blinken focuses attention on continuation of aid to Ukraine being the guarantee of creating new jobs in the United States, like a certain profitable business project is meant and not the war that already claimed hundreds of thousands of lives in Ukraine,"" the top Russian diplomat said.
""The majority of large Ukrainian plants and companies, including the ones producing lithium, were sold to the same Americans,"" Lavrov noted. ""Fertile lands were also sold to them for a perpetual lease on the cheap, as we say,"" he stressed. ""One of the striking example is that [George] Soros’ institutions received gumbo soil lands for burial of Western chemical industry’s waste, he added."

Moscow will seek a clear reaction from the OSCE to the recent downing of a Russian military transport aircraft carrying Ukrainian prisoners of war, Russia's representative at the group, Alexander Lukashevich, told reporters.
""We will persist in seeking an articulate reaction <...> and demand an answer,"" the diplomat said, when asked about the OSCE reaction to Ukraine's attack on the Il-76 aircraft.
""We also reminded them about the tragedy at the market in Donetsk on January 21. We did all this in advance, telling the Maltese that we expected an appropriate response. We this to them and the OSCE secretary general. They react, as if on cue, only to their insane fabrications about our brutal shelling,"" Lukashevich said.
The Foreign Ministry of Malta, the country that now holds the rotating OSCE presidency, told TASS earlier that its government is aware of the Russian plane incident, but won’t comment as it awaits more details. Later, the organization's spokesman, David Dadge, told reporters in Vienna that the crash of the aircraft in Russia’s Belgorod Region is a tragedy.
On January 24 Ukrainian forces shot down a Russian Il-76 military transport aircraft that was carrying captured Ukrainian soldiers for exchange. All 74 people onboard, including 65 Ukrainians, were killed in the incident. The Russian Defense Ministry called the incident a terrorist act and said Kiev knew about the transportation of prisoners for an exchange that was to take place at the Kolotilovka checkpoint. The ministry said Ukraine attacked the plane so Kiev could blame Moscow for taking the lives of Ukrainian soldiers."
1WLZTP4X7V_DCCZ5LYMU9KDQJD,Press review: Swiss offer to broker Ukraine talks and US green-lights F-16 sales to Turkey,_,_,20240126,tass.com,https://tass.com/pressreview/1737623,"MOSCOW, January 26. /TASS/. The West sent out a trial balloon for a potential dialogue with Russia as Switzerland offered to mediate a settlement to the Ukraine conflict; the US appears ready to unfreeze the sale of F-16 fighter jets to Turkey after Ankara finally gave its nod to NATO membership for Sweden; and world opinion is solidly behind the creation of a Palestinian state despite Israel’s stubbornly intransigent stance. These stories topped Friday’s newspaper headlines across Russia.

Statements by Switzerland indicating Bern’s willingness to assist in the resolution of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, announced by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov during a press conference at the UN headquarters in New York, represent a trial balloon by the West as it attempts to leave the door open for prospective negotiations, potentially using Switzerland as a mediator, experts told Izvestia. Nevertheless, the consensus view sees no real grounds to argue that the West is seeking an actual discussion between Russia and Ukraine.
During his visit to the UN, Lavrov met with his Swiss counterpart, Ignazio Cassis. According to Lavrov, Cassis attempted to persuade him that Bern was willing to serve as a mediator in the conflict with Ukraine. However, Lavrov pointed out that Switzerland's potential role as a mediator in the Russian-Ukrainian dispute is complicated by the traditionally neutral Alpine country's own recent strategy, which has prioritized reinforcing European security structures not in conjunction with Russia, but against it.
Switzerland is attempting to strengthen its status as a neutral state, according to Valdai Discussion Club expert Igor Istomin, who is director of the Department of Applied Analysis of International Problems at Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO University). ""The country is traditionally proud of its neutrality and is trying to maintain some demonstration of its special position even in conditions where it has joined sanctions against Russia and is pursuing a policy that is in line with the Western course,"" he told Izvestia.
In light of the near-total breakdown of diplomatic dialogue between Russia and the West, Dmitry Danilov, head of the European Security Department at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute of Europe, believes that the United States and Europe must keep the door open for future negotiations. In this light, Switzerland is a good candidate to be a communications channel.
Nonetheless, it is difficult to argue that the West is genuinely seeking to foster an actual discussion between Russia and Ukraine, just as it is difficult to believe that Kiev’s international partners are attempting to persuade Switzerland to begin the search for potential peace deals. ""In order to conduct mediation negotiations and come up with such an initiative, it is necessary to at least identify some points for negotiations, but they didn't do this,"" Sergey Ordzhonikidze, former UN deputy secretary general and former deputy head of the Russian Foreign Ministry, told the newspaper. ""Switzerland is practicing its mediation capacities in order to shift away from its [recent] pro-Western stance and back toward the neutrality that the country is traditionally known for,"" the expert added.

Late in the evening on January 25, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan officially confirmed Ankara’s ratification of the protocol for approving Sweden's NATO membership application, which had been passed the day before by the country's Grand National Assembly (parliament), according to official Turkish newspaper Resmi Gazete. Thus, according to experts interviewed by Vedomosti, by approving the ratification of Sweden's NATO application, Erdogan has fulfilled the necessary condition for unfreezing the sale of US F-16 fighter jets to Turkey.
The US ambassador to Ankara indirectly verified information reported by Reuters and The New York Times that US President Joe Biden sent a letter to Congress on the night of January 25 requesting approval of the sale of F-16 fighter jets to Turkey. Erdogan has consistently linked approval of Sweden's NATO candidacy to Ankara’s purchase of the F-16s from the US.
According to Vladimir Vasiliev, chief researcher at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute for US and Canadian Studies, Congress will approve the sale of the F-16s, clearing the way for Sweden's NATO membership. According to him, there is a consensus among major US political figures on this topic. ""The [sale of F-16s] is in the interests of the United States, as Ankara remains a vital partner in the Black Sea region and the Middle East. Continuing the conflict with [Ankara] would only result in image and reputational impairment,"" he said.
At the same time, Vasiliev continued, Washington will maintain its ""two keys"" policy: by approving the supply of weapons to Turkey, Washington will keep Ankara ""on a short leash,"" linking the sale of the new consignment of aircraft to the process of resolving Ankara’s relations with Tel Aviv, which deteriorated following the start of Israel’s war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip in October 2023.
Ankara faces severe challenges in modernizing the Turkish air force in light of the possibilities for neighbor and long-time rival Greece to upgrade its air arsenal, including with French assistance, Alina Vernigora, junior researcher at the Center for the Study of Strategic Planning at the Russian Academy of Sciences’ Institute of World Economy and International Relations (IMEMO RAS), told the newspaper. According to the expert, the Turkish establishment will present the likelihood that the sale of F-16s will now be unfrozen not as a success, but as a necessary ""commitment to NATO bloc discipline,"" similar to Ankara’s lukewarm support for Sweden's membership bid.

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Egypt and Jordan recently submitted a post-conflict settlement proposal for the Gaza Strip. The idea was sponsored by the United States, which has consistently underlined the need for an independent Palestinian state. The EU advocates the same thing, along with Russia and China. However, despite almost universal agreement, the ""two peoples - two states"" proposal may still be a long way away from being implemented, Izvestia writes.
The day after the Arab governments' announcement, foreign ministers from the EU met with Israeli and Palestinian officials, announcing a European settlement plan, which includes the practical application of the two-state concept. However, as the European press reports, Brussels' peace effort, like all previous ones, was met with the Israeli authorities’ categorical refusal to even initiate conversations on the subject. As a response, the EU reportedly began discussing sanctions against Israel.
The Israelis' steadfast opposition to the creation of an independent Palestine is not unique to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's leadership. This is part of the overall political culture, Middle East expert Andrey Ontikov told Izvestia.
""When talks in the West repeatedly focus on the necessity of implementing the two-state principle, it is difficult to fathom how they will do that. If Netanyahu talks about Palestinian statehood tomorrow, his future will be predictable. After the inquiry into the events of October 7 is completed, his political career will either end on the street, at best, or at worst - in prison,"" the analyst contends.
Hamas’ surprise terrorist attack, the subsequent military operation, and the large number of civilian losses have all contributed to a gradual shift in public attitudes in Washington and Brussels. However, no action has been taken yet. According to Ontikov, if the Europeans and Americans truly wanted to promote the idea of a two-state solution, they could put some pressure on Israel's leadership. ""There is no evidence of this. Moreover, Israel continues to be supplied with numerous armaments. Obviously, to maintain hostilities. It looks ridiculous,"" he added.
According to Grigory Lukyanov, senior lecturer at the Department of Middle East Countries of the Faculty of Oriental Studies at the State Agrarian University of Humanities, the main political forces in Palestine are losing popular support, and this ongoing issue complicates the settlement process. At the same time, Israel will never be satisfied with the security mechanisms that the United States or Arab countries can offer them, Lukyanov emphasized.

The US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations has approved a bill that would authorize the seizure and use of the Central Bank of Russia’s frozen foreign reserves and other Russian sovereign assets to assist Ukraine and for ""other purposes."" Twenty of the committee's 21 members voted in favor, while only Senator Rand Paul (Republican-Kentucky) spoke out against it. At the same time, the US Senate does not yet have ready-made tools for implementing the idea, Vedomosti writes.
According to Ivan Timofeyev, director of the Russian International Affairs Council (RIAC), among Western countries only Canada has a framework in place to confiscate Russian assets as of January 2024. The expert stated that in the US, the equivalent legal mechanism could only be applied to assets involved in criminal proceedings. As a result, the US authorities are currently legally unable to actually seize the frozen assets.
The White House is unlikely to be interested in the enactment of new laws that would limit its room for maneuver in potential bargaining with Russia, according to the expert: ""Therefore, the bill may be passed by Congress, but the president will have broad discretion in how to implement it. Although this scenario is not ideal, because each new president can interpret and execute the legislation in their own unique way, and the law itself would be extremely tough to repeal,"" he said.
Artem Sokolov, a researcher at the Center for European Studies at Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO University), told Vedomosti that the EU countries are taking a more cautious approach. ""We are talking about very large assets; caution is logical and understandable, as well as fear of Russia's reaction,"" he said. The expert emphasized that the benefit to the EU from confiscation is only considerable in the short term, and that in the medium and long term, it may raise concerns about the European market's reliability for large players such as India, China and the Arab states.
Victoria Zhuravleva, director of the Center for North American Studies at the Russian Academy of Sciences’ Institute of World Economy and International Relations (IMEMO RAS), stressed that until Republicans and Democrats agree on how to tackle the festering immigration crisis on the United States' southern border, the possibility of this bill getting beyond preliminary approval by congressional committees is minimal.

Gas production in Russia fell by 5.5% in 2023 to 636.7 bln cubic meters, according to an article by Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak in Energy Policy magazine. However, in December, production grew by 3.8% to 63 bln cubic meters. According to Kommersant, Gazprom's output declined by around 9% year on year to 404 bln cubic meters, mainly due to a drop in shipments to Europe, while overall pipeline gas exports fell by one quarter. The government anticipates a recovery in output in 2024 as a result of increasing exports from Gazprom to Asia and the start of the first line at Novatek’s new liquified natural gas (LNG) plant.
The production of ""other producers,"" including Gazprom, reached around 404 bln cubic meters in 2023, which is 9.2% lower than the year before. Gazprom's exports continued to decline due to the loss of the European market. The gas giant aims to compensate for the loss of the European market by increasing supplies to China and Central Asia.
Russia’s largest independent gas producer, Novatek, increased production by 0.3% in 2023 to 82.39 bln cubic meters. Gas production at other big oil companies is still declining, most likely as a result of the OPEC+ deal, Kommersant writes.
The past year's results were largely expected, according to Sergey Kondratiev of the Institute of Energy and Finance. ""Although in recent months production has been growing in annual terms, at the end of the year we still saw a slight decline associated with the high base effect in the first half of the year,"" he told Kommersant. According to the expert, Gazprom's dynamics as a result of reduced exports contributed the most to the overall decline. At the same time, the expert believes that 2023 generally exceeded expectations, and that the recovery in production will continue in 2024, as domestic demand remains high and supplies to China and the CIS countries increase. According to his projections, by the end of 2024, production may reach 650-655 bln cubic meters.

The US and British military forces carried out 18 airstrikes on the territory of Yemen in the early hours of Tuesday, a military spokesman for the rebel Houthi movement Ansar Allah, Yahya Saria, has said.
On his social network X page he claimed that the Yemeni capital city Sanaa was hit by a total of 12 airstrikes. Three more were carried out in Hodeidah province, 2 in Taiz province, and 1 in al-Bayda province.
He also vowed that ""these attacks will not go unanswered.""
On Tuesday night, the US and Britain attacked Houthi military facilities in several Yemeni provinces. According to a joint statement by Australia, Bahrain, Britain, Canada, the Netherlands and the US, the allied forces carried out eight strikes on Ansar Allah positions, their main target being the rebels' underground warehouses and facilities related to missile launches and air surveillance.
The strikes were the first joint US-British operation since January 12. The US has independently attacked Yemeni rebel positions several times over the ten days since then. On January 12, US and British forces, using aircraft, ships, and submarines, first hit Ansar Allah targets in a number of Yemeni cities, including Sanaa and Hodeidah, including the Houthis’ missile and drone sites and radar stations.
Following the escalation of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict in the Gaza Strip, the Houthis said they would attack Israeli territory and prevent associated ships from passing through the Red Sea and the Bab el-Mandeb Strait until the operation in the Palestinian enclave was halted. The US military's Central Command estimates that the Houthis have attacked more than 20 civilian vessels since mid-November 2023."

""Venezuela has built peace, guaranteeing security without reprisals and ensuring respect for the people. We acted on our own based on the national doctrine and we did it without the US Drug Enforcement Administration, which we expelled from our country,"" the Venezuelan president noted.
""There are two models - a Latin American model that we can build and a model based on dependence and the intervention of the gringos, who come to seize a country’s wealth.

Western democracies prefer to keep quiet and turn a blind eye to the Kiev’s regime’s crimes in the wake of American journalist and blogger Gonzalo Lira’s death in a Ukrainian prison, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Monday.
Earlier this month, the US Department of State confirmed reports that reporter and blogger Gonzalo Lira had died in a Ukrainian prison.
""Did anyone in the West, particularly in the United States, come out with a proper statement [at the state level] here? The answer is certainly ‘No.’ Even today, Western delegations and representatives of the Kiev regime are unlikely to find the courage to make any comments in regard to this monstrous crime on behalf of [Ukrainian President Vladimir] Zelensky and his clique,"" Lavrov added.
Russia’s top diplomat added that instead of hearing frank comments that condemn the West’s alleged assassination of the journalist, the talk is only ""about Russia’s aggression and further assurances to back up the Kiev regime.""
In October 2023, Lira fell ill with bilateral pneumonia while in jail. This follows from a note the journalist wrote, provided by his father Gonzalo Lira Sr. to the American news outlet The Grayzone.
Lira Sr. previously published a photo of the note. According to the journalist’s father, the prison administration ignored the fact of his son’s illness and tried to hide it from the journalist's family and lawyers. Lira Sr. demanded that the American Embassy in Kiev intervene in the situation. However, according to him, the diplomatic mission made no efforts in this direction.
Last spring, Russia urged the global journalistic community to come to the defense of Lira, who was abducted by the Ukrainian Security Service (SBU), and demand his immediate release. The SBU detained the blogger in Kharkov in May 2023 for supporting Russia’s special military operation in Ukraine."

Russia is rapidly increasing gas exports to China via the Power of Siberia pipeline, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak wrote in his article for the Energy Policy magazine.
""The reorientation of Russian gas exports to new markets continues, with a focus on strengthening cooperation with Asia-Pacific countries. We are rapidly increasing gas exports to China via the Power of Siberia pipeline, the Far Eastern route project with a capacity of 10 bln cubic meters of gas per year is being implemented, and the Power of Siberia 2 gas pipeline project through Mongolia with a capacity of 50 bln cubic meters of gas per year is also in the works,"" he stated.
At the same time, in order to accelerate construction of new transportation infrastructure facilities, the Russian government has simplified the procedures for approving a portion of the work in the design and construction of major gas and oil pipelines, according to the Deputy Prime Minister.
Gazprom reported earlier that in 2023, it would increase gas supplies to China via the Power of Siberia 1.5-fold to 22.7 bln cubic meters, which is 700 mln cubic meters more than contractual requirements.
The Power of Siberia gas pipeline is anticipated to reach its intended capacity of 38 bln cubic meters by 2025. Furthermore, Gazprom's total export volume to China will reach 48 bln cubic meters per year in the coming years due to the implementation of a project for gas supplies to China along the Far Eastern route, and nearly 100 bln cubic meters per year including the transit gas pipeline through Mongolia, according to Gazprom CEO Alexey Miller.
At the same time, Miller later stated that China is considering boosting Russian gas supplies through the Power of Siberia above the design capacity of 38 bln cubic meters, and that such an agreement may be concluded soon."

""A technical and economic analysis of construction has been carried out on the promising gas pipeline Power of Siberia 2, during which its resource base and preliminary technological parameters have been determined.

Novak also noted that Russia is rapidly increasing gas exports to China via the Power of Siberia pipeline. ""The reorientation of Russian gas exports to new markets continues, with a focus on strengthening cooperation with Asia-Pacific countries.

Gazprom reported earlier that in 2023, it would increase gas supplies to China via the Power of Siberia 1.5-fold to 22.7 bln cubic meters, which is 700 mln cubic meters more than contractual requirements.
The Power of Siberia gas pipeline is anticipated to reach its intended capacity of 38 bln cubic meters by 2025. Furthermore, Gazprom's total export volume to China will reach 48 bln cubic meters per year in the coming years due to the implementation of a project for gas supplies to China along the Far Eastern route, and nearly 100 bln cubic meters per year including the transit gas pipeline through Mongolia, according to Gazprom CEO Alexey Miller.
At the same time, Miller later stated that China is considering boosting Russian gas supplies through the Power of Siberia above the design capacity of 38 bln cubic meters, and that such an agreement may be concluded soon."

""Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken pressed Israeli officials about allowing Gaza aid through the port of Ashdod when he was in Tel Aviv earlier this month, according to one U.S. official.

From Ashdod, it would then be transported to Kerem Shalom, the Israeli border crossing through which aid has been allowed into Gaza, a European official said,"" the newspaper reported.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has repeatedly stated that the capacity of the Kerem Shalom and Rafah checkpoints is not enough to meet the needs of the population of the Palestinian enclave and solve the humanitarian catastrophe.
The situation in the Middle East sharply worsened after the infiltration of Hamas militants from the Gaza Strip into Israeli territory on October 7, 2023, which was accompanied by the killing of residents of border settlements and the taking of hostages. In response, Israel announced a complete blockade of Gaza and began shelling the strip and certain areas of Lebanon and Syria, after which it launched a ground operation in the enclave.

""We see what has been happening on the territory of Transnistria since the introduction of customs duties by Moldova. There have been mass rallies and protests. This causes a very big annoyance in society and can lead to consequences in the Security Zone (dividing line along the Dniester - TASS),"" Belyakov said.
According to him, the Transnistrian side expressed its concerns in a message to Moldovan representatives, accusing Chisinau of violating the 1992 agreement on the principles of a peace settlement of the conflict. In it, the conflicting sides pledged not to resort to sanctions, blockades, restrictions on the movement of people, goods and cargo.
Earlier, Transnistrian authorities accused Moldova of restricting the supply of medicines and medical equipment, as well as blocking the export of a number of enterprises. Starting this year, Chisinau began charging duties on goods being delivered to Transnistria through the Moldovan territory. Transnistrian President Vadim Krasnoselsky told TASS that the damage to Transnistrian companies would amount to tens of millions of dollars a year, while the restrictions would affect prices inside the self-proclaimed republic and other economic indicators.

Besides, the president is also set to chair a meeting on the region’s social and economic development and meet with regional Governor Anton Alikhanov.

""Of course, [security] measures were taken this time, too. Every effort was made to ensure the safety of the head of state,"" Peskov assured.
The Kaliningrad Region is separated from the rest of Russia by European Union countries.

Houthi rebels from the Yemeni Ansar Allah movement have attacked the Ocean Jazz ship identified as belonging to the US Navy in the Gulf of Aden, the movement’s military spokesperson Yahya Sarea said.
""The Yemeni naval forces conducted an operation in the Gulf of Aden against the US Ocean Jazz military cargo ship, which was attacked with anti-ship missiles,"" he wrote on his X (formerly known as Twitter) page.
According to the spokesman, the attack was staged in response to the US and UK strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen. He warned that the Houthis would continue their attacks to prevent Israeli ships from calling at Palestinian ports until ""the aggression against the Palestinian people and the blockade of the Gaza Strip are ended.""
According to Marine Traffic, a maritime analytics provider, the US-flagged Ocean Jazz heavy load carrier left the Rota naval base in Cadiz, Spain on January 5. The last time it reported its location was on January 18 when it was near Egypt’s Hurghada in the northern part of the Red Sea. The online service does not provide data about the ship’s owner, operator or destination.
Following the escalation of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict in the Gaza Strip, the Houthis warned that they would launch strikes on Israeli territory while barring ships associated with the Jewish state from passing through the waters of the Red Sea and the Bab el-Mandeb Strait until Tel Aviv ceased its military operation against Palestinian radical group Hamas in the embattled enclave. According to the US Defense Department’s Central Command’s (CENTCOM) estimates, the Yemeni rebel group has attacked more than 20 vessels and civilian ships in the Red Sea since mid-November.
On January 12, US and British aircraft, ships and submarines for the first time attacked targets belonging to the Ansar Allah movement in a number of Yemeni cities, including Sana’a and Hodeidah. US President Joe Biden claimed that the attack came in direct response to unprecedented Houthi attacks in the Red Sea. The US administration said that the strikes targeted the launch sites of rockets and unmanned aerial vehicles, as well as radar stations belonging to the Houthi rebels. Since then, the United States has been regularly striking Houthi missile launchers in Yemen. Following the January 12 operation, the United Kingdom said it was not planning to deliver more strikes."

The Turkish government is taking a cautious approach to media reports that the US plans to withdraw its military contingent from Syria, while Ankara does see a general striving by Washington to exit not only Syria but the entire Middle East region, the Hurriyet newspaper writes.
Foreign Policy magazine reported earlier this week, citing sources in the State Department and Pentagon, that the White House is no longer interested in continuing the US mission in Syria, which it regards as unnecessary. There is a discussion in the US administration on when and how the troops may be withdrawn, although no final decision on the issue has been made yet, according to the publication. Later, the White House denied this information in a commentary to Al Arabiya television.
With no official statements made or specific steps announced, a reserved approach should be taken to reports on US plans to pull its troops out of the region, the Turkish publication wrote, citing sources in the Turkish Defense Ministry. At the same time, however, it is known that the US is considering such a move, Hurriyet said. ""The US realizes that it has been dragged into the Middle Eastern quagmire by Israel and Iran, and that by offering full-throated support to Israel, particularly after the attack by Hamas [from the Gaza Strip] on Israel, it has effectively been caught in a trap. This process has begun spreading across the entire territory form the Red Sea to Pakistan. Given this, the US has started searching for ways to resolve [the problem],"" Hurriyet columnist Abdulkadir Selvi wrote.
The Turkish authorities have repeatedly accused the US of favoring and providing help to the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK, banned and declared a terrorist organization by Ankara) and its Syrian division, the People's Defense Units (YPG), whose militants attack Turkish military posts in northern Syria and Iraq. Ankara claims that such a policy contradicts the ostensibly allied relationship between the US and Turkey.
The Turkish authorities cite the PKK and YPG as the main threats to the country’s national security. The Turkish army has been carrying out operations in northern Syria against Kurdish militants since 2015, and has maintained a large troop contingent on Turkey’s border with Syria."

Hungary is opposed to providing Ukraine with 5 bln euros in military aid from the European Peace Facility (EPF), an off-budget European Union (EU) funding mechanism, over the next few years, and is expecting ""fierce debates"" on the matter at the upcoming Brussels summit of EU leaders on February 1, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said en route to a meeting with his EU colleagues in the Belgian capital.
""This is the first time this year that the EU Foreign Affairs Council is meeting. There are, of course, two major security challenges on the agenda that threaten our continent: the war in Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East. There will be fierce debates, as unfortunately the pro-war party in Brussels still suggests that we commit ourselves to supplying weapons to Ukraine for many years to come, so far for 5 bln (!) euros,"" the foreign minister wrote on his page on Facebook (banned in Russia due to its ownership by Meta, a designated extremist organization).
Budapest earlier stated that it would not support the allocation of yet another tranche of military aid to Ukraine in the sum of 500 mln euros from the EPF as long as the current situation surrounding top Hungarian lender OTP Bank remains unresolved. The bank had been listed by Ukraine as being among the ""international sponsors of [the Ukraine] war,"" but was later removed from Kiev’s blacklist. Budapest is now seeking guarantees from Kiev that such blacklisting of OTP Bank or other Hungarian companies will not recur in the future. Furthermore, Hungary does not endorse providing Ukraine with 50 bln euros in financial aid from the EU budget for 2024-2027, and instead is proposing that such assistance be provided gradually and with strict controls over how the funds are spent.
Szijjarto thinks that, ""while the year is new, the war hysteria is the same."" He believes ""the last few days and weeks have repeatedly proven this war to have no solution on the battlefield and that only the death toll and the scale of destruction are growing."" ""The longer the war goes on, the more severe the casualties will be. How could this not be understood,"" the foreign minister added.
He also recalled that the EU foreign ministers were planning to discuss the situation in the Middle East in Brussels. ""I hope that sooner rather than later we will come to a point where everyone realizes that the success of the counter-terrorism operation serves the interests not just of Israel, but of the entire world. We must ensure that no terrorist attack such as the one that ravaged Israel in early October will ever happen again anywhere in the world,"" said Szijjarto."

The Taiwanese military said on X on January 25 that six vessels and 18 aerial vehicles belonging to the PLA had been detected around the island.
Taiwan has been governed by its local administration since 1949 when the remaining Kuomintang forces led by Chiang Kai-shek (1887-1975) fled to the island after suffering a defeat in China’s civil war. Since then, Taiwan has preserved the flag and some other symbols of the Republic of China that had existed in mainland China before the Communists came to power. According to Beijing’s official position supported by most countries, including Russia, the island of Taiwan is one of China’s provinces."
KPDBRQ7A07_9U2MMX8SDU8KNXY,"Press review: UNSC meets as Kiev steps up civilian attacks and DeSantis quits, Trump gains",_,_,20240123,tass.com,https://tass.com/pressreview/1735881,"MOSCOW, January 23. /TASS/. The United Nations Security Council held a meeting to discuss Ukraine as Kiev’s forces step up their lethal attacks on civilian targets; Florida Governor Ron DeSantis’ withdrawal from the US presidential race gives a major boost to former President Donald Trump’s chances of sweeping the Republican primaries; and China is increasingly competing with the US in Latin America, which Washington has traditionally deemed its exclusive ""backyard."" These stories topped Tuesday’s newspaper headlines across Russia.

The US and its allies will continue to provide weapons to Kiev despite the Ukrainian army’s use of Western-made ammunition in strikes on civilians, said experts interviewed by Izvestia. On January 22, the UN Security Council held a meeting at Russia’s request, which took place right after another Ukrainian terrorist attack on civilians in Donetsk. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov represented Russia at the meeting.
Moscow’s mission to the UN announced plans to hold an extraordinary meeting on the Ukraine issue a few days after residential areas in the borderline Russian city of Belgorod had come under fire on December 30. The Ukrainian attack killed at least 25 civilians and left over 100 wounded. Just one day before the top Russian diplomat’s address to the UN, the Ukrainian armed forces carried out a strike on an open-air market in Donetsk. According to the latest reports, 27 civilians were killed and 30 suffered wounds. Lavrov pointed out that Kiev’s Western sponsors were largely to blame for these developments.
According to UN estimates, more than 14,000 civilians have been affected by the conflict since February 2022 and at least 10,000 have been killed. However, experts emphasize that the fact that Ukrainian forces are using Western weapons to launch attacks on civilians will not give the US and its allies any pause nor will it cause them to cease providing lethal assistance to Kiev. ""We should not expect the West to recognize its mistakes and change its behavior,"" Vladimir Bruter, an expert with the International Institute for Humanitarian and Political Studies, said.
Kiev will continue to receive military support as the West’s proxy because the West still has no intention of conceding to Russia on the battlefield, Alexey Fenenko, professor with the Department of International Security at Moscow State University’s Faculty of World Politics, stressed. Experts point out that the West is interested in resolving the conflict in Ukraine, but only under a scenario where Kiev remains fully capable of carrying out strikes against Russia.

Now that Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has announced his withdrawal from the race for the Republican Party nomination for this November’s US presidential election, former President Donald Trump and former South Carolina Governor and US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley remain the only two GOP presidential hopefuls standing. The two rivals will go head-to-head on January 23 when the bellwether state of New Hampshire holds its first-in-the-nation Republican primary election, Vedomosti writes.
Pavel Dubravsky, political strategist and head of Dubravsky Consulting, sees Trump’s advantage in the fact that his electoral base is similar to that of DeSantis. The Florida governor’s supporters view Haley as part of the party establishment that both Trump and DeSantis have opposed. So far, Trump is regarded as the favorite in the upcoming primaries, the political strategist stressed. ""Haley has a chance of achieving a good result but she will hardly beat the ex-president,"" Dmitry Suslov, deputy director of the Center for Comprehensive European and International Studies at the Higher School of Economics (HSE University), pointed out.
DeSantis’ decision to pull out of the race is highly likely to mean that the party establishment that bet on him has given up on finding a viable ""Never Trump"" alternative contender and accepted that Trump is the only possible candidate. ""The party has gone Trumpist. The credit goes to Trump himself as he has been working hard with the party for two years,"" Vladimir Vasilyev, senior research fellow at the Russian Academy of Sciences’ Institute for US and Canadian Studies, told Nezavisimaya Gazeta.
""Trump’s opponents can now only hope for a miracle, wishing for Haley to give him a fight and win. The New Hampshire primary will show whether those hopes are justified. If the bet on Haley fails, there will be no way to stop Trump but to get rid of him in a non-political way, that is, through a court ruling. However, it’s very dangerous because the entire political system may break down,"" Vasilyev noted. The expert believes there is a distinct possibility that the Democrats may try to find a replacement for President Joe Biden at the top of their party ticket, as the incumbent chief executive and his administration’s favorability ratings continue to sink in public opinion polls. Or, they may move to dump unpopular incumbent Vice President Kamala Harris in favor of a fresh face with a higher popularity rating in the No. 2 spot as Biden’s running mate, who could well end up being president should the 81-year-old Biden win re-election. Such desperate electoral stratagems by the Democratic Party establishment would not come without major risks, but there seem to be no risk-free ways left to bring Trump down.

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s visit to Jamaica and Brazil is a sign of the practical implementation of Beijing’s strategy for expanding commodity imports from Latin America and enhancing its political influence in the region, Nezavisimaya Gazeta writes.
Jamaica was the last stop on Wang’s ten-day tour of Africa and Latin America. The trip, which began in Egypt on January 13, also included Tunisia, Togo, Ivory Coast and Brazil. China’s top diplomat always visits Africa at the beginning of the year. This time, Brazil and Jamaica were added to his itinerary. American experts point out with irritation that Beijing’s diplomatic activity is aimed at undermining Washington’s position on the South American continent, over which it once proclaimed exclusive suzerainty under the Monroe Doctrine, which stipulated that the countries of the ""Old World"" must not meddle in Washington’s Latin American ""backyard."" While China is certainly not an Old World nation, it has grown so powerful that its presence in the region is becoming dangerous for US interests.
Andrey Karneyev, head of the School of Asian Studies at the Higher School of Economics (HSE University), notes that, ""in its policies, China pays much attention to the countries of the Global South."" ""Beijing believes that it can rely on them in case of increasing tensions with the US, Japan and the European Union. It is an important means of strengthening Beijing’s positions in terms of foreign policy and trade. Particularly because the West is lagging far behind China regarding the size of investment in infrastructure projects in the Third World. This also goes for Latin America. Notably, the newly elected Argentinian president, [Javier Milei], who is pro-American, initially planned to cut economic ties with China but later changed his mind,"" the expert explained.
Alexander Lukin, research director at the Russian Academy of Sciences’ Institute of China and Contemporary Asia, says that Being is betting on South America’s economic heavyweights such as Brazil. As for political influence, China has consistently said that it does not interfere in the domestic affairs of other countries. Unlike the Americans, Beijing does not have a program for ""defending democracy,"" which also makes the Chinese preferable partners for most countries in Latin America.

Budapest will not participate in funding a new European Union compensation fund for weapons supplies to Kiev, nor in making such supplies itself, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said, thereby confirming a Wall Street Journal report of Brussels’ new plan to provide military assistance to Ukraine, Vedomosti writes.
Officials have not yet commented on the EU’s new initiative. However, according to the WSJ, the EU’s External Action Service has developed a plan to create a new fund worth $22 bln to provide military aid to Kiev. It will absorb the funds of the European Peace Facility (EPF), which paid compensation to the countries sending weapons and ammunition to Ukraine. The practice actually stopped in 2023 due to disagreements between EU members and the exhaustion of weapons stocks in some countries. The new fund is also expected to pay compensation to the nations helping Kiev, while its structure will make it possible to avoid the type of regular payments that Hungary used as a lever to put pressure on Kiev.
The EU is forced to establish new funds because of uncertainty about the future of US policy toward Ukraine, said Andrey Kortunov, academic director of the Russian International Affairs Council (RIAC). Brussels is seeking to create mechanisms that would be as independent as possible from the existing state of affairs, he pointed out. With every EU member currently capable of blocking such decisions single-handedly, Brussels’ desire to create a reserve within an autonomous fund - preferably based on an existing one - is logical and understandable. ""These measures cannot be taken without bargaining and compromises. There will be debate about individual contributions; additional EU spending and other conflicts are possible. At this point, Kiev can expect financial aid from rich EU donors such as Germany and France, among others,"" the expert emphasized.
EU countries still have resources left to support Ukraine, said Denis Denisov, an expert at the Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation. However, a growing number of EU members are becoming cautious about providing assistance to Kiev, showing fatigue with the ongoing Ukraine conflict, Denisov noted. According to him, the high level of corruption in Ukraine is one of the reasons. In addition, more and more people in EU countries are coming to think that further support for Kiev is not a good idea. ""However, it doesn’t mean that support will stop all of a sudden. There will be ways to get around dissenters like Hungary,"" the expert concluded.

Russian companies boosted coal supplies to Southeast Asian countries by 47% in 2023, Vedomosti writes, citing data from analytical firm Kpler. In particular, Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia ramped up Russian coal imports.
Russian coal supplies to Southeast Asia are rising as companies are redirecting exports to new markets following the European Union’s embargo. According to Kpler statistics, Russia also increased coal exports to China, India and Turkey in 2023. In total, Asia’s share in Russian coal exports grew from 84% in 2022 to 95% in 2023, while Europe’s share dropped from 11% to 1%, Kpler data shows.
Kirill Rodionov, an independent energy expert, believes that demand for thermal coal is most likely to rise in China and India, while demand for coking coal will grow the most in India. The country lags far behind China in terms of the level of urbanization, which is why it will increase the consumption of steel.
As for Southeast Asia, most countries there are actively developing the coal energy sector so the region looks very promising for the export of power-generating coal, Finam analyst Yelena Yushkova pointed out. Indonesia purchases energy from Russia to compensate for the lost volumes on a number of markets, particularly in Europe, which is why the country’s domestic production may be insufficient to meet its own needs, the expert explained. According to Yushkova’s estimates, Russia can export coal to almost all Southeast Asian nations as its low cost allows exporters to offer a discount of up to 50% from the market price. The analyst believes that Russian supplies to the region this year may grow by 10% compared to 2023.

Houthi attacks on ships in the Red Sea will stop when the conflict in the Gaza Strip is ended, Majed al-Ansari, Qatari foreign ministry spokesman, said.
""We support all regional efforts to reduce escalation,"" he told a news conference in Doha, commenting on the situation around the safety of navigation in the Red Sea. ""We say once again that this problem began after the escalation in the occupied [Palestinian] territories, hence, it will be over when this escalation ends, first of all when the war there ends.""
Following the escalation of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict in the Gaza Strip, the Houthis warned that they would launch strikes on Israeli territory while barring ships associated with the Jewish state from passing through the waters of the Red Sea and the Bab el-Mandeb Strait until Tel Aviv ceased its military operation against Palestinian radical group Hamas in the embattled enclave.
On January 12, US and British aircraft, ships and submarines for the first time attacked targets belonging to the Ansar Allah movement in a number of Yemeni cities, including Sana’a and Hodeidah. The strikes targeted the launch sites of rockets and unmanned aerial vehicles, as well as radar stations belonging to the Houthi rebels.
In the early hours on Tuesday, the US and UK attacked Houthi facilities in several Yemeni provinces. According to a joint statement by Australia, Bahrain, Britain, Canada, the Netherlands and the US, the allied forces carried out eight strikes on Ansar Allah positions, their main target being the rebels' underground warehouses and facilities related to missile launches and air surveillance. The strikes were the first joint US-British operation since January 12. The US has independently attacked Yemeni rebel positions several times over the ten days since then."

The novel coronavirus pathogen has exhausted its pandemic potential, although new variants of the virus may still emerge, a prominent Russian epidemiologist has told TASS.
Dr. Gennady Onishchenko, member of the Russian Academy of Sciences and Vice President of the Russian Academy of Education, said the virus’ ability to mutate has caused several serious waves of the infection globally in the past.
""New strains may emerge. It [the virus] is constantly mutating, but, based on all indications, the coronavirus has already exhausted its pandemic potential,"" Onishchenko said.
One of the sessions of the World Economic Forum, held in Davos between January 15 and 19, was headlined ‘Preparing for Disease X.’ It focused on preparations for a pandemic and caused a serious debate in the media and on social networks. WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the notion of ‘disease X’ has been used since 2018 to denote a hypothetical unknown disease, not a concrete infection.
Head of Russia’s Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and Human Wellbeing Anna Popova said discussion on the so-called ‘disease X’ was a part of routine work of healthcare experts, whose task is to examine and study all possible variants of a hypothetical pandemic."

The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe should not put Ukraine at the forefront of its agenda to the detriment of other areas in its activity, Russian Permanent Representative to the OSCE Alexander Lukashevich said.
""Total Ukrainianization of the OSCE agenda and activities to the detriment of work on other tracks is absolutely inadmissible,"" the Russian diplomat told a special meeting of the OSCE Permanent Council.
Earlier, the new OSCE Chairperson-in-Office and Malta's Minister of Foreign and European Affairs Jan Borg said in his inauguration speech that Ukraine would become one of the priority areas of the agency’s activity.
In this regard, Lukashevich pointed out that the OSCE leadership must act ""in the public domain fully in line with consensually agreed approaches.""
""Now in your speech you have gone beyond this framework, violating the above mentioned decision. This needs to be corrected,"" the permanent representative added.
The diplomat urged taking an objective look at the current state of affairs. ""Pretending that freedom and democracy are flourishing in Ukraine today and that civilian casualties from the use of weapons supplied there by NATO countries simply do not exist means deceiving oneself and the international community,"" Lukashevich said."

The West is going all out against Russia, as evidenced by the current holding of the largest-ever NATO exercise, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said.
""The strategy of deterring our country, of putting pressure on it, has not gone anywhere. Sometimes it escalates, sometimes it subsides. Now it is probably at its peak. Such exercises are the best proof of this,"" he said on Channel One.
Peskov pointed out that the West holds a very clear anti-Russian position, which is determined by NATO, while the alliance's rhetoric ""is determined across the ocean, in Washington.""
The Kremlin spokesman was asked about the West's policy in the context of today's visit of Russian President Vladimir Putin to the Kaliningrad Region. Commenting on the situation in the region, Peskov noted that ""Kaliningrad is an integral part of Russia,"" and it is important for the authorities to keep the entire region's life support system in a workable condition.
""There are certainly dangers present, merely in strategic terms. You see what militaristic moods prevail now in Europe, in the neighboring Baltics and so on.

A special expert group will reveal in 2-3 days results of its investigation into the crash Russia’s Il-76 transport military aircraft which was allegedly downed by the Ukrainian military, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday.
""All fragments that could have caused the [fatal] destruction have been recovered from the scene. They point to the fact that the aircraft was shot down by an air-defense rocket,"" Putin said.
""This incident should be either attributed to their poor [Air Defense] training or their incompetence of handling such systems,"" the Russian president said. ""Most likely the strike was delivered by a US system Patriot system but even more likely by a French-made air-defense system.""

""The maneuvers [of Exercise Steadfast Defender 2024] are openly provocative in nature. For several months, a 90,000-strong group of forces from 31 NATO member countries, as well as Sweden, will be actively operating near Russian borders on the territory from Norway to Romania.

According to the Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman, NATO does not hide the fact that during the drills ""tasks to repel <...> the Russian threat"" will be practiced.

Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Rafael Grossi believes that risks to the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) may sometimes be close to ten on a ten-point scale.
When asked where would ZNPP stand on a scale of 1 to 10, with ten being the most dangerous and one being secure, Grossi replied: ""There are days when you are near ten, and there are days when nothing seems to happen. And the problem is this: the complete uncertainty.""
He added that the security situation in the area was volatile.
When asked to comment on the implications of a meltdown at ZNPP, Grossi said that given that core temperatures of may reach ""hundreds of degrees,"" so ""degradation of the reactor’s protective system"" is possible without proper cooling.
""Then you have the dissemination of radioactive material in the atmosphere. This is what happened in Chernobyl. <…> This was the case in Fukushima, where after the earthquake <…> there was a tsunami and emergency diesel generators disappeared,"" he said.
That is why the IAEA constantly emphasizes the importance of uninterrupted power supply to the nuclear power plant, he added. In the official’s words, the ZNPP has two external power supply lines at this point, and has to rely on diesel generators when these lines are cut off.
""We are walking on very-very thin ice,"" he said.
Located in Energodar, the Zaporozhye nuclear facility, with roughly 6GW of capacity, is the largest of its kind in Europe. Russia took control of the plant on February 28, 2022, in the first days of its special military operation in Ukraine. Since then, units of the Ukrainian army have periodically shelled both residential districts in nearby Energodar as well as the premises of the nuclear plant itself, by means of drones, heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems.
Over the past two years, the ZNPP was disconnected from external power sources eight times."

Russia has evidence that the United States has declared its readiness to start withdrawing its military contingent from Iraq, Russia’s special presidential representative for the Syrian settlement, Alexander Lavrentyev, has said.
""As far as we know, the US side has declared its readiness to meet the demands of Iraq and to start withdrawing the US military contingent,"" said Lavrentyev following the 21st international meeting on Syria on the Astana platform. It is difficult to judge how realistic this is, though. This process may last long, even years.""
""The Americans, as you can see in many countries, get in very easily, regardless of the opinion of the leadership of certain countries, ostensibly for fighting terrorism. A very fashionable pretext this is. But getting out proves far more difficult,"" Lavrentyev added.
He recalled that the only country from which the Americans withdrew very quickly was Afghanistan.
""But there was a threat of physical impact on the representatives of the American expeditionary corps present there. They were forced to get out of there virtually in no time, in coordination with the Taliban (the Taliban movement is banned in Russia - TASS),"" he pointed out.
""In all likelihood, the same may happen on the territory of Iraq, and on the territory of Syria. Whenever we contact our Kurdish colleagues we always tell them that it is necessary to negotiate, it is necessary to stay in touch with the central government, because you have to live together. You are a single state,"" Lavrentyev concluded.
Earlier, Reuters, citing sources, reported that the United States was ready to negotiate with the government the withdrawal of the international coalition it leads. The US ambassador to Iraq Alina Romanowski on Wednesday handed over a letter to Iraq’s Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein, in which the US expressed its readiness to initiate a dialogue with the Iraqi authorities on the withdrawal of the coalition and its replacement within the framework of bilateral relations. Such talks might take several months. It is not specified what kind of replacement was mentioned.
On January 5, Prime Minister Mohammed al-Sudani said that the excuses for the presence of the international coalition had been exhausted and Baghdad intended to take concrete steps to end the foreign military presence in the country. This happened after Abu Taqwa, one of the commanders of the Shiite Hezbollah al-Nujaba movement, was killed a day earlier and at least six other people were injured in the Iraqi capital in a US drone strike."

According to the report, ""the US and Iraq are close to agreement on starting the Higher Military Commission dialogue that was announced back in August."" The dialogue is aimed at determining concrete steps for the future withdrawal.
The report says that Washington wants the troop schedule to reflect the current situation in Iraq and the stability of its government and law enforcement agencies. In turn, the Iraqi leadership believes that the timeframe of the withdrawal should not be affected by any circumstances.
Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammad Shia al-Sudani said on January 5 that the international coalition has run out of justifications for its presence on the Iraqi soil, and Baghdad is set to take concrete measures to end foreign military presence in the country.
He also said that the Iraqi government was in the process of setting the date for the start of talks within the framework of a bilateral commission established to tackle the issue of foreign troops’ withdrawal.
The statement came after reports that a leader of the Harakat al-Nujaba movement, Abu Taqwa, was killed during a US drone strike on Baghdad.
In turn, the Pentagon said on January 8 that it was not planning to withdraw its troops from Iraq at this point. Currently, around 2,500 US servicemen are deployed at various bases in Iraq.

""Today’s strike specifically targeted a Houthi underground storage site and locations associated with the Houthis’ missile and air surveillance capabilities,"" reads the statement, published on the British government’s website.
These strikes, carried out by US and UK forces, with support from the abovementioned countries, aimed to ""disrupt and degrade the capabilities that the Houthis use to threaten global trade and the lives of innocent mariners, and are in response to a series of illegal, dangerous, and destabilizing Houthi actions since our coalition strikes on January 11, including anti-ship ballistic missile and unmanned aerial system attacks that struck two US-owned merchant vessels.""

""We are determined to continue expanding our cooperation with African countries,"" the Kremlin spokesman said.

The range of opportunities of our [bilateral] cooperation is far from being fully tapped; we have plenty of work ahead of us,"" he pointed out.
According to Peskov, the Russian-Chadian negotiations will first entail meetings between the full delegations of the respective sides, after which Mahamat Deby and Russian President Vladimir Putin will continue the dialogue during a working breakfast.
Peskov also recalled that the Chadian foreign minister had attended last July’s second Russia-Africa summit in St. Petersburg. The spokesman added that the meeting between the two countries’ leaders is a continuation of those that took place in St. Petersburg during the summit.
According to Peskov, other meetings will take place without press coverage.
The Kremlin press service reported earlier that the agenda will cover the prospects for further developing Russian-Chadian relations in various fields as well as regional and international issues.
This meeting will be the first between the two leaders. The Chadian president had initially planned to attend the Russia-Africa summit in St. Petersburg, but his visit was cancelled. Some diplomatic sources told TASS that Chad was put under extreme pressure by the West, and so the country ultimately was compelled to downgrade the degree of its engagement. In addition, a military coup d’etat occurred in neighboring Niger at the same time, and so Mahamat Deby visited the Nigerien capital of Niamey as part of a diplomatic mission. His father, Idriss Deby, who served as president of Chad in 1990-2021, attended the first Russia-Africa summit in 2019 in Sochi."
TH6GO0FUWB_D53KMALWLG9B0V7,Rumors about new pandemic due to Russian permafrost development are speculative — expert,_,_,20240126,tass.com,https://tass.com/economy/1737685,"MOSCOW, January 26. /TASS/. Recent claims about the beginning pandemic due to the release of viruses from Siberia's permafrost are speculative. A new pandemic's risks are much higher from viruses circulating among animals, Deputy Director of the Pasteur St. Petersburg Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology Vladimir Dedkov told TASS.
Earlier, The Guardian, referring to European scientists, wrote the Arctic ice shrinking would favor shipping traffic and forecasted the beginning of industrial development in Siberia's permafrost zone. Large-scale mining operations, the article said, would cause huge emissions of pathogenic microorganisms.
""The claims a new pandemic may occur due to viruses in Siberia's permafrost zone are speculation. Permafrost exists not only in Russia - it exists, for example, in Denmark on the Island of Greenland, or in the USA on the Alaska Peninsula, but those scientists are talking exclusively about Siberia and its development. From a political point of view, we are currently fighting for the Arctic shelf and the Northern Sea Route. Therefore, as part of this struggle, they come up with all sorts of stories to take control of something or to limit someone. Here I can see just an attempt to interfere with this country's internal affairs,"" he said, adding ""it is quite like a situation where people may as well encounter unknown viruses or microbes when cutting down forests in Amazon, where it has never been done, or in any other places where not a single human has set foot.""
From the scientific point of view, he continued, much more threatening are viruses circulating in modern animals. ""For example, some viruses of bats living in the Amazon forests, and of which we know nothing. When developing such territories, humans many contact animals or their waste products, which carry risks of infections,"" he added, stressing such a probability is tenfold higher than a contamination with viruses from the permafrost zone. ""This, in fact, is what we could observe on the example of the COVID-19 epidemic, Ebola, Marburg and so forth,"" the expert said.
As for the permafrost, over there contacts are more probable with dangerous bacteria, like, for example, with the causative agent of anthrax, rather than with viruses. ""Viruses have developed after multicellular organisms and they are unable to exist by themselves, as they need an organism in which they will reproduce,"" the scientist said. Additionally, distant ancestors of humans most likely have already encountered viruses that are in the permafrost, and ""have been selected for survival amid those viruses. Therefore, <...> our immune system is [most likely] ready for this,"" he added.
Russia has programs to study the Arctic region, the expert told TASS. For example, the Arctic Forum that has been held in St. Petersburg annually for many years discusses biosafety in that region. ""Scientists have been monitoring the ice melting, they study the composition of chemicals polluting the Arctic zone, as well as whatever biological objects found there - bacteria, viruses, and so on,"" he said, stressing the ongoing work in the Arctic features various ministries and agencies.
""Rospotrebnadzor (Russian consumer safety watchdog) also has been working on biosafety in the Arctic zone. Monitoring there continues permanently. There is no real threat to the Russian population, everything has been fully controlled and monitored,"" he said. Russia has sufficient knowledge, skills and technologies to ensure the country's biological safety and to protect the population from pathogens that potentially may be detected in the Arctic zone as well as beyond it."

Qatar has sent its proposed draft ceasefire deal to Israel and Palestine’s radical movement Hamas, Bloomberg reported citing sources familiar with the negotiations.
In their words, the plan envisages the release of all hostages held in the Gaza Strip. Israel, in turn, will release a number of Palestinian prisoners. The document also says that the amount of humanitarian aid delivered to the enclave should be increased.
Efforts aimed at reaching a ceasefire deal are hampered by Israel’s declared determination to continue its military operation in the Gaza Strip until the Hamas movement is entirely destroyed, the news agency reported.
Tensions flared up again in the Middle East on October 7 when militants from the Gaza Strip-based radical Palestinian movement Hamas staged a surprise attack on Israeli territory from Gaza, killing residents of Israeli border settlements and taking over 240 hostages, including women, children and the elderly. Hamas described its attack as a response to the aggressive actions of Israeli authorities against the Al-Aqsa Mosque on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem’s Old City. In response, Israel declared a total blockade of the Gaza Strip, home to 2.3 million Palestinians, and has been delivering air strikes on Gaza as well as some parts of Lebanon and Syria. Clashes are also underway in the West Bank. On December 1, the Israeli army accused Hamas of violating a ceasefire that had been in effect since November 24 and announced that it would resume fighting in Gaza.

One of the survivors of an airplane that crash-landed in Afghanistan, pilot Dmitry Belyakov, has blamed the incident on a technical malfunction that led to a fuel problem.
""The cause of the crash was a technical malfunction. In all likelihood, a problem with fuel. The presence of ice, which disrupted the flow from the main tanks to the feeder tanks,"" he told journalists.
Belyakov noted that the pilots had been taking measures to prepare the aircraft to make an emergency landing up until the very last minutes before being forced to crash-land.
""We were busy with emergency landing procedures; we determined the most favorable place where it could be landed, and we did find such a place, a flat mountain slope,"" he added.
""One of the crew members also spotted a local village. We saw it from the air when we started having problems. In the morning, we identified our location and the guy reached it and alerted the locals. The temperature in the mountains was about 15 degrees [Celsius] below freezing,"" the pilot recalls.
The father of the other pilot, Arkady Grachev, said that the landing of the plane in such adverse conditions was a miracle, which he attributed to the pilots’ skill.
""The airplane may be old. Wear and tear, you know. Inadequate fueling is a possibility. The experienced pilots say: The fact that they landed was a miracle. What kind of miracle? It's the pilots' job. This miracle was made possible by the pilots' hands. You have to find a place where to land. Let alone at dusk,"" the man told journalists at Moscow’s Vnukovo Airport.
The four people who survived the plane crash in Afghanistan - two pilots and two medics - were flown to Moscow on Friday. Their plane landed at Vnukovo Airport in the morning.
Grachev denied reports that the plane allegedly was carrying $1.2 mln.
""There was no money on board,"" he told the media in response to a related question.
""You should remember the mentality of the Afghan people. They came to help us and they had to be thanked somehow; we gave them some cash,"" the pilot explained.
Earlier, Afghan daily Hasht-e Subh, citing sources in the region, claimed that unknown persons had allegedly stolen about $1.2 mln from the Russian Falcon 10 airplane, which crash-landed in Afghanistan’s Badakhshan Province.
On the evening of January 20, radio contact with the Falcon 10 was lost. The plane disappeared from radars over an area on the border between Afghanistan and Tajikistan. Six people were on board the aircraft en route from Thailand to Moscow. Russia’s Investigative Committee has launched criminal proceedings.

A draft message to the National Assembly of France in connection with the participation of French mercenaries in the Kiev regime's crimes has been submitted to the State Duma. The document may be considered at the plenary session of the lower house of parliament on January 24, the head of the State Duma’s Committee on International Affairs Leonid Slutsky has told TASS.
""The Committee on International Affairs submits a draft address to the National Assembly of France. We propose to include it in the agenda of the plenary session of the State Duma on January 24,"" Slutsky said.
In the draft message (obtained by TASS), the legislators indicate that they address their French counterparts in connection with evidence data confirmed by the competent authorities and independent media testifying to the participation of French mercenaries in hostilities on the side of the criminal Kiev regime.
""Although Paris denies the participation of French mercenaries in the military conflict in Ukraine and mercenarism is prohibited by French law, objective information about losses sustained by neo-Nazi mercenary units reliably testifies to the contrary,"" the draft message reads.
The legislators note that Ukraine, through the efforts of Western Russophobes, has turned ""not only into an obedient tool of anti-Russian policies, but also into a large-scale military training ground where transnational companies - arms manufacturers - test their 'deadly goods,' and the military polish tactics and new forms of military confrontation.""
""While hypocritically professing support for the Ukrainians, Western politicians, including French politicians, go beyond all bounds of logic and common sense to further expand supplies to Kiev of the latest military hardware, which require instructors familiar with NATO weapons and ammunition for training in their use and maintenance,"" the draft reads.
Earlier, the Russian Defense Ministry said that the Russian army had carried out a surgical strike on a temporary deployment site of foreign militants, mostly Frenchmen, in Kharkov. More than 60 militants were killed and more than 20 wounded.
The French Foreign Ministry, when asked to comment on Russia’s statements, confined itself to stating there were no French mercenaries in Ukraine, without confirming or denying the very fact that its citizens had been killed.
French Armed Forces Minister Sebastien Lecornu said on January 19 that a democratic country was unable to ban its citizens who were not military personnel, from voluntarily going to Ukraine to fight on Kiev's side. He argued that the ban could not be enforced, if the persons in question were not military personnel and had no ties with French military institutions."

""A big portion of the details are agreed. The sticking point is the Israelis don’t want to agree to a permanent ceasefire,"" said a diplomat from a third country briefed on talks over the release of hostages in Gaza.
According to NBC News, US, Qatari and Egyptian officials continue to push for an agreement that would free the captives remaining in Gaza. Hamas is demanding the permanent halt of fighting, a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and the release of a large number of Palestinian prisoners.
The broadcaster points out, citing officials, that ""the mediators’ current proposal envisages releasing the hostages in three phases over 30 days.""
Earlier, the Wall Street Journal reported that the United States, Egypt and Qatar were pushing Israel and Hamas to make another hostage release deal. According to the plan, first, Hamas would release all civilian hostages and Israel would release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, withdraw forces from Gaza’s towns and cities, allow freedom of movement in the Gaza Strip and double the amount of aid going into the enclave. Later, Hamas would free female Israeli soldiers and turn over bodies, while Israel would release more Palestinians. A third phase would involve the release of Israeli soldiers, while Israel would redeploy some of its forces outside the Gaza Strip, the media outlet specified.
Tensions in the Middle East flared up again on October 7, 2023, after militants from the radical Palestinian group Hamas launched a surprise incursion into Israeli territory from the Gaza Strip, killing residents of border communities and taking people hostage.

According to al-Maliki, it is necessary to increase the international pressure on Israel in order to achieve a ceasefire, which will make it possible to deliver ever increasing volumes of humanitarian aid and will create an option to discuss the post-war future.
The situation in the Middle East sharply escalated following an incursion of Hamas militants from the Gaza Strip into Israel on October 7. Hamas has cast the attack as a response to Israeli actions against the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. Israel has declared a complete siege of the Gaza Strip and started a military operation there. Israel also strikes parts of Lebanon and Syria in retaliation for bombardments originating from these countries. Clashes are also taking place in the West Bank."

The foreign ministers of Venezuela and Guyana have confirmed, at a meeting in the Brazilian capital, Brasilia, their readiness to engage in a dialogue to resolve the neighboring South American countries’ longstanding territorial dispute, the G1 news portal reported, citing statements by the top diplomats.
""We give our assurances to the Venezuelan side that Guyana affirms its intention to peacefully address Venezuela’s territorial claims,"" Guyanese Foreign Minister Hugh Todd said following the meeting, which was mediated by his Brazilian counterpart, Mauro Vieira.
In turn, Venezuela’s top diplomat, Yvan Gil Pinto, said: ""Venezuela and the government of [President] Nicolas Maduro are ready to look for alternative ways that could enable us to come to a mutually acceptable agreement."" He described direct, face-to-face negotiations as the only way toward finding a peaceful and harmonious solution to the disputed region of Guyana Essequibo. ""We underlined the importance of preventing any foreign interference in the dispute and the need to consider Guyana’s position and actions regarding the non-demarcated maritime zone in order to ensure the compliance of conditions coordinated by our countries decades ago,"" Gil said. He also expressed his satisfaction with the talks he held with his Guyanese counterpart, adding that ""he is expecting much from future discussions.""
The two countries also established a joint high-level commission to work toward resolving their territorial dispute, Venezolana de Television reported. The meeting between the two foreign ministers, which was initiated by Brazil’s Vieira, was hosted by the Brazilian Foreign Ministry.
The dispute between Caracas and Georgetown over ownership of the 159,500 square kilometer territory west of the Essequibo River has been ongoing for over a century. The territorial dispute has been further aggravated by the discovery in 2015 of oil fields containing at least 10 bln barrels of oil and the granting by Guyana of a concession to oil major ExxonMobil for petroleum production on Guyana’s continental shelf, the boundaries of which have not been demarcated.
On December 14, Venezuela and Guyana agreed not to use force over their border dispute, following negotiations in Kingstown, capital of Caribbean island nation Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Both parties also committed to ensuring that Latin America remains a zone of peace and said that they would refrain from escalating the situation in the disputed border region."

A Bloomberg report alleging that Russia may lift its opposition to Ukraine’s bid to join NATO, or abandon its insistence that Kiev adopt neutrality, is absolutely untrue, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.
Earlier, Bloomberg reported that Russia is allegedly testing the waters on whether it can engage in talks with the United States for resolving the Ukraine crisis. In particular, two people familiar with the situation told the US news agency, Moscow may consider abandoning its opposition to Ukraine’s eventual NATO membership or drop its insistence on Kiev's neutral status.
""That is a bogus story. It has absolutely nothing to do with reality,"" Peskov said, commenting on yesterday’s Bloomberg report.
On December 14, Russian President Vladimir Putin said at the combined Direct Line Q&A session and year-end press conference that peace will arrive in Ukraine when Russia attains the goals of its special military operation, which he said remain unchanged."

A senior Ansar Allah (the Houthi) official has promised that the Houthis will not attack Russian, Chinese, and German ships in the Red Sea.
""Chinese and Russian ships are not in the crosshairs. They are not our targets. As well as German (vessels),"" Mohammed al-Bahiti, a member of the Ansar Allah politburo, said in an interview with the RTL and NTV television channels.
According to al-Bahiti, this applies to ships that are not linked with ""Israel’s Zionist regime.""
At the same time, according to NTV, the Houthi official said that the rebel movement would expand its military actions after the United States and United Kingdom’s strikes on targets in Yemen. ""Attacks are possible on warships as well,"" he warned.
""Our military operations will continue until the genocide in Gaza is stopped and until the population receives food, medicine, and fuel. Our goal is not to sink cargo ships but rather to force them to change their routes to increase companies’ economic losses,"" he explained, adding that this is meant to increase pressure on Israel.
""All countries must pool efforts with us to stop crimes <…> in Gaza. Our intentions are true,"" he stressed.
Following the escalation of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict in the Gaza Strip, the Houthis warned that they would launch strikes on Israeli territory while barring ships associated with the Jewish state from passing through the waters of the Red Sea and the Bab el-Mandeb Strait until Tel Aviv ceased its military operation against Palestinian radical group Hamas in the embattled enclave.
On January 12, US and British aircraft, ships and submarines for the first time attacked targets belonging to the Ansar Allah movement in a number of Yemeni cities, including Sana’a and Hodeidah. US President Joe Biden claimed that the attack came in direct response to unprecedented Houthi attacks in the Red Sea. The US administration said that the strikes targeted the launch sites of rockets and unmanned aerial vehicles, as well as radar stations belonging to the Houthi rebels."

The UN International Court of Justice in The Hague should legally classify Israel's actions against Palestinians during the military operation in the Gaza Strip as genocide, Russian Special Presidential Representative for Syria Alexander Lavrentyev said at a press conference following the 21st international Astana meeting on Syria.
""The tragic events in the Gaza Strip are inhumane,"" he said. ""When [there are] so many victims in a short time, including women and children, it is certainly a real crime. It can even be interpreted as genocide, although the corresponding legal basis should be provided by the International Court of Justice in The Hague, where South Africa has filed a lawsuit to recognize Israel's actions against the Palestinian people as genocide.""
According to the Russian envoy, the meeting participants focused on the situation in and around the Gaza Strip because ""the policy of permissiveness of the Israeli right-wing leadership could lead to extremely negative consequences for the entire Middle East region."" ""If the war in the Gaza Strip continues, it will inevitably spill over to Lebanon and to Syria, and if these countries are involved, other powers in the Middle East region will also suffer,"" he warned. ""I think no one wants this to happen. It must be prevented by all means possible.""
The only option to achieve a settlement is to ""address the issue of the formation of a Palestinian state immediately,"" Lavrentyev believes. ""Therefore, the international community will have to do very scrupulous work, as soon as possible, to persuade Israel to stop fighting in the Gaza Strip and actually come to the negotiating table with the Palestinians to talk over the issue of a two-state system,"" he emphasized.

Transnistria has accused Moldova’s authorities of whipping up tension following the detention of Tiraspol resident Anna Mamei at Chisinau airport and her subsequent deportation from Moldova.
""On January 22, 2024, Anna Mamei, a citizen of the Transnistrian Moldovan Republic and the chairperson of the Tiraspol City Court, who was on her way back to Transnistria, was deported by Moldovan law enforcement agencies. We consider Moldova’s actions to be a flagrant violation of universal human rights and freedoms. The restriction of Transnistrian citizens’ freedom of movement, instances of which have become more frequent recently, has concrete political motives accompanied by threats to Transnistrian officials,"" the Transnistrian foreign ministry said in a statement.
The ministry recalled that the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) had officially condemned amendments to Moldovan law criminalizing the so-called separatism. However, Moldova’s authorities ignored ODIHR’s opinion.
In February 2023, Moldova’s parliament passed amendments to the Criminal Code envisaging punishment for separatism. Commenting on this decision, parliament speaker Igor Grosu said that sanctions for separatism were meant to make Transnistrian officials ""more malleable at the talks with Chisinau."" Since then Transnistrian officials have been refraining from visiting Moldova."

In this address, the lawmakers express their extreme outrage over the ""inhumane policy of the Kiev regime, which, in its impotent rage, resorts to truly barbaric terrorist methods in a bid to intimidate the civilian population of Russia’s border territories and to justify the failed actions of Ukrainian militias at the contact line.""
The lawmakers note that the January 21 MLRS shelling of Donetsk market and nearby stores has become yet another crime of Ukrainian neo-Nazis.

Tensions flared up in the Middle East after Hamas militants from the Gaza Strip attacked Israeli territory on October 7, when many Israelis living in the settlements near the border were killed and over 200 people, including children, women and the elderly, were taken hostage. Hamas views its attack as a response to Israeli authorities’ steps against the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem.

Russia opposes the recent Houthi attack targeting civilian vessels in the Bab al-Mandab Strait but it considers the reaction by the West to be over the top, Russian Special Presidential Envoy for Syria Alexander Lavrentyev said following the 21st round of talks on Syria.
""Unfortunately, there are forces who fuel [the situation in the Middle East], by bombing some areas, including Yemeni ones,"" he lamented. ""Of course, we oppose attacks against civilian vessels crossing the Bab al-Mandab Strait, but these [Western] actions are disproportionate and absolutely unacceptable,"" he added.
The strikes targeting Yemen would not achieve the goals declared by members of ""the so-called coalition for safeguarding shipping in the Red Sea,"" the Russian envoy argued. ""Violence breeds violence, and the existing conflicts cannot be resolved using military means,"" he concluded.
Overnight on January 12, the armed forces of the United States and the United Kingdom delivered airstrikes on rebel-held positions in several Yemeni cities, including the capital, Sanaa and Hodeidah, using aircraft, warships and submarines. US President Joe Biden said the military action was ordered in response to ""unprecedented Houthi attacks"" on shipping vessels in the Red Sea and that the strikes, targeting Houthi munitions depots, launching systems, production facilities, and air defense radar systems, were delivered in self-defense."
ZBGIAEHGI1_WY7SYRRULQRF3I2,Press review: NATO drills to rehearse war on Russia and Netanyahu nixes Palestinian state,_,_,20240122,tass.com,https://tass.com/pressreview/1735345,"MOSCOW, January 22. /TASS/. NATO is set to launch its largest exercise since the Cold War in what observers see as a dress rehearsal for a direct military conflict with Russia; Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected a plan for a Palestinian state, despite Western objections; and Russia’s agribusiness sector is reviewing the potential risks of the latest round of US restrictions, this time on Russian food exports. These stories topped Monday’s newspaper headlines across Russia.

NATO’s largest exercise since the Cold War, Steadfast Defender 2024, kicks off in Europe this week. The drills will last four months and involve 90,000 troops from all 31 member nations of the North Atlantic Alliance, as well as candidate member Sweden. Moreover, NATO is making it absolutely clear that the maneuvers will be aimed at practicing moves to wage a direct, head-to-head confrontation with Russia as the bloc ups the ante amid abysmal failure by its proxy army in Ukraine.
Simultaneously, there has been increasingly more rhetoric in Europe and the United States about a direct military conflict with Russia on the battlefield. ""A situation where an enemy is being conjured up is leading directly to a revival of the very idea of maintaining NATO as a counterweight [to that purported threat]. In addition, this will inevitably result in increased defense spending,"" Viktor Mizin, researcher at the Russian Academy of Sciences’ Institute of World Economy and International Relations (IMEMO RAS), told Izvestia.
Meanwhile, Royal Netherlands Navy Admiral Rob Bauer, who chairs the NATO Military Committee, warned on Thursday that the governments and populations of NATO countries should ready themselves for a larger war with Russia, which he said will demand a major large-scale mobilization of the populations and industrial capacities of NATO member states over the next two decades.
According to Ilya Kramnik, researcher with the Center for Strategic Planning Studies at IMEMO RAS, bringing back the infrastructure for a military draft and call-up would be a minor concern for NATO’s European members, and the process of reintroducing or expanding the military conscription bureaucracy as well as readjusting the relevant administrative processes would require little more than a year or two at most. But, ""properly equipping such conscripts could prove far more problematic,"" Kramnik told Vedomosti.
For the time being, NATO armies are capable, at best, of providing the availability of first-line forces if a major conflict erupts on the alliance’s eastern flank, the expert argues. Judging from the case of Germany, however, only sparse arsenals are available given their depletion from NATO’s ongoing assistance for Ukraine, he continues. ""The Europeans would need to restart and expand their defense industrial complex to have the genuine capacity to revive their military mobilization posture, which is a mission that would take many years to carry out,"" Kramnik emphasized.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wrote on X (formerly Twitter) on Saturday that he would ""not compromise on full Israeli control"" over the entire territories west of the Jordan River, acknowledging that this stance ""contravenes [the idea of establishing] a Palestinian state.""
Prior to that, the Israeli head of government said at a news conference on January 18 that he had made his position clear to the United States, rejecting any Palestinian statehood as a post-war scenario. According to Netanyahu, the majority of Israeli citizens oppose the idea of establishing a sovereign Palestinian state led by the West Bank-based Palestinian National Authority. And, on the next day, he and US President Joe Biden held their first telephone conversation in almost a month, in which the US leader pressed on with his rhetoric about creating a Palestinian state.
Netanyahu’s provocative statements are intended for consumption by a domestic Israeli audience, Dmitry Mariyasis, leading researcher with the Department of Israel Studies at the Russian Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Oriental Studies, said. ""While a part of the elite is committed to the idea of establishing an independent Palestinian state, others believe that the [window of] time for this has been lost. <…> Much will depend on the outcome of the war,"" he said, adding that resolving the Palestinian issue politically would depend on both the Israelis and the Palestinians themselves.
According to Russian International Affairs Council (RIAC) expert Kirill Semyonov, Israel is seeking to create a new status quo in the region that would enable its military to retain control of the Palestinian territories, while envisaging a limited Palestinian self-government without establishing a sovereign Palestinian state. For the time being, an Israeli siege of the southern areas of the Palestinian enclave in Gaza will continue, accompanied with sporadic air raids, the expert maintains. ""How long such a policy will last would depend on how the Arab world responds, as sooner or later they may have had enough and move to take a tougher stance,"" he concluded.
Later on Monday, EU foreign ministers will discuss a preliminary 10-point plan developed by the bloc’s chief diplomat to end the Gaza conflict, Euractiv reported. The draft document proposes holding a ""preparatory peace conference"" with the participation of the EU, the United States, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the Arab League and the United Nations, after which a peace plan should be outlined within a year’s time.

The No Russian Agricultural Act, a new piece of anti-Russian US legislation passed by the lower chamber US House of Representatives, if enacted would require the US Treasury Department to direct US representatives at international financial institutions to promote, where possible, investments that reduce global dependence on Russian agriculture, including grain, and encourage private investments, according to the website of the US Congress.
Agroexport, a state-owned provider of consulting services to farmers at the Russian Agriculture Ministry, has launched a probe into how the US initiative would affect the Russian market as it surveys the views of market players to introduce a framework for potential international dispute resolution.
Marat Samarsky, an advisor at Verba Legal, believes that Agroexport is evidently working toward ""formulating Russia’s response"" to potential restrictions. Russian agribusiness still has time for that as the US bill must still be approved by both houses of the US Congress and then be signed into law by the president before taking effect. ""And this is a difficult path, to put it mildly,"" Samarsky emphasized. If the bill is enacted, however, proceedings at the World Trade Organization would be launched and a removal of trade barriers would have to be negotiated, but ""such disputes stand little chance"" of taking place anyway, he explains.
According to Dmitry Rylko, director general of the Institute for Agricultural Market Studies, while, thus far, Russian food has not been directly sanctioned, the latest US bill ""may signal a potential reversal."" The initiative is still in its early stages, but it ""can already be viewed as a recommendation not to deal with Russian food exports,"" he said, even while key buyers of Russian food are already fully incorporated into the global financial system.
An industry official told Kommersant that pressure from the United States has already delayed payments for grain, for example, on the part of Egypt. ""There will perhaps be more pressure, and discounts for Russian supplies may widen,"" he warned.

The first team of cosmonauts will start work at Russia’s new orbital station as early as in 2028, chief designer of the project, Vladimir Kozhevnikov, told Izvestia in an interview. By that time, three basic modules to enable research, power generation and gateways will be docked with the station in orbit, which will make it possible to pilot the station, he said.
So far, the Energia space industry company has completed work on developing the final document, which comprises more than 1,500 volumes, Kozhevnikov added as he described the project as the largest in Russian cosmonautics in the past 30 years. The draft design of the Russian Orbital Station (ROS) has been examined by the leading research bodies at state space corporation Roscosmos and submitted to the latter for approval. ""We hope that it will be greenlighted in early February,"" Kozhevnikov said.
According to him, at the next stage, state contracts will have to be signed and the process to build the ROS and its ground-based infrastructure, as well as necessary carrier rockets, and cosmonaut training will begin.
The ROS is a systemic project involving quite a few programs and subprograms, Kozhevnikov said. In all, at least 100 Russian companies and some 200,000 highly qualified experts will take part, he specified.
The ROS could as well control fleets of satellites, Kozhevnikov continued. In addition, it will be very powerful in terms of energy, with large solar panels generating 54 kW for its own consumption. By comparison, the Russian segment of the International Space Station (ISS) currently uses as little as 6 kW, which is barely enough to boil three kettles. And the ROS is expected to have a 120 V voltage, while the Russian cosmonauts on the ISS use 28 V. Thanks to its resources, the ROS will have much greater capabilities than any minor spacecraft, he concluded.

Export prices for Russian cast iron rose to $400 per metric ton, according to the latest data from Metals & Mining Intelligence (MMI), as seen by Vedomosti. In the first 10 days of January, Russian suppliers offered a metric ton for $420 to $440, depending on quality, while ""the working level"" of cast iron prices was somewhat lower, standing at $395 to $415, the report reads.
Not all Russian suppliers export their cast iron, with some steelmakers preferring to increase their own cast iron consumption, MMI said. This, too, has kept export prices higher.
MMI Director General Valeria Kalashnikova explained to Vedomosti that Russian steelmakers had succeeded in increasing export prices for cast iron after the situation in end markets improved across key export routes since November 2023 amid stronger demand and rising global prices.
However, MMI analysts doubt that next spring export prices could reverse back to the price levels seen last March, when cast iron sold for as much as $465 per metric ton. Dmitry Baranov, a leading expert at Finam Management, agrees, even though he, too, sees an increase in export prices.
A source familiar with the dynamics and geography of Russian cast iron exports told Vedomosti that the bulk of Russian exporters have stopped selling to Europe. As a result, the European market is seeing a deficit, while prices of cast iron are rising. A source at a steelmaker said that Russian companies are currently reducing the export of cast iron as they are prioritizing using it in their own steelmaking operations instead.

New Operation Truth (in Spanish, ""Nueva Operacion Verdad""), an international forum of journalists organized by Cuban news agency Prensa Latina, began in the Cuban capital with more than 60 delegates from 34 countries, including Russia, in attendance.
The main topics for discussion at the forum include countering the spread of disinformation and fake news, the impact of social networks on the dissemination of news, and the digitalization of information flows. The participants will also be discussing contemporary Cuba’s relations with the world under the conditions of sanctions.
The event coincides with the 65th anniversary of ""Operation Truth"" (""Operacion Verdad""), initiated by the leader of the Cuban revolution, Fidel Castro. A few weeks after the overthrow of dictator Fulgencio Batista in 1959, a number of US media outlets launched a large-scale media manipulation campaign to discredit the revolutionary process on the Caribbean island and its revolutionary leadership. After that, Castro invited several hundred journalists from around the world to the country to show foreigners the real situation in Cuba. The original Operation Truth implied an alternative coverage of historical events in the region and prompted the emergence of the Prensa Latina news agency, which brought together dozens of journalists from Latin America and the Caribbean.
""Sixty-five years ago, Cuba faced an information war aimed at ending the dream of freedom. The historic leader of the Cuban revolution, Fidel Castro, gathered almost 400 journalists from all over the world in the midst of the campaign that he called the most shameful, criminal and unfair unleashed against a nation,"" said Enrique Gonzalez Acosta, head of Prensa Latina, at the opening ceremony of the information forum, at which Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel was in attendance.
