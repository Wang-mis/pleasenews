00EO6QNHGD_GTTCGNKG2WY3SZ5,DOJ and Mifepristone maker urge Supreme Court to preserve full access to abortion pill,"By Devan Cole, CNN","3 minute read Published 11:18 PM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/23/politics/doj-mifepristone-maker-supreme-court-abortion-pill/,"The Justice Department and the manufacturer of a widely used abortion pill urged the Supreme Court on Tuesday to preserve full access to the drug, warning that a lower-court ruling restricting its availability “threatens profound harms” nationwide.
“The loss of access to mifepristone would be damaging for women and healthcare providers around the Nation. For many patients, mifepristone is the best method to lawfully terminate their early pregnancies,” Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar told the justices in court papers.
“There is no equitable justification for allowing parties whose asserted injuries are at best attenuated – and whose relevant claims assert only that FDA failed adequately to explain its actions – to secure disruptive nationwide relief that threatens profound harms to the government, the healthcare system, patients, and the public,” Prelogar wrote.
The pair of filings from the Justice Department and Danco Laboratories, a manufacturer of the drug and an intervenor in the case, lay out their arguments for why the justices should overturn the lower-court ruling that curbed access to mifepristone, including that the pill’s challengers didn’t have the legal right – known as “standing” – to sue the government over its approval of the drug and the regulatory regime that eased access to it.
“The Fifth Circuit ran roughshod over this Court’s precedents,” attorneys for Danco wrote in their filing. “The court’s standing analysis would give medical organizations standing to challenge virtually every government regulation that touches on health or safety.”
The justices agreed last year to review the case, though the court has not yet scheduled oral arguments. More briefs from the parties are expected in the coming weeks.
In its filing Tuesday night, the drugmaker, like the government, defended the US Food and Drug Administration’s 2000 approval of mifepristone and the agency’s subsequent actions concerning the drug. The company argued that the legal analysis employed by the New Orleans-based appeals court to limit access to the drug “threatens to destabilize the pharmaceutical industry, which relies both on FDA’s ability to make predictive judgments and on courts not second-guessing those scientific judgments.”
For now, mifepristone remains available and not subject to restrictions that the lower courts have said should be imposed on its use. The high court determined in April 2023 that access to the drug would remain unchanged until the appeals process finishes.
Central to the dispute is the scope of the FDA’s authority to regulate mifepristone, a drug that the medical community has deemed safe and effective and is used by more than half of women to terminate their pregnancies, according to the government.
Challengers – including doctors and groups who oppose abortion – argue that the FDA did not do enough to study the safety implications of the drug when it approved its use and made it more easily accessible in subsequent years.
A federal judge in Texas agreed last spring, issuing a ruling that would have halted the FDA’s 2000 approval of the drug. The 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals backtracked somewhat, saying in August that while it was too late for the challengers to mount a case against the initial 2000 approval of the drug and left in place the 2019 approval of a generic version of the drug, it would block changes made in 2016 and 2021 that made the drug more easily accessible."
01AIEK3P34_ZW240X5PQ3TYA22,China says US military makes region more dangerous after Navy ship sails through Taiwan Strait,"By Brad Lendon, CNN","3 minute read Published 11:05 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/26/china/china-us-navy-taiwan-strait-intl-hnk-ml/,"China accused the United States military of “abusing international law” and continuing a pattern of “dangerous provocations” in East Asia Thursday, after a US Navy destroyer made the service’s first transit of the Taiwan Strait of 2024.
The movement on Wednesday of the USS John Finn through the waterway that separates democratically governed Taiwan from communist mainland China was also the first transit of a US warship through the strait since elections on the island two weeks ago.
The vote gave Taiwan’s ruling Democratic Progressive Party a historic third consecutive presidential victory, with the island’s voters shrugging off warnings from Beijing that its reelection would increase the risk of conflict.
China’s ruling Communist Party views Taiwan as part of its territory, despite having never controlled it, and leader Xi Jinping has not ruled out the use of military force to “reunify” the island with the mainland.
The US meanwhile is obligated under the Taiwan Relations Act to provide Taiwan with the military means to defend itself, something Beijing regards as interference in its internal affairs.
US Navy 7th Fleet spokesperson Cmdr. Meagan Greene said in a statement Wednesday that the transit of the USS John Finn through the strait was made “in accordance with international law.”
“The ship transited through a corridor in the Strait that is beyond the territorial sea of any coastal State. John Finn’s transit through the Taiwan Strait demonstrates the United States’ commitment to upholding freedom of navigation for all nations as a principle,” Greene said.

While the John Finn’s transit of the Taiwan Strait was the first of 2024, US warships and warplanes regularly travel through and over the waterway. In 2023, US Navy and Coast Guard ships and Navy reconnaissance planes made 11 transits of the strait, according to a database kept by Collin Koh, research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.
On Thursday, China’s Defense Ministry said Washington was courting danger with its military activities in the region, saying a change in behavior is “needed to avoid maritime and air accidents,” according to the state-run Xinhua news agency’s English-language website.
“The root cause of the China-U.S. maritime and air security issues lies in the U.S. military’s harassment and provocations on China’s doorstep, engaging in prolonged, extensive and high-frequency activities in the maritime and aerial areas surrounding China,” the Xinhua story said, citing Defense Ministry spokesperson Wu Qian.
“He urged the U.S. side to stop abusing international law, cease all dangerous provocations, and strictly discipline its troops on the ground,” the story said.
Earlier this month, the commander of the US Indo-Pacific Command, Adm. John Aquilino, accused Beijing of ramping up tensions.
Aquilino told a defense forum in Hawaii that he expected a show of force from China against Taiwan in the wake of the election result.
“When something occurs that they don’t like, they tend to take actions,” Aquilino told the Pacific Forum’s Operationalizing Integration in the Indo-Pacific conference in Honolulu.
Koh, the Singaporean analyst, said Beijing may be a bit “miffed” at Washington at the moment, especially after agreeing to restart military-to-military talks in December.
“Given that Beijing very likely believes that it extended the olive branch by agreeing to reopen military-to-military communications and other high-level exchanges, it might have perceived a lack of reciprocity from the US,” Koh said."
046AQCVGBT_C3KSFTM25TK8L7E,‘A sneak peek into hell’: Israel’s war in Gaza has cost this young woman her closest friends,"By Zahid Mahmood and Abeer Salman, CNN. Video by Julie Zink, CNN.","7 minute read Updated 7:10 AM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/24/middleeast/gaza-young-woman-loss-israel-war-intl-cmd/,"Nowara Diab was trying to drown out the sounds of airstrikes by listening to music, but it was not enough to shake the unsettled feeling in her gut.
Then her phone rang. It was a friend, who said they had heard that Maimana Jarada - Diab’s best friend - and her family had been killed by Israeli bombardment.
Her stomach was in knots as she felt herself panicking. Diab called Jarada’s number repeatedly but when there was no answer, it dawned on her that it was true - Jarada had been killed.
The 20-year-old says she broke down in tears as she felt the walls close in around her. The pain was even more intense for Diab because she had learned only 10 days earlier that another friend, Abraham Saidam, had also been killed by Israeli airstrikes.
“Living without them is the worst thing I’ve ever felt,” Diab said. “My heart aches every single day thinking that they’re not here and they’re not going to be here for me anymore, it pains me.”
She recalls how she froze in disbelief and started crying when she received the text message about Saidam.
“My mother looked at me to ask me what was wrong. I just covered my mouth with my hands and I was silent, everything was a blur and I was in complete shock.”
Despite repeated telecommunications blackouts amid Israel’s siege, Diab has managed to speak to CNN from Gaza through voice notes, text messages and videos about the life and friendships she has lost since October 7.
As Israel’s war approaches its fourth month, sustained bombardment by Israeli forces in Gaza has had a devastating impact on civilians there. United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres condemned the “utterly unacceptable” killing of civilians, renewing calls for an “immediate humanitarian ceasefire” to relieve the suffering of Palestinians in the strip, after the death toll surpassed 25,000, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry.
Throughout Israel’s war, launched in response to the October 7 Hamas attacks, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has repeatedly said that it only targets Hamas fighters, not civilians.
The enclave is one of the most densely populated areas in the world, with about 2.2 million inhabitants.
At the outset of the war, Diab watched as bombs fell near her home in Gaza City. She and her family knew they had to leave for their own safety.
“That night was dreadful, it was so scary, I was sure I was going to die,” she said.
After fleeing multiple times, Diab and her family are now staying in Rafah, southern Gaza, and are among the nearly 1.9 million people displaced across the territory, according to data from the United Nations’ Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA).
The Israeli bombardment and the ensuing humanitarian crisis have made the situation in the enclave unbearable, with the UN children’s agency, UNICEF, saying conditions for children are a “living hell.” The UN agency has described Gaza as the most dangerous place in the world to be a child and said the ongoing violence is exposing young people to devastating emotional trauma and psychological harm.
Walking through the streets, Diab said, she looks at the faces of fellow residents of Gaza and sees nothing but sadness and pain.
She says losing her best friends and being forced to leave behind the life she’s known has impacted her own mental health.
“I’m unable to feel anything, I don’t feel happy or sad or anything,” she said. “I don’t know why but all of this has consumed my energy, I cry every now and then but not the way I used to cry before, it’s very brief.”
Before the war, Diab was in her final year of college studying English and French literature at Al Azhar University. Like most young people, she enjoyed spending time with her friends and eating tasty food in the city.
Sometimes, when Diab closes her eyes, she can still remember the faint smell of her family home in northern Gaza, destroyed by bombing since October 7. “Even the flaws hold memories,” she said. “If my little sister drew something on the walls, it made my mother mad but it still holds a memory.”
Diab says she longs for the kind of problems she had before the war, like missing the bus for college or being bored in lectures. “I’m not able to do this anymore because my college was bombed, my house was bombed and I lost my best friend,” she said.
Diab describes her situation as worse than a nightmare because she’s unable to wake up from it.
“I laugh at myself when I say ‘my life’ now, because this is not my life, this is far away from my life,” she continued. “This is a sneak peek into hell.”
There’s rarely a moment when Jarada and Saidam leave Diab’s mind, she says, and she thinks of them whenever she looks through photos on her phone or sees other people with their friends.
“I just need her (Jarada) more than ever right now, but I know that she is in a better place,” Diab said.
“And I know that Abraham is happy now, I just know it, but I miss them.”
Diab and Jarada were childhood friends, with shared humor and interests creating a bond like that of sisters. In a video shared with CNN, the pair sit next to each other, giggling and lip syncing to a viral Tik Tok sound that originated from a Saturday Night Live skit about friendship.
“How would I even begin to describe Jarada? She’s just unique, a beautiful soul and a very artistic person,” Diab told CNN, adding that Jarada had “the biggest heart ever” and would create pictures for her.
Jarada painted a sunflower for Diab’s birthday last year. Diab says she accepted it unaware that this would be her friend’s last gift to her before she died at age 20.
When Diab and her family fled Gaza City, she had to leave the painting behind.
At college, Diab’s interest in the arts drew her to participate in a theater group, where she became good friends with Saidam after initially thinking he was quiet.
“He even looked like an introvert, but then we found out he’s an extrovert and was so funny and so exceptional,” she said.
Diab recalls how they both participated in a play based on Homer’s “Odyssey.” Saidam played King Odysseus and would make everybody laugh, she said.
The day Diab learned of her 27-year-old friend’s death, she cried a lot, but resolved to be strong because there was nothing more she could do, she said.
In Rafah, all Diab tries to do is to survive another day, she said, searching for essential items like cooking gas and water, both in very short supply.
“Can you imagine if you live your life without water? The most basic thing, just to drink, just to keep living,” said Diab. “Now everyone is being killed and if you’re not going to die from (airstrikes) we’re going to die from being hungry or thirsty.”
But despite everything that is happening, she says she will never forget the generosity and kindness of neighbors where they’ve sought refuge in Rafah and Khan Younis.
A neighbor in Rafah would give them plates of food and let Diab’s family shower at her home. “To see someone giving so much like this under these circumstances is surprising and she’s so nice,” Diab said.
“(Another family) came over and offered water to shower and to charge our phones and within an hour, our phones came back fully charged,” she said – no small thing in Gaza, where fuel shortages mean electricity is hard to access.
Although aid has entered the enclave, it has done so under challenging conditions and the UN has repeatedly warned that the volume getting in remains “woefully inadequate.”
Diab says extreme thirst has driven her family to drink water suitable only for laundry or showering.
Families across Gaza are having to consume unclean water because of Israel’s siege, adding to the risk of ill health. Earlier this month, UNICEF warned that the intensifying conflict has threatened the lives of over 1.1 million children, putting them in a deadly cycle of violence, malnutrition and disease.
With airstrikes pummeling southern Gaza, Diab fears for her safety in Rafah, saying there’s not an inch in the enclave which is truly safe, despite Israel’s declaration of a safe zone and regular announcements of times when they will stop bombing so people can move safely.
And although she wishes the war to be over, she lacks hope for the future.
“We’re going to see Gaza City wiped out, we’re gonna see it with our own eyes, which will be heartbreaking,” she said of any future return to her home.
“Imagine going back, after all of this is over and there’s going to be nothing to go back to, not a college, not a house, nothing. So even when this is over, there is more agony and pain waiting for us.”"

The event kicked off on Schiaparelli’s runway, where the stars were out in full force. Zendaya stole the limelight, donning an all black gown with knot-embellished sleeves and a ruched ponytail-esque train, complete with razor-sharp micro bangs (and, days later, at Fendi in a sultry off-shoulder wine-colored gown). Also in attendance, Jennifer Lopez, who commanded attention in an elaborate petaled white coat, paired with opulent surrealist-style gold eyebrow glasses.
Since then, whether it’s been the Kardashian crew at Maison Margiela, Rihanna in a voluminous black brocade puffer jacket at Dior, Lucy Boynton at Chanel, or Glenn Close and Gwyneth Paltrow at Giorgio Armani Privé, the week certainly showcased the industry’s most elite and decadent looks — both on and off the catwalks.
It was also a family affair, with Kris Jenner appearing alongside daughters Kylie and Kim Kardashian at Maison Margiela, Kylie Jenner and daughter Stormi Webster arriving hand-in-hand to Valentino, and Reese Witherspoon and Ava Phillippe photographed together at Fendi.

0F92VQ2EKY_HC8D9P1YWHQ4V14,The man who captured images of a long-forgotten Ghana,"By Zoe Whitfield, CNN","4 minute read Published 1:02 AM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/23/style/jk-bruce-vanderpuije-archive/,"While visiting London to see the work of her grandfather, the late Ghanaian photographer J.K. Bruce-Vanderpuije, at the 2023 contemporary African art fair “1-54,” Kate Tamakloe was surprised to discover another of his images, uncredited, in the collection at the British capital’s Victoria and Albert Museum.
“I asked how they got the photo and was told it was in the library,” she recalled in an interview with CNN. “We have the original (in our archives), but somehow a copy got taken to the UK, and along the line, its history got lost.”
One of West Africa’s foremost documentarians of the 20th century, Bruce-Vanderpuije created a prolific record of life in pre- and post-independence Ghana, illustrating the country’s changing fashions and cultural practices with portraits of young couples getting married, newborn babies and everyday life for over 70 years. He also encountered a number of important community leaders and political figures throughout his career, among them Kwame Nkrumah, the first president of Ghana following its independence from Britain in March 1957.
For more than a decade — since Tamakloe began managing the Deo Gratias Photo Studio, which her grandfather set up in the Jamestown area of Accra, Ghana in 1922 — she has overseen an archive of some 50,000 images. Championing them and rectifying oversights in international collections has become a vital part of her job.
Spellbinding photos capture the ‘mermaid’ divers of South Korea
In collaboration with Efie Gallery in Dubai, the Ethiopian photographer Aïda Muluneh has curated a new exhibition titled “Unveiling the Shadows of the Past: J.K. Bruce-Vanderpuije — The Hidden Icon of Photography in Africa” that highlights images from the 1920s and 1930s, when Ghana was still a British colony (then called the Gold Coast).
“When I look at Bruce-Vanderpuije’s work, I think about the responsibility we bear (for) preserving the changing faces of the continent,” Muluneh told CNN.
“His dedication to the field and the amassed body of work is a diary of a country and its people,” she added, alluding to the significant events Bruce-Vanderpuije captured, including the moment three ex-servicemen protesting unpaid war allowances were fatally shot. The incident sparked the 1948 Accra riots and would inform constitutional changes that shaped the country’s eventual independence.
“Photographers of that generation were not capturing images for recognition or with the aim of being showcased in an exhibition,” explained Muluneh. “It was a necessity to preserve a moment in history.”
Born in March 1899, James Kobla (J.K) Bruce-Vanderpuije studied at the Accra Royal School and enjoyed photography as a hobby in his teens. Later, he trained with J.A.C Holm (another Ghana-based photographer) for three years before establishing his own studio aged just 23.
Despite growing up privy to the studio and her grandfather’s practice, Tamakloe’s involvement was almost happenstance; after an accident caused her to move her cybercafé business to the studio, she began supporting her father — Isaac Hudson Bruce-Vanderpuije, also a photographer and an earlier custodian of the studio — when his eyesight started to deteriorate.
“Once, a photographer from South Africa visited and said, ‘You guys are sitting on a goldmine,’” she explained. “That’s when I paid more attention and realized that I needed to do this. I needed to sort out the archive.”
For the past 12 years, Tamakloe has been digitalizing her grandfather’s pictures. “I’m still making a lot of discoveries, which is very exciting,” she added, recounting how some of Bruce-Vanderpuije’s subjects were identified decades later — including Miss Ghana 1958 and Seth Anthony, the first Black African to be commissioned as an officer in the British army, who were both recognized in pictures by their grown-up children.

“I have always been fascinated to see the reaction of the young generation when they see images of people from the past,” noted Muluneh, who has worked on a number of archive-building projects in Ethiopia. “The magic of photography, for me, is that it can bring us back to a time and moments that offer a unique perspective of not only understanding our people, but also ourselves. I believe that a bigger discussion is needed as it relates to the preservation, publication and promotion of the visual archives of Africa.”
Tamakloe is similarly engaged in pursuing this conversation, and keen to export her grandfather’s work more broadly. Ultimately, she said, “I would like to tell the Ghanaian story, truthfully.”
Today, nearly two years after celebrating its centenary, Deo Gratias is widely considered to be the oldest operational photo studio in West Africa, and is still largely used as it was in its early years (albeit with a different, smaller crowd), said Tamakloe. “It’s in a very densely populated area and we have a lot of festivals happening around us — we’re also surrounded by churches — so people still come and have their photograph taken all dressed up,” she explained.
With a shift in new technologies and the way we interact with photography evolving, however, Tamakloe acknowledged that most people now look elsewhere for their mementos. “People do come and have passport pictures taken, but it’s not as busy as it used to be,” she said. “These days, people take photographs on their phones. Those who do come in though, want a print to keep and probably frame.”
“Unveiling the Shadows of the Past: J. K. Bruce-Vanderpuije — The Hidden Icon of Photography in Africa” runs until Feb. 20, 2024 at Efie Gallery, Dubai."
0FPUHUQ9C4_Y3SZ1HJ8FI6GYV7,GM’s self-driving car division is under investigation by DOJ and SEC after pedestrian dragging incident,"By Peter Valdes-Dapena, CNN","3 minute read Published 8:14 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/25/cars/gm-self-driving-car-unit-criticized/,"Cruise, General Motors’ self-driving vehicle unit, disclosed today that it is the subject of two federal investigations regarding its actions after a severe accident involving a Cruise “robotaxi.”
In just the latest setback in the auto industry’s attempt to perfect driverless cars, the company is being investigated by the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission, according to a Cruise blog post.
An investigation and report commisioned by Cruise and GM and released today found no evidence that Cruise staffers or executives lied to or misled regulators about the 2023 accident involving a pedestrian, but that they also did not volunteer details about what happened.
In meetings with regulators after the October 2 incident, Cruise officials attempted to show a full video of the impact, shot from the car. But “technical issues” prevented the regulators from seeing all of it clearly, according to the report. Cruise did not, then, point out to regulators the details of what actually happened.
When California regulators found out, later, that a Cruise vehicle had dragged a woman  20 feet across the asphalt following the impact, causing grievous injuries, Cruise’s permits to test fully autonomous vehicles in California were suspended.
Cruise later stopped all testing throughout the United States and has not resumed those operations.
Cruise’s chief executive and other executives also resigned and the company laid off nearly a quarter of its workforce shortly after the 2023 incident.
Cruise commissioned the law firm of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan to investigate the incident and Cruise’s response to it. The report is a result of that investigation.
The investigation concluded that “The reasons for Cruise’s failings in this instance are numerous: poor leadership, mistakes in judgment, lack of coordination, an ‘us versus them’ mentality with regulators, and a fundamental misapprehension of Cruise’s obligations of accountability and transparency to the government and the public,” Cruise posted in a summary of the report.
Before the accident, Cruise had been a leader in developing self-driving cars. It planned to expand its so-called “robotaxis” to a dozen or more cities in 2024. Mary Barra, the CEO of GM, has said she remains focused on the self-driving future. But the incident functioned as a major setback.
Immediately after the incident, Cruise employees were not, themselves, aware that the woman had been dragged, according to the report. Initially, Cruise staffers were focused on correcting stories in the media that implied the Cruise veihicle was the first to strike the woman. Actually, the pedestrian was struck by a human-driven Nissan car first and that impact propelled her into the path of the Cruise car.
Even after people in the company became aware the woman was then dragged by the Cruise car, Cruise did not update its press statements or present the full video to reporters, according to the report.
The report attributed its failures in communication to a “myopic focus” in clearing Cruise of fault in the initial impact.
“We acknowledge that we have failed to live up to the justifiable expectations of regulators and the communities we serve,” Cruise wrote in its blog post on the report. “In doing so, we also fell woefully short of our own expectations.”
Cruise told CNN it is cooperating fully with the federal investigations but cannot comment on them."

Artisanal mining is a common activity across much of West Africa and has risen in recent years due to growing demand for metals and rising prices.
Deadly accidents are frequent as artisanal miners often use old-fashioned and unregulated methods of digging.
The incident in Mali occurred on Friday on a site in the Kangaba Cercle in the south-western Koulikoro Region, the mines ministry said in a statement on Tuesday that did not specify the number of deaths.

A spokesperson for the ministry, Baye Coulibaly, said via telephone on Wednesday that the death toll was still provisional.
“Gold panners have dug galleries without complying with the required standards, and we have advised them against it on several occasions in vain,” Coulibaly said.
The ministry would be a sending a mission to the Kangaba area on Thursday to get more details on the accident, he added.
According to mines ministry data, an estimated six tons of gold was produced in artisanal mines in Mali in 2023."
0GSHWROCQY_OFDK3LG5EA2MH9I,The Los Angeles Times plunges into ‘chaos’ as brutal layoffs loom and senior editors call it quits,"By Oliver Darcy, CNN","5 minute read Published 6:30 AM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/23/media/los-angeles-times-layoffs-strike/,"Editor’s Note: A version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here.
The Los Angeles Times is in disarray.
The Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong-owned newspaper, which houses the largest newsroom in the western U.S., has been thrown into a state of mayhem as severe layoffs loom and senior editorial leaders abruptly call it quits.
“I cannot overstate the level of chaos,” one   staffer, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak   publicly, candidly told me on Monday.
To say that it has been a rocky start to the new year for the venerable news outlet would be an understatement. Earlier this month, Kevin Merida suddenly announced that he was departing his post as executive editor after less than three years on the job. Then, news of forthcoming mass layoffs ensued, prompting the employee’s union to stage a historic one-day walk out on Friday. The LAT’s Meg James reported last week that management could slash upwards of 20% of the newsroom — or roughly 100 positions — with the looming layoffs, though a person familiar with the matter warned to me on Monday that it could ultimately end up being “much worse” than that.
Meanwhile, amid the backdrop of bedlam, the team of four managing editors — Julia Turner, Sara Yasin, Scott Kraft, and Shani Hilton — tapped to oversee operations in the wake of Merida’s departure has also been rocked by departures. Two of the four members, BuzzFeed News alums Hilton and Yasin, have in recent days exited the newspaper, contributing even further to the turmoil that has enveloped the newsroom.
“We have a billionaire who doesn’t understand media and thinks he can cut his way to success,” another staffer told me, likening the drama playing out in the editorial leadership to the reality television show “Survivor.”
Seeking to provide the newsroom with some sense of stability, Turner emailed staffers on Monday announcing that she would oversee daily editorial operations with Kraft and absorb all of Hilton’s direct reports. Notably, Turner was not shy about the grim reality confronting the newspaper, writing to employees, “Scott and I are now responsible for all editorial operations, and we’re advocating for editorial interests in conversations with the company about the financial crisis we face.”
Beyond the drastic cuts hanging over the newsroom, it’s unclear what Soon-Shiong is doing behind the scenes to stable his ship. The biotech billionaire purchased The LAT in 2018, pouring nearly $1 billion into the storied paper and vowing to steer it into the future after enduring years of tumult under Tribune Publishing. But in the words of the newspaper’s own leadership team, years later under his stewardship it is in a dire state of “financial crisis.”
The newsroom’s rank-and-file have not heard from Soon-Shiong since he   announced Merida’s exit two weeks ago. At the time, he said his commitment to   the newspaper had “not wavered.” But he did foreshadow a period of   disruption, telling staffers, “Given the persistent challenges we face,   it is now imperative that we all work together to build a sustainable   business that allows for growth and innovation of the LA Times and LA Times   Studios in order to achieve our vision.”
The Times is certainly not alone in its struggles. Most news media companies are fighting to stand on their feet as they fight unprecedented headwinds. Layoffs have become the de facto norm in an industry continually pummeled by seismic change. In 2023, news outlets slashed nearly 2,700 jobs — the highest number of cuts to torment the industry since the Covid-19 pandemic.
The cuts have come at a horrendous time. As antidemocratic   candidates look to seize power in election contests from coast to coast,   newsrooms are shrinking and simply trying to stay afloat. That lack of   accountability means dishonest figures seeking higher office, and those in   positions of power, could avoid crucial scrutiny, leaving the electorate less   informed about the vital decisions it will have to make in November at the   ballot box.
That said, while painful cuts have become all too frequent   throughout the industry, it’s still rare to watch in real-time as a news   organization of The LAT’s stature see its leadership team come apart at the   seams so visibly — particularly as staffers brace for even more agony.
On Monday, 10 Democratic members of Congress representing   California wrote Soon-Shiong, expressing alarm over the planned layoffs,   noting that during elections, “the role of news outlets in providing   accurate and unbiased information becomes even more vital.”
“Our community relies on the newspaper to stay informed   about local and national events, and a reduction in reporters could have a   detrimental impact on the quality of reporting,” the congressional   leaders wrote. “Preserving democracy is contingent upon a free and   robust press, and the LA Times has been instrumental in upholding this   democratic principle.”
“We urge you to consider alternative solutions that would   allow the LA Times to navigate its financial challenges without compromising   the integrity and strength of its newsroom.”
In response, Soon-Shiong said he had invested hundreds of   millions of dollars into the paper and suggested lawmakers should take action   of their own to aid revenue-starved news organizations.
“I’d like to put the question to them: What can they do   to help preserve a free and robust press, one that is instrumental in   upholding our democracy?” he wrote. “All we are asking for is the   opportunity for our newspaper and hardworking journalists to be fairly   compensated, and for the L.A. Times to have a fair chance to become a   self-sustaining institution.”"
0JWWRG371Q_728GOS3J74SAD18,Oklahoma state lawmaker apologizes for bill labeling ‘Hispanic’ gang members terrorists. Fellow lawmakers say it’s not enough,"By Chandelis Duster, CNN","3 minute read Published 9:48 AM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/24/us/oklahoma-humphrey-gang-terrorist-bill-reaj/,"An Oklahoma state lawmaker says he will now change the language of a bill he proposed that designates anyone “of Hispanic descent” that is “a member of a criminal street gang” and convicted of a “gang-related offense” a terrorist.
Earlier this month, Oklahoma state Rep. Justin Humphrey, a Republican, introduced HB 3133, which states, “Any person who: 1. Is of Hispanic descent living within the state of Oklahoma; 2. Is a member of a criminal street gang … and 3. Has been convicted of a gang-related offense … shall be deemed to have committed an act of terrorism.”
The bill has been met with backlash, with some critics labeling it racist.
“I am not trying to offend any race,” Humphrey told CNN. “I support the Hispanic people. I am willing to change this to improve the language – very happy to do that.
“I do want to make certain that people understand that I don’t believe I was wrong. I can absolutely respect that and say, ‘You know what, I believe I’m right,’ but I can respect your opinion and if I offended you, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to offend you,” he added.
Humphrey said he wrote the law to target anyone engaged in gang-related criminal activities, mainly those committed by Mexican drug cartels.
He said he did not intend to target people of Hispanic descent and pushed back on allegations that he is racist.
“The whole world can call me racist, doesn’t bother me because I know I’m not a racist and anybody who’s around me would know that as well,” he said. “It doesn’t matter what race you are, if you’re not engaging in those activities then this bill does not apply to you.”
Humphrey said he has talked with narcotics experts, including the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, who advised him to broaden the language of the bill to “include all the players.”
He said the next iteration of the bill will remove the term “Hispanic” and will be introduced when the Oklahoma legislature returns for a new session on February 5.
Oklahoma state Rep. Arturo Alonso-Sandoval, a Democrat, said he feels Humphrey’s decision to change the language of the bill is too little, too late.
“He might swap the term ‘Hispanic’ with something else, but he already said the quiet part out loud,” Alonso-Sandoval said.
“Conflating Hispanics with terrorists is textbook fear-mongering. I don’t see this bill going anywhere, but it does add to the negative and false stereotypes that are often portrayed by individuals that are just trying to make an enemy out of someone.”
The bill has also been criticized by Oklahoma Republican state Sen. Jessica Garvin, the state legislature’s first elected Hispanic woman. Garvin told CNN she appreciates Humphrey’s commitment to changing the language in the bill, but that is not enough.
“It doesn’t excuse the bill’s initial language that was filed and what I thought was disparaging remarks about Hispanic Oklahomans in our state, including me,” she said. “I am appalled by this bill, as it has portrayed our state in a light that does not represent the position of the Republican Party, or the vast majority of elected officials,” Garvin added."
0L6TXC2XC2_MDRP2C4J1J9RY0E,UAW endorses Biden as he prepares to fight Trump for union workers,"By MJ Lee, Jeff Zeleny, Betsy Klein, Samantha Waldenberg, Chris Isidore and Michael Williams, CNN","5 minute read Updated 4:42 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/24/politics/biden-uaw-endorsement/,"The United Auto Workers union on Wednesday endorsed President Joe Biden, a long-awaited announcement that is an important pickup for the president.
“Look, I kept my commitment to be the most pro-union president ever,” Biden said after receiving the UAW’s endorsement at the group’s conference in Washington, DC, on Wednesday afternoon. “I’m proud you have my back. Let me just say I’m honored to have your back, and you have mine.”
The endorsement comes as the Biden campaign is making a full pivot to the general election, pointing to former President Donald Trump’s victory in the Republican primary in New Hampshire Tuesday as a clear sign that he is poised to emerge as the GOP presidential nominee.
The president and union leadership have long courted each other. Although it’s a key endorsement for Biden, the backing from union leadership may not convince all of the rank-and-file to vote for the president in November. Biden won the endorsement of the UAW in the 2020 campaign, even though many rank-and-file members supported Trump.
Ahead of endorsing Biden, UAW President Shawn Fain said the choice union workers face in 2024 “isn’t about who you like. It’s not about your party. It’s not this b——- about age. It’s not about anything, but our best shot at taking back power for the working class.”
He then referred to Trump using the worst insult that can be made in front of a room full of union workers.
“Donald Trump is a scab,” Fain said. “Donald Trump is a billionaire, and that’s who he represents. … Donald Trump stands against everything we stand for as a union – as a society.”
The choice between Trump and Biden, Fain said, was clear.
“Joe Biden bet on the American worker while Donald Trump blamed the American workers,” he said. “We need to know who’s going to sit in the most powerful seat in the world and help us win as a united working class. So if our endorsement must be earned, Joe Biden has earned it.”
Trump has made appealing to union voters a key part of his political strategy, in no small part by targeting disaffected voters in parts of the Midwest who believe the Democratic Party has left them behind.
Biden, meanwhile, has continued to cast himself as the most pro-union leader. He joined members of the UAW in Michigan on the picket line last year in the middle of a strike – an unprecedented move for a sitting president.
“I will say, I was so damn proud to stand in that picket line with you,” Biden told the crowd on Wednesday, prompting cheers.
“Honest to God, I’ve always believed that the union movement in America is important because it produces the best-skilled workers in the world. That’s what happens. It’s good for everybody.”
But just because the union endorsed Biden for a second term doesn’t mean it is lockstep with the president on every issue. In December, UAW released a statement calling for a ceasefire in Israel and Gaza – a move that Biden has himself resisted. The gap between the union’s position on Israel and the president’s briefly revealed itself during his speech Wednesday, when a member of the audience unfurled a Palestinian flag and shouted, “Ceasefire now!”
The protest was brief and did not derail the president’s remarks – unlike the abortion-rights rally on Tuesday where Biden was interrupted more than a dozen times by protesters demanding a ceasefire.
The endorsement could be a factor in the battleground state of Michigan in November. Trump won the Great Lakes State in 2016 and Biden won it narrowly in 2020. The race is expected to be close again in November as Biden and the former president – should he win his party’s presidential nomination – both work to stake out their claim to be the champion of the working class.
The UAW had kept its powder dry on a potential endorsement, declining last year to join a cadre of high-profile unions in backing Biden’s reelection campaign ahead of high-stakes contract negotiations. At the time, the union cited concerns over Biden’s policies that would encourage a transition to electric vehicles.
The UAW has more than 400,000 members, and Biden – who has long relied on the political backing of unions – has touted its support in the past. The president has called American autoworkers “the most skilled autoworkers in the world.” The group’s membership is mostly concentrated in Michigan, a presidential election battleground.
Fain previously warned this cycle that “another Donald Trump presidency would be a disaster.”
While Biden took care to show his support on the picket line, the administration lacked the legal or legislative authority to act as a participant in the negotiations, which ended in late October.
Rep. Dan Kildee, a Michigan Democrat, dismissed concerns Tuesday that Biden had not yet received the union’s endorsement.
“No, it doesn’t,” Kildee told CNN’s Poppy Harlow when pressed on whether he was worried the endorsement had not yet been made.
“The UAW had other issues on its mind than injecting presidential politics into the 2023 challenges. They had an unprecedented strike. With the support of President Biden, they received an unprecedented contract. So, when I talk to auto workers, they understand that. And, you know, I’m very hopeful that organized labor generally, and the UAW specifically, will - will remember Joe Biden’s record and will stand with him as a result,” Kildee added.
Trump has found support among the rank-and-file of the UAW despite Fain’s strong criticisms and union leadership’s consistent support of Democratic candidates. On the same day that Biden visited a UAW picket line in Michigan, Trump spoke at a non-union auto shop in suburban Detroit – drawing the ire of the union.
Fain told CNN in December that he felt like the former president has never truly had the backs of UAW members.
“You go back to 2019, when he was a sitting president, and GM was on strike for, you know, 40 days. What did he say about the strikers in? What did he do to assist? What did you do show he cared about those workers, I mean, he was silent,” Fain said.
“You go back to 2015, when he was running for the presidency. And he talked about, we need to do a rotation of all these good paying jobs in the Midwest somewhere else, not out of the country, but somewhere else in the country, and have these workers begging for their jobs back. You go back to the economic recession, and he jumped on ‘The bandwagon of the UAW is to blame for everything wrong with these companies.’ And so those are facts, they’re indisputable.”

0M2Z8CYPGW_1J26T3KTOB2QOYQ,‘I don’t know why I’m not arrested.’ Anti-war presidential candidate ignites Russian anger,"By Clare Sebastian, CNN","3 minute read Updated 2:42 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/25/europe/russia-anti-war-presidential-candidate-boris-nadezhdin-intl/,"For the past week cities and towns across Russia have witnessed an unusual display of defiance.
No protests or picket lines, just patient, orderly queues. Dozens, if not hundreds of people lining up in freezing conditions to try to ensure an anti-war presidential candidate has enough signatures to get on the ballot for the vote in March.
It’s even happening outside of Russia, with volunteers collecting expats’ signatures in cities from London and Paris to Georgia’s capital Tbilisi.
Key endorsements from other Russian opposition figures, including associates of jailed Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny have helped. But the deadline to submit 100,000 signatures, with strict rules on quality and regional quotas, is January 31 – and time is running short.
The candidate is Boris Nadezhdin, on the surface an unlikely opponent for Vladimir Putin.
He’s a physicist by training, served one term in the state Duma 20 years ago, and by his own account joined the ranks of Russia’s opposition after the arrest of exiled oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky in 2003.
He went on to become an adviser to opposition leader Boris Nemtsov, assassinated within view of the Kremlin in 2015. “I know Putin very well from the 90s” he told CNN in an interview from Moscow on Wednesday, in which he spoke English.
“He was a normal Russian bureaucrat, and I was a normal Russian bureaucrat.”
He believes this may be why he can get away with publishing a manifesto calling Russia’s so-called “special military operation” a “fatal mistake,” in a country where spreading “false” information about the army carries a maximum 15-year prison sentence, and the most prominent opposition figure, Navalny, is serving a multi-decade prison term beyond the Arctic Circle.
Ultimately he admits, “I don’t know why I’m not arrested.”
The Kremlin says it doesn’t see him as a rival, but the speculation is that they are allowing Nadezhdin to continue, either so that Putin can win against an anti-war candidate, thereby affording himself a mandate to keep the war going, or to provide a release valve for an undercurrent of anti-war sentiment, to prevent it descending into mass protests.

Nadezhdin maintains his movement is real. “Millions of people understand,” he says, “we have to change the way Russia is going now, because Putin forced Russia into this track of militarization, this track of isolation.”
His plan, if elected, is to free all political prisoners on day one (including Navalny), call an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine and start peace talks.
For those waiting in line in the Moscow snow, this is not about Nadezhdin himself. Elizaveta from Bryansk, who declined to give her second name and from a border region now under regular drone attack, says the war has hit home.
“My town is in a special situation,” she tells us, “my main wish is that it should stop as soon as possible.”
Another supporter, who also wanted to be identified only as Ivan, tells us he doesn’t care if Nadezhdin is a Kremlin plant or not.
“I am prepared even for the candidate to be, as we say here, a representative of one of the Kremlin towers. For me the most important thing is that military action should stop and any vote in support of that will be valid.”
For several people we spoke to, whether Nadezhdin ends up on the ballot or not, this is a rare opportunity to play a part in Russian political life.
Gripping her hot tea handed out by volunteers, Elena puts it simply. “I think people should see that we want to show our position, that we exist.”

0Q931R6JMP_FSADNVF48NMF6A6,One in six Black men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lifetime. Early detection is key to saving lives,"By Nicquel Terry Ellis, CNN","4 minute read Published 7:15 AM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/26/us/black-men-prostate-cancer-risks-reaj/,"Nate Battle said he had avoided doctor’s visits for most of his life until 2014, when his insurance company began incentivizing preventive health screenings.
Battle, who is Black and was 49 at the time, said he made an appointment, thinking it would be routine and harmless. But the results from a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test led to a series of other procedures that ultimately revealed Battle had aggressive prostate cancer.
Battle told CNN that he was able to have his prostate removed and that he’s thankful the cancer was caught early.
“At my follow-up appointment the doctor said, ‘You had another six months before things were going to get really bad for you,’” Battle recalled. “That was really scary to hear.”
One in six Black men will develop prostate cancer in their lifetime, according to the advocacy organization ZERO Prostate Cancer. Research from the American Cancer Society shows Black men are more than twice as likely to die from the disease than their White counterparts.

The stark racial disparity has spurred health advocates like Battle to sound the alarm and urge Black men to consider getting prostate cancer screenings.
The rate of prostate cancer among Black men has been underscored in recent weeks as Dexter King, the youngest son of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., died after a battle with prostate cancer. And in December, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin underwent a prostatectomy to treat prostate cancer that was discovered that same month.
Doctors and health advocates suggest the disparity in deaths results from a lack of access to quality health care in many Black communities, mistrust and avoidance of the health care system, and the stigma surrounding the disease, which oftentimes means Black men aren’t discussing their diagnosis with other people.
These factors can also be barriers to screening, doctors say.
According to the American Cancer Society, “having a father or brother with prostate cancer more than doubles a man’s risk of developing this disease,” but the disease is easier to treat when it’s diagnosed at an earlier stage.
Dr. Otis Brawley, professor of oncology and epidemiology at Johns Hopkins University, said the death rates among Black men are also higher because health care facilities in marginalized Black and brown communities often have doctors with less training and fewer resources for providing high-quality care. Low-income people, he added, are also less likely to seek health screenings because of the associated costs.
“If you take Black men and White men who are stage II and give them equal treatment, you end up with equal outcome and equal prognosis,” Brawley said. “If you remove the insurance issues, social issues, racism issues and give everybody equal quality of care, you end up with equal outcomes.”
Brawley said there is also a stigma surrounding the digital rectal examination, which requires that a health care provider insert a gloved finger into a man’s rectum to feel the prostate for abnormalities.
Brawley said many of his Black patients have refused to go through with that procedure.
In 2021, Brawley was part of a team at Johns Hopkins that launched the Schaufeld Program for Prostate Cancer in Black Men, which travels to barbershops in the Baltimore and Washington, D.C. areas, to raise awareness about prostate cancer and screening in Black communities.
“A lot of men in their 30s and 40s don’t even know what the prostate is, or where it is,” Brawley said. “We want them to know [screening] is available, and we want them to understand that we are respecting their choice.”

Courtney Bugler, president and CEO of ZERO Prostate Cancer, said she has spoken with some Black men who had no idea they had a family history of prostate cancer because no one ever discussed it.
“What we find is, because men are not always interacting with their health care providers in a regular fashion and because they don’t realize they are at risk for the disease, they don’t know to be more vigilant,” she said.
ZERO Prostate Cancer has spent more than two decades working to raise awareness of the disease. Bugler said the organization is also lobbying Congress to pass the PSA Screening for High Risk Insured Men Act.  The measure would require health insurance companies to offer prostate-specific antigen screenings for Black men or men between ages 55 and 69 who have a family history of prostate cancer without co-pays, deductibles or co-insurance.
Bugler said ZERO Prostate Cancer recommends that Black men start talking to their doctors about the risks and benefits of prostate cancer screening at the age of 40. She also encourages them to share their stories of survival with one another.
Although Battle knew that there were men in his family with the disease, he said he still refused to go to the doctor for years. He blames toxic masculinity and stubbornness, which he said can also play a role in preventing Black men from getting screened for prostate cancer.
“It’s ingrained in us that we are supposed to be strong,” Battle said.
But this mindset is only contributing to the high prostate cancer death rates in the Black community, Battle said.
“It’s about putting your pride aside,” Battle said. “And asking yourself, is your pride more important than your life?”"
0SVQMKMQDT_6L5AXK0675RO2J0,McConnell says immigration talks in ‘quandary’ as Trump lobbies Congress to kill deal,"By Manu Raju, Lauren Fox and Ted Barrett, CNN","5 minute read Updated 9:33 AM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/24/politics/mcconnell-senate-gop-border-ukraine-package/,"Former President Donald Trump’s push to kill a bipartisan immigration deal may now derail a major national security package, forcing Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell to suggest a new course of action and endangering aid to Ukraine and Israel in the process.
According to a GOP source familiar with the matter, McConnell told Republicans at a private Wednesday meeting that they are in a “quandary,” given that bipartisan talks over immigration have created intraparty feuding and may have closed off a path to getting a massive package approved this Congress.
The fresh doubts from the Senate GOP leader – one of the leading proponents of more aid to Ukraine – suggest Congress may have to punt on the issues altogether or break up the package into individual pieces, though no decisions have been made. McConnell’s goal at the meeting, sources said, was to lay out to his colleagues that there was no clear path ahead unless members were willing to compromise.
The new doubts come as House Republicans – with the encouragement of Trump, who is railing on immigration as a top election issue – are revolting over the bipartisan talks, even before they’ve concluded. Republicans were already divided over whether to approve any aid to Ukraine, even as they have insisted that the border must be dealt with before Ukraine aid can be approved. On top of that, the House Republican demand to pass their border security bill – HR 2 – is a non-starter with Democrats.
The candid assessment, reported earlier by Punchbowl News, underscores the growing fears that Congress won’t be able to approve aid to Ukraine at a critical moment in its war against Russia – or pass any legislation to clamp down on the surge of migrants at the southern border.
During the meeting, McConnell read a quote from Trump in 2018 that cast doubt on Democrats ever voting for border security, a message to his GOP colleagues that this may be the best opportunity Republicans have to get border security in decades.
“He did a good job of quoting Donald Trump saying in 2018 that we will never get a Democrat to vote for this [border] stuff,” Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota said.
Senate Republicans engaged in a lengthy debate behind closed doors over the future of US aid to Ukraine, but the GOP emerged still divided over the best path forward as lawmakers remain stuck over how to get a bill to aid Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan and the US border across the finish line.
“We had a thorough airing of views,” Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn said.
Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, said at this point, he thinks he has a good sense of where everyone in the conference is but that there was no grand resolution.
“It was one of the most thoughtful discussions, sincere emotional discussions, we’ve had. I think that we will have a conference too divided on Ukraine, but we’re united in securing the border,” Sen. Roger Marshall, a Republican from Kansas, said.
GOP members emerging said it was less about finding a unified position (there is none) and more about giving members an opportunity to state their case and engage in a debate. Members also said that McConnell played the part of “historian in the room,” reminding the conference of where they once were and the opportunity at hand on the border.
“He is attentive and he understands the historical lay of the land and it is very instructive when he does those things, when he reminds us of other opportunities lost, how far James Lankford has brought us further than we have ever been in 30 years,” Cramer said.
Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina who is among those supportive of more aid, said he just wants to remind his colleagues there are consequences to not taking action.
“This won’t take decades to regret. This will be in a matter of years and so people who chose to ultimately to exit Ukraine if they are successful – for as long as I am breathing – I will remind them of the consequences I am convinced we will have to live with,” Tillis said.
Sen. Mitt Romney, a Republican from Utah who is supportive of the US aiding the war effort in Ukraine, said that Sens. Jerry Moran, Jim Risch and Susan Collins made rousing appeals in support of the effort.
Cramer told reporters that Risch, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, actually played a clip of the late Sen. John McCain talking about Russian President Vladimir Putin after the invasion of Crimea.
But it’s a delicate balance for many in the GOP conference.
“We have to figure out a way to sustain this fight without depleting our capabilities around the world. I don’t think that strategy should be whatever it costs for however long it takes. That’s neither realistic nor wise but it also can’t be we are walking away when we are done because we’ll pay a price for that too,” Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida said.
Asked if the meeting was tense, Rubio laughed it off, saying, “Compared to what?” Reminded that Tuesday’s lunch was animated and boisterous, Rubio quipped: “That’s not tense. Just because they don’t let us bring knives and forks anymore.”
Rubio reminded reporters that was a joke.

0UX8AZ7KS3_LF2E7HPC0G1OXH4,Redistricting fights in these states could determine which party controls the US House,"By Fredreka Schouten, CNN","11 minute read Published 5:50 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,http://us.cnn.com/politics/redistricting-states-congressional-maps-house/,"Around the country, politicians are waging high-stakes battles over new congressional lines that could influence which party controls the US House of Representatives after the 2024 election.
In North Carolina, the Republicans who control the state legislature have crafted a map that could help them flip at least three seats. Democrats, meanwhile, could pick up seats under news lines in Alabama, Louisiana and New York.
In all, the fate of anywhere from 14 to 18 House seats across nearly a dozen states could turn on the results of these fights. Republicans currently hold just a narrow majority in the US House, with one vacancy. That razor-thin margin was underscored by the GOP’s recent chaotic struggle to elect a new speaker.
“Given that the majority is so narrow, every outcome matters to the fight for House control in 2024,” said David Wasserman, who follows redistricting closely as senior editor and elections analyst for The Cook Political Report with Amy Walter.
And with fewer competitive districts that swing between the political parties, Wasserman added, “every line change is almost existential.”

Experts say several other factors have helped lead to the slew of consequential – and unresolved – redistricting disputes, just months before the first primaries of the 2024 cycle.
They include pandemic-related delays in completing the 2020 census – the once-a-decade population count that kicks off congressional and state legislative redistricting – as well as a 2019 Supreme Court ruling that threw decisions about partisan gerrymandering back to state courts.
In addition, some litigation had been frozen in place until the US Supreme Court’s surprise ruling in June, which found that a Republican-crafted redistricting plan in Alabama disadvantaged Black voters in the state and was in violation of the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act.
That decision “is functionally reanimating all of these dormant cases,” said Adam Kincaid, the president and executive director of the National Republican Redistricting Trust, which supports the GOP’s redistricting efforts.
Kincaid said it’s too soon to tell whether Republicans or Democrats will emerge with the advantage by Election Day 2024. In his view, either party could gain or lose only about two seats over redistricting.
In many of the closely watched states where action is pending, just a single seat hangs in the balance, with two notable exceptions: North Carolina and New York, where multiple seats are at stake. Republicans controlled the map-drawing in the Tar Heel State, while a ruling by New York’s highest court leaves the job ultimately to the Democrats who control the state legislature, potentially canceling out each party’s gains.
“Democrats kind of need to run the table in the rest of these states” to gain any edge, said Nick Seabrook, a political scientist at the University of North Florida and the author of the 2022 book “One Person, One Vote: A Surprising History of Gerrymandering in America.”
Here’s a state-by-state look at recent and upcoming redistricting disputes that could shape the 2024 race for control of the US House:
North Carolina’s legislature, where Republicans hold a supermajority, has drawn new congressional lines that observers say could prove a windfall for the GOP and boost the party’s chances of retaining its House majority next year.
The state’s current House delegation is split 7-7 between Democrats and Republicans.
A map that state lawmakers recently approved puts three House Democrats in what one expert called “almost impossible to win” districts.
The affected Democrats are Reps. Jeff Jackson, who currently represents a Charlotte-area district; Wiley Nickel, who holds a Raleigh-area seat; and Kathy Manning, who represents Greensboro and other parts of north-central North Carolina. All three have announced they will not seek reelection to the House.
A fourth Democrat, Rep. Don Davis, saw his district retooled to become more friendly toward Republicans while remaining competitive for both parties.
State-level gains in the 2022 midterm elections have given the GOP new sway over redistricting in this swing state. Last year, Republicans flipped North Carolina’s Supreme Court, whose members are chosen in partisan elections. The new GOP majority on the court this year tossed out a 2022 ruling by the then-Democratic leaning court against partisan gerrymandering.
A map that had been created after the Democratic-led high court’s ruling resulted in the current even split in the state’s House delegation.
Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper does not have veto power over redistricting legislation. A group of Black and Latino residents of North Carolina recently filed a lawsuit alleging that the GOP-approved map “intentionally discriminates” against minority voters in violation of the US Constitution.
In one of the cycle’s highest-profile redistricting cases, a three-judge panel in Alabama approved a map that creates a second congressional district with a substantial Black population. Before the court action, Alabama – which is 27% Black – had only one Black-majority congressional district out of seven seats.
The fight over the map went all the way to the Supreme Court – which issued a surprise ruling, affirming a lower-court opinion that ordered Alabama to include a second Black-majority district or “something quite close to it.” Under the map that will be in place for the 2024 election, the state’s 2nd District now loops into Mobile to create a seat where nearly half the population is Black.
The high court’s 5-4 decision in June saw two conservatives, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, side with the three liberals to uphold the lower-court ruling. Their action kept intact a key pillar of the Voting Rights Act: that it’s illegal to draw maps that effectively keep Black voters from electing a candidate of their choice.
The ruling has reverberated around the country and could affect the outcome of similar court cases underway in Louisiana and Georgia that center on whether Republican-drawn maps improperly diluted Black political power in those states.
Given that Black voters in Alabama have traditionally backed Democrats, the party now stands a better chance of winning the newly reconfigured district and sending to of its members to Congress after next year’s elections.
The new map also could result in two Black US House members from Alabama serving together for the first time in state history.
Facing a court-ordered deadline, the Republican-controlled state legislature in January approved a map with a second, Black-majority district that will be in effect for this year’s elections.
The action, which is viewed as a win for Democrats, endangers a seat now held by Republican Rep. Garret Graves.
The new map follows a protracted legal battle over the state’s district lines.
Although Black people make up roughly a third of the state’s population, Louisiana has just one Black lawmaker – who is also the lone Democrat – in its six-member congressional delegation.
A federal judge threw out the state’s Republican-drawn map in 2022, saying it likely violated the Voting Rights Act. Republican officials in the state appealed to the US Supreme Court, which put the lower-court ruling on hold until it decided the Alabama case, which it did in June this year.
Once the high court weighed in on the Alabama case, the legal skirmishes again lurched to life in Louisiana.
A federal court had given the GOP-controlled state legislature until the end of January to draw a new map, after deciding that the lower court had ruled correctly that the lawmakers’ map improperly diluted the voting power of Louisiana’s Black residents.
If the legislature had﻿ not acted by that deadline, the lower court could have proceeded to a full trial to resolve the map in time for this year’s elections.
Georgia Republicans, who hold a governing trifecta in the state, finalized a new congressional map last year that safeguarded their party’s dominance in state politics and dashed Democrats’ hopes of adding an additional US House seat.
The new map complied with an order issued by US District Judge Steve Jones to establish an additional Black-majority district. But it preserved the GOP’s 9-5 edge in Georgia’s US House delegation by moving the Atlanta-area district represented by﻿ Rep. Lucy McBath, a Black Democrat, farther into Republican territory.
Jones had ordered state lawmakers to draw a new congressional map by December 8, arguing that the Republican-controlled legislature improperly diluted the political power of Black voters in their establishment of district boundaries following the 2020 census. In that ruling, Jones said state lawmakers’ earlier map had violated the Voting Rights Act.
In a big win for Republicans, Jones in late December ruled that the new legislature-drawn map that preserved Republicans’ 9-5 advantage “fully complied” with his order.
A separate federal case in Georgia challenges the congressional map on constitutional grounds.
Republicans flipped four US House seats in New York in the 2022 midterm elections, victories that helped secure their party’s majority in the chamber.
But a new ruling by the state’s highest court could jeopardize those gains by potentially making it easier for Democrats to pick up as many as six GOP-held seats.
First, a bit of history: A state court judge oversaw the process of drawing the current map following a long legal battle and the inability of New York’s bipartisan Independent Redistricting Commission to agree on new lines. But Democrats scored a court victory this summer when a state appellate court ruled that the redistricting commission should redraw the map.
Republicans appealed that decision, and oral arguments were held in November before New York’s Court of Appeals, the state’s highest court.
On December 12, the Court of Appeals ordered the state to once again restart the mapmaking process. New York’s redistricting commission will be tasked with creating the new districts by February 28. The Democratic-controlled state legislature would have ultimate say over the new map.
A state judge in September struck down congressional lines for northern Florida that had been championed by Gov. Ron DeSantis, ruling that the Republican governor’s map had improperly diluted Black voting power.
This case, unlike the Alabama fight decided by the US Supreme Court, centers on provisions in the state constitution.
The judge concluded that the congressional boundaries – which essentially dismantled a seat once held by Al Lawson, a Black Democrat, that connected Black communities across a northern reach of the Florida – violated the state’s Fair Districts amendments, enacted by voters. One amendment specifically bars the state from drawing a district that diminishes the ability of racial minorities “to elect representatives of their choice.”
But in December, a state appeals court upheld the map DeSantis had advocated, saying the plaintiffs “failed to present any evidence” that the earlier version of the district – which connected Black communities from Jacksonville to Tallahassee – contained a singular cohesive community that would have a right to protection under Florida’s constitution.
The case still could land before the all-Republican state Supreme Court, where DeSantis appointees hold most seats.
A separate federal case – which argues that the map violates the US Constitution – is pending.
Observers say the outcome of the state litigation is more likely than the federal case to determine the future of the North Florida district, given the state constitution’s especially strong protections for the voting rights of racial minorities and the lower burden of proof required to establish that those rights were abridged.
The Kentucky Supreme Court  in December rejected arguments from Democrats that a map drawn by the state’s Republican-controlled legislature violated the state constitution as an “extreme partisan” gerrymander.
The dispute centered on lawmakers’ decision to move Kentucky’s capital city – Democratic-leaning Frankfort – out of the 6th Congressional District and into an oddly shaped – and solidly Republican – 1st District. Doing so helped shore up GOP odds of holding the 6th District, represented by Rep. Andy Barr.
The seat was among the more competitive ones in Kentucky under its previous lines. (Democrat Amy McGrath came within 3 points of beating Barr in 2018; last year, Barr won a sixth term under the new lines by 29 points.)
A lower-court judge had ruled that the Republican-drawn map did not violate the state’s constitution, and the state’s high court, in a December 14 ruling, agreed.
A redistricting case pending before the US Supreme Court centers on the future of a Charleston-area seat held by Republican Rep. Nancy Mace, who made headlines recently for joining House GOP hard-liners in voting to remove Kevin McCarthy as speaker.
Earlier this year, a three-judge panel concluded that lines for the coastal 1st Congressional District, as drawn by state GOP lawmakers, amounted to an unconstitutional racial gerrymander.
The Republican lawmakers appealed to the US Supreme Court. During oral arguments, several justices in the court’s conservative majority expressed skepticism that South Carolina officials had engaged in an improper racial gerrymander and seemed inclined to reinstate the lawmakers’ map.
Republicans in New Mexico say the congressional lines drawn by the Democrats who control state government amount to an illegal gerrymander under the state’s constitution.
At stake: a swing district along the US border with Mexico. If Republicans prevail, the 2nd District seat – now held by a Democratic Rep. Gabe Vasquez – could become more favorable to Republicans.
A state judge in October upheld the map drawn by Democrats, and the New Mexico Supreme Court recently affirmed that ruling.
New Mexico GOP Chairman Steve Pearce, who represented an earlier version of the seat in Congress, said the party was “contemplating our next course of action in conference with our legal team.”
The state Supreme Court, in a case it heard in July, is considering whether it even has the authority to weigh in on map-drawing decisions by the GOP-controlled state legislature.
Republican state officials argue that the court’s power over redistricting decisions is limited.
Advocacy groups and a handful of voters are challenging a congressional map that further carved up Democratic-leaning Salt Lake County between four decidedly Republican districts.
Doing so, the plaintiffs argued in their lawsuit, “takes a slice of Salt Lake County and grafts it onto large swaths of the rest of Utah,” allowing Republican voters in rural areas and smaller cities far away from Salt Lake to “dictate the outcome of elections.”
Redistricting fights over congressional maps are ongoing in several other states – ranging from Texas to Tennessee – but those cases might not be resolved in time to affect next year’s elections.

0WJRNLPGUA_KLBLI3DT31KS1L1,An Alabama inmate was executed with nitrogen gas. How does it work?,"By Lauren Mascarenhas, CNN","5 minute read Updated 11:11 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/25/us/nitrogen-gas-execution/,"Alabama inmate Kenneth Smith was put to death Thursday night, marking the nation’s first known execution using nitrogen gas.
Smith, who was sentenced to death for his role in a 1988 murder for hire and already survived a botched execution attempt by lethal injection, was at the center of a heated debate over whether the execution method constitutes cruelty.
Smith’s lawyers made several eleventh-hour attempts to prevent the execution. A federal appeals court on Wednesday and the US Supreme Court on Wednesday and Thursday declined to halt it.
Related article Alabama plans the first nitrogen gas execution this week in largely secret process experts say raises concerns about cruelty
“Execution is a very specific kind of punishment, and no punishment, according to the US Constitution, can be carried out in a cruel fashion,” Dr. Joel Zivot, an associate professor of anesthesiology and surgery at Emory University, told CNN. “And so the only real question is: Is execution with nitrogen gas cruel?”
Officials started using lethal injection to kill people on death row about 40 years ago, and it’s since become the most widely used execution method across the 27 states where capital punishment is legal.
Around 2009, the drugs used to carry out lethal injections became harder to access, and states began turning to alternative drugs – a shift that has been tied to a surge of complications with the procedure.
That’s what happened when Alabama first tried to execute Smith in November 2022, and officials were unable to set an intravenous line before the execution warrant expired.
Only three states – Alabama, Oklahoma and Mississippi – have approved the use of nitrogen gas for capital punishment, and experts say there is no real blueprint for the execution method. Alabama has published a protocol for the procedure, though it contains redactions the state says are meant to maintain security.
Alabama officials planned to use a mask to administer the nitrogen to Smith. Smith likely would have been strapped down when this occurred, Zivot said before the execution.
Nitrogen hypoxia would occur when a high concentration of the gas is inhaled, replacing oxygen in the body and causing death.
The process essentially disables the respiratory system, said Dr. Jonathan Groner, a professor of surgery at The Ohio State University College of Medicine.
Some officials say that a person would likely lose consciousness shortly into the procedure, making it more humane than other execution methods. However, doctors have said that they could not pinpoint if or when a person will lose consciousness when exposed to high concentrations of nitrogen gas.
On Thursday night, the execution process started at 7:53 p.m. CT, and a physician pronounced Smith dead at 8:25 p.m. CT, Alabama Department of Corrections Commissioner John Hamm said. Nitrogen flowed for about 15 minutes during that time, and “nothing … out of the ordinary” happened compared to “what we were expecting,” Hamm said.
According to witnesses from the news media, Smith “appeared conscious for several minutes into the execution.”
“For about two minutes following that, Kenneth Smith shook and writhed … on a gurney,” the media witnesses said in a joint report. “That was followed by several minutes of deep breaths on the gurney.”
“Following that, his breath slowed until it was no longer perceptible for media witnesses,” the journalists said in their joint report.
Asked whether the shaking and writhing was evidence that Smith suffered, Hamm said: “(It) appeared that, one, Smith was holding his breath has long as he could.”
“And then there’s also information out there that he struggled against his restrains a little but, but there’s some involuntary movement and some agonal breathing, so that was all expected and is in the side effects that we’ve seen or researched on nitrogen hypoxia,” Hamm said. Agonal breathing is usually described as a kind of gasping seen in people who are dying.
This month, United Nations experts raised the alarm that Smith’s execution could constitute torture, saying in a news release, “We are concerned that nitrogen hypoxia would result in a painful and humiliating death.”
While doctors couldn’t say definitely, ahead of the execution, what would happen to Smith, the possibilities left many concerned.
If a mask is not secured tightly enough, oxygen could leak in, prolonging the death, experts say.
“When we put 100% non-rebreather face masks on our patients, they never get 100%, because there’s some leakage,” Groner said before Smith’s execution. “I feel pretty confident that he’s not going to just take a deep breath and go to sleep. I think that’s unlikely.”

Doctors say the lack of oxygen could lead to seizures, which have been observed in patients experiencing hypoxia.
There’s also a possibility that a person being executed with this method could vomit into the mask, which could cause choking or asphyxiation if inhaled into the lungs.
The Department of Corrections altered Smith’s last meal schedule after concerns were raised that he had been “vomiting repeatedly.”
Even if a person is fasting, they can still vomit water or stomach fluids, experts say. If stomach acid is aspirated, it could burn the lungs, Zivot noted.
The stress, anxiety or flat-out fear that a person might feel before execution shouldn’t be ruled out, Groner said.
“When we have an operation and someone’s totally terrified, they actually respond differently to anesthetics, so a lot of times we’ll give them a sedative before we even go into the operating room,” he said before Smith’s execution. “There’s no talk anywhere of giving (Smith) anything to relax him.”
With most lethal injections, a person is first given an anesthetic to render them unconscious.
Increased stress has been linked to heart attacks and other medical events.
In a botched 2014 execution, Oklahoma death row inmate Clayton Lockett was declared dead of a heart attack more than an hour after being strapped to a gurney for an attempted lethal injection.
Officials say what happened in the Alabama execution chamber Thursday night could set a precedent for other death row prisoners in the state and beyond.
If the procedure did not kill Smith, complications could have left him injured or with serious brain damage, experts said before the execution.
“If they produce a corpse, then the states that want to do this will start doing it,” said Zivot.

Colombia’s President Gustavo Petro declared a “situation of disaster and calamity,” telling reporters that funds previously approved for other purposes are being redirected to deal with the crisis.
The government is also seeking international help, he said, adding that the United States, Chile, Peru and Canada, “which has enormous experience [fighting fires],” have responded to the call. Petro said he’s also seeking the cooperation of the United Nations and the European Union.
The fires are the result of hot and dry conditions linked to the El Niño weather phenomenon, according to officials. El Niño is expected to continue for the next few months before ending during the Northern Hemisphere spring.
Petro warned that the situation, which he described as a “climate crisis,” will get worse. “We are going toward an increasingly difficult stage,” he said.
Temperatures across much of the country have been 5 to 10 degrees Celsius above normal in recent days and weeks. Many locations are in the mid to even upper 30s C (upper 90s to low 100s F) and are coming on the heels of above-average temperatures across the region in recent months.
At least 25 active fires were reported on Thursday by the National Disaster Risk Management Unit. Ten are under control and 217 have been extinguished, the agency said.
Billowing smoke has overwhelmed some areas in the country and led to flights being cancelled in the capital Bogota.
The city’s El Dorado airport operated with restrictions Thursday morning due to low visibility from smoke and fog.
“We estimate that the phenomenon is composed of 70% fog and 30% smoke,” the Civil Aviation Authority of Colombia said on X.
At least 138 flights were affected, 48 were canceled and 16 were rerouted to other airports, the authority reported."
0XVIM42QCZ_BZO3TYYUTYLMKKU,Fact check: Trump makes false claims in New Hampshire victory speech,"By Daniel Dale, CNN","4 minute read Updated 12:10 AM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/23/politics/fact-check-donald-trump-new-hampshire-victory-speech/,"Former President Donald Trump made several false claims in a speech Tuesday night after CNN and other media outlets projected that he would win the Republican presidential primary in New Hampshire.
CNN also watched rival candidate Nikki Haley’s Tuesday night speech in New Hampshire; Haley’s claims were either accurate or too general to fact check. Here is a fact check of some of Trump’s assertions.
Trump repeated some of his familiar lies about the 2020 presidential election.
At one point, he claimed, as he has repeatedly in the past, that “they used Covid to cheat.” At another point, he claimed that in addition to winning in 2016, “we also won in 2020 – by more. And we did much better in 2020 than we did in 2016.” He dismissively said, “But as they said, we lost by a whisker.”
Facts First: Trump’s claims are false. He lost the 2020 election fair and square to Joe Biden, by a 306 to 232 margin in the Electoral College, and also lost New Hampshire in that election. There remains no evidence of any fraud even close to widespread enough to have changed the outcome in any state.
Trump Tuesday night said, “Do they hate our country? They must hate our country. Because there’s no other reason that they can be doing the things they do. Take a look – the taxes, they want to raise your taxes times four.”
Facts First: This is false. Neither Biden nor other top Democrats are proposing anything close to quadrupling people’s taxes.
CNN previously fact-checked a similar Trump claim that “they want to double, triple everything.”
Howard Gleckman, senior fellow in the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center at the Urban Institute think tank, said in a November email: “I don’t know what ‘they want to double, triple everything’ means. But if he’s suggesting that Biden would ‘double, triple’ federal income taxes, he’s just making up numbers. There is no evidence to support that claim.”
Gleckman said his organization’s analysis of Biden’s budget proposal for fiscal 2024, which included his most recent tax plan, found that the major tax provisions would “would raise taxes by an average of $2,290, or reduce taxable income by 2.3 percent.”
Trump claimed that he has always won the state – not only in Republican primaries but in general elections.
“You know we won New Hampshire three times now three. We win it every time. We win the primary. We win the generals. We won it and it’s a very, very special place to me.” Trump said.
Facts First: Trump’s claim is false. He lost New Hampshire to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the 2016 general election and to Democratic candidate Joe Biden in the 2020 general election, though he did win the Republican primary each time.
Criticizing Republican New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, a supporter of Haley, Trump said that because of Sununu’s incompetence, “in the Republican primary, they accepted Democrats to vote. In fact, I think they had 4,000 Democrats – Democrats before October 6 – they already voted. Now, they’re only voting because they want to make me look as bad as possible.”
Facts First: Trump’s claims are misleading at best. People registered as Democrats were not allowed to vote in New Hampshire’s Republican primary. Only registered Republicans and independents (people registered as “undeclared”) were allowed to cast ballots in that primary. While it’s true that nearly 4,000 people who had been registered as Democrats switched their affiliation to either undeclared or Republican by October 6, the last day to switch in time to potentially cast a ballot in the GOP primary, it’s not yet clear how many of these people actually ended up voting. And it’s important to note that New Hampshire made its primaries open to independents decades before Sununu became governor in 2017.
Also, while Trump was complaining about people formerly registered as Democrats being permitted to vote in the Republican primary, it is standard for states to allow people to switch affiliations by a certain date in order to participate in another party’s primary – and some states have switching deadlines closer to an election day than New Hampshire does. In Trump’s state of Florida, to name one, voters can switch from Democratic to Republican by February 20 and cast a ballot in the Republican primary in the early voting window that begins less than three weeks later or in person a month later on the March 19 election day. (Unlike in New Hampshire, independents can’t cast Republican primary ballots there.)
Finally, the motivations of the recent New Hampshire affiliation-switchers are not nearly as clear as Trump suggested. While some might have indeed switched with the sole intention of opposing him, some others might have sincerely decided that they no longer saw themselves as Democrats. There was all kinds of affiliation-switching before October 6. For example, the New Hampshire Bulletin reported that 719 people switched from Republican to undeclared and 132 people switched from undeclared to Republican."
0ZHC5IR7F0_1VBNZ5LGR4515YY,These Trump supporters show why the former president is dominating the race,"By Arit John, CNN","5 minute read Published 7:00 AM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/24/politics/new-hampshire-trump-voter-voices/,"Bonnie Cote never considered voting for anyone other than former President Donald Trump.
As she stood outside her hometown’s opera house, where Trump held one of his final Granite State campaign rallies earlier this week, the 33-year-old said she was “relieved” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis dropped out and that she didn’t know former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley existed until that evening. Though Trump wasn’t necessarily “presidential material,” she said he was braver than anyone else running and felt he was robbed of a second term in 2020.
“I voted for Trump the last time and I’ll keep voting for him, unless there’s somebody that is right there and has the same morals and values of Trump, trying to make America great again,” she said.
With the help of voters like Cote, Trump won the New Hampshire primary Tuesday, reinforcing what months of polls, political endorsements, focus groups and the results of the Iowa caucuses have shown: Many GOP voters aren’t interested in an alternative to the former president.
His win, and the thoughts and feelings that motivated the voters that gave it to him, offer sobering lessons to his last remaining major GOP rival.
Related article Five takeaways from the New Hampshire primary
In more than a dozen interviews, Trump’s backers here described his first term in office as a time of economic prosperity and global peace, dismissed the four criminal indictments against him as attacks from Democrats and, at times, expressed the unfounded view that the 2020 presidential election was stolen due to widespread voter fraud. Many acknowledged his behavior wasn’t what they would like, but he was a known and proven entity, unlike his rivals, they said.
Despite months of campaigning and millions spent on ads, mailers and door knocking in the Granite State, some Trump supporters said they were unfamiliar with Haley. Some were turned off by the little they had heard. And many never even considered voting for anyone else.
Adrienne Kirwin, a 74-year-old from Derry, said most of her exposure to Haley came from items stuffed into her mailbox. First, she backed South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, but then he dropped out and backed Trump. Then she liked DeSantis, until he did the same.
“I was thinking of Nikki Haley but then when everybody, like I said, started endorsing Trump,” she said outside her polling place, where she voted for the former president. “Everybody came out for Trump, Trump, Trump… so, why not go for Trump?”
Kirwin said she thought Trump was “a little crazy” and his found his personality “awful,” but she also recalled watching him in the first 2016 general election debate against Hillary Clinton.
“Everything he said, it was like he was saying it to me,” she recalled during an interview in the parking lot of her polling place Tuesday afternoon. “And I said, ‘This man loves the country.’”
Her husband, 85-year-old Raymond Kirwin, was less conflicted.
“I didn’t consider anyone else,” he said. “He did more than any president in my life, and I was gonna come back and hope he’d do the same thing again.”
Christy Piper, a 38-year-old from Dover, said that while she was open to other candidates, the former president was always her top choice. “It’s always been Trump,” she said outside the Trump rally in Rochester Sunday. “Trump’s messaging resonates the most, and I feel like he can just make the most difference out of any viable candidate running.”
Piper predicted Trump would win and said she believed he had a large pool of quiet support.
“It’s not really politically correct or safe to say that you’re a Trump supporter. So most people just keep their mouth shut,” she said. “His messaging resonates with so many people who are sick and tired of what’s going on in this country.”
Both Trump and Haley ratcheted up their attacks on each other heading out of New Hampshire. Flanked by former rivals, including Scott and biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, Trump railed against Haley for remaining in the race despite his two first place finishes.
“I don’t get too angry, I get even,” he told supporters in Nashua.
Haley highlighted his legal troubles and a recent a moment in which he confused her for former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
“With Donald Trump, you have one round of chaos after another,” she said Tuesday night during a post-primary speech in Concord. “This court case, that controversy, this tweet, that senior moment. You can’t fix Joe Biden’s chaos with Republican chaos.”
She has also tried to make the argument for electability. She has pointed to national and swing state general election polls that show her beating Biden by wider margins than Trump. On the trail and in fundraising emails, she told supporters there would be “no recounts, no lawsuits, and no doubts” about the election results if she took on Biden, and Republican ranks would swell in the House and Senate.
“We’ll rebuild our economy and secure our border,” her campaign said in a fundraising pitch the day before the election. “And make no mistake, we will restore our national pride.”
It’s an argument that has worked on some former Trump voters. Mike Condor, a 59-year-old from Derry, said he voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020. In the last election, he saw Trump as the lesser of two evils. This time, he said he would hope for a viable third party candidate if there is another Trump vs. Biden rematch, and backed Haley in the primary.
“I don’t want any chaos,” he said as he left his polling place with his wife Laura, 49, and daughter Mira, 18, both of whom also voted for Haley.
Laura, who voted for Republicans like John McCain and Mitt Romney before backing Democrats over Trump, said she hoped Haley would stay in even if she lost Tuesday’s election. Even if she trailed Trump with delegates, she thought the party needed a viable alternative to Trump.
“When we’re talking about people of this age and cognitive awareness, health things could happen,” she said. “So, I think that she makes a stronger case by having as many delegates as she can get.”
While Haley’s supporters are itching for a contest, the former president’s backers are hoping for a coronation.
Robert Stacy, a 26-year-old from Rochester said he hoped the nomination process would wrap up soon in Trump’s favor – and noted that he didn’t want the race to drag out, as it had in 2016.
“I think it would be a mistake for Nikki Haley to pull a Ted Cruz,” Stacy said."
10TJCZJLYP_LR5XZXL9WHN856L,‘Mass casualties’ as UN shelter struck amid intense fighting in Khan Younis,"By Celine Alkhaldi, Ibrahim Dahman and Kareem Khadder, CNN","5 minute read Updated 3:46 AM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/24/middleeast/khan-younis-gaza-un-shelter-strike-intl/,"A building sheltering hundreds of displaced people in the city of Khan Younis was hit by Israeli tank fire on Wednesday, according to the UN, as Israeli forces ramped up attacks on southern Gaza, forcing streams of Palestinians to flee the neighborhood.
Wreaths of smoke hung over the UN shelter, after a huge blaze broke out at the UNRWA Khan Younis Training Center, video obtained by CNN showed.
“Buildings ablaze and mass casualties. Safe access to and from the center has been denied for two days. People are trapped,” Thomas White, the director of UNRWA Affairs, said on X.
At least nine people were killed and another 75 injured, White said, adding that a team from his agency and the World Health Organization were trying to reach the site. He said the building shelters 800 people. UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini said on X that the entire Khan Younis Training Center, one of the largest UNRWA facilities in Gaza, was sheltering 30,000 people, and is clearly marked as a UN site.
In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had “currently” ruled out that the incident was “the result of an aerial or artillery strike by the IDF.”
It said a “thorough review of the operations of the forces in the vicinity is underway,” adding that it is “examining the possibility that the strike was a result of Hamas fire.”
In the past week, the IDF has intensified its offensive on Khan Younis, where medical facilities sheltering displaced civilians and health workers have been battered. The IDF maintains there are Hamas militants located in hospitals in the area. Relief agencies say the siege has blocked critical humanitarian operations.
The Israeli military launched its campaign in Gaza with the stated aim of eliminating Hamas, after more than 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 kidnapped during the militant group’s October 7 attacks on Israel, according to Israeli authorities.
Since then its bombardment and besiegement of the enclave has decimated swathes of the territory, diminishing food, fuel and water supplies and exposing more than 2.2 million civilians to starvation, dehydration and disease.
On Tuesday, UN Secretary-General António Guterres warned that Palestinians in Gaza “face inhumane, squalid conditions, struggling to simply make it through another day without proper shelter, heating, sanitary facilities, food and drinkable water.”
Israeli attacks on the Palestinian enclave have killed at least 25,700 people, and injured another 63,740, according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health in Gaza. CNN cannot independently verify the figures due to the difficulties of reporting from the war zone.
Palestinian health officials and paramedics have also reported Israeli tanks and attack drones firing at people trying to flee the vicinity of the Amal and Nasser hospitals in Khan Younis.
The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said Israeli forces have surrounded the Nasser Medical Complex, cutting off crucial medical, food, and fuel supplies.
“Hundreds of patients with infections and pregnant women are facing serious complications,” health ministry spokesperson Ashraf Al-Qudra said.
The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said Israeli forces are “surrounding” their headquarters and the Al-Amal Hospital and have enforced “restrictions on movement around both the building and the hospital”.
Six people were killed in attacks on Khan Younis on Wednesday, PRCS added, three of which had been “targeted” at the entrance of their headquarters.
Israeli tanks also surrounded the compound of the Al-Aqsa University in the city where thousands have been sheltering, Palestinian state news agency WAFA said. It said civilians had been targeted elsewhere in southern Gaza in the last 24 hours.
Four civilians, including a child, were killed in an Israeli attack on a “rest stop” in the coastal town of Al-Mawasi, and a man fleeing fighting in Khan Younis was struck in his car, reported WAFA.
Israeli forces conducted “numerous intense air raids, described as ‘fire belts’ to accompany its ground incursion, which has extended all the way to the west of Khan Younis,” a Geneva-based NGO advocating for human rights in the region, Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor, said on Wednesday
Euro-Med HR reported that shelters housing “tens of thousands” of displaced people in the western part of Khan Younis, and in Al-Mawasi, are under siege by the Israeli military.
The IDF said they continue to operate in Khan Younis, where they are pursuing “military targets, outposts, infrastructure and command and control centers,” and said the operation there will continue for “several days.”
“The brigade combat team is located around the [Khan Younis] camp, in the western part, and have begun to operate within it.  The manoeuvre will continue against military targets that are in the area, outposts, infrastructure, and command and control centers,” the IDF said.
“There is an area with shelters, there are several hospitals, several sensitive sites. We have seen terrorists use these sites. Almost a week ago we saw a launch from the Nasser Hospital, there are terrorists located in these hospitals.
“This operation will continue for several days until we maximize the achievements: dismantling Hamas’ military framework and Hamas strongholds, which we are required to thoroughly dismantle,” added the IDF.
CNN cannot independently verify operational details reported by the IDF. CNN has sought comment from the IDF on whether its forces have surrounded the Nasser and Amal hospitals.
As the IDF surrounded the city of Khan Younis, thousands of Palestinians moved south towards Rafah, near the border with Egypt, where 1.3 million people have been displaced, according to the UN.
A CNN video recorded on Monday shows displaced people sitting on the side of streets and in the vicinity of the seashore as they head west and south. The IDF instructed civilians to leave several districts in and around the city and head toward the coast, which it described to CNN as “safer.”
The video shows cars, trucks, and tractors transporting families and their essential belongings, such as blankets, mattresses and food. Many, however, were walking.
Hisham Sayegh said he saw four people killed, which forced him to leave with his family as shelling in the area intensifies.
“There are dead people on the ground. We left them behind. There are people killed inside the houses,” Sayegh said. “We were expecting to die at any minute.”
Jamal al Rozzi, an aid worker displaced near Khan Younis, said he was forced to flee to Rafah on Wednesday after heavy bombardment in the area.
“We had three horrible nights,” Al Rozzi, who is executive director of the National Society for Rehabilitation, told CNN in a voice message.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.
I host a podcast, “In the Room with Peter Bergen,” which focuses on national security issues. Every day, I see the merits of being part of an entirely remote workforce.
We have a production team, around half of whom live in Brooklyn and Manhattan, and the others live in places like Chicago, Mexico City and San Francisco. We have met in person only twice in the year that the production has been up and running, and we have put out dozens of highly produced episodes, often featuring multiple guests, which go through many rounds of edits.
In my four decades of working in media, I have never worked somewhere with a better esprit de corps, creative energy and a collective willingness to help everyone else out.
And yet, some corporate titans are still pushing for their employees to return to their offices. Banks like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase and tech giants like Meta are demanding that their staff be back at the office several days a week.
Those return-to-office demands are often couched in non-falsifiable claims about the necessity of having chance encounters at the office where folks bounce creative, productive ideas off of each other.
Typical of this view is JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who claimed in 2021 that working from home “doesn’t work for spontaneous idea generation.” There is no empirical evidence for this claim, and the desire for employers to see their employees working in their offices seems to be more about the need for control and an attachment to the old ways of doing things.
The return-to-office demands also make little sense from an overall economic perspective at a time when a third of Americans who can do their job remotely now only work from home, up from only 7% before Covid, according to the Pew Research Center, yet the economy is very strong in terms of low unemployment and GDP growth. If working from home suppressed innovation, productivity and creativity, you would expect quite different economic results.
Further, working from home saves Americans an average daily commute of 72 minutes a day, to say nothing about the reduced pollution and energy consumption that comes from fewer commuters, according to a 2023 University of Chicago study.

Working parents, in particular, benefit from not having to waste time, money and flexibility commuting to an office. A 2023 Bankrate survey found that 74% of working women with children are in favor of remote work, while 64% of all working Americans support it.
I have some insight into this as a parent who now works mostly from home. This arrangement gives me a lot more time to spend with my kids, and if there is any kind of unforeseen emergency, I can be there for them in a way that, during the era of the office, I couldn’t be.
The internet and cell phones obviate so much of what was once done at the office, which is, after all, largely an artifact of the 20th century thanks to the rise of mass transportation, the ability to build tall office buildings and the previous immovability of the “work” telephone, which was stuck to a desk. All this, thankfully, is going the way of the dodo.
During the office era, so many workers spent so much time at their desks that workplaces often tried to present themselves as some kind of alternative family. You had your “work husbands” and mandatory “team building” events. Of course, this all came at the expense of your loved ones at home, as you had to spend time away from them while doing all your office-based events and tasks.
I am writing this column in Washington, DC, but work with editors in New York, London or Atlanta. In fact, I have written several hundred of these columns over the past dozen years and I have never met most of the editors I work with, and yet I still have a warm, productive relationship with them.

To be sure, a Starbucks cappuccino is not going to make itself, and certain kinds of work environments — such as hospitals, restaurants, film sets or government offices where classified material is handled in a secure environment — require employees to be in person.
But for much of the economy where work doesn’t need to be in person, the demand to “return to office” is not rooted in any concern for employees, a large majority of whom want to work from home — not because they are lazy or don’t want to be productive, but because it gives them more freedom and control over their own lives.
So why do some bosses still feel it necessary to prolong the slow and necessary death of The Office? Beats me."

Both the British Museum and the V&A will send items related to the Asante royal court to Ghana, where they will be displayed at the Manhyia Palace Museum in Kumasi, according to a press release from the UK museums Thursday.
Many of the items, which include 13 pieces of Asante royal regalia, were looted during the Anglo-Asante wars, while some were part of an indemnity payment that the British forcibly extracted from the Asantehene, or Asante king. Others were sold at auction, entering private collections and museums worldwide.
Items displayed at the V&A in London were selected as “exemplars of the brilliant goldsmithing techniques practiced for centuries by the Asante royal goldsmiths” and served as inspiration for British artists and designers, reads the release.
Now they will be displayed in Ghana for the first time in 150 years, as part of an exhibition celebrating the 2024 Silver Jubilee of His Royal Majesty, the Asantehene, Osei Tutu II, as well as commemorating the Anglo-Asante war of 1873-74.
The items also include a small gold ornament in the shape of a sankuo, or lute-harp, and an ornament in the form of an eagle.
“Since the foundation of the Asante empire during the late 17th century, gold has been central to Asante identity, spirituality and economic stability,” reads the release.
“Asante kings grew powerful on local gold deposits and the palace in Kumasi became the focal point for a lucrative international gold trade,” it adds.
Gold is also used to decorate the royal throne and the Asantehene himself, as well as high-ranking court officials, according to the release.
“These ornaments carry meaning beyond their material value. They are invested with the spirits of former Asante kings and their decoration can be read by those familiar with the visual lexicon,” it continues.
Tristram Hunt, director of the V&A, said that he’s “proud” of the partnership.
“As part of our commitment to sharing collections with a colonial past, we are excited to see these items on public show, in Ghana, as part of Asantehene Otumfuo Osei Tutu II’s Silver Jubilee celebrations,” said Hunt in the release.
Lissant Bolton, keeper of Africa, Oceania and the Americas at the British Museum, hailed the partnership with the Manhyia Palace Museum.
“This relationship is of great importance to us. We are delighted to be lending these beautiful and significant cultural objects for display in Kumasi,” added Bolton.
The agreement comes amid ongoing calls for Western museums to give back stolen property – the cultural heritage of oppressed people plundered by colonial armies in the 19th century or taken unfairly by missionaries or ambassadors.
No less than 90% of African cultural property resides in European museums, according to a report commissioned by French President Emmanuel Macron, who has decided that much of it must be returned.
However, the British Museum has refused to give back to Greece the half of the Parthenon Marbles stolen by Lord Elgin, and the issue is a source of uncomfortable conversations at many other cultural institutions."

The first full moon of the new year, known as the wolf moon, will shine in the night sky Thursday.
January’s full moon reached peak illumination at 12:54 p.m. ET, but it will appear full through Friday evening, according to NASA.
Expect the bright orb to rise in the east around sunset Thursday and appear just about overhead around midnight, according to EarthSky.
Between Thursday evening and Friday morning, the full moon will be close to the bright star Pollux. The star will appear to rotate clockwise around the moon overnight, according to NASA.
January’s full moon is commonly called the wolf moon because wolves are active this time of year and can be heard howling on cold nights, according to the Old Farmer’s Almanac. The origin of the name stems from the Sioux language, which describes this moon as “wolves run together.”
But this wintry full moon also goes by many other monikers according to different Native American tribes: It’s known as the cold moon to the Cherokee people, the hard moon to the Lakota and the whirling wind moon to the Passamaquoddy tribe.
The full moon will be visible around the world, weather permitting, so bundle up to stay warm and enjoy the view. Here are other celestial events to look forward to this year.
Of the 12 full moons in 2024, September and October’s lunar events will be considered supermoons, according to EarthSky.
Definitions of a supermoon can vary, but the term generally denotes a full moon that is closer to Earth than normal and thus appears larger and brighter in the night sky. Some astronomers say the phenomenon occurs when the moon is within 90% of perigee — its closest approach to Earth in orbit.
Here are the remaining full moons of 2024:
February 24: Snow moon
March 25: Worm moon
April 23: Pink moon
May 23: Flower moon
June 21: Strawberry moon
July 21: Buck moon
August 19: Sturgeon moon
September 17: Harvest moon
October 17: Hunter’s moon
November 15: Beaver moon
December 15: Cold moon
Multiple eclipses will occur in 2024, including two types of lunar eclipses and two types of solar eclipses, according to the Old Farmer’s Almanac.
The most highly anticipated of these events is the total solar eclipse occurring on April 8, which will be visible to those in Mexico, the United States and Canada. A total solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between Earth and the sun, completely blocking the golden orb’s face.
Those within the path of totality, or locations where the moon’s shadow will completely cover the sun, will see a total solar eclipse.People outside the path of totality will still be able to see a partial solar eclipse, in which the moon only obscures part of the sun’s face.
A total solar eclipse won’t be visible across the contiguous US again until August 2044.
An annular solar eclipse will occur in the sky on October 2 over parts of South America. This type of eclipse is similar to a total solar eclipse, except the moon is at the farthest point in its orbit from Earth, so it can’t completely block the sun. Instead, annular solar eclipses create a “ring of fire” in the sky as the sun’s fiery light surrounds the moon’s shadow.

Meanwhile, a penumbral lunar eclipse will be visible to many across Europe, North and East Asia, Australia, Africa, North America, and South America between March 24 and 25.
A lunar eclipse, which causes the moon to look dark or dimmed, occurs when the sun, Earth and moon align so that the moon passes into Earth’s shadow. A penumbral lunar eclipse is more subtle and happens when the moon moves through the outer shadow, or penumbra, of Earth.
A partial lunar eclipse, in which Earth moves between the sun and the full moon without being perfectly aligned, will appear over Europe and much of Asia, Africa, North America and South America between September 17 and 18.
Check Time and Date’s website to see when each of these eclipses will appear.

Authorities learned Noah Roush and Jatonia Bryant were missing Monday around 10:30 a.m. from the Dub Brassell Adult Detention Center in Pine Bluff, about 40 miles south of Little Rock.
Roush, 22, was apprehended Thursday after authorities got a 911 call from a “citizen” who reported seeing someone matching the inmate’s description at an abandoned residence in Pine Bluff about 2 miles away from the detention center, the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office said in a news release.
When an officer arrived at the residence, Roush tried to flee on foot before he was captured and returned to custody at the detention center, the sheriff’s office said.
Roush was being held on suspicion of residential burglary and theft, according to inmate records. The sheriff’s office said Roush is “also a suspect in a homicide,” but did not provide additional details on the case.
Bryant, 23, was being held on suspicion of capital murder, among other offenses, inmate records show. He was still at large as of Thursday, the sheriff’s office said.
Bryant is 5 feet 11 inches tall, Black and weighs about 145 pounds, authorities previously said. The sheriff’s office announced a $2,500 reward for information that would lead to his capture.
“We are relieved to have Roush in custody, but we also remain vigilant in capturing Jatonia Bryant who remains at large,” the sheriff’s office said.
It’s unclear how Roush and Bryant managed to escape from the detention facility, or exactly when they got out. Authorities said Monday the pair was believed to have escaped in the previous 48 hours."
1CZNCL033Z_7CQECZSO8A773XG,The US and Iran are dangerously close to confrontation in the Middle East. Here’s where they both operate,"By Nadeen Ebrahim and Abbas Al Lawati, CNN","9 minute read Updated 7:16 AM EST, Mon January 29, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/24/middleeast/us-iran-middle-east-war-mime-intl/,"Editor’s Note: A version of this story appears in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here.
The war between Israel and Hamas has already spilled over to the wider Middle East, with prospects of a confrontation between regional and world powers becoming ever more likely.
Over the weekend, three US service members were killed and more than 30 were injured in a drone attack on a small US outpost in Jordan, according to US officials. It was the first time US troops were killed by enemy fire in the Middle East since the beginning of the Gaza war. US President Joe Biden cast the blame on Iran-backed groups, promising retribution. An umbrella group of Iranian-backed militias in Iraq said it had attacked US positions along the Jordan-Syria border, but Iran denied any direct involvement in the strikes.
Across the region, the fighting has largely been confined to tit-for-tat attacks between Iran-backed militias on one side and the US, Israel and its allies on the other. But the direct intervention of both Iran and the US in recent weeks, as well as the death of US troops, has heightened fears that the proxy conflict between the two could turn into a direct one.
US officials have repeatedly said they do not want to see the increasingly high tensions across the Middle East broaden into a regional war. So far, the US and Iran have avoided directly confronting each other. The US has attacked Iranian-backed groups in Yemen, Syria and Iraq, while Iran-linked groups have targeted American personnel in Iraq and Syria. Tehran has also struck what it said were anti-Iran groups in Iraq, Syria and Pakistan. Pakistan responded with retaliatory strikes.

The Islamic Republic, which has long opposed the presence of US forces in what it considers to be its backyard, has spent the past few decades building a network of Islamist, anti-Western and anti-Israel militias that it trains, funds and arms. Those groups have become more belligerent of late, especially Yemen’s Houthi rebels, who have disrupted a vital international waterway, wreaking havoc on global trade and prompting Western states to intervene. And it has built ties with and helped fund Hamas, which launched its war on Israel on October 7.
The US, having been trying to pivot away from the Middle East for years, finds itself drawn back into the region. It already had a sizeable military footprint in the region before the war, with over 30,000 troops.
Since the war began, however, Washington has significantly strengthened its military posture in the region, having moved roughly 1,200 US service members, alongside thousands of others aboard Navy carrier strike groups and a Marine Expeditionary Unit roughly 2,000 people strong.
And in some places, including Iraq and Syria, the US military presence overlaps that of Iran and its allies.
As tensions across the region rise, here is where Iran or its allies are present, where US forces are stationed and where both sides have conducted military operations since the start of the Israel-Hamas war:
Tehran wields significant influence on several Shiite militias closely tied to the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). These include Kataib Hezbollah, Harakat al-Nujaba, and Kata’ib Sayyid al-Shuhada.
Since the Israel-Hamas war started, a new group emerged calling itself the Islamic Resistance in Iraq (IRI). That was the group that took responsibility for the attack on Tower 22 in Jordan. According to the Washington Institute for Near East Policy (WINEP), a think tank, the IRI is an umbrella term used to describe the operations of all Iran-backed militias in Iraq. Its objective is to allow various Iraqi militias to attack US troops in Iraq and Syria under one umbrella term while obscuring the actual perpetrator, according to WINEP.
Experts say that some of the groups, like Kataib Hezbollah, are more answerable to the authorities in Tehran than to the government in Baghdad. The US Office of the Director of National Intelligence believes it has up to 10,000 members. Iraq is also home to the IRGC-founded Badr Organization as well as Asaib Ahl Al-Haq.
Iran-backed groups have carried out dozens of attacks against US forces in Iraq since the Gaza war started, to which the US has retaliated with airstrikes. Over the weekend, US personnel were injured in a ballistic missile attack on Al-Asad Air Base in Iraq. It appeared to be the second time ballistic missiles were used to target US and coalition forces in the country since October 7.
Until 2008, at the height of the Iraq war, the US had up to 160,000 troops in the country. Today, some 2,500 forces are deployed at several bases, including Erbil AB, Al-Asad AB, and the JOC-I (Union III) base in Baghdad.
Wary of his country becoming a staging ground for a regional war, Iraq’s prime minister this month said that Baghdad is seeking an exit of the US-led coalition. The US has stressed that its military is present in the country at the invitation of the government.
Iran has a direct presence in Syria, where its Quds Force, an elite unit of the IRGC that handles overseas operations, deployed after the 2011 uprising to back the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Its personnel served as military advisers and fought on the frontlines for Assad, alongside Iranian-backed militias.
Syria also hosts the Zainabiyoun and Fatemiyoun Brigades, Shiite militias linked to the IRGC who are believed to recruit Afghan and Pakistani fighters.
The US has 800 forces in Syria as part of an ongoing mission to defeat ISIS. Most US forces are stationed in what military officials call “the Eastern Syria Security Area,” where the US supports the anti-regime Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in the country’s northeast. There is also some US troop presence in Syria’s southeast, where the US supports the Syrian Free Army, which also opposes the Syrian regime. The regime considers the US to be an invader.
US troops in Syria have increasingly come under attack by Iran-backed groups in recent weeks, to which the US has responded with airstrikes.
The American troops were killed at Tower 22, a US base in northeastern Jordan near the border with Syria. US forces at the outpost are there as part of an advise-and-assist mission with Jordan. US officials said the drone was fired by Iran-backed militants and appeared to come from Syria.
The Islamic Resistance in Iraq said in a statement on Telegram that it had attacked four bases along the Jordanian border, including three in Syria.
Jordan hosts around 3,000 US troops. A longtime US ally and a major recipient of US military aid, Jordan’s airbases such as the Muwaffaq Salti Air Base in Azraq, have been key to US intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance missions in Syria and Iraq, where Washington has been fighting ISIS.
Lebanon is home to the most powerful paramilitary force in the Middle East: Iran-backed Hezbollah, one of the Islamic Republic’s most effective regional proxies.
The group has its main base on the Israel-Lebanon border and has been exchanging fire with Israel since the Gaza war began. The movement is close to Hamas in Gaza.
While the exact size of the Shiite Islamist group’s arsenal is unknown, experts have estimated it has between 150,000 and 200,000 missiles, as well as rockets and mortars. Hundreds of those missiles “are of high precision and highly destructive,” according to the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv.
Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah claims the group has 100,000 fighters, including active soldiers and reservists. Iran is believed to be Hezbollah’s main arms supplier.
At the heart of today’s proxy conflict between Iran and the US are Yemen’s Houthi rebels, who have been stepping up their strikes on ships in the Red Sea, saying they are revenge against Israel for its war in Gaza.
The group is currently in control of northern Yemen, and was engaged in nearly eight years of fighting with a US-backed and Saudi-led coalition before a halt in fighting last year.
Home-grown Houthi weapons were largely assembled with Iranian components smuggled into Yemen in pieces. But the group later made progressive modifications that have added up to big overall improvements, an official familiar with US intelligence told CNN previously.
The US military stations warships in the Red Sea, off Yemen’s coast, from which it has been striking Houthi targets. In December, the US assembled a coalition of more than 20 countries to safeguard commercial traffic against Houthi attacks in the Red Sea.
The besieged Gaza Strip is home to the Hamas militant group, which Israel believes to have had around 30,000 fighters before the war. An Islamist organization with a military wing, Hamas was established in 1987, and on October 7 launched an attack on Israel that killed around 1,200 people and took 253 others hostage, according to Israeli authorities.
Iran has built closer ties with the group in recent years; unlike all of Tehran’s other allies in the region, Hamas is a Sunni Muslim organization, rather than a Shiite one.
There is no evidence that Iran knew in advance about the October 7 attacks and Iran is not believed to have as much influence on Hamas as its other allies in the region. But the US believes that Iran has historically provided up to $100 million annually in combined support to Palestinian militant groups, including Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), another Gaza-based militant group.
On the other side of the border, Israel is the largest recipient of US military aid, with Washington having contributed  more than $130 billion in assistance since the Jewish state’s founding in 1948.
While the Israel-Hamas war has not yet spilled into the Gulf Arab states, some of those nations feel vulnerable as they have been targeted by Iran-linked groups before. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were attacked by the Houthis in 2019 and 2022, respectively.
The US-allied Gulf states are also home to some of the biggest deployments of US troops in the world.
The US has around 13,500 US forces in Kuwait, the largest American military presence in the region. Only Germany, Japan, and South Korea host more US forces than Kuwait.
The US’ second-largest military presence in the region is in Qatar, which hosts around 10,000 US forces at Al-Udeid Air Base, the largest US military base in the Middle East that is also home to the US Central Command’s Forward Headquarters and the Combined Air Operations Centre. The US this month quietly reached an agreement that extends its military presence for another 10 years at the base.
Qatar maintains relations with Hamas, having hosted its political office in the capital Doha since 2012.
More than 2,700 US forces are stationed at the Prince Sultan Air Base in Saudi Arabia, while the UAE hosts 3,500 US military personnel at Al Dhafra Air Base, which is home to the Gulf Air Warfare Center.
Other hubs for US military presence include Bahrain, which hosts the US Naval Forces Central Command and is home to the Navy’s Fifth Fleet. Turkey hosts 1,465 military members at Incirlik airbase."
1ELE50Q85Q_XACL0APOP4G7VYU,"New blood test that screens for Alzheimer’s may be a step closer to reality, study suggests","By Jacqueline Howard, CNN","8 minute read Updated 10:56 PM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240122,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/22/health/alzheimers-blood-test-screening-study/,"Testing a person’s blood for a type of protein called phosphorylated tau, or p-tau, could be used to screen for Alzheimer’s disease with “high accuracy,” even before symptoms begin to show, a new study suggests.
The study involved testing blood for a key biomarker of Alzheimer’s called p-tau217, which increases at the same time as other damaging proteins — beta amyloid and tau — build up in the brains of people with the disease. Currently, to identify the buildup of beta amyloid and tau in the brain, patients undergo a brain scan or spinal tap, which often can be inaccessible and costly.
Related article Alzheimer’s among seniors is most common in these parts of the US, first-of-its-kind data shows
But this simple blood test was found to be up to 96% accurate in identifying elevated levels of beta amyloid and up to 97% accurate in identifying tau, according to the study published Monday in the journal JAMA Neurology.
“What was impressive with these results is that the blood test was just as accurate as advanced testing like cerebrospinal fluid tests and brain scans at showing Alzheimer’s disease pathology in the brain,” Nicholas Ashton, a professor of neurochemistry at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden and one of the study’s lead authors, said in an email.
The study findings came as no surprise to Ashton, who added that the scientific community has known for several years that using blood tests to measure tau or other biomarkers has the potential to assess Alzheimer’s disease risk.
“Now we are close to these tests being prime-time and this study shows that,” he said. Alzheimer’s disease, a brain disorder that affects memory and thinking skills, is the most common type of dementia, according to the National Institutes of Health.
Related article Doubts abound about a new Alzheimer’s blood test
Last year, the first blood test for assessing beta amyloid protein was made available for consumer purchase in the United States, called AD-Detect, to help people with mild cognitive impairment identify their risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. Some researchers have raised doubts about the science behind the test. Quest Diagnostics, the company behind the test, has stressed that it is not meant to diagnose Alzheimer’s, but says it helps assess a person’s risk of developing the disease.
The test used in the new study, called the ALZpath pTau217 assay, is a commercially available tool developed by the company ALZpath, which provided materials for the study at no cost. The test is currently available for research use only, but Ashton said it is expected to be available for clinical use soon.
“This is an instrumental finding in blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer’s, paving the way for the clinical use of the ALZpath pTau 217 assay,” Professors Kaj Blennow and Henrik Zetterberg from the University of Gothenburg, co-authors of the study, said in a press release. “This robust assay is already used in multiple labs around the globe.”
ALZpath estimates the price of the test could be between $200 and $500.
“A robust and accurate blood-based biomarker would enable a more comprehensive assessment of cognitive impairment in settings where advanced testing is limited,” the researchers wrote in their study. “Therefore, use of a blood biomarker is intended to enhance an early and precise AD diagnosis, leading to improved patient management and, ultimately, timely access to disease-modifying therapies.”
For instance, the test demonstrated “high accuracy” in identifying tau pathology within people who tested positive for beta amyloid, according to the study. That may help guide treatment decisions in patients considering therapies that target beta amyloid, such as Leqembi and Aduhelm, since they may be less effective in patients with advanced tau pathology, the researchers wrote.
“These results emphasize the important role of plasma p-tau217 as an initial screening tool in the management of cognitive impairment by underlining those who may benefit from antiamyloid immunotherapies,” the researchers wrote.
The study included data on 786 people, who had an average age of 66 and had brain scans and spinal taps completed, as well as blood samples collected. The data and those samples came from the Translational Biomarkers in Aging and Dementia, Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer’s Prevention and Sant Pau Initiative on Neurodegeneration.
Some of the participants showed signs of cognitive decline while undergoing the data collection but others did not. The researchers, from institutions in Sweden, the United States and other countries, analyzed the participants’ data from February to June of last year.

The researchers found that when they tested a participant’s blood sample with the p-tau217 immunoassay, the blood test showed similar results and accuracies in identifying abnormal beta amyloid and tau as the results from the participant’s spinal tap or brain scan.
Only about 20% of the study participants had blood test results that, in a clinical setting, would have required further testing with imaging or a spinal tap due to being unclear.
“This is a significant reduction in costly and high-demand examinations,” Ashton said in the email. Therefore, based on the study findings, “we think that a blood test and clinical examination can have definitive decision in 80%” of those who are being investigated for early signs of dementia.
Yet even though the blood test in this study was found to be highly accurate in predicting whether someone has key characteristics of Alzheimer’s disease in their brain, not everyone with those characteristics will go on to develop the disease.
Also, the p-tau test is specific for Alzheimer’s disease, so if someone tests negative but is showing signs of cognitive impairment, this test could not determine other possible causes of their symptoms, such as vascular dementia or Lewy body dementia.
“A blood test being negative speeds up the investigation for other causes of the symptoms and this is just as important,” Ashton said.

Overall, a blood test for Alzheimer’s disease, such as the one described in the new study, can be used to help diagnose both a person experiencing early memory loss, as well as before a patient shows signs or symptoms of the disease, because changes in the brain can occur about 20 years before the onset of overt symptoms, said preventive neurologist Dr. Richard Isaacson, director of research at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Florida, who was not involved in the study.
“This is actually the test that has, at this time, among the best available evidence for being one single test for Alzheimer’s,” Isaacson said about the study’s findings. “This study takes us one really powerful step closer to having that test, and the beauty of this study is it also looked at people before they had symptoms.”
Signs and symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease can vary from one person to another, but often memory problems are the first signs of the disease, such as losing track of dates, getting lost, misplacing things or having difficulty completing tasks, such as bathing, reading or writing.
Isaacson, who has researched blood biomarkers in people with no or minimal cognitive complaints, likened testing blood samples for signs of Alzheimer’s disease to how people undergo routine blood tests for high cholesterol.
“People get cholesterol tests before they have a heart attack. People get cholesterol tests before they have a stroke. To me, this type of test will eventually be best served in people before they start to have cognitive symptoms,” Isaacson said. And “just like cholesterol tests, by following the pTau217 level over time, we can better understand how various therapies and lifestyle changes are working to keep Alzheimer’s under better control.”
Testing for Alzheimer’s before someone has symptoms “leaves a lot of time” for that person to make brain-healthy choices and to talk to their doctor about their individual risk factors, Isaacson said, adding that a blood-based test also can be more cost-effective than performing brain scans or other methods of testing.
“PET scans have radiation and can cost over $5,000. Spinal taps are great because you get detailed information, but not everyone wants one and it is expensive and not covered by insurance. These blood tests are generally more reasonably priced,” Isaacson said.
“Having a blood test like this can also help democratize access for people and just make it easier for our health care system to more proactively manage the tsunami of dementia risk that our society is facing,” he said. “This is the key to unlock the door into the field of Alzheimer’s prevention and preventive neurology.”
More than 6 million people in the United States are living with dementia caused by Alzheimer’s disease, according to the Alzheimer’s Association, and the number of people affected is projected to double in the next two decades, rising to some 13 million in 2050.

In the future, adults older than 50 may be recommended to undergo routine blood tests for Alzheimer’s disease, said David Curtis, honorary professor at the University College London, who was not involved in the new study.
“When effective treatments to prevent the progression of Alzheimer’s disease become available it will be essential to be able to identify people who are at high risk before they begin to deteriorate. This study shows that a simple blood test might be able to do this by measuring levels of tau protein in the blood which has been phosphorylated in a specific way. This could potentially have huge implications,” Curtis said in a statement distributed by the UK-based Science Media Centre.
“Everybody over 50 could be routinely screened every few years, in much the same way as they are now screened for high cholesterol. It is possible that currently available treatments for Alzheimer’s disease would work better in those diagnosed early in this way,” he said. “However, I think the real hope is that better treatments can also be developed. The combination of a simple screening test with an effective treatment for Alzheimer’s disease would have a dramatic impact for individuals and for society.”"

“The death sentence of Mohammad Ghobadlou for the crime of intentional murder of Farid Karampour Hassanvand was executed this morning after 487 days of judicial review of the case,” the Mizan news agency said.
Iranian authorities allege Ghobadlou ran over the official during a protest in Robat Karim, Tehran province, in September 2022, according to rights group Amnesty International.
He was sentenced to death by judge Abolqasem Salavati – who has been sanctioned by the United States for the notoriously harsh sentences he issued to activists, journalists and political prisoners, CNN previously reported.
Ghobadlou received two death sentences – one for “corruption on Earth,” issued by a Revolutionary Court and upheld by the Supreme Court, and one for murder, issued by a criminal court in Tehran province, according to Amnesty.
Mizan reported that the death sentence for “corruption on Earth” was suspended earlier this month until the intentional murder charge was investigated.
Ghobadlou’s lawyer Amir Raesian said he was not notified about a ruling regarding his client, and called on Mizan to release more information on the execution.
“If Mizan news agency is telling the truth, it should announce the number and date of issuance of this verdict,” Raesian said in a statement on X.

Amnesty has criticized the death sentences for following what it described as “grossly unfair sham trials, marred by torture-tainted ‘confessions’ and failure to order rigorous mental health assessments despite (Ghobadlou’s) mental disability.”
Ghobadlou had been under the supervision of a psychiatric hospital for bipolar disorder since the age of 15, Amnesty said. International law and standards prohibit using the death penalty against people with mental disabilities, according to the rights group.
Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam, the director of Norway-based Iranian human rights group Iran Human Rights (IHR), called Ghobadlou’s execution an “extrajudicial killing.”
On X, formerly Twitter, he wrote that “the Islamic Republic’s leader Ali Khamenei and his Judiciary must be held accountable for this crime. This execution must be met with strong international condemnations!”
At least eight protesters are known to have been executed in connection to nationwide demonstrations over the death of Mahsa Amini in September 2022.
Amini, a 22-year-old woman, died in the custody of Iran’s morality police after being arrested for allegedly not wearing her headscarf properly.
Protests spread like wildfire in the following weeks – which Iranian authorities responded to with brute force, mass arrests and hasty sham trials, drawing sharp global condemnation and sanctions from the US.
More than 300 people were killed in the months-long protests, including more than 40 children, the United Nations said. US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) placed the number of dead at more than 500, including 70 children. Thousands were arrested across the country, the UN said in a report last year, citing research from its Human Rights Committee."

Virginia Foxx admonishes Harvard for ‘unacceptable’ response to antisemitism investigation,"By Matt Egan, CNN","3 minute read Updated 9:17 PM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/23/business/virginia-foxx-harvard-response/,"House Education Committee Chairwoman Rep. Virginia Foxx blasted Harvard University on Tuesday evening for failing to turn over all the documents lawmakers demanded in their antisemitism investigation into the Ivy League school.
Foxx, a Republican from North Carolina, described Harvard’s initial production of documents as “woefully inadequate” and warned of consequences if the university does not comply with the committee’s requests.
Harvard faced a 5 pm ET deadline on Tuesday to respond to a demand from lawmakers for a mountain of documents relating to antisemitism on campus.
“Rather than answering the Committee’s request in a substantive manner, Harvard has chosen to provide letters from nonprofits and student handbooks, many of which are already publicly available,” Foxx said in a statement. “This is unacceptable. Harvard must produce the remaining documents in a timely manner, or risk compulsory measures.”
Nick Barley, a spokesperson for the House committee, told CNN compulsory measures means the panel is “prepared to subpoena Harvard.” He added that the documents were received by the committee around 5pm ET on Tuesday.
“Harvard is committed to cooperating with the Committee’s inquiry and providing information, including the submission made today, which addresses important questions raised by the Committee,” a Harvard spokesperson told CNN in a statement. “We denounce any form of antisemitism in the strongest possible terms and are committed to the safety and well-being of our students. We intend to continue to engage with the Committee in a dialogue to respond to their ongoing requests.”
Last week, Alan Garber, Harvard’s interim president, unveiled two presidential task forces aimed at fighting antisemitism and Islamophobia.
“Reports of antisemitic and Islamophobic acts on our campus have grown, and the sense of belonging among these groups has been undermined,” Garber said in the announcement. “We need to understand why and how that is happening—and what more we might do to prevent it.”
Earlier this month, Foxx wrote a letter to Harvard leaders with a wide-ranging request listing 24 separate categories of documents to be turned over, including all reports of antisemitic incidents and related reports since early 2021; documents on how the university responds to such incidents; settlements by Harvard in response to discrimination, harassment or free speech violations since early 2018; and communications linked to Harvard’s response to an October anti-Israeli student organization letter.
Lawmakers also requested that Harvard produce information on the school’s diversity office and foreign donations, including all donations from Qatari sources since early 2021.
The House investigation is separate from a probe by the same committee into how Harvard responded to plagiarism allegations against its former president, Claudine Gay. Harvard turned over documents last Friday on the plagiarism investigation.
Another House panel, the powerful Ways and Means Committee, recently threatened to reassess the lucrative tax-exempt status of Harvard and three other universities amid concerns about how they have handled antisemitism on campus.
The Department of Education has also launched an unprecedented number of Title VI investigations into colleges, including Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania and Cornell University."
1M460Y84F8_CRLUCBLNBCX6U2P,The world successfully tackled a dangerous pollutant. But did it accidentally warm the planet in the process?,"By Laura Paddison, CNN","5 minute read Published 4:00 AM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/26/china/shipping-pollution-global-warming-climate-intl/,"The huge cargo ships that criss-cross the world’s oceans sometimes leave “tracks” in their wake — long, wispy clouds that trail through the sky, lasting for a handful of days at most before disappearing.
These ghost clouds look beautiful, but they are a visible sign of deadly air pollution. They form when tiny sulfur dioxide particles belched out from ships’ smokestacks interact with water vapor in the atmosphere, creating low-lying, highly reflective clouds.
Ships’ sulfur pollution causes tens of thousands of premature deaths a year. But in what may seem a cruel twist — especially from an industry responsible for around 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions — this type of pollution also helps cool the planet by brightening clouds and reflecting the sun’s energy away from the Earth.
So, when in 2020 the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the United Nations body regulating shipping, slashed sulfur content permitted in ships’ fuel by 80%, it was a victory for human health. An estimated 30,000 premature deaths will now be avoided each year.
But it was “a silver cloud with a dark lining,” said Michael Diamond, assistant professor at Florida State University’s Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Science. The regulations ended a vast, accidental geoengineering project. Ship tracks reduced sharply, and with them, the cooling impact of this pollution.
As global temperatures soar, it has left scientists﻿ trying to unpick whether these shipping regulations may be inadvertently fueling an alarming acceleration of global warming — a controversial hypothesis that has divided some experts.
It’s a debate made more urgent by last year’s record-breaking heat. “Scientists are amazed at the outlier that 2023 was,” said Olaf Morgenstern, a scientist at the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research in New Zealand.
The heat was especially pronounced in some parts of the oceans, where water temperatures in areas including the North Atlantic shot wildly off the charts.
Scientists say the surge in global temperature was primarily driven by two factors: the impacts of El Niño, a natural climate phenomenon that tends to have a global heating impact, combined with the backdrop of long-term global warming caused by burning fossil fuels.
But some have speculated the heat spiked so abnormally high that other influences may also be at play. Theories include a lack of sunlight-reflecting dust from the Sahara, a change in wind patterns, and the January 2022 eruption of the Hunga Tonga underwater volcano, which injected enough planet-warming water vapor into the atmosphere to fill 58,000 Olympic-size swimming pools.
Of all of the theories, however, the impact of shipping regulations is swiftly becoming one of the most discussed. Scientists have long known that reducing this particle pollution﻿ would have a warming effect, but by how much “is where the controversy starts,” Morgenstern said.
In November, the prominent climate scientist James Hansen co-authored a paper which argued the curtailing of shipping pollution was the main driver of an alarming acceleration in global warming that goes beyond what climate models have predicted.
The IMO shipping regulations were “an unintentional scientific experiment,” Hansen told CNN. His research predicted global temperatures would breach 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming above pre-industrial levels in the 2020s and 2 degrees in the 2050s — a catastrophic level of warming that could trigger a slew of climate tipping points.
But other scientists have urged caution, not least because the relationship between pollution particles and clouds is extremely complex. Unraveling it is “one of the biggest challenges in climate science,” Diamond said.
Piers Forster, a professor of climate physics at Leeds University in the UK, said the reduction in shipping pollution is likely to have a very small warming influence.
Related article The 1.5-degree climate goal may be ‘deader than a doornail,’ and scientists are bitterly divided over it
According to Forster’s calculations, the regulations will increase global warming by around 0.01 degrees Celsius, which could grow to about 0.05 degrees by 2050 — equivalent to around two additional years of human-caused emissions.
However, he added, the uncertain effect of the pollution on clouds means there’s a possibility the warming impact could be much larger — an additional 0.1 or 0.2 degrees by 2050.
Diamond, whose own work estimates the regulations will bring levels of warming over the next few decades of between 0.05 and 0.1 degrees, said this heat won’t be “a showstopper” but is important. Every fraction of a degree matters when the world is hurtling towards levels of warming to which even humans will increasingly struggle to adapt.
Diamond, along with most of the other scientists CNN spoke to, doesn’t believe the decline in shipping pollution was a major factor in last year’s global heat, not least because there is usually a time lag before changes in the atmosphere are reflected in the Earth’s temperature.
“But I think it could have mattered quite a bit more regionally,” he said. Shipping is unevenly distributed, with much of it concentrated between Europe, North America and Asia, meaning air pollution impacts are also likely to be skewed.
In areas such as the North Atlantic, where temperatures soared several degrees above usual in 2023, Diamond said, “shipping is a decent explanation for part of why that was so warm.”
There are only a few years of data so far, and it will take time for scientists to unravel the exact impact of the fall in shipping pollution.
But it is clear that particle pollution from all sources, including burning fossil fuels, has had a cooling impact. Without it, the world would be about 0.4 degrees hotter, according to a 2021 report from Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. And pollution decreases in the future could have a big impact.
Annica Ekman, professor of meteorology at Stockholm University in Sweden, said her research has found that decreases in human-caused particle pollution between 2015 and 2050 could warm the planet as much as 0.5 degrees.
But this is not an argument against cutting air pollution, Diamond said, it’s an argument for tackling it alongside reducing carbon emissions.
The cooling impact of air pollution is far outweighed by the heating impact of burning fossil fuels. It’s when air pollution is tackled without also reducing carbon emissions, that “we can get into trouble,” Diamond said.
That is what’s happening in this shipping industry, where huge container vessels are still propelled across the oceans by hundreds of millions of tons of fossil fuels.
“We must not forget why the regulation exists,” Forster said. “It is there to save lives from air pollution.” While reducing this pollution will have a small warming impact, immediate action to reduce emissions will both slash the rate of global warming and improve air quality, he said. We are not “on some doomed trajectory,” he added."

She is a weekly opinion contributor to CNN, a contributing columnist to The Washington Post and a columnist for World Politics Review. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.
Elon Musk, who spends much of his time on futuristic endeavors, took a step into history on Monday. With his son on his shoulders, Musk visited a somber monument to humanity’s darkest past, the remains of the Auschwitz death camp, where the Nazis killed 1.1 million people during World War II, almost 1 million of them Jews.
That put Musk, whom many have accused of promoting antisemitism on his social media platform X, formerly Twitter, at the paramount memorial to the victims of the Holocaust, itself the zenith of industrialized hatred, which killed 6 million Jews just eight decades ago.
Why did Musk go to Auschwitz?
Was the pilgrimage one of self-reflection and atonement? Despite rising antisemitism across the globe, Musk’s trip appears to have been more of a public relations move aimed at repairing his reputation and boosting a flagging business.
Assaults, vandalism, harassment and even physical attacks against Jews had been increasing for months even before the Hamas assault inside Israel on October 7 and Israel’s subsequent fierce counterattack inside Gaza.
Once the war started, Jews, regardless of their views or connections to Israel, have been targeted to a degree they had never experienced in the United States, a country that, on the surface, seemed to be mostly free of the antisemitic virus, perhaps a lasting refuge for a minority that has been persecuted elsewhere for thousands of years.
Related article Opinion: Elon Musk’s Israel tour was transparently transactional and insulting
But suddenly antisemitism started coming out of the shadows on the far right and on the left.
Like in other entities where an upsurge in antisemitic activity started making headlines, Musk was taking performative action at Auschwitz. It was an effort to appear to be taking action while doing nothing.
After his visit to the death camp, Musk appeared at a conference on antisemitism in nearby Krakow, Poland. There, he defended his social media platform. X, he said, has less antisemitic content than other platforms. He gave no evidence to back that assertion up. But that, it seemed, was irrelevant.
There was nothing in his statements to suggest he will do anything about the problem.
Nothing suggests he will change the guidelines or even enforce X’s existing ones. A recent experiment by the Center for Countering Digital Hate, an internet monitoring group, found 98% of reported posts with shocking antisemitic, Islamophobic or anti-Palestinian content were left untouched. (X has rejected the center’s work as an effort to drive away advertisers and filed a lawsuit against it. The center says the lawsuit is an attempt to silence the organization.)
The moment Musk bought Twitter, reinstated suspended accounts and fired the content moderation staff, the platform exploded with hate speech, as documented by independent internet monitoring organizations. The verbal invective converged with real-world attacks on Jews, as cataloged by the Anti-Defamation League.
Related article Opinion: Progressives should never tolerate antisemitism
Musk’s own words amplified the surge of anti-Jewish conspiracy theories. When someone posted “Hitler was right,” accusing Jews of “hatred against whites,” Musk posted, “You have said the actual truth.”
He later apologized, calling the comment his “dumbest” ever. But it was hardly his first incendiary moment. Earlier Musk postings included one in which he declared that the Jewish financier George Soros “hates humanity.” It was described by Ted Deutch, head of the American Jewish Committee, as “The Protocols of the Elders of Zion for the internet age.” The Protocols is one of history’s foremost texts of antisemitic incitement.
Despite Musk apologizing for his endorsement of the “Hitler was right” post, advertisers fled X. The stampede accelerated after Media Matters said ads on X were appearing next to pro-Nazi and white supremacist posts. When Apple, Disney and IBM stopped advertising, Musk accused them of trying to blackmail him. X sued Media Matters.
To advertisers who left because of his antisemitic content, he said, “go f—k yourself.”
X was going into a tailspin. Ad revenue has collapsed. It was time to take action.
Unfortunately, there’s no sign that anything will change at the former Twitter, which has become a stronghold for far-right antisemites and people such as Tucker Carlson, who recently declared on X that rich Jews are funding a “white genocide.”
It’s easier to show up at a conference or a concentration camp, or to create a committee than to make real changes.
Consider Harvard University.
Related article Opinion: This unpalatable reality about antisemitism at Harvard
The school made headlines after a politically charged chain of events. President Claudine Gay was asked in Congress if calls for genocide against Jews violate Harvard rules against bullying and harassment. She said it depended on the context and later apologized. But after plagiarism charges surfaced, the embattled administrator resigned her post.
Many Jewish students said they had not wanted her to lose her job. They wanted Harvard to focus on tackling antisemitism with the same conviction with which it rejects racism or other forms of prejudice. That doesn’t seem to be happening.
A number of students have already filed a lawsuit against the school, describing it as a bastion of rampant and anti-Jewish hatred and harassment. The evidence is hard to miss.
When Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, setting on fire entire families in their homes, massacring more than 1,200 people and kidnapping hundreds more in the worst attack against Jews since the Holocaust, 31 Harvard student groups responded on that very same day, saying they held Israel “entirely responsible” and blaming Israel for the pogrom even before Israel started its military response, while the flames set by Hamas were still smoldering.
Since then, Jewish staff and students have implored the university for help in enforcing its own rules as they endure relentless harassment. A Harvard rabbi said antisemitism is “thriving” there, and after 26 years at the university, he’s “never felt so alone.”
Related article Opinion: I thought I’d be safe from antisemitism at my college. I was wrong
The popular theory of “intersectionality” has been weaponized against Jews, incredibly claiming that the most persecuted minority in history is part of a white oppressor class. That view now seems to permeate university campuses.
Across the country, 73% of Jewish students say they have seen or experienced antisemitism since the start of the 2023-2024 school year. Nearly half say they don’t feel safe on campus.
Under pressure, Harvard’s interim president, Alan Garber, just announced the appointment of the man who will co-chair its new task force on antisemitism. (Another task force on Islamophobia is being created.)
It was a moment to find a leader without controversial baggage. One who would help soothe the rifts and make a genuine effort to address the problem. Instead, Garber named a man who only recently declared that the problem of antisemitism on campus has been blown out of proportion.
Derek Penslar heads Harvard’s Center for Jewish Studies. Whatever the scholarly qualifications, he is a terrible choice for this new position. The main problem is not that he has made some startling statements about “Jewish civilization,” or that as a fierce critic of Israel he has used the language of Israel’s enemies to attack the country.

The most serious problem with the appointment of Penslar, who describes himself as “left of center,” is that he does not seem to think the problem he has been tasked with solving is a terribly serious one. Outsiders, he said, have “exaggerated” the issue. And he worried that paying attention to antisemitism is obscuring the vulnerabilities of pro-Palestinian students.
Former Harvard President Larry Summers said the university made its credibility problem worse by naming Penslar. “I am unable to reassure Harvard community members,” he wrote on X, “… that Harvard is making progress in countering anti-Semitism.”
The ADL called Penslar’s appointment, “absolutely inexcusable.”
From Musk, on the far right, to Harvard, on the left, antisemitic forces are being given a pass. Much of what we’re seeing is PR, theater, a pretense of action with little real impetus to solve what is admittedly a difficult problem — but one for which useful steps, such as improved content moderation on social media and unbiased leaders in the effort to uproot antisemitism, are plain to see."
1Q15L4Z29A_DGKS0WCCIH2BLJ3,Netanyahu touts ‘initiative’ to free hostages in Gaza as pressure mounts,"By Amir Tal, Mitchell McCluskey, Hagi Cohen-Boland and Nadeen Ebrahim, CNN","5 minute read Updated 5:56 PM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240122,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/22/middleeast/netanyahu-rejects-hamas-hostage-offer-mime-intl/,"Editor’s Note: A version of this story appears in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here.
Israel has offered a two-month ceasefire to Hamas as part of a prospective hostage deal, Axios reported Monday, citing two unnamed Israeli officials.
It would be “the longest period of ceasefire that Israel has offered Hamas since the start of the war,” wrote Axios reporter Barak Ravid, who is also a CNN analyst.
The proposal comes after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected Hamas’ call for an end to the Gaza war in exchange for the release of hostages held there, as he faces increasing public pressure to bring the captives home.
In order to release the remaining hostages, Netanyahu said Hamas was demanding an end to the war, the release of Palestinian prisoners and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. “I work on this around the clock. But to be clear: I reject outright the terms of surrender of the monsters of Hamas,” he said in a statement on Sunday, adding that agreeing to the terms goes against Israel’s security.
“If we agree to this, our soldiers fell in vain. If we agree to this, we will not be able to guarantee the security of our citizens,” the Prime Minister said.
Netanyahu has since told families of the remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza that Israel has an “initiative” to secure the release of those abducted – but that there is “no real proposal” from Hamas that would advance their freedom, according to the prime minister’s office.
According to the Axios report, Israel’s latest proposal envisions the release of all remaining hostages and hostage bodies in multiple phases, in exchange for Palestinian detainees imprisoned in Israel.
It would also see Israel move its forces out of main population centers and allow “a gradual return of Palestinian civilians to Gaza city and the northern Gaza strip.”
Out of the 253 hostages Israel says Hamas seized on October 7, Israel believes that 132 are still in Gaza, of whom 104 are thought to be alive.
The Wall Street Journal report has reported that the US, Egypt and Qatar want Israel to join a new phase of talks with Hamas that would start with the release of hostages and lead to the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.
These developments come amid deepening divisions within Israel’s war cabinet about whether to prioritize bringing hostages home over defeating Hamas, and as thousands protested over the weekend in Tel Aviv against Netanyahu’s handling of the war.
War cabinet minister Gadi Eisenkot last week suggested that the key war aim of defeating Hamas is unrealistic and called for elections within months. Eisenkot also said the government had failed to achieve what he says should be its highest priority: securing the release of the hostages.
Netanyahu is under mounting pressure from the Israeli public to secure the release of captives in Gaza. On Monday, more than a dozen people, including families of the hostages, forced their way into a meeting held by the Israeli parliament’s finance committee. The protesters held placards that read: “You will not sit here while they die there.”
Video of the scene showed security officers trying to remove the protesters amid shouting and jostling.

“It can’t go on like this. You’d better know. It can’t go on like this. You will not sit here while our children die there,” shouted one protester. There were no reports of arrests inside the parliament, known as the Knesset.
Israeli police said that in a separate demonstration dozens of protesters had blocked the entrance to the Knesset, “violating public order.” That protest called for an immediate election, and included some of the families of those killed on October 7.
After some refused to leave, a police officer announced a dispersal order, according to an Israeli police statement.
A poll released on Monday by CNN’s Israeli affiliate Channel 13 found that 35% of Israelis would support a deal involving the release of all hostages from Gaza in exchange for stopping the war and freeing all Hamas detainees in Israel. Nearly half (46%) said they would oppose such a deal.
A slim majority (53%) said Netanyahu’s personal interests were the main consideration driving his conduct of the war and a third (33%) said the national interest was his main consideration.
It has been more than three months since Israel launched its war against Hamas, which came in response to the group’s brutal October 7 attack that killed 1,200 people, according to Israeli authorities.
Meanwhile, the death toll in Gaza on Sunday surpassed 25,000, according to the Hamas-controlled health ministry in the enclave.
CNN cannot independently verify the figures.
Netanyahu reiterated his rejection of future Palestinian sovereignty over the occupied territories on Saturday after talks with US President Joe Biden about Gaza’s future. The White House has been pushing Israel to recognize the need for the Palestinians to establish an independent state in areas Israel captured in the 1967 war.
“I will not compromise on full Israeli security control over all the territory west of Jordan - and this is contrary to a Palestinian state,” Netanyahu said in a post Saturday on X.
The Prime Minister’s public rejection of a Palestinian state has placed him at odds with Israel’s staunchest ally, which has long advocated for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Several European foreign ministers have also joined the chorus of criticism directed at Netanyahu over Israel’s opposition to a two-state solution. Josep Borrell, the European Union’s foreign policy chief said on Monday that Israel’s opposition to a two-state solution is “unacceptable” and Israel cannot expect countries to drop the issue.

Shoichet, CNN","6 minute read Published 7:41 AM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/23/us/mexican-restaurant-locations-us-county-cec/,"As falling snow blankets the ground around his bright green taco truck in rural eastern Oregon, Amado Juarez puts the finishing touches on an order.
It’s a labor of love for Juarez, 53, who takes pride in the food he and his wife prepare and serve.
“We make everything personally,” he told CNN in a recent Zoom interview. “We give it our own seasoning.”
Years ago, Morrow County, Oregon, would have been a surprising place to find the carne asada, enchiladas and tacos Juarez is known for. But his family’s food truck, Tacos Hometown, has been operating in this rural community some 1,100 miles from the US-Mexico border for more than a decade, serving up “simply authentic Mexican food” to a largely American clientele.
A recent report from the Pew Research Center lists Morrow County as one of the places with the highest concentration of Mexican eateries in the US. According to Pew’s analysis of data from SafeGraph, more than a third of restaurants in the county serve Mexican food. The other counties listed in that ranking are all located in border states.
It’s one telling example of how Mexican food has spread throughout the United States.
Roughly 1 in 10 restaurants in the US serve Mexican food, according to Pew’s analysis of SafeGraph and Yelp data, with Mexican restaurants found in a large majority of US counties.
“Mexican food exists exactly where you would expect it to, but also pretty much anywhere else you might care to look in the United States that has any significant number of people in it,” says Aaron Smith, Pew’s director of data labs research. “In the middle of Oregon somewhere, out between the Pacific Ocean and the Rockies, there’s this little moderately sized community where over a third of the restaurants are serving Mexican food, which is kind of fascinating.”
There’s not a taco truck on every corner, as a Trump supporter once warned could happen in the runup to the 2016 election – spurring backlash and mockery on social media, and even inspiring a campaign to use taco trucks to help with voter registration.
But Mexican cuisine in the US is flourishing near the border, and also thousands of miles away. Tacos and tamales can be found in food trucks and five-star restaurants, in big cities and small towns.
Decades ago, the landscape was dramatically different. As food historian Jeffrey Pilcher notes in “Planet Taco: A Global History of Mexican Food,” in the middle of the 20th century, Mexican restaurants outside the Southwest were rare in the US.
Pilcher points to a number of factors that contributed to Mexican food’s increasing prevalence, including a “renaissance for family restaurants serving Mexican regional cooking throughout the United States” as large numbers of migrant workers from Latin America came to the US starting in the 1980s.
Now, as Pew’s analysis shows, Mexican food can be found almost everywhere in the US.
According to the report, 99% of the US population lives in a county with at least one Mexican restaurant.
Historian Natalia Molina says behind each data point there are even richer stories to tell — and important questions to ask.
“If we want to understand immigration, if we want to understand Latino culture, if we want to understand our neighborhoods, the way that our cities and counties and states are changing, food and restaurants are a central part of that,” Molina says. And numbers, she says, only tell part of the story.
Yes, foodies across the US now scour sites like Eater to find the trendiest tacos.
But, Molina notes, “at the same time we can’t pass immigration reform, at the same time every time you turn on the news there’s a new crisis at the border.
“It’s begging the question — can we cherish Mexican cuisine without embracing Mexicans?”
For Molina, a distinguished professor of American studies and ethnicity at the University of Southern California, the question isn’t simply academic. It’s closely intertwined with her family’s personal history.
Molina’s grandmother once ran a beloved Mexican restaurant in Los Angeles, and she documents its history — and the vital importance of other restaurants like it — in her book “A Place at the Nayarit: How a Mexican Restaurant Nourished a Community.”
Her mother sold the restaurant lease when Molina was a child. Its new owners closed it in 2001. Later that year, the building became a nightclub.
About 37 million people in the United States trace their ancestry to Mexico, according to Pew, and Mexicans represent the largest group of immigrants living in the US. While there are many Mexican restaurants in the US — not to mention restaurants serving other types of cuisine where Mexican immigrants work — Molina says a key detail can get lost when focusing on overall numbers.
Gentrification is changing neighborhoods that once were epicenters of working-class Latino life, Molina says, and beloved restaurants where people could find community are closing.
“When that gets replaced by someone selling your matcha latte and your avocado toast, it’s not going to draw the immigrant generation or the working-class immigrants,” she says.
Meanwhile, Molina hopes that in addition to embracing Mexican cuisine, consumers will think more about how that food is making it to their table.
“That’s brought to you by a chain fueled by immigrants,” she says.
At first, Amado and Elia Juarez weren’t sure how the residents of Morrow County would respond to their taco truck.
“There are very few Mexicans here. When we moved to Ione, Oregon, in 2002, we were the first Mexicans,” Elia recalls.
So when they opened up their taco truck in 2013, they went with a name they hoped would help them connect with customers. Amado’s former boss at the dairy farm where he’d worked for decades offered a suggestion that stuck.
While many taco trucks invoke the names of their owners or Mexican locales, “Tacos Hometown” aimed to appeal both to immigrant agricultural workers in the area and the larger community they hoped to serve.
But they knew their Mexican heritage would be a key ingredient.
They painted the taco truck green as a tribute to Amado’s late father, whose home in Mexico’s Guerrero state was the same bright color.
And they didn’t change the foods to appeal to an American palate.
It wasn’t long before their business was thriving, Amado recalls.
“They really love the spicy salsa,” Elia says.
Getting ingredients to make the fresh food that’s become their trademark isn’t easy. The closest city is a 50-minute drive, and often they’ll drive an hour and a half to get products in bulk. But they say going the extra miles — literally — is worth it to keep customers happy.
The dairy industry has brought more Mexicans to the area since they first arrived, but the Juarez family says Mexican eateries are still relatively rare. Other taco trucks and restaurants they know of are about an hour away, on the other side of the county or outside its limits.
Juarez says most of his taco truck’s customers are American. Opening the business, he says, has helped his family feel closer to their community.
He marvels at the generous tips American customers leave. On his phone he keeps a photo of the day when students in a local high school Spanish class showed up and serenaded him. And he’s even visited a preschool to give a presentation on Mexican food.
“I see them as my future customers,” he laughs.
And wherever those toddlers end up traveling in the years to come, there will be plenty of restaurant options to choose from for the kids from rural Oregon who learned to love tacos in their hometown."
1QS2GJI08C_8KJSNR3NTV50RE9,Alabama carries out first known execution with nitrogen gas in the US. Now the state’s AG expects more states to follow,"By Elizabeth Wolfe, Dakin Andone, Holly Yan and Caitlin Danaher, CNN","7 minute read Updated 6:58 PM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/26/us/alabama-execution-nitrogen-what-we-know/,"Alabama inmate Kenneth Smith was put to death Thursday night by nitrogen hypoxia, marking the nation’s first known execution using that method. Now Alabama’s attorney general wants to help other states interested in using the new form of capital punishment.
Smith, 58, was sentenced to death for his role in a 1988 murder-for-hire and had previously survived a failed attempt to execute him by lethal injection in 2022. His attorneys fought the execution until the end, ultimately losing a final appeal to the US Supreme Court on Thursday evening.
Smith’s legal team – alongside experts and advocates from the US to the United Nations – had voiced concern that nitrogen hypoxia could lead to excessive pain or even torture.
Alabama is one of only three states – Oklahoma and Mississippi being the others – to have approved the method, which is designed to replace oxygen in the body with a high concentration of nitrogen, causing death. So far, Alabama is the only state to have carried it out or even outlined a protocol on how to do it.
Here’s what we know about the historic execution:
After widespread discussion and speculation about how Smith’s execution would unfold, Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall told reporters on Friday, “What occurred last night was textbook.”

“As of last night, nitrogen hypoxia as a means of execution is no longer an untested method. It is a proven one. It’s the method that Kenneth Smith ultimately chose, along with 43 other death row inmates in our state,” Marshall said.
“I now suspect many states will follow.”
The attorney general had a message for colleagues across the country who were monitoring developments in the nation’s first execution using nitrogen hypoxia:
“Alabama has done it, and now so can you,” Marshall said. “And we stand ready to assist you in implementing this method in your states.”
As the procedure started Thursday evening at the William C. Holman Correctional Facility in Atmore, Smith was fitted with a mask, a device that would be used to administer the nitrogen.
The execution process began at 7:53 p.m. CT, and Smith was pronounced dead at 8:25 p.m., according to Alabama Department of Corrections officials.

Nitrogen flowed for about 15 minutes during the procedure, state corrections commissioner John Hamm said in a news conference.
Smith, who was on a gurney, appeared conscious for “several minutes into the execution,” and “shook and writhed” for about two minutes after that, media witnesses said in a joint report.
That was followed by several minutes of deep breathing before his breath began slowing “until it was no longer perceptible for media witnesses,” the media witnesses said.
When asked at the news conference about Smith shaking at the beginning of the execution, Hamm said Smith appeared to be holding his breath “for as long as he could” and may have also “struggled against his restraints.”
“There was some involuntary movement and some agonal breathing, so that was all expected and is in the side effects that we’ve seen and researched on nitrogen hypoxia,” Hamm said. “So nothing was out of the ordinary of what we were expecting.” Agonal breathing is an irregular, gasping breath pattern that can happen when someone is near death.

Smith’s spiritual adviser, the Rev. Jeff Hood, who’d previously expressed concern that the method could be inhumane, witnessed the execution and described it in more graphic terms, saying it was “the most horrible thing I’ve ever seen.”
Smith, wearing a tight-fitting mask that covered his entire face, convulsed when the gas was turned on, “popped up on the gurney” repeatedly, and gasped, heaved and spat, Hood said.
“It was absolutely horrific,” he said.
Smith made a lengthy statement in front of the witnesses before the execution started, according to the pool reporters.
“Tonight, Alabama caused humanity to take a step backward,” Smith said in part, according to the reporters. “I’m leaving with love, peace and light. Thank you for supporting me. Love all of you.”
Smith “made a ‘I love you’ sign in sign language with one of his hands that was facing the room where his family was witnessing,” the journalists’ joint report said.
It’s unclear exactly how long it took for Smith to die.
During lethal injections, the nation’s most common execution method, the time it takes for an inmate to die varies widely depending on the drugs used, number of injections and individual inmates’ reactions.
In a typical three-injection protocol, a person can die as quickly as 30 to 60 seconds after the final fatal injection, experts say. But the process does not always go as outlined. In 2014, for example, an Oklahoma inmate had an apparent heart attack 43 minutes after receiving the first injection, according to state documents and witnesses.
A tense debate has unfolded about whether America’s new execution method is humane and whether the procedure would cause undue pain.
In theory, the method involves replacing the air breathed by an inmate with 100% nitrogen, depriving the body of oxygen.

Proponents argue the process should be painless, citing nitrogen’s role in deadly industrial accidents or suicides, and the state indicated in court records that it believes nitrogen hypoxia is “perhaps the most humane method of execution ever devised.”
Others have been skeptical, fearing the method could go awry and voicing concerns that the state’s plan up until Thursday had been shrouded in secrecy. The protocol published by the state contained several redactions experts said shielded key details from public scrutiny.
The White House said Smith’s execution by nitrogen gas was “troubling” to the administration.
Press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters the death by the new method underscored President Joe Biden’s belief in a moratorium on the federal death penalty.
“The president has long said, and had deep, deep concerns, with how the death penalty’s implemented and whether it’s consistent with our values,” Jean-Pierre said.
Criticism of Alabama’s new death penalty method has spread globally. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Turk, said the death penalty is “inconsistent with the fundamental right to life” and called for its “universal abolition.”
“I deeply regret the execution of Kenneth Eugene Smith in Alabama despite serious concerns this novel and untested method of suffocation by nitrogen gas may amount to torture, or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment,” Turk said in a statement Friday.
The European Union described the new method of execution as “a particularly cruel and unusual punishment” and also called for universal abolition of the death penalty, spokesperson Peter Stano said in a statement Friday.
In recent years, many states that still allow the death penalty have had difficulty obtaining necessary ingredients for lethal injections after European manufacturers refused to sell drugs to the US that would be used in executions.
Stano said the EU welcomed “the fact that 29 US states have either abolished capital punishment or imposed a moratorium on executions.”
The family of Smith’s victim, Elizabeth Sennett, said the execution is “bittersweet” – a final act of justice for the woman killed more than three decades ago.
Sennett was murdered in 1988 after her husband hired someone who hired two others, including Smith, to kill his wife and make it look like a burglary, court records show. The husband, minister Charles Sennett, was having an affair and had taken out an insurance policy on his wife, the records say.
“Nothing that happened here today is going to bring mom back,” said Sennett’s son, Michael, after the execution. But, he added, “we’re glad this day is over.”
Elizabeth Sennett’s sons told CNN earlier Thursday they felt it was time for Smith’s sentence to be carried out, adding they believed their mother had been overlooked due to the focus on the execution method.
“What’s going on is overshadowing what’s actually happened,” Chuck Sennett, said. “He’s gotta pay the price for what he done to our mother,” who should be remembered “as a loving, caring woman.” The brothers were in their 20s when their mother was killed.
The family has forgiven everyone involved in the killing, including Smith, Michael Sennett said at a news conference Thursday night.
“His debt was paid tonight,” the son said.

1STJAKXYBO_CX2UR1KANJE3VGW,Martin Scorsese and John Williams just made Oscars history,"By Lisa Respers France, CNN","2 minute read Updated 11:45 AM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/23/entertainment/martin-scorsese-john-williams-oscars/,"Someone forgot to tell Martin Scorsese and John Williams about the often complained issue of ageism in Hollywood.
The famed director and composer both broke new Oscar records Tuesday, when the nominees for the 96th Academy Awards were revealed.
With his nomination for best director for “Killers of the Flower Moon,” 81-year-old Scorsese became the oldest nominee in the category that had previously been held by John Huston, who was 79 when he was nominated for “Prizzi’s Honor” in 1985.
It was Scorsese’s tenth nomination in that category, which puts him two behind current record-holder William Wyler, who had 12 best director nominations prior to his death in 1981.
“It’s deeply gratifying to receive this recognition from the Academy, for myself and for so many of my collaborators on ‘Killers of the Flower Moon,’” Scorsese said in a statement to CNN.
“It was a remarkable experience to make this picture, to work together with the Osage community to tell the story of a genuine American tragedy, hidden in the shadows of official culture for far too long,” the director added. “I only wish that Robbie Robertson had lived to see his work recognized—our many years of friendship and Robbie’s growing consciousness of his own Native heritage played a crucial role in my desire to get this film onscreen.”
Robertson, co-founder of The Band, who collaborated as a composer of several films with Scorsese, including “Killers of the Flower Moon,” died in August at the age of 80.
“Killers of the Flower Moon” notched 10 total nominations, including best picture, best actress in a leading role for Lily Gladstone, best actor in a supporting role for frequent Scorsese collaborator Robert De Niro, and best original score.
In that last category, Scorsese’s project is up against another record holder.
Legendary composer John Williams’ work on “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” earned him his 49th Oscar nomination for original score. With a total of 54 career Oscar nominations when including original song, Williams has more Academy Award nominations than any living person.
According to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences that is responsible for the awards show, the late Walt Disney held the overall record with 59 total Oscar nominations.
The Academy also noted that at the age of 91, Williams, who is best known for his work on the “Star Wars” franchise, is the oldest nominee in a competitive award category."

The couple have agreed to buy a stake of nearly 5% in the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE), joining other buyers of around 17 million shares in total, the exchange said in a statement. The TASE expects the sale to generate $65 million in proceeds, which it plans to invest in its technology infrastructure, it said.
The share sale drew “robust interest” from investors in Israel, the United States, Europe and Australia, the bourse said, “reflecting a strong vote of confidence in both the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange and the Israeli economy at large.”
Related article Business Insider stands by reporting on Bill Ackman’s wife, Neri Oxman, says stories ‘are accurate’ with ‘no unfair bias’
Ackman, the founder and chief executive of Pershing Square Capital Management, made his name betting against stocks. But his latest investment suggests he is optimistic about the prospects for Israeli companies despite the country’s ongoing war against Hamas.
The value of stocks listed on the exchange has swung wildly since October 7, the day Hamas launched its deadly attack on Israel. Overall, however, the TASE has gained almost 13% since that date.
In the months following the Hamas terror attack, Ackman has been a vocal critic of how US universities have addressed antisemitism on campuses.
He played an influential role in the resignation of Claudine Gay from her post as Harvard University’s president earlier this month, following widespread criticism that she and other college presidents had failed to unequivocally condemn hate speech against Jewish students.
He also accused Gay of plagiarism in her academic work, a claim that has made his wife — also an academic — a target for scrutiny. A report by Business Insider in early January alleged that Oxman had plagiarized parts of her doctoral dissertation. Both Gay and Oxman have denied the claims against them."

The delivery is seen as an important affirmation from a key market for the plane maker, whose reputation for safety and quality in its commercial jets was dealt a massive blow following a terrifying accident aboard a 10-week-old 737 Max 9 flight on January 5.
According to flight tracking website Flightradar 24, China Southern Airlines flight CZ5073 departed from Boeing Field in Seattle, Washington, on Wednesday for China via Honolulu. The use of the airline’s flight number, instead of a Boeing one, suggests the ownership of the plane has already been transferred.
Boeing (BA) declined to comment on the apparent delivery.
The plane, a 737 Max 8 according to flight data, was built in September 2019 and has been parked in Boeing’s Seattle factory since then, according to flight tracking sites Flightradar 24 and Aviation Flights.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grounded the aircraft in March 2019 after 346 people died in two separate fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia. It was discovered that a safety feature meant to stop the plane from climbing too fast and stalling had improperly forced the nose of the plane down, causing the crashes, as CNN reported previously.
Chinese aviation authorities instructed its airlines in March 2019 to ground all their 737 Max 8 aircraft, citing the need for “strict control of safety risks.” That ban was lifted in 2021, following the model’s clearance by the FAA, but there haven’t been any new deliveries of the model to China until now.
In December, the trade publication the Air Current said Boeing had won a key clearance from China’s aviation regulator, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), allowing Boeing to prepare Max aircraft for delivery, Reuters reported."
1W3ULSUD04_05RGE213VUTYUW2,Trump comes out against draft RNC resolution from supporter declaring him presumptive nominee,"By Daniel Strauss, Kristen Holmes and Kaitlan Collins, CNN","4 minute read Updated 8:57 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/25/politics/rnc-trump-presumptive-nominee-resolution/,"A Republican National Committee draft resolution that would have formally declared Donald Trump the Republican Party’s 2024 presumptive nominee was withdrawn Thursday amid pushback from the former president.
David Bossie, the RNC committeeman from Maryland who recently endorsed Trump and introduced the resolution, withdrew it, according to two sources familiar with the matter.
The Trump campaign had initially approved going forward with the resolution and the former president himself was also on board until a backlash began, a source familiar told CNN.
Trump said on his social media platform Thursday that the RNC should not move forward with the resolution, saying he appreciated the effort but was opposing it “for the sake of Party unity” and wanted to “finish the process off AT THE BALLOT BOX.”
His statement came amid concerns from Trump allies that the resolution could anger Republicans because of the perception that Trump was trying to stack the deck against former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, a source close to the former president said.
While the former president would have still needed to reach the delegate requirements necessary to win the nomination, if the resolution had been approved and the RNC had shifted to a general election mode, he would have access to the RNC’s data operation, benefit from fundraising with the RNC, and have the support of all of the committee’s ground operations. It would also have meant the committee would have been supporting Trump and effectively opposing Haley – an unprecedented break from the party’s past approach to the nominating process.

The resolution, which was being reviewed by the RNC earlier Thursday, was first reported by The Dispatch on Thursday. A draft copy of the resolution was obtained independently by CNN.
“RESOLVED that the Republican National Committee hereby declares President Trump as our presumptive 2024 nominee for the office of President of the United States and from this moment forward moves into full general election mode welcoming supporters of all candidates as valued members of Team Trump 2024,” the resolution reads.
An RNC spokesperson said in a statement earlier Thursday that this resolution was still just a resolution and not the stance of the committee.
“Resolutions, such as this one, are brought forward by members of the RNC. Chairwoman McDaniel doesn’t offer resolutions,” communications director Keith Schipper said in the statement. “This will be taken up by the Resolutions Committee and they will decide whether to send this resolution to be voted on by the 168 RNC members at our annual meeting next week.”
The Haley campaign brushed off the resolution and said GOP Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel should organize a debate ahead of the South Carolina primary at the end of February.
“Who cares what the RNC says? We’ll let millions of Republican voters across the country decide who should be our party’s nominee, not a bunch of Washington insiders,” Haley spokeswoman Olivia Perez-Cubas said in a statement. “If Ronna McDaniel wants to be helpful she can organize a debate in South Carolina, unless she’s also worried that Trump can’t handle being on the stage for 90 minutes with Nikki Haley.”
But her campaign was soon fundraising off of the draft resolution. “The RNC is leveraging the establishment to try and crown Trump the presumptive nominee,” Haley wrote in a fundraising email. “Well I have news for them: I’m in this to win it and I’m not going anywhere.”
The resolution comes just a few days after Trump defeated Haley in New Hampshire by more than 30,000 votes, following his decisive win in the Iowa caucuses. Those victories have led many prominent figures in the Republican Party to coalesce around Trump and call on Haley to exit the race. Earlier this week, McDaniel told Fox News, “We need to unite around our eventual nominee, which is Donald Trump.”
Current RNC rules require Trump to secure 1,215 delegates to officially become the party’s nominee. As of Thursday, CNN estimates Trump has 32 delegates while Haley has 17.
Some RNC members were discussing the resolution during a conference call Wednesday night, according to a Republican with knowledge of that call.

Vergara, who is currently starring as Colombian drug lord Griselda Blanco in Netflix’s “Griselda,” has intentionally sought characters where her accent is an asset.
“I’m always looking for characters because there’s not much that I can play with this stupid accent,” she told The Los Angeles Times. “I can’t play a scientist or be in ‘Schindler’s List.’ My acting jobs are kind of limited.”
It was after she watched the 2006 documentary “Cocaine Cowboys,” that Vergara said she first got the idea of playing Blanco. She joined “Modern Family” in 2009, but kept Blanco in the back of her mind over the years, periodically studying her.
“I read every single book, every single article, every new note on the internet that came out,” Vergara told the publication. “For many years, I read and read and read.”
Blanco, known as La Madrina ( Godmother) and La Viuda Negra (Black Widow), ran a cocaine ring before she was fatally shot in Medellín in 2012 at age 69.
“Griselda” is now streaming on Netflix."

The Online Safety Bill, which passed with 108-62 votes, aims to “make provisions to prohibit online communication of certain statements of fact in Sri Lanka” and “prevent the use of online accounts and inauthentic online accounts for prohibited purposes.”
The bill will also create an “Online Safety Commission,” a five-member committee appointed by the president, to “issue directives to persons who communicate prohibited statements under this Act to stop the communication of any such statements.”
Sri Lanka’s government says the bill will provide protection against online abuse, but rights groups have criticized its position, claiming the bill is instead aimed at stifling dissent and criticism.
“Sri Lanka is still reeling from an economic crisis partly caused by misgovernment and failures of accountability,” said Human Rights Watch Deputy Asia Director Meenakshi Ganguly in a statement Tuesday. “In 2022, months-long protests demanding reform toppled the prime minister and president. Since coming to power that year, President (Ranil) Wickremesinghe has moved to stifle dissent.”
The Asia Internet Coalition, an industry group, opposed the bill when it was first announced in September last year.
Managing Director Jeff Paine said in a statement at the time that “the bill provides for a draconian system to stifle dissent and Sri Lankans’ rights to expression.”
He added: “While our member companies take seriously the online safety of those who use their services, legislation should not dampen innovation by restricting public debate and the exchange of ideas that can consequently impact the digital economy.”
The United Nations Human Rights Office also spoke against the bill in October.
Raising issue with its proposed punishments for violators, the organization said it “includes an overly broad definition of terrorism and grants wide powers to the police - and to the military - to stop, question and search, and to arrest and detain people, with inadequate judicial oversight.”
Nearly two years ago, Sri Lanka was rocked by monthslong protests over the country’s worst economic crisis in 73 years.
Then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa was forced to flee the country after angry protesters, who blamed him for the financial situation, stormed his residence.
Rajapaksa resigned from his post, paving the way for current President Wickremesinghe to take over. But rights groups have accused him of cracking down on dissent and silencing protesters.
“Sri Lanka’s repressive laws have facilitated widespread human rights violations for decades and contributed to economic and political crises,” said Ganguly."

The strikes targeted three facilities used by Iranian-backed Kataib Hezbollah and other Tehran-affiliated groups in Iraq.
Austin said in the statement that the strikes “are in direct response to a series of escalatory attacks against US and coalition personnel in Iraq and Syria” by Iranian-backed militia groups.
US Central Command also released a statement on Tuesday saying US forces “conducted unilateral airstrikes” targeting “KH headquarters, storage, and training locations for rocket, missile, and one-way attack UAV capabilities.”
According to a US defense official, the strikes were carried out in two sites in western Iraq, including Al-Qa’im near the Syrian border, as well as Jurf al-Sakhar south of Baghdad.
“I am grateful for both the skill and professionalism with which our personnel planned and conducted these strikes and the continued efforts of our troops on the ground as they work with regional partners to further dismantle and degrade ISIS,” Austin said in Tuesday’s statement.
“The President and I will not hesitate to take necessary action to defend them and our interests. We do not seek to escalate conflict in the region. We are fully prepared to take further measures to protect our people and our facilities. We call on these groups and their Iranian sponsors to immediately cease these attacks,” Austin added.
The airstrikes killed up to seven Kataib Hezbollah fighters, according to to US defense officials, who on Wednesday cited the US’ preliminary battle damage assessment.
The strikes also destroyed two headquarters buildings and an intelligence facility used by the Iran-backed militant group and associated groups, the officials said.
At least one Kataib Hezbollah fighter was killed and two were injured following the US airstrikes, according to a statement from the Popular Mobilization Front operation command.
Jafar al-Hussaini, the military spokesman for Kataib Hezbollah, wrote on X that the group will “continue to strike the strongholds of the enemies, in support of our people in Gaza until the brutal killing machine backed by America stops, and the complete siege is lifted. This is the promise of the free people.”
The strikes come just days after US personnel at Al-Asad Air Base in Iraq were injured in a ballistic missile and rocket attack on the base. While most missiles and rockets were intercepted by the base’s air defenses, some projectiles made impact, US Central Command said over the weekend.
The initial assessment is that Kataib Hezbollah was responsible for the ballistic missile attack, the defense official said.
Pentagon spokesman Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said Tuesday that a total of four US troops were diagnosed with traumatic brain injury as a result of the attack, and all had since returned to duty.
The strikes on Tuesday are the first in Iraq since the beginning of the month, when the US targeted a member of an Iranian proxy group operating in the country who one US official said had “US blood on his hands.” They also come after multiple strikes against the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen over the last week and a half, as the US looks to rein in the aggressive actions of Iranian-backed groups in the Middle East amid heightened tensions in the region.
US forces in Iraq and Syria have come under attack at least 151 times since attacks began on October 17, according to a US official — 10 days after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7. And while officials have not directly connected the two situations, the ongoing attacks on US forces have fed into heightened tensions and concerns about broader conflict breaking out in the region, particularly when coupled with the regular attacks on commercial shipping by the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen.
“We’ve continued to see attacks on our forces since October 17th in Iraq and Syria. The attack that we saw over the weekend was just a larger scale attack,” Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh said Monday. “But again, we don’t seek conflict, we don’t want to see this widen out to a regional war, we don’t want … to continue to see our forces being put at risk.”
The US’ actions against the Iran-backed militias in Iraq have appeared to strain tensions between the US and the Iraqi government. Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani told Reuters this month that that there should be a “quick” time frame for the US-led coalition’s exit from the country. The US has maintained that it is in Iraq at the invitation of its government, as part of the ongoing mission to defeat ISIS.
“There is a need to reorganize this relationship so that it is not a target or justification for any party, internal or foreign, to tamper with stability in Iraq and the region,” Sudani said. Ryder said at the Pentagon on Tuesday that he was not aware “of any official notifications” to the Pentagon regarding a withdrawal of US forces.
The US has carried out a number of strikes in Iraq and Syria in response to the attacks on coalition forces, placing blame squarely on Iran for supporting the militia groups carrying out the attacks.
In October, following US airstrikes on facilities linked to Iranian-backed militias, a senior defense official said Tehran was “the center of gravity” for the attacks, and that “Iranian fingerprints are all over this.”
“Tehran and Iranian senior leaders are funding, arming, equipping, training and directing a whole plethora of militia groups across the region, and they have escalated attacks against US forces since October 17, which is why we took self-defense action,” the official said.
While the attacks in Iraq and Syria have been ongoing, the US has also been managing regular attacks by the Houthis in Yemen on commercial shipping. The strikes on Tuesday followed strikes on the Houthis on Monday, carried out by the US and UK, which a senior official said were successful in striking weapons storage sites, drone systems, and missiles.
The US also conducted strikes Tuesday evening against two Houthi anti-ship missiles that were aimed into the Southern Red Sea and were prepared to launch, according to US Central Command.
“U.S. forces identified the missiles in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen and determined that they presented an imminent threat to merchant vessels and the U.S. Navy ships in the region. U.S. forces subsequently struck and destroyed the missiles in self-defense,” CENTCOM said in a statement.

230P1RIYHI_58VH4D6VYOLFT81,Look of the Week: Kim Kardashian steps into Balenciaga ambassadorship in ‘pantaleggings’,"By Jacqui Palumbo, CNN","3 minute read Published 6:24 PM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/23/style/kim-kardashian-balenciaga-closet-campaign-lotw/,"Editor’s Note: Featuring the good, the bad and the ugly, ‘Look of the Week’ is a regular series dedicated to unpacking the most talked about outfit of the last seven days.
Get ready for another parade of Kim Kardashian in black spandex ensembles. Less than 24 hours after Balenciaga announced the Skims founder had officially joined the luxury house as a brand ambassador, Kardashian appeared in her first campaign in her new role to herald the return of the label’s Le City oversized leather bag, which became a mainstay in the 2000s thanks to supermodel Kate Moss.
Over the past few years, Kardashian has played muse to the brand’s most recent creative director, Demna Gvasalia, in everything from mobility-limiting yellow caution tape to spectral head-to-toe black fabric. But for her first official official outing as ambassador, her simple silhouette is classic Kimenciaga: a seamless tube top-pantaleggings ensemble that fits neatly with her own shapewear empire’s aesthetic.
Photographed by Inez and Vinoodh, the “Closet Campaign” features a roster of celebrities, including actor and socialite Nicola Peltz — who wears a Regina George-worthy pink tracksuit — and model Paloma Elsesser, holding the new Le City silhouettes and other signature Balenciaga bags in pristine luxury closets. (Kardashian is photographed in her own enormous handbag closet, along with her own collection of nearly 130 Balenciaga bags.)
The “Closet Campaign” feels like a soft launch rather than a big splash for the new partnership, but is still stirring buzz. After several appearances for the brand, including walking the runway in its 51st Haute Couture show in 2022, Kardashian took a step back from Balenciaga later that year after a holiday campaign ignited controversy.
The fashion house’s “Toy Stories” campaign featured young children with various Balenciaga gifts, including plush bags designed as teddy bears in goth outfits and BDSM-inspired accessories. After the brand and its creative collaborators were accused of sexualizing children — and a separate campaign went viral for featuring documents from a United States Supreme Court case relating to child pornography laws on a desk in an otherwise generic office scene — Balenciaga pulled the campaign and issued an apology for including the teddy bear bags. (They also filed, then dropped a lawsuit against the production company involved in the shoot that included the court case documents.)
Days later, Kardashian called the images “disturbing” on social media and said she was “re-evaluating” her relationship with the house.

But in December, just over a year after the backlash, Kardashian signaled that she was back in the fold, appearing front row at its Los Angeles runway show — closed by Cardi B — along with her half-sister Kendall Jenner.
On Monday, as part of her ambassador announcement, Kardashian said in a press statement that the fashion house “embraces modernity, craftsmanship and takes an innovative approach to design under Demna.”
She added: “For me, this long-standing relationship is built on mutual trust and a commitment to doing what’s right.”"
25JVFGM62I_TMB6QDGPSW7Y1EV,"Native American communities have the highest suicide rates, yet interventions are scarce","By Cheryl Platzman Weinstock, KFF Health News","8 minute read Updated 7:09 PM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240122,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/22/health/native-american-communities-suicide-rates-interventions-kff-health-news/,"Editor’s Note: If you or someone you know may be experiencing a mental health crisis, contact the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline by dialing or texting “988.” To reach the Native and Strong Lifeline, call “988” and press 4.
Amanda MorningStar has watched her children struggle with mental health issues, including suicidal thoughts. She often wonders why.
“We’re family-oriented and we do stuff together. I had healthy pregnancies. We’re very protective of our kids,” said MorningStar, who lives in Heart Butte, Montana, a town of about 600 residents on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation.
Yet despite her best efforts, MorningStar said, her family faces a grim reality that touches Native American communities nationwide. About a year ago, her 15-year-old son, Ben, was so grief-stricken over his cousin’s suicide and two classmates’ suicides that he tried to kill himself.
“Their deaths made me feel like part of me was not here. I was gone. I was lost,” said Ben MorningStar.
He spent more than a week in an inpatient mental health unit, but once home, he was offered sparse mental health resources.

Non-Hispanic Indigenous people in the United States die by suicide at higher rates than any other racial or ethnic group, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The suicide rate among Montana’s Native American youth is more than five times the statewide rate for the same age group, according to the Montana Budget and Policy Center. Montana ranked third-worst among states for suicide deaths in 2020, and 10% of all suicides in the state from 2017 through 2021 were among Native Americans, even though they represent only 6.5% of the state’s population.
Despite decades of research into suicide prevention, suicide rates among Indigenous people have remained stubbornly high, especially among Indigenous people ages 10 to 24, according to the CDC. Experts say that’s because the national strategy for suicide prevention isn’t culturally relevant or sensitive to Native American communities’ unique values.
Suicide rates have increased among other racial and ethnic minorities, too, but to lesser degrees.
Systemic issues and structural inequities, including underfunded and under-resourced services from the federal Indian Health Service, also hamper suicide prevention in Indigenous communities. “I worried who was going to keep my son safe. Who could he call or reach out to? There are really no resources in Heart Butte,” said Amanda MorningStar.
Ben MorningStar said he is doing better. He now knows not to isolate himself when problems occur and that “it is OK to cry, and I got friends I can go to when I have a bad day. Friends are better than anything,” he said.
His twice-a-month, 15-minute virtual telehealth behavioral therapy visits from IHS were recently reduced to once a month.
Mary Cwik, a psychologist and senior scientist at the Center for Indigenous Health at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, said the systemic shortcomings MorningStar has witnessed are symptoms of a national strategy that isn’t compatible with Indigenous value systems.
“It is not clear that the creation of the national strategy had Indigenous voices informing the priorities,” Cwik said.

The cause of high suicide rates in Indigenous communities is complex. Native Americans often live with the weight of more adverse childhood experiences than other populations — things such as emotional, physical, and sexual abuse, intimate partner violence, substance misuse, mental illness, parental separation or divorce, incarceration, and poverty.
Those adverse experiences stack upon intergenerational trauma caused by racial discrimination, colonization, forced relocation, and government-sanctioned abduction to boarding schools that persisted until the 1970s.
“There’s no way that communities shaped by these forces for so long will get rid of their problems fast by medical services. A lot of people in Indian Country struggle to retain hope. It’s easy to conclude that nothing can fix it,” said Joseph P. Gone, a professor of anthropology and global health and social medicine at Harvard University and member of the Gros Ventre (Aaniiih) tribal nation of Montana.
Most tribal nations are interested in collaborative research, but funding for such work is hard to come by, said Gone. So is funding for additional programs and services.
Stephen O’Connor, who leads the suicide prevention research program at the Division of Services and Intervention Research at the National Institute of Mental Health, said, “Given the crisis of suicide in Native American populations, we need more funding and continued sustained funding for research in this area.”
Getting grants for scientific research from NIMH, which is part of the National Institutes of Health, can be challenging, especially for smaller tribes, he said.
Officials at the NIMH and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration said that they continue to build research partnerships with tribal nations and that they recently launched new grants and multiple programs that are culturally informed and evidence-based to reduce suicide in tribal communities.
NIMH researchers are even adjusting a commonly used suicide screening tool to incorporate more culturally appropriate language for Indigenous people.
Teresa Brockie, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins School of Nursing, is one of a small but growing number of researchers, many of whom are Indigenous, who study suicide prevention and intervention strategies that respect Indigenous beliefs and customs. Those strategies include smudging — the practice of burning medicinal plants to cleanse and connect people with their creator.
Without this understanding, research is hampered because people in tribal communities have “universal mistrust of health care and other colonized systems that have not been helpful to our people or proven to be supportive,” said Brockie, a member of Fort Belknap reservation’s Aaniiih Tribe.
Brockie is leading one of the first randomized controlled trials studying Indigenous people at Fort Peck. The project aims to reduce suicide risk by helping parents and caregivers deal with their own stress and trauma and develop positive coping skills. It’s also working to strengthen children’s tribal identity, connectivity, and spirituality.
In 2015, she reported on a study she led in 2011 to collect suicide data at the Fort Peck reservation in northeastern Montana. She found that adverse childhood experiences have a cumulative effect on suicide risk and also that tribal identity, strong connections with friends and family, and staying in school were protective against suicide.
In Arizona, Cwik is collaborating with the White Mountain Apache Tribe to help leaders there evaluate the impact of a comprehensive suicide surveillance system they created. So far, the program has reduced the overall Apache suicide rate by 38.3 % and the rate among young people ages 15 to 24 by 23%, according to the American Public Health Association.
Several tribal communities are attempting to implement a similar system in their communities, said Cwik.
Still, many tribal communities rely on limited mental health resources available through the Indian Health Service. One person at IHS is tasked with addressing suicide across almost 600 tribal nations.
Pamela End of Horn, a social worker and national suicide prevention consultant at IHS, said the Department of Veterans Affairs “has a suicide coordinator in every medical center across the U.S., plus case managers, and they have an entire office dedicated to suicide prevention. In Indian Health Service it is just me and that’s it.”

End of Horn, a member of the Oglala Lakota Sioux Tribe of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota, blames politics for the discrepancy.
“Tribal leaders are pushing for more suicide prevention programs but lack political investment. The VA has strong proactive activities related to suicide and the backing of political leaders and veterans’ groups,” she said.
It is also hard to get mental health professionals to work on remote reservations, while VA centers tend to be in larger cities.
Even if more mental health services were available, they can be stigmatizing, re-traumatizing, and culturally incongruent for Indigenous people.
Many states are using creative strategies to stop suicide. A pilot project by the Rural Behavioral Health Institute screened more than 1,000 students in 10 Montana schools from 2020 to 2022. The governor of Montana is hoping to use state money to expand mental health screening for all schools.
Experts say the kinds of strategies best suited to prevent suicide among Native Americans should deliver services that reflect their diversity, traditions, and cultural and language needs.
That’s what Robert Coberly, 44, was searching for when he needed help.
Coberly began having suicidal thoughts at 10 years old.
“I was scared to live and scared to die. I just didn’t care,” said Coberly, who is a member of the Tulalip Tribes.
He suffered in private for nearly a decade until he almost died in a car crash while driving drunk. After a stay at a rehabilitation center, Coberly remained stable. Years later, though, his suicidal thoughts came rushing back when one of his children died. He sought treatment at a behavioral health center where some of the therapists were Indigenous. They blended Western methodologies with Indigenous customs, which, he said, “I was craving and what I needed.”
Part of his therapy included going to a sweat lodge for ritual steam baths as a means of purification and prayer.

Coberly was a counselor for the Native and Strong Lifeline, the first 988 crisis line for Indigenous people. He is now one of the crisis line tribal resource specialists connecting Indigenous people from Washington state with the resources they need.
“It’s about time we had this line. To be able to connect people with resources and listen to them is something I can’t explain except that I was in a situation where I wanted someone to hear me and talk to,” said Coberly.
Amanda MorningStar said she still worries about her son night and day, but he tries to reassure her.
“I go to sleep and wake up the next day to keep it going,” Ben MorningStar said. “I only get one chance. I might as well make the best of it.”

25L4CLPVL4_10Q15JF77VLQCTK,Biden’s top White House advisers will move to campaign,"By MJ Lee, Jeff Zeleny, Edward-Isaac Dovere and Arlette Saenz, CNN","4 minute read Published 10:38 PM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/23/politics/jen-omalley-dillon-will-move-over-to-biden-campaign-sooner-than-expected/,"President Joe Biden’s campaign is preparing to make a full pivot to the general election with some of the president’s top advisers in the West Wing set to move over to the reelection campaign, as it watches former President Donald Trump’s quick consolidation of the GOP primary.
Biden’s 2020 campaign manager, Jen O’Malley Dillon, will transition to his reelection efforts as campaign chair, according to a senior Biden adviser. Her departure from the White House could come sooner than previously thought, another senior Biden adviser told CNN, because of what the Biden campaign sees as Trump’s quick move to the Republican nomination.
O’Malley Dillon has served as White House deputy chief of staff since Biden’s inauguration.
According to the adviser, another top Biden White House adviser who is in the president’s inner-most circle of aides, Mike Donilon, will also move over to the campaign, becoming its chief strategist. Donilon will be focused on the campaign’s messaging and paid media strategies, campaign officials said.
The moves, set to take place in the “coming weeks” per campaign officials, clearly signal that the Biden campaign is already in general election mode.
“This is the time when the campaign needs to have all hands on deck,” one senior Biden adviser said.
In a statement, Biden praised O’Malley Dillon for leading his “winning campaign in the midst of a historically challenging environment” in 2020 and argued, “no one knows my voice and values better” than Donilon.
“I’m thankful to Mike and Jen both for their service in the White House these last three years, and I am grateful that in rejoining the campaign, they are stepping up one more time to ensure we finish the job for the American people,” the president said.
Shifting some West Wing staff to Biden’s 2024 headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware, has been under discussion for weeks. It is intentionally designed to quiet the concern from leading Democrats – including those in former President Barack Obama’s orbit – that the campaign has not adequately prepared for the fight ahead, one senior Democratic adviser said.
They will work in conjunction with Julie Chavez Rodriguez, who will remain campaign manager, the officials said.
“Mike and Jen were essential members of the senior team that helped President Biden and Vice President Harris earn the most votes in American history in 2020, and we’re thrilled to have their leadership and strategic prowess focused full-time on sending them back to the White House for four more years,” Chavez Rodriguez said in a statement.
Chavez Rodriguez, who was previously the director of the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, had been the target of private criticism of some staff in Wilmington and among leading Biden supporters beyond.
Some aides and top donors alike complained of a lack of direction and believed that top Biden advisers’ decision to choose someone for the job without previous campaign management experience demonstrated that they were not sufficiently serious about the challenges ahead for the 2024 campaign.
Chavez Rodriguez’s defenders tend to acknowledge her shortcomings in the job, but argue that she was at a disadvantage with most of Biden’s inner circle in the West Wing, who have to date retained control of all significant decisions for the campaign at the expense of not empowering the person with the title of being in charge.
That includes O’Malley Dillon, who, despite telling many privately she had no interest in another stint as Biden campaign manager, was guiding decisions about strategy and operations in addition to her duties in the White House.
According to a senior Biden adviser, it is also possible that Anita Dunn, one of Biden’s closest advisers, would eventually move over to the campaign. But that would not happen imminently, they said.
Trump has largely consolidated the GOP primary field in the first two nominating contests, something the Biden campaign had long planned for and viewed as an eventuality. The current president remains wracked with low approval ratings and polling in key battleground states reflects a tight potential rematch with his predecessor.
O’Malley Dillon will be among those working to change minds as voters begin to tune in. As CNN first reported earlier this month, the Biden campaign’s internal research shows that most of the undecided voters that the campaign is targeting – nearly three-in-four of them – do not appear to believe that Trump is likely to be the Republican presidential nominee.
These moves, a source familiar said, will coincide with Biden spending increasingly more time on the campaign trail as he looks ahead to the general election.
He held his first joint rally alongside Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday with a focus on abortion rights in Northern Virginia, and on Wednesday, he is set to appear alongside the United Auto Workers as the union’s elusive endorsement is looming. He travels to battleground Wisconsin ahead of a weekend trip to South Carolina, where the first Democratic primary of the cycle will be underway on February 3.

29ZCI678Y3_EYTQ91CU4O5OXCK,Exclusive: Israel’s spy chief proposed Hamas leaders leave Gaza as part of broader ceasefire talks,"By Alex Marquardt, CNN","5 minute read Updated 11:04 PM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/22/politics/israel-proposal-hamas-leaders-leave-gaza/,"Israel has proposed that Hamas senior leaders could leave Gaza as part of a broader ceasefire agreement, two officials familiar with the ongoing international discussions told CNN.
The extraordinary proposal, which has not been previously reported, comes as Israel has struggled to achieve its stated goal of completely destroying Hamas. Despite its nearly four-month war in Gaza, Israel has failed to capture or kill any of Hamas’s most senior leaders in Gaza and left around 70% of Hamas’ fighting force intact, according to Israel’s own estimates.
Though it would give safe passage out of Gaza for top Hamas leaders who orchestrated the October 7 attack, draining Gaza of its leaders could weaken Hamas’ grip on the war-torn area while also allowing Israel to continue tracking down high-value targets abroad.
Senior Hamas officials are known to live in Doha, Qatar, and the Lebanese capital Beirut, among other places outside the Palestinian territories. An Israeli airstrike earlier this month killed a top Hamas commander in Beirut.
Israel’s suggestion that Hamas leaders could leave Gaza, though unlikely to be accepted by Hamas, has been discussed as part of broader ceasefire negotiations at least twice in recent weeks — once last month in Warsaw by Israel’s intelligence chief, Mossad Director David Barnea, and then again this month in Doha with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, according to one official familiar with the discussions.
It also comes amid a flurry of diplomatic activity to try to achieve an extended break in the fighting and free hostages believed to still be alive in Gaza. The White House’s top official for the Middle East, Brett McGurk, is traveling to Egypt and Qatar this week for further talks.
American and international officials familiar with the negotiations have said that Israel and Hamas’ recent engagement in talks is encouraging but that a deal doesn’t appear imminent.
Pressure is building on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to deliver some kind of resolution. The “complete victory” over Hamas that he has called for is a long way off, by his own admission. Meanwhile, anger among Israelis has grown over the inability of the government to bring home the more than 100 hostages being held in Gaza.
Israel is “not achieving their military objectives,” says Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. That, combined with the “enormous pressure” on Netanyahu and his government to bring hostages home, Miller said, has created a situation where Israel would be willing to propose having Hamas leaders leave Gaza.
“I think they’re simply bumping up against against reality,” said Miller. “And hostage families are beginning to exert tremendous influence.”
In addition, international sentiment toward Israel has soured over its continued bombardment of Gaza, which has killed more than 25,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry.
For the past two months, the Biden administration has been openly calling on Israel to transition to a lower-intensity phase of the conflict, which US officials argue has started happening, though intense operations continue in southern Gaza.
The proposal for Hamas leaders to leave Gaza was raised in Warsaw in December by Barnea, Israel’s top intelligence official when he met with US CIA Director Bill Burns and Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al Thani, who has acted as an intermediary with Hamas. The official familiar with the discussions in the meetings said it was then brought up again when Blinken was in the Qatari capital earlier this month.
In that meeting Blinken was told by al Thani that the Israeli idea “would never work,” the official said. In part because of distrust by Hamas that Israel would in fact end its operations against Hamas in Gaza even after its leadership left.
A second official, from the Middle East, was told about Israel’s proposal by the US.
The US State Department, CIA and the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office all declined to comment.
While it’s unclear whether in private discussions Israel has named which Hamas leaders they would hope to leave Gaza, there is no bigger target than Yahya Sinwar, Hamas’ top official in Gaza. Sinwar is a “dead man walking,” Netanyahu and others have said.
Sinwar spent two decades in Israeli prisons and is originally from Khan Younis in southern Gaza, where the bulk of Israel’s operations in Gaza are currently focused. Israeli and US officials have said they believe Sinwar could be hiding out in the vast, deep network of tunnels under the city, Gaza’s second biggest.
His closest confidantes and aides are Mohammed Deif, the leader of Hamas’ armed wing, along with Deif’s deputy Marwan Issa. Sinwar’s brother Mohammed is also a senior Hamas commander. None are believed to have been found or killed by Israel.
Last month Israel dropped leaflets on Gaza offering rewards of hundreds of thousands of dollars for information on the Hamas leaders, including a $400,000 reward for information on Sinwar.
“The goal is bringing down Hamas as the ruler in the Gaza Strip,” said Ofer Shelah, a senior researcher at Israel’s Institute for National Security Studies.
“There is no difference if [Sinwar] dies, or if he leaves,” Shelah said. “If he dies, then somebody could take over much in the same way. If we bring all the hostages back and Sinwar leaves, definitely that would make most people in Israel feel that we’ve won the war.”
American officials believe it is highly unlikely Sinwar and those around him would agree to leave Gaza, preferring instead to die fighting their sworn enemy.
Israel has made no secret of its intention to continue hunting Hamas leaders long after the war is over.
Netanyahu said in November he had “instructed the Mossad to act against the heads of Hamas wherever they are.” Ronen Bar, the director of Israel’s domestic security agency Shin Bet, has vowed to “eliminate Hamas” around the world, even if it takes years.
“Everywhere: in Gaza, Israel, Lebanon, Turkey, Qatar, everywhere,” Bar said in a recording aired in early December by Israel’s public broadcaster, Kan.
Sinwar could perhaps be convinced to leave, Miller argued, if Israel were to agree to an “asymmetrical” trade of many times more Palestinian prisoners held by Israel than Israeli hostages.
“I think he would only consider it in the event the Israelis also agreed to free all of the Palestinian prisoners,” Miller said.
“Whatever the Israelis agree to, Sinwar must know that they’re going to try to kill him,” he added. “Weeks, months years.”"
2A3V0MT794_TVJP6RZ90SCMEUA,"Before part of an Alaska Airlines plane blew off, Boeing had removed and adjusted it, reports say","By David Goldman, CNN","5 minute read Published 8:24 AM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/25/business/boeing-737-max-door/,"Before the plane took its first flight, Boeing had removed and reinstalled the part that blew off of an Alaska Airlines flight on January 5, according to reports from the New York Times and the Seattle Times, both citing a person familiar with the matter.
Although federal investigators continue to probe the incident and have not reached any conclusions, the details could provide critical new insight into what may have caused a gaping hole to form in a 737 Max 9 mid-flight.
The reports said the door plug, a part of the plane used to seal the aircraft when no exit door is installed, was removed because Spirit AeroSystems, which makes the fuselage for 737 Max 9 planes, needed to make other repairs to the door plug’s rivets, used to connect various parts together. Boeing then reinstalled the door after Spirit AeroSystems made the repair.
Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems are under multiple investigations that probe their safety policies and procedures. The Federal Aviation Administration recently expanded its Boeing probe to include Spirit AeroSystems, the National Transportation Safety Board is also reviewing the incident, and Washington Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell, chair of the Senate Commerce Committee, announced Wednesday that she would hold a future hearing to investigate Boeing’s safety record.
Boeing said it couldn’t comment on the reports about what may have led to the door plug blowing off the plane, citing the ongoing investigation.
“As the air safety agency responsible for investigating this accident, only the US National Transportation Safety Board can release information about the investigation,” Boeing said in a statement.
Spirit did not respond to a request for comment.
Although details are sparse, there have been some clues about what went wrong over the past few weeks. Boeing CEO David Calhoun on January 9 acknowledged the company made a “mistake” at a staff-wide safety meeting, but he did not specify what that mistake was. NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy has demanded Boeing provide answers about any mistake it made as part of its safety investigation, which is separate from the FAA’s audit.
Alaska Airlines CEO Ben Minicucci on Tuesday revealed the carrier found “some loose bolts on many” Boeing 737 Max 9s in an interview for “NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt.”
The FAA has grounded the 737 Max 9 since the incident. But late Wednesday, it approved a set of inspection criteria for the 171 grounded planes that, if followed, could return the grounded aircraft to service.
But the agency also issued a stern warning to Boeing: “The January 5 Boeing 737-9 Max incident must never happen again.” And it said it would not grant any production expansion of the 737 Max lineup while its safety probe of Boeing continues.
Airlines, especially Alaska and United, had faced hundreds of cancellations a day because of the grounding.
“The exhaustive, enhanced review our team completed after several weeks of information gathering gives me and the FAA confidence to proceed to the inspection and maintenance phase,” FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said in a statement Wednesday.
Each of the 171 grounded aircraft must be inspected, including the bolts, fittings and guide tracks for the door plug. The process also includes tightening fasteners and performing “detailed inspections of…dozens of associated components.”
FAA on Sunday also required airlines to ensure older Boeing 737 planes with similar door plugs were secure. The FAA said airlines operating the Boeing 737-900ER model should visually inspect the planes but didn’t require them to be grounded. Alaska Airlines on Thursday said it has completed all of those inspections “with only one minor finding, which was immediately corrected.”
In a statement Wednesday, Boeing said it will “continue to cooperate fully and transparently with the FAA and follow their direction as we take action to strengthen safety and quality at Boeing.”
But Whitaker noted Boeing itself is not out of the woods.
“Let me be clear: This won’t be back to business as usual for Boeing,” he said. “We will not agree to any request from Boeing for an expansion in production or approve additional production lines for the 737 Max until we are satisfied that the quality control issues uncovered during this process are resolved.”
Boeing has faced repeated quality and safety issues with its aircraft for five years now, leading to the long-term grounding of some jets and the halt in deliveries of others.
The 737 Max’s design was found to be responsible for two fatal crashes: one in Indonesia in October 2018 and the other in Ethiopia in March 2019. Together, the crashes killed all 346 people aboard the two flights and led to a 20-month grounding of the company’s best-selling jets, which cost it more than $21 billion.
Internal communications released during the 737 Max grounding showed one employee describing the jet as “designed by clowns, who in turn are supervised by monkeys.”
Late last month, Boeing asked airlines to inspect all of their 737 Max jets for a potential loose bolt in the rudder system after an airline discovered a potential problem with a key part on two aircraft.
Its quality and engineering problems have extended beyond the 737. Boeing also had to twice halt deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner, for about a year starting in 2021 and again in 2023, due to quality concerns cited by the FAA. And the 777 jet also suffered a grounding after an engine failure on a United flight scattered debris onto homes and the ground below.
Two Max variants — the Max 7 and the Max 10 — are still awaiting approval to begin carrying passengers. This latest incident complicates that, Wells Fargo analysts noted."
2CHUI0683J_BQ71S9PFDHJXC5S,Australia marks national day that stokes patriotism and anger,"By Angus Watson, CNN","6 minute read Updated 9:50 PM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/26/australia/australia-day-national-rallies-2024-intl-hnk/,"“Australia Day is Dead!” Indigenous activist Gwenda Stanley chants into the loudspeaker, as a crowd of thousands breaks into applause.
It’s Australia’s national day, but the crowd in central Sydney seethes in anger and cheers in solidarity with Indigenous Australians, many of whom view January 26 as nothing but the anniversary of their colonial dispossession, 236 years ago this Friday.
“Australia is stolen land and we need to be united and firm in our resistance and sustain that resistance until justice is achieved under our terms,” protest organizer Lynda-June Coe, a Wiradjuri woman, told CNN.
The Sydney crowd is diverse, and it’s replicated in Australian cities nationwide.
Each year an increasing number of non-Indigenous Australians find it impossible to celebrate Australia Day, in the knowledge that many of their Indigenous fellow citizens treat it as a day of mourning.
“I think it’s important to show up for the First Nations people in this country,” says Grace, from the crowd on a hot, humid morning in Belmore Park near Sydney’s Central Station.
“I think that there are plenty of other times that you can party if you want to celebrate the lots of good things about this country,” she says.
Elise wears the black, red and yellow of the Aboriginal flag on her earrings, as her friends hold a sign saying said: “Put down ya beer, pick up a banner. This is not a day to celebrate.”
Nearby, Kevin Shaw-Taylor agrees January 26 is “absolutely not” an appropriate day for national celebrations.
On the other side of the city, the Australia Day party was in full swing. The public holiday gives Australians a three-day weekend in the height of summer just a month after Christmas. Millions took full advantage.
Nowhere are the celebrations more colorful than Sydney Harbor. The city’s iconic yellow and green ferries were decked out in Australia Day regalia to take part in the annual race across the very same water that British Royal Navy officer Arthur Phillip crossed in 1788, planting the British flag at Sydney Cove to proclaim the new colony on January 26.
Frank Bongiorno, a history professor at the Australian National University (ANU), says its “pretty creative” to connect that colonial date to the modern state of Australia – which was founded on January 1, 1901.
That’s why many of Australia’s Indigenous peoples, and an increasing number of the non-Indigenous or “settler” population, have long dubbed the national holiday “Invasion Day” or “Survival Day” – acknowledging British settlement as first and foremost an act of Indigenous dispossession.
This year, the often toxic argument over the colonial past and continued disadvantage for Indigenous people has taken on a new dimension – it’s the first Australia Day since voters rejected a proposal to acknowledge the nation’s first people in its constitution.
Last October, Australians were asked in a referendum whether the country’s constitution should be amended to recognize Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders through the creation of an Indigenous advisory body – the Voice to Parliament – to advise on matters directly impacting Indigenous people.
Supporters said the Voice to Parliament would give First Nations people a say in efforts to remedy issues such as the eight-to-nine year life expectancy gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians or disproportionately high Indigenous incarceration rates.
But more than 60% of voters said no.
A study by the ANU found that most voted against the proposal because they didn’t want division and were wary of giving some Australians rights not held by others – arguments promoted by the referendum’s most vocal critics.
Professor Chelsea Watego, executive director of Queensland University of Technology’s Curumba Institute for Indigenous research, says the result reflected the Australian public’s attitude toward Indigenous people, who make up just under 3% of the population.
“It was a test for the Australian people to finally come clean and maybe have an honest conversation about racism in this country. But they can’t and they won’t. They will never let go of it because it enables them to occupy stolen land and not feel guilty about it,” says Watego, a Munanjahli and South Sea Islander woman.

Instead of guilt on Australia Day, a vast number of Australians “associate it with summer fun,” says Bongiorno, from the ANU. “Its particular cultural and political implications for many people are rather muted.”
But that is changing, according to both professors, who see an increasing number of non-Indigenous Australians choosing to use the day to mourn Indigenous loss and advocate for better outcomes.
Bongiorno says one ramification of a bitterly fought debate over the Indigenous Voice to Parliament, which descended into a swirl of misinformation and ugly rhetoric, is a sense that political capital can be won by stoking the culture war.
“The main impact has been on the domestic politics,” he said.
“Clearly the (center-right) Coalition parties (led by) Peter Dutton believes they got an advantage from their opposition to the Voice and now they are attempting to squeeze further advantage out of controversies around Australia Day.”
Dutton, who serves as federal opposition leader, this month called on Australians to boycott the country’s largest supermarket chain, Woolworths, over its decision not to sell cheap Australia Day paraphernalia ahead of the holiday. Dutton labeled the firm’s decision an “outrage” and “against the national interest.”
A Woolworths store in Queensland was vandalized in the wake of Dutton’s comments – spray-painted with curses and the nationalistic sporting catchphrase: “Aussie Oi Oi Oi.”
Woolworths CEO Brad Banducci took out full-page advertisements in national newspapers explaining the decision was a commercial one and appealing for the company’s staff to be kept safe.
One prominent commercial television breakfast host goaded Banducci for serving up “wokeness on aisle 3.”
“They are proud, hardworking Australians,” Banducci said of the Woolworths workforce. “For them to be seen as anti-Australian or woke is fundamentally unfair. Fair to address it to me but not to them.”
As emotions run high, vandalism has gone both ways. A century-old statue of Captain Cook was found face down in the grass in Melbourne on Thursday, his severed feet still attached to the plinth that celebrates his charting of Australia’s east coast and his proclamation of the land as British in 1770, almost two decades before the colony was established. Red paint was also splashed over a monument to Queen Victoria.
With all the toxic rhetoric, the hurt feelings and damaged pride – there has been little room in the mainstream post-referendum debate for new initiatives to remedy the tangible problem of Indigenous disadvantage.
Instead, the notion of the Blak Sovereign Movement has gained traction among Indigenous people who do not want to have to ask the settler population for their rights, instead vowing to empower themselves to control their own affairs.

Many proponents of Blak Sovereignty voted no in the referendum for that reason.
“I’m always excited about the way in which Blakfullas clap back, often under the most oppressive circumstances,” said Watego, using a term by which many Indigenous Australians self identify.
“The 26th of January is when we come together each year, to remember not just what we’ve lost, but to make a powerful statement to settlers that we’re not going anywhere, we’re not a dying race and we’re not going to be absorbed into the general population.”"
2NOIVUQWVC_XONE9WVVUBAQZY0,Biden spoke with ceasefire advocates as his team grapples with reality of regular protests,"By MJ Lee and Kevin Liptak, CNN","4 minute read Published 7:00 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/25/politics/biden-ceasefire-advocates-protests/,"President Joe Biden was working a photoline backstage on Wednesday after receiving the United Auto Workers’ coveted political endorsement at its’ annual conference in Washington, DC, when a small group of union members supporting a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war approached him.
Biden briefly spoke with the members about their concerns, in an exchange that multiple people – including Michigan Rep. Debbie Dingell, who was present – described as “respectful” and “cordial.” The president also shook hands with the group and poised for photos, according to one source familiar with the matter. (Dingell declined to share other details with CNN, saying private conversations should remain precisely that.)
One attendee told CNN that prior to the UAW conference, they had reached out to the White House to offer them a courtesy note of caution: There were certain to be pro-ceasefire protesters in the audience. The union itself had endorsed a ceasefire in December.
The White House responded that the president was prepared to take some time to speak with those individuals if they asked to have that conversation with him, according to that attendee.
That attendee happened to be right: Biden’s remarks to the union members were interrupted by protesters, including one who unfurled a Palestinian flag and shouted: “Call for a humanitarian ceasefire!” The group was quickly led out of the room as Biden paused his speech.
Afterward, however, the president listened closely to the concerns of some union members backstage about the situation in Gaza before departing the venue to return to the White House.
“I know, he knows how to talk to people. It’s an issue we’re going to have to talk about and deal with,” Dingell said Wednesday on CNN.
Even as Biden remains staunchly supportive of Israel in its campaign against Hamas, aides say he is acutely aware of the anger and passion the war has generated, particularly among young progressives. The outcry would be hard for him to miss: protests have now sprung up during private fundraisers, at a Christmas tree lighting, outside the White House and ever near his secluded home in Delaware.
Biden’s conversation with the UAW members backstage following the speech interruption came the day after a campaign rally in northern Virginia that was paused more than a dozen times, including by people unfurling a banner reading “Genocide Joe.”
Advisers say the president and his team are prepared for his speeches to be interrupted going forward as the war in Gaza rages on, even if exactly when and where can be hard to predict. While aides have been irritated when protests obscure the message of the president’s speech, they say the moments aren’t out of the ordinary for a public figure.
Biden is also open to meeting with critics of his policies, White House officials say, as he navigates the fraught politics of the Gaza war.
At previous speeches, Biden has sought to succinctly explain his position to the people shouting in the audience: “I understand the passion and I’ve been quietly working with the Israeli government to reduce – significantly get out of Gaza,” Biden said as the protesters were led out.
At Tuesday’s speech – which was intended as a fiery defense of abortion rights, a galvanizing issue for Democrats – Biden flashed moments of irritation as protester after protester prevented him from proceeding with his speech.
“This is going to go on for a while,” he said when it had become clear the protesters had carefully planned their one-after-another interruptions.
Yet he did not publicly tell the protesters to quiet down or leave the venue – a distinction with his predecessor that his team has been eager to highlight. Volunteers and staff at events have also not attempted to bar people from attending, even if they suspect they will disrupt the president’s speech.
“I think what you saw yesterday was a president who understands and respects Americans’ fundamental First Amendment rights to peacefully protest. I think that stands in stark contrast to Donald Trump and the Republicans, who don’t seem to understand the same thing, who only want to use these situations to fan the flames and further divide people,” Biden campaign communications director Michael Tyler said Wednesday.
Since the October 7 Hamas terror attacks that launched the Gaza war, the administration has sought to engage Arab and Muslim American leaders in conversations about the conflict, including a meeting in October between Biden and leaders of community groups.
At that session – during which the leaders called for a ceasefire and encouraged Biden to show more empathy for Palestinians – the president listened and sought to clarify some of his positions, attendees said afterward.
Since then, however, the White House hasn’t publicly disclosed additional meetings between Biden and activists who are calling for a ceasefire.
“I can’t speak to a direct conversation that he’s had, but he hears from Americans all the time about their different views that they have,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said this week. “That is something that the president is very aware of.”"

Biden’s 2020 campaign manager, Jen O’Malley Dillon, will transition to his reelection efforts as campaign chair, according to a senior Biden adviser. Her departure from the White House could come sooner than previously thought, another senior Biden adviser told CNN, because of what the Biden campaign sees as Trump’s quick move to the Republican nomination.
O’Malley Dillon has served as White House deputy chief of staff since Biden’s inauguration.
According to the adviser, another top Biden White House adviser who is in the president’s inner-most circle of aides, Mike Donilon, will also move over to the campaign, becoming its chief strategist. Donilon will be focused on the campaign’s messaging and paid media strategies, campaign officials said.
The moves, set to take place in the “coming weeks” per campaign officials, clearly signal that the Biden campaign is already in general election mode.
“This is the time when the campaign needs to have all hands on deck,” one senior Biden adviser said.
In a statement, Biden praised O’Malley Dillon for leading his “winning campaign in the midst of a historically challenging environment” in 2020 and argued, “no one knows my voice and values better” than Donilon.
“I’m thankful to Mike and Jen both for their service in the White House these last three years, and I am grateful that in rejoining the campaign, they are stepping up one more time to ensure we finish the job for the American people,” the president said.
Shifting some West Wing staff to Biden’s 2024 headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware, has been under discussion for weeks. It is intentionally designed to quiet the concern from leading Democrats – including those in former President Barack Obama’s orbit – that the campaign has not adequately prepared for the fight ahead, one senior Democratic adviser said.
They will work in conjunction with Julie Chavez Rodriguez, who will remain campaign manager, the officials said.
“Mike and Jen were essential members of the senior team that helped President Biden and Vice President Harris earn the most votes in American history in 2020, and we’re thrilled to have their leadership and strategic prowess focused full-time on sending them back to the White House for four more years,” Chavez Rodriguez said in a statement.
Chavez Rodriguez, who was previously the director of the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, had been the target of private criticism of some staff in Wilmington and among leading Biden supporters beyond.
Some aides and top donors alike complained of a lack of direction and believed that top Biden advisers’ decision to choose someone for the job without previous campaign management experience demonstrated that they were not sufficiently serious about the challenges ahead for the 2024 campaign.
Chavez Rodriguez’s defenders tend to acknowledge her shortcomings in the job, but argue that she was at a disadvantage with most of Biden’s inner circle in the West Wing, who have to date retained control of all significant decisions for the campaign at the expense of not empowering the person with the title of being in charge.
That includes O’Malley Dillon, who, despite telling many privately she had no interest in another stint as Biden campaign manager, was guiding decisions about strategy and operations in addition to her duties in the White House.
According to a senior Biden adviser, it is also possible that Anita Dunn, one of Biden’s closest advisers, would eventually move over to the campaign. But that would not happen imminently, they said.
Trump has largely consolidated the GOP primary field in the first two nominating contests, something the Biden campaign had long planned for and viewed as an eventuality. The current president remains wracked with low approval ratings and polling in key battleground states reflects a tight potential rematch with his predecessor.
O’Malley Dillon will be among those working to change minds as voters begin to tune in. As CNN first reported earlier this month, the Biden campaign’s internal research shows that most of the undecided voters that the campaign is targeting – nearly three-in-four of them – do not appear to believe that Trump is likely to be the Republican presidential nominee.
These moves, a source familiar said, will coincide with Biden spending increasingly more time on the campaign trail as he looks ahead to the general election.
He held his first joint rally alongside Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday with a focus on abortion rights in Northern Virginia, and on Wednesday, he is set to appear alongside the United Auto Workers as the union’s elusive endorsement is looming. He travels to battleground Wisconsin ahead of a weekend trip to South Carolina, where the first Democratic primary of the cycle will be underway on February 3.

2UDP04AXZL_ZYGNCMOVN43BHUS,The Los Angeles Times plunges into ‘chaos’ as brutal layoffs loom and senior editors call it quits,"By Oliver Darcy, CNN","5 minute read Published 6:30 AM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/23/media/los-angeles-times-layoffs-strike/,"Editor’s Note: A version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here.
The Los Angeles Times is in disarray.
The Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong-owned newspaper, which houses the largest newsroom in the western U.S., has been thrown into a state of mayhem as severe layoffs loom and senior editorial leaders abruptly call it quits.
“I cannot overstate the level of chaos,” one   staffer, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak   publicly, candidly told me on Monday.
To say that it has been a rocky start to the new year for the venerable news outlet would be an understatement. Earlier this month, Kevin Merida suddenly announced that he was departing his post as executive editor after less than three years on the job. Then, news of forthcoming mass layoffs ensued, prompting the employee’s union to stage a historic one-day walk out on Friday. The LAT’s Meg James reported last week that management could slash upwards of 20% of the newsroom — or roughly 100 positions — with the looming layoffs, though a person familiar with the matter warned to me on Monday that it could ultimately end up being “much worse” than that.
Meanwhile, amid the backdrop of bedlam, the team of four managing editors — Julia Turner, Sara Yasin, Scott Kraft, and Shani Hilton — tapped to oversee operations in the wake of Merida’s departure has also been rocked by departures. Two of the four members, BuzzFeed News alums Hilton and Yasin, have in recent days exited the newspaper, contributing even further to the turmoil that has enveloped the newsroom.
“We have a billionaire who doesn’t understand media and thinks he can cut his way to success,” another staffer told me, likening the drama playing out in the editorial leadership to the reality television show “Survivor.”
Seeking to provide the newsroom with some sense of stability, Turner emailed staffers on Monday announcing that she would oversee daily editorial operations with Kraft and absorb all of Hilton’s direct reports. Notably, Turner was not shy about the grim reality confronting the newspaper, writing to employees, “Scott and I are now responsible for all editorial operations, and we’re advocating for editorial interests in conversations with the company about the financial crisis we face.”
Beyond the drastic cuts hanging over the newsroom, it’s unclear what Soon-Shiong is doing behind the scenes to stable his ship. The biotech billionaire purchased The LAT in 2018, pouring nearly $1 billion into the storied paper and vowing to steer it into the future after enduring years of tumult under Tribune Publishing. But in the words of the newspaper’s own leadership team, years later under his stewardship it is in a dire state of “financial crisis.”
The newsroom’s rank-and-file have not heard from Soon-Shiong since he   announced Merida’s exit two weeks ago. At the time, he said his commitment to   the newspaper had “not wavered.” But he did foreshadow a period of   disruption, telling staffers, “Given the persistent challenges we face,   it is now imperative that we all work together to build a sustainable   business that allows for growth and innovation of the LA Times and LA Times   Studios in order to achieve our vision.”
The Times is certainly not alone in its struggles. Most news media companies are fighting to stand on their feet as they fight unprecedented headwinds. Layoffs have become the de facto norm in an industry continually pummeled by seismic change. In 2023, news outlets slashed nearly 2,700 jobs — the highest number of cuts to torment the industry since the Covid-19 pandemic.
The cuts have come at a horrendous time. As antidemocratic   candidates look to seize power in election contests from coast to coast,   newsrooms are shrinking and simply trying to stay afloat. That lack of   accountability means dishonest figures seeking higher office, and those in   positions of power, could avoid crucial scrutiny, leaving the electorate less   informed about the vital decisions it will have to make in November at the   ballot box.
That said, while painful cuts have become all too frequent   throughout the industry, it’s still rare to watch in real-time as a news   organization of The LAT’s stature see its leadership team come apart at the   seams so visibly — particularly as staffers brace for even more agony.
On Monday, 10 Democratic members of Congress representing   California wrote Soon-Shiong, expressing alarm over the planned layoffs,   noting that during elections, “the role of news outlets in providing   accurate and unbiased information becomes even more vital.”
“Our community relies on the newspaper to stay informed   about local and national events, and a reduction in reporters could have a   detrimental impact on the quality of reporting,” the congressional   leaders wrote. “Preserving democracy is contingent upon a free and   robust press, and the LA Times has been instrumental in upholding this   democratic principle.”
“We urge you to consider alternative solutions that would   allow the LA Times to navigate its financial challenges without compromising   the integrity and strength of its newsroom.”
In response, Soon-Shiong said he had invested hundreds of   millions of dollars into the paper and suggested lawmakers should take action   of their own to aid revenue-starved news organizations.
“I’d like to put the question to them: What can they do   to help preserve a free and robust press, one that is instrumental in   upholding our democracy?” he wrote. “All we are asking for is the   opportunity for our newspaper and hardworking journalists to be fairly   compensated, and for the L.A. Times to have a fair chance to become a   self-sustaining institution.”"
2UOZMH1DME_X7NW8JSXGLLFMD7,Biden to host Japanese PM for official state visit in April,"By Donald Judd, Betsy Klein and Shania Shelton, CNN","3 minute read Published 1:17 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/25/politics/biden-japanese-prime-minister-state-visit/,"President Joe Biden and first lady Dr. Jill Biden will host Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and his wife, Yuko Kishida, at the White House this April for an official state visit and state dinner, the White House announced Thursday.
“The visit will underscore the enduring strength of our alliance partnership, the unwavering U.S. commitment to Japan, and Japan’s increasing global leadership role,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement announcing the visit.
Jean-Pierre said Biden and Kishida will discuss “efforts to strengthen our political, security, economic, and people-to-people ties so that our alliance is postured to address evolving challenges and advance our shared vision for a free, open, secure, and prosperous Indo-Pacific region and world.”
The two leaders last met one-one-one during November’s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in San Francisco, building on a historic trilateral summit with South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol in August.
“This will obviously underscore the importance of our alliance with Japan and our bilateral relationship, and also all the work we’re doing together to improve and strengthen, not only our bilateral cooperation but our cooperation with Japan and other allies across the Indo-Pacific, really trying to pursue a safe and secure, prosperous Indo Pacific,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters on Air Force One Thursday.
April’s state dinner will mark the fifth state dinner of the Biden administration, an opportunity for the White House to treat the visiting country’s leader to pomp and circumstance with fine attention to diplomatic details.
Biden welcomed Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese for a state dinner in October as the crisis in the Middle East was increasingly becoming an all-consuming focus for the president and his team.
He invited Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the White House in June for a state visit in an era of growing tensions between the US and China and as India surpassed China to become the most populous country on Earth.
The president has also previously hosted French President Emmanuel Macron and South Korea’s Yoon.
The visit points to the administration’s continued engagement with Indo-Pacific nations as it seeks to counter China’s influence in the region.
Biden has visited Japan twice as president. He met in May with Kishida during a visit to Japan on the eve of the G7 Summit in Hiroshima, emphasizing close US-Japan relations at a time of China’s growing military and economic ambitions, as well as Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine.
Biden, who is the second US president to visit Hiroshima, pointed to deepening cooperation between the US and Japan on emerging technologies, including new partnerships on quantum computing and semiconductors.
He made his first presidential visit to Asia in 2022, where he met with Kishida, along with the leaders of India and Australia, and used Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to send a message to China that the US would be willing to respond militarily if the country invades the self-governing island of Taiwan."

Office work has become a far less rigid affair in the era of remote collaboration and hybrid schedules. (Just ask me, I’m writing this in bed while wearing a hoodie and yoga pants on a Monday afternoon.)
But a lot of companies haven’t updated their scripts when it comes to delivering hard news to their employees.
Corporate-speak — that banal, jargon-heavy workplace lingo — is one of those dehumanizing habits from the Before Times that has proven hard to break.
And in the era of TikTok (and shameless oversharing online generally), that’s increasingly proving to be a liability.
ICYMI: Two weeks ago, a Cloudflare employee filmed herself getting fired over a web meeting in an interaction that company’s CEO later called “painful” to watch, partly because of the lack of humanity in the way HR reps delivered the news
And this week, the CEO of clothing company Kyte Baby offered up two public apologies — the first for denying an employee’s request to work remotely while that employee’s newborn was in intensive care, and a second for how detached and scripted the first apology sounded.
In both situations, the corporate comms strategy, or lack thereof, made an already difficult, emotional situation even worse. The companies stuck to their rigid rules about remote work and performance metrics. And in both cases, the fired employees funneled their anger toward a social media audience that would have their backs.
“I am forever amazed at the tendency of corporate America to want to strip the humanity out of their communications, whether it be an apology or any other public statement,” crisis PR expert James Haggerty told my colleague Eva Rothenberg.
“It could be that the lawyers get too involved, and have final say too often. More likely, though, it’s that everyone in the corporate environment is just so used to falling back on corporate-speak, banal cliches, legalese and muddied equivocation. What works in a corporate board meeting doesn’t often fly with the public … and it sure doesn’t work on social media.”
Kyte Baby’s CEO and founder, Ying Liu, learned that the hard way this week.
In her first apology, Liu is on message — clearly reading from a prepared statement — succinct and stiff. It is the kind of button-down speech that might not have raised eyebrows if delivered in a board room.

But on TikTok, outrage over the employee’s situation was already boiling over, and Liu’s canned delivery struck the exact wrong note, as she later acknowledged.
“The comments were right — it was scripted … I just basically read it, it wasn’t sincere,” she says in her second apology video. “I’ve decided to go off script and just tell you exactly what happened.”
In the Cloudflare layoff video, viewed more than 2 million times on TikTok alone, two HR employees can be heard telling the woman that her performance didn’t meet expectations.
The problem, Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince wrote on X, was that the two HR reps had never met the woman they were letting go, and couldn’t provide any specifics when she pressed them for information. The laid-off employee noted that she had just been hired in August and had been told she was an excellent employee.
“Clearly we were far from perfect … HR should be involved, but it shouldn’t be outsourced to them,” Prince wrote. “No employee should ever actually be surprised they weren’t performing.”
Whether the Cloudflare episode is something we should model is debatable (and the people on the internet are certainly debating). But either way, the episode underscores a relatively new tool workers have to wield power and rally support when they feel mistreated.
Once upon a time, a bungled speech or messy layoff might have sparked some grumbling, but would rarely be caught on video or rabidly shared and commented upon by millions of people outside the company.

State broadcaster CCTV reported that a further five people were injured and 12,426 evacuated from affected areas.
The quake struck Wushi county, also known as Uqturpan county, in Aksu prefecture near the Kyrgyzstan border shortly after 2 a.m. local time, state-run news agency Xinhua reported.
Strong tremors caused two houses to collapse and downed two major power lines near the epicenter, though electricity was quickly restored, according to Xinhua, and tremors were felt in Central Asian countries hundreds of miles away.
Rescue missions are taking place in cold weather with temperatures expected to reach minus 23 degrees Celsius (minus 9.4 degrees Fahrenheit) in Wushi county in the next three days, China’s Meteorological Agency said Tuesday.
The Xinjiang railway authority immediately sealed off routes in areas affected by the quake and suspended 27 trains, Xinhua reported.
Three people were hospitalized in a township 26 kilometers (16 miles) from the epicenter, state broadcaster CCTV reported. A child was rescued from the rubble of their house in that township, the broadcaster said.
Nearly 200 rescue workers have been dispatched to the quake zone, and hundreds more are being assembled, Xinhua reported.
More than 50 aftershocks above magnitude 3 were reported as of 11 a.m. Tuesday, according to the state-run China Earthquake Networks Center.
The quake’s epicenter is a remote, mountainous and sparsely populated area at an altitude above 3,000 meters (9,842 feet), CCTV said.
Five villages are located within a radius of 20 kilometers from the epicenter, which is about 50 kilometers from Wushi county’s main urban area, Xinhua reported.
Wushi county has a population of 205,000 people, according to China’s latest census in 2020.
Heavy tremors were felt in cities hundreds of miles away, including the Silk Road oasis of Kashgar and Hotan in southern Xinjiang.
Videos posted by Xinjiang residents on Chinese social media show lights swinging and crashing onto the floor, and crowds taking shelter outside in the streets, wrapped in winter jackets and blankets as overnight temperatures dropped as low as -10 degrees Celsius (14 degrees Fahrenheit).
The tremors were also felt across the border in Kyrgyzstan, according to the United States Geological Survey.
In nearby Kazakhstan, at least 44 people were injured in the country’s largest city Almaty following the quake, authorities said Tuesday. The quake was also felt as far away as Uzbekistan, Reuters reported.

Residents in the rural areas of southern and western Xinjiang are mostly Uyghurs, a predominantly Muslim ethnic minority that has been targeted by a sweeping Chinese government crackdown in recent years, from mass detention to strict restrictions on religious and cultural life.
A United Nations report said China committed “serious human rights violations” against Uyghurs that may amount to “crimes against humanity” – accusations that Beijing has vehemently denied.
In December, a powerful earthquake killed 151 people in the provinces of Gansu and Qinghai in northwest China, the deadliest quake to hit the country in nine years.

2Y6XH42QCH_8HQCRABL7ULXDRY,Another Biden business associate says Joe Biden was not involved in foreign business dealings,"By Annie Grayer, CNN","3 minute read Updated 6:17 PM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/26/politics/john-robinson-walker-house-republican-interview/,"Hunter Biden business associate John Robinson Walker said in a closed-door interview on Friday that President Joe Biden “was never involved” in any of his business dealings with the president’s son, according to Walker’s opening statement provided first to CNN.
Walker is among a growing list of Biden family business associates who have undercut Republican allegations related to their impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden including another business associate of the Biden family who testified behind closed doors on Thursday.
The committees conducting the investigation subpoenaed Walker in November for his testimony, claiming that he may know whether the president had been involved in his family’s business dealings, an unproven allegation that rests at the heart of their probe.
“In business, the opportunities we pursued together were varied, valid, well-founded, and well within the bounds of legitimate business activities. To be clear, President Biden-while in office or as a private citizen-was never involved in any of the business activities we pursued,” Walker said according to his opening statement.
“Any statement to the contrary is simply false,” Walker added. “Hunter made sure there was always a clear boundary between any business and his father. Always. And as his partner, I always understood and respected that boundary.”
Walker also discussed an interaction he had with Joe Biden shortly after he left office in 2017, House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan told reporters. Walker testified to the FBI in 2020 that Joe Biden, shortly after he left office, made in appearance at a lunch Hunter Biden was having with foreign business associates at the Four Seasons in Washington DC.
“He literally sat down. I don’t even think he drank water,” Walker told the FBI of Joe Biden’s appearance at the Four Seasons lunch meeting Hunter Biden was having with a Chinese energy company, CEFC, that Walker also attended.
Walker also said in his 2020 interview with the FBI that he believed Hunter Biden orchestrated for his father to show up to that meeting and that there were times he heard Hunter say he was setting up a meeting with his father who was then serving as the vice president.
But even in 2020, Walker testified, “I certainly never was thinking at any time that ah … the V. P. was a part of anything we were doing.’”
Jordan characterized the Four Seasons lunch interaction as “the biggest thing” he had learned so far.
Jordan said the timing of the Four Seasons meeting is “interesting” because shortly after, CEFC wired $3 million to Biden family business associates that members of the Biden family received indirectly. Republicans have zeroed in on the deals between Walker and the president’s son but there is no evidence of wrongdoing by the president.
Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin told reporters that Walker has repeatedly stated during the interview that Joe Biden was not involved in any of his business dealings with Hunter Biden. He said Walker testified Joe Biden’s appearance at the Four Seasons meeting lasted “less than 10 minutes,” and he “didn’t order any food, he wasn’t having drinks, it was a drop by to say hello.”
“The aimlessness of this investigation continues. It’s a like a fishing expedition with no fishing rods or poles or lines or bait or tackle or a map,” Raskin added.
Walker said in his opening statement he is “very concerned” that his closed-door testimony on Friday could be taken “out of context” given recent accusations that Republicans have misrepresented closed-door testimony, and asked that any public statements about the interview include the entire transcript.
Walker testified that he began working with Hunter Biden around 2008.
Upon walking into his closed-door interview, Walker told reporters he plans to tell the committee “the truth.”
After roughly seven hours of closed-door testimony, Walker left the building and said, “I answered questions to the best of my ability.”

2ZJHVUH4B4_R9MTHAUG3Y4U70C,An Alabama inmate was executed with nitrogen gas. How does it work?,"By Lauren Mascarenhas, CNN","5 minute read Updated 11:11 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/25/us/nitrogen-gas-execution/,"Alabama inmate Kenneth Smith was put to death Thursday night, marking the nation’s first known execution using nitrogen gas.
Smith, who was sentenced to death for his role in a 1988 murder for hire and already survived a botched execution attempt by lethal injection, was at the center of a heated debate over whether the execution method constitutes cruelty.
Smith’s lawyers made several eleventh-hour attempts to prevent the execution. A federal appeals court on Wednesday and the US Supreme Court on Wednesday and Thursday declined to halt it.
Related article Alabama plans the first nitrogen gas execution this week in largely secret process experts say raises concerns about cruelty
“Execution is a very specific kind of punishment, and no punishment, according to the US Constitution, can be carried out in a cruel fashion,” Dr. Joel Zivot, an associate professor of anesthesiology and surgery at Emory University, told CNN. “And so the only real question is: Is execution with nitrogen gas cruel?”
Officials started using lethal injection to kill people on death row about 40 years ago, and it’s since become the most widely used execution method across the 27 states where capital punishment is legal.
Around 2009, the drugs used to carry out lethal injections became harder to access, and states began turning to alternative drugs – a shift that has been tied to a surge of complications with the procedure.
That’s what happened when Alabama first tried to execute Smith in November 2022, and officials were unable to set an intravenous line before the execution warrant expired.
Only three states – Alabama, Oklahoma and Mississippi – have approved the use of nitrogen gas for capital punishment, and experts say there is no real blueprint for the execution method. Alabama has published a protocol for the procedure, though it contains redactions the state says are meant to maintain security.
Alabama officials planned to use a mask to administer the nitrogen to Smith. Smith likely would have been strapped down when this occurred, Zivot said before the execution.
Nitrogen hypoxia would occur when a high concentration of the gas is inhaled, replacing oxygen in the body and causing death.
The process essentially disables the respiratory system, said Dr. Jonathan Groner, a professor of surgery at The Ohio State University College of Medicine.
Some officials say that a person would likely lose consciousness shortly into the procedure, making it more humane than other execution methods. However, doctors have said that they could not pinpoint if or when a person will lose consciousness when exposed to high concentrations of nitrogen gas.
On Thursday night, the execution process started at 7:53 p.m. CT, and a physician pronounced Smith dead at 8:25 p.m. CT, Alabama Department of Corrections Commissioner John Hamm said. Nitrogen flowed for about 15 minutes during that time, and “nothing … out of the ordinary” happened compared to “what we were expecting,” Hamm said.
According to witnesses from the news media, Smith “appeared conscious for several minutes into the execution.”
“For about two minutes following that, Kenneth Smith shook and writhed … on a gurney,” the media witnesses said in a joint report. “That was followed by several minutes of deep breaths on the gurney.”
“Following that, his breath slowed until it was no longer perceptible for media witnesses,” the journalists said in their joint report.
Asked whether the shaking and writhing was evidence that Smith suffered, Hamm said: “(It) appeared that, one, Smith was holding his breath has long as he could.”
“And then there’s also information out there that he struggled against his restrains a little but, but there’s some involuntary movement and some agonal breathing, so that was all expected and is in the side effects that we’ve seen or researched on nitrogen hypoxia,” Hamm said. Agonal breathing is usually described as a kind of gasping seen in people who are dying.
This month, United Nations experts raised the alarm that Smith’s execution could constitute torture, saying in a news release, “We are concerned that nitrogen hypoxia would result in a painful and humiliating death.”
While doctors couldn’t say definitely, ahead of the execution, what would happen to Smith, the possibilities left many concerned.
If a mask is not secured tightly enough, oxygen could leak in, prolonging the death, experts say.
“When we put 100% non-rebreather face masks on our patients, they never get 100%, because there’s some leakage,” Groner said before Smith’s execution. “I feel pretty confident that he’s not going to just take a deep breath and go to sleep. I think that’s unlikely.”

Doctors say the lack of oxygen could lead to seizures, which have been observed in patients experiencing hypoxia.
There’s also a possibility that a person being executed with this method could vomit into the mask, which could cause choking or asphyxiation if inhaled into the lungs.
The Department of Corrections altered Smith’s last meal schedule after concerns were raised that he had been “vomiting repeatedly.”
Even if a person is fasting, they can still vomit water or stomach fluids, experts say. If stomach acid is aspirated, it could burn the lungs, Zivot noted.
The stress, anxiety or flat-out fear that a person might feel before execution shouldn’t be ruled out, Groner said.
“When we have an operation and someone’s totally terrified, they actually respond differently to anesthetics, so a lot of times we’ll give them a sedative before we even go into the operating room,” he said before Smith’s execution. “There’s no talk anywhere of giving (Smith) anything to relax him.”
With most lethal injections, a person is first given an anesthetic to render them unconscious.
Increased stress has been linked to heart attacks and other medical events.
In a botched 2014 execution, Oklahoma death row inmate Clayton Lockett was declared dead of a heart attack more than an hour after being strapped to a gurney for an attempted lethal injection.
Officials say what happened in the Alabama execution chamber Thursday night could set a precedent for other death row prisoners in the state and beyond.
If the procedure did not kill Smith, complications could have left him injured or with serious brain damage, experts said before the execution.
“If they produce a corpse, then the states that want to do this will start doing it,” said Zivot.

2ZRXD5UONI_4LST4UCP9WJSCEI,Police patrols increased on UW-Whitewater campus after group projected swastika image on dorm,"By Brammhi Balarajan and Raja Razek, CNN","3 minute read Updated 12:56 AM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/22/us/police-patrols-increased-on-uw-whitewater/,"The University of Wisconsin-Whitewater has increased police patrols on campus after a group projected an image of a swastika on a student dorm.
The incident, which happened at 5:40 p.m. on Sunday, a day before the beginning of the spring semester, comes amid what experts say is a staggering increase of antisemitic incidents across the US in the months since Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel and the ongoing conflict in Gaza.
Police received reports of four people chanting “racist words, lighting what appeared to be road flares and displaying antisemitic symbols” outside a dorm on campus, according to a news release from the school’s chancellor Corey A. King.
A photo posted on social media shows a swastika image projected onto the side of the Knilans residence hall.
When police arrived, the group had already left the area, King said in the message.
While the chancellor said the university has “no reason to believe there is any current threat to safety on campus,” the school increased police presence out of “an abundance of caution.”
Toni Pharm, a mother who dropped her daughter off at the dorm hours before the incident, told CNN affiliate CBS 58, she called campus police after receiving an “alarming message” from her daughter.
“It’s very disturbing. I think it is a deplorable act of terrorism, in my opinion,” Pharm said. “This was too close for comfort for me.”
In the three months since the October 7 attack by Hamas, antisemitic events in the US “skyrocketed,” reaching 3,291 incidents by January 7, the Anti-Defamation League said in a news release earlier this month. That number represented roughly a 360% increase in reported antisemitic incidents compared to the same time frame a year earlier, the ADL said.
The reported incidents included more than 1,300 rallies with antisemitic rhetoric, more than 1,300 incidents of verbal or written harassment, more than 550 cases of vandalism and 56 incidents of physical assault, the ADL said. It’s unclear whether rallies were tracked last year.
Junior Brooklyn Stevenson told CNN affiliate CBS 58 said the incident worried her.
“It’s really concerning that it’s the first day back, and that’s already happened,”she told the station.
“I came here because they were one of the schools that was really high in diversity and inclusion and had a lot of different clubs and programs. So, it’s just really surprising and concerning to see that,” Stevenson said.
King noted in the message “the actions of the individuals are consistent with a group that has been visiting other campuses, and has no affiliation” with the school.
“The actions of the group last night are abhorrent and go against our core values. At UW-Whitewater, we strive to create a safe community where everyone feels a sense of belonging,” the message read. “We take pride in our Warhawk family. We reject hate in all its forms.”
King said the university is offering counseling services for those who have been impacted.

333Y3LX2GA_X89FLJZ64KNJO8B,Trump makes history again as he powers toward Republican nomination,"Analysis by Stephen Collinson, CNN","7 minute read Published 1:40 AM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/24/politics/trump-new-hampshire-gop-nomination/,"Nothing seems to be stopping Donald Trump as he surges toward his third consecutive Republican nomination.
The ex-president on Tuesday became the first modern-era non-incumbent Republican to win the first two presidential nominating contests, adding the New Hampshire primary to his Iowa caucuses landslide from last week, and reached the brink of a rematch with President Joe Biden.
Trump has all but cleared the GOP field at an astonishing clip. Despite a crush of criminal liability and the memory of his assault on democracy on January 6, 2021, he is consolidating his party around him at a rate unprecedented in modern primary elections.
Related article Five takeaways from the New Hampshire primary
And yet, Trump spent Tuesday night seething, sources told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, because his sole remaining GOP rival, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, isn’t dropping out. Despite failing to land a win against the ex-president in the state perhaps most suited to her candidacy, she insisted she would go on, resisting heavy pressure from Trump’s camp to bow out and promising to engage in what looks like an uphill battle in her home state – which holds the next big primary next month. Trump criticized Haley publicly and privately and urged his political aides to up their attacks on her, Collins reported.
While his reaction to his New Hampshire win was far less jubilant than his Iowa triumph, the twin victories represent a stunning act of political survival. Three years ago, Trump left Washington stung by his second impeachment after trying to overturn the result of an election that he lost. There’s also a possibility he could be a convicted felon by November’s election given that he’s facing 91 criminal charges and more trials — civil and criminal — than can be counted on one hand. His wins underscore his success in leveraging his legal problems to paint a narrative of political persecution that’s bolted his political base ever closer to his side. And exit polls on Tuesday showing that roughly 8 in 10 of Trump’s voters denied the legitimacy of Joe Biden’s election in in 2020 highlight how Trump has successfully used election denialism as an engine of his political comeback.
The former president is in a unique political position. In some senses, he’s effectively an incumbent since he never relinquished his hold on the GOP even after losing — a fate that normally sends ex-presidents into ignominious retirement. But even while in office, Trump never lost sight of his core political formula — his reputation as an insurgent outsider.
So while Haley is trying to portray him — and his stack of endorsements — as a figure of the “establishment,” it’s a tactic that works more in theory than practice. In fact, Haley, who is pushing hawkish foreign policies and deficit reduction, is trying to revive the establishment policies of the pre-Trump Republican Party. Trump, who is vowing a second term of “retribution,” is sending every signal he wants to go back to Washington to tear it all down.
There is also no sign in the first two contests that Republican voters are worried that Trump can’t beat Biden, which is the core argument of the Haley campaign and of her erstwhile rival, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who folded his White House bid after finishing second in Iowa. The former president has probably been helped in this regard by Biden’s own low approval ratings and a blizzard of conservative media coverage of the 81-year-old president’s age and perceived mental frailty, which may have convinced many voters he’ll be a pushover in November.
“We had one hell of a night tonight,” Trump said in his victory speech in Nashua at an election night party that saw his supporters in red “Make America Great Again” hats cheering as networks called his win.

But Haley’s decision not to pull out of the race irked the former president after he said at his closing rally on Tuesday night that he expected she would be knocked out.
“Ron came in second and he left. She came in third and she’s still hanging around,” Trump said of DeSantis’ and Haley’s performances in Iowa. “She had a very bad night.”
Trump was joined on stage Tuesday by his other one-time rivals for the nomination, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, whom he described as “the only person more angry than, let’s say me, but I don’t get too angry, I get even.”
The ex-president’s victory party also welcomed another guest – disgraced ex-congressman George Santos, who became one of the few people ever expelled from the House of Representatives over ethics allegations.
At her own election night event, Haley congratulated Trump on his win, but said that the race was far from over – even though it’s hard to pick a primary state where she might win if she couldn’t win New Hampshire.
“In the next two months, millions of voters in over 20 states will have their say. We should honor them and allow them to vote,” Haley told her crowd at the election watch party, as several supporters chanted, “Trump is a loser.” The former US ambassador to the UN advised her old boss to take a mental competency test and suggested he was afraid to climb on a debate stage alongside her.
Had the former president chosen to be magnanimous, he might have ended the primary race in all but name. But instead, he gave the Haley team a new seam to mine. Her campaign issued a quick response to his speech, which it termed a “furious and rambling rant” against her, asking, “If Trump is in such good shape, why is he so angry?”
His bitter demeanor may have reminded suburban and women voters whom he alienated in past elections why they soured on him. And his outbursts will have delighted Biden’s campaign, which declared Trump all but clinched the GOP nomination on Tuesday night and fired up their general election attack machine against him. In another sign of urgency, two of his top White House aides are moving to Wilmington, Delaware, soon to take the reins of his reelection.
Unfortunately for Haley, New Hampshire did not, as she told its voters it would, “correct” the result of last week’s Iowa caucuses, where she came a distant third to Trump. Whether she got “smoked” in the Granite State — as her former opponent Chris Christie predicted she would on a hot mic — depends on whose spin you accept.
With 88% of the vote in from the primary, Haley trailed Trump by about 11 points. That’s short of the huge win some of the ex-president’s supporters had expected but still a handsome victory margin for Trump, even if his problems with suburban voters were reflected in his rival’s strong performance in large population areas in southern New Hampshire – a potential alarm bell for his prospects in a general election.
The problem for Haley is that as the race now turns toward her home state, and big southern state primaries on Super Tuesday in March, she’ll be up against Trump in his strongholds and her chances to pick off wins and convention delegates seem slim.
Still, her campaign is arguing that every time she takes on Trump she is improving. And her supporters insisted that her difficult road ahead did not mean she should be forced out of the race.
And there’s no reason why Haley shouldn’t stay in if she has the money. After all, it’s a democratic process and voters – not rival candidates – get to decide the result. Trump’s rush to declare victory in the primary race may even be a sign of political malpractice since he’s only leaving Haley and her supporters more determined not to be pushed out.
“The more she runs, the more support she’s getting,” said Lisa Kent, a Haley supporter from Connecticut who attended the election watch night party in Concord. “It’s like an avalanche.”
But unless the former South Carolina governor can pull off a miracle next month in a state where she was elected governor twice – but that is now a Trump bastion – her shaky rationale for continuing her campaign may face a terminal reality.

367CDSEVS0_V8OAVOWLHBM1FME,Australia sanctions Russian national accused of hacking in Medibank data leak,"By Jessie Yeung and Hilary Whiteman, CNN","3 minute read Updated 2:58 AM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/23/tech/medibank-attack-australia-sanction-revil-intl-hnk/,"Australia has publicly named and imposed cyber sanctions on a Russian national for his alleged role in a 2022 ransomware attack, in the country’s first use of the penalty.
The attack stole sensitive personal data from 9.7 million customers of Medibank, one of Australia’s largest private health insurers: including names, dates of births, medical information and Medicare numbers. Some of these records were published on the dark web, according to Australian authorities.
At the time, the Australian Federal Police said investigators knew the identity of the attackers but declined to name them. On Tuesday, the Australian government revealed the name of the individual sanctioned — Russian national Aleksandr Ermakov, 33, an alleged member of the Russian ransomware gang REvil.
The sanctions make it a criminal offense to provide assets to Ermakov, or to use or deal with his assets, including through cryptocurrency wallets or ransomware payments, according to a government news release.
The offense is punishable by up to 10 years’ imprisonment. The government has also imposed a travel ban on Ermakov.
Australian authorities have “worked tirelessly over the past 18 months to unmask those responsible for the cyberattack on Medibank Private,” Richard Marles, deputy prime minister and defense minister, said in the release.
Related article Australia blames cyber criminals in Russia for Medibank data breach
The investigation included collaboration between federal intelligence agency Australian Signals Directorate, the Australian Federal Police, the FBI and National Security Agency (NSA) in the United States, and the United Kingdom’s cyber agency GCHQ — as well as with companies including Microsoft (MSFT) and Medibank, Marles said at a news conference Tuesday.
Cybersecurity experts said at the time of the data breach that it was likely linked to REvil, which had previously launched large attacks on targets in the United States and elsewhere. One such attack on international meat supplier JBS Foods in 2021 shut down the company’s entire US beef processing operation and prompted the company to pay an $11 million ransom.
At the request of the US, Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) intelligence agency detained multiple people associated with REvil in January 2022, seized millions of dollars and raided the homes of 14 people.
When the Medibank attack took place later that year, experts said it could have been perpetrated by a REvil member — which Australian authorities confirmed on Tuesday.
“REvil is only one of many Russian cyber-criminal syndicates, and those gangs we know are dynamic and have multiple partners. So a disruption of REvil at one point in time doesn’t cease its business,” Abigail Bradshaw, head of the Australian Cyber Security Center, said at the news conference.
However, she said, “cyber criminals trade in anonymity” — so publicly naming Ermakov “will most certainly do harm” to his activities, on top of the financial blow of the sanction.
Marles added that with this announcement, “his identity now being completely plain is on display for every agency around the world, but also anybody who is seeking to operate with him, so this will have a very significant impact on Aleksandr Ermakov.”
Investigations into other individuals linked to the attack are ongoing, Marles said.
The stolen data belonged to not only Australian customers but 1.8 million international customers. An initial ransom demand was made for $10 million (15 million Australian dollars). It was later lowered to $9.7 million, which Medibank refused to pay.
Australian authorities have repeatedly urged businesses and individuals not to pay ransoms to cyber criminals, arguing that paying does not guarantee the recovery of data or prevent further attacks — and makes the country a bigger target."
37G1AEBVXT_GFKC39ONCIULQJN,Alabama carries out first known execution with nitrogen gas in the US. Now the state’s AG expects more states to follow,"By Elizabeth Wolfe, Dakin Andone, Holly Yan and Caitlin Danaher, CNN","7 minute read Updated 6:58 PM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/26/us/alabama-execution-nitrogen-what-we-know/,"Alabama inmate Kenneth Smith was put to death Thursday night by nitrogen hypoxia, marking the nation’s first known execution using that method. Now Alabama’s attorney general wants to help other states interested in using the new form of capital punishment.
Smith, 58, was sentenced to death for his role in a 1988 murder-for-hire and had previously survived a failed attempt to execute him by lethal injection in 2022. His attorneys fought the execution until the end, ultimately losing a final appeal to the US Supreme Court on Thursday evening.
Smith’s legal team – alongside experts and advocates from the US to the United Nations – had voiced concern that nitrogen hypoxia could lead to excessive pain or even torture.
Alabama is one of only three states – Oklahoma and Mississippi being the others – to have approved the method, which is designed to replace oxygen in the body with a high concentration of nitrogen, causing death. So far, Alabama is the only state to have carried it out or even outlined a protocol on how to do it.
Here’s what we know about the historic execution:
After widespread discussion and speculation about how Smith’s execution would unfold, Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall told reporters on Friday, “What occurred last night was textbook.”

“As of last night, nitrogen hypoxia as a means of execution is no longer an untested method. It is a proven one. It’s the method that Kenneth Smith ultimately chose, along with 43 other death row inmates in our state,” Marshall said.
“I now suspect many states will follow.”
The attorney general had a message for colleagues across the country who were monitoring developments in the nation’s first execution using nitrogen hypoxia:
“Alabama has done it, and now so can you,” Marshall said. “And we stand ready to assist you in implementing this method in your states.”
As the procedure started Thursday evening at the William C. Holman Correctional Facility in Atmore, Smith was fitted with a mask, a device that would be used to administer the nitrogen.
The execution process began at 7:53 p.m. CT, and Smith was pronounced dead at 8:25 p.m., according to Alabama Department of Corrections officials.

Nitrogen flowed for about 15 minutes during the procedure, state corrections commissioner John Hamm said in a news conference.
Smith, who was on a gurney, appeared conscious for “several minutes into the execution,” and “shook and writhed” for about two minutes after that, media witnesses said in a joint report.
That was followed by several minutes of deep breathing before his breath began slowing “until it was no longer perceptible for media witnesses,” the media witnesses said.
When asked at the news conference about Smith shaking at the beginning of the execution, Hamm said Smith appeared to be holding his breath “for as long as he could” and may have also “struggled against his restraints.”
“There was some involuntary movement and some agonal breathing, so that was all expected and is in the side effects that we’ve seen and researched on nitrogen hypoxia,” Hamm said. “So nothing was out of the ordinary of what we were expecting.” Agonal breathing is an irregular, gasping breath pattern that can happen when someone is near death.

Smith’s spiritual adviser, the Rev. Jeff Hood, who’d previously expressed concern that the method could be inhumane, witnessed the execution and described it in more graphic terms, saying it was “the most horrible thing I’ve ever seen.”
Smith, wearing a tight-fitting mask that covered his entire face, convulsed when the gas was turned on, “popped up on the gurney” repeatedly, and gasped, heaved and spat, Hood said.
“It was absolutely horrific,” he said.
Smith made a lengthy statement in front of the witnesses before the execution started, according to the pool reporters.
“Tonight, Alabama caused humanity to take a step backward,” Smith said in part, according to the reporters. “I’m leaving with love, peace and light. Thank you for supporting me. Love all of you.”
Smith “made a ‘I love you’ sign in sign language with one of his hands that was facing the room where his family was witnessing,” the journalists’ joint report said.
It’s unclear exactly how long it took for Smith to die.
During lethal injections, the nation’s most common execution method, the time it takes for an inmate to die varies widely depending on the drugs used, number of injections and individual inmates’ reactions.
In a typical three-injection protocol, a person can die as quickly as 30 to 60 seconds after the final fatal injection, experts say. But the process does not always go as outlined. In 2014, for example, an Oklahoma inmate had an apparent heart attack 43 minutes after receiving the first injection, according to state documents and witnesses.
A tense debate has unfolded about whether America’s new execution method is humane and whether the procedure would cause undue pain.
In theory, the method involves replacing the air breathed by an inmate with 100% nitrogen, depriving the body of oxygen.

Proponents argue the process should be painless, citing nitrogen’s role in deadly industrial accidents or suicides, and the state indicated in court records that it believes nitrogen hypoxia is “perhaps the most humane method of execution ever devised.”
Others have been skeptical, fearing the method could go awry and voicing concerns that the state’s plan up until Thursday had been shrouded in secrecy. The protocol published by the state contained several redactions experts said shielded key details from public scrutiny.
The White House said Smith’s execution by nitrogen gas was “troubling” to the administration.
Press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters the death by the new method underscored President Joe Biden’s belief in a moratorium on the federal death penalty.
“The president has long said, and had deep, deep concerns, with how the death penalty’s implemented and whether it’s consistent with our values,” Jean-Pierre said.
Criticism of Alabama’s new death penalty method has spread globally. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Turk, said the death penalty is “inconsistent with the fundamental right to life” and called for its “universal abolition.”
“I deeply regret the execution of Kenneth Eugene Smith in Alabama despite serious concerns this novel and untested method of suffocation by nitrogen gas may amount to torture, or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment,” Turk said in a statement Friday.
The European Union described the new method of execution as “a particularly cruel and unusual punishment” and also called for universal abolition of the death penalty, spokesperson Peter Stano said in a statement Friday.
In recent years, many states that still allow the death penalty have had difficulty obtaining necessary ingredients for lethal injections after European manufacturers refused to sell drugs to the US that would be used in executions.
Stano said the EU welcomed “the fact that 29 US states have either abolished capital punishment or imposed a moratorium on executions.”
The family of Smith’s victim, Elizabeth Sennett, said the execution is “bittersweet” – a final act of justice for the woman killed more than three decades ago.
Sennett was murdered in 1988 after her husband hired someone who hired two others, including Smith, to kill his wife and make it look like a burglary, court records show. The husband, minister Charles Sennett, was having an affair and had taken out an insurance policy on his wife, the records say.
“Nothing that happened here today is going to bring mom back,” said Sennett’s son, Michael, after the execution. But, he added, “we’re glad this day is over.”
Elizabeth Sennett’s sons told CNN earlier Thursday they felt it was time for Smith’s sentence to be carried out, adding they believed their mother had been overlooked due to the focus on the execution method.
“What’s going on is overshadowing what’s actually happened,” Chuck Sennett, said. “He’s gotta pay the price for what he done to our mother,” who should be remembered “as a loving, caring woman.” The brothers were in their 20s when their mother was killed.
The family has forgiven everyone involved in the killing, including Smith, Michael Sennett said at a news conference Thursday night.
“His debt was paid tonight,” the son said.

Radnor married clinical psychologist Jordana Jacobs earlier this month in an outdoor wedding ceremony, much to the chagrin of their chilly guests.
“I got married! Two weeks ago. In a *light* blizzard. It was an incredible overwhelming snowy bliss-filled weekend,” Radnor wrote on his Instagram page on Sunday, showcasing photos from their big day.
The actor and Jacobs wed in front of 164 guests at Cedar Lakes Estate in Port Jervis, New York, according to the New York Times.
The pair met at a meditation ceremony in 2022, during a psychedelic trip, according to the article. Radnor proposed during a trip to Joshua Tree National Park.
Radnor told the newspaper that their very snowy wedding night was both “cold and anxiety-producing, but also cosmic and divine.”
Part of what may have added to that anxiety was that the weather conditions were so intense, that all of the wedding guests and vendors were forced to spend the night at the venue due to unsafe driving conditions.
Still, Radnor calls himself a lucky guy.
“I can’t believe my great good fortune that I get to call this extraordinary woman my wife,” Radnor wrote in his post on Sunday.
All in all, the event sounds like… a trip.
This story has been updated to reflect Jacobs’ first name is Jordana."
39ET3ZPBD4_01YTMOTLAMA8L9T,Unruly passengers were a problem before the pandemic. Now they’re even worse,"By Francesca Street, CNN","11 minute read Published 8:11 AM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/travel/unruly-airplane-passengers-post-pandemic-problem/,"Passenger Philip Baum recently experienced one of the most uncomfortable flights of his life.
To Baum, it was obvious his seatmate, a stranger, was drunk. Flight crew, he says, “denied him alcohol.”
“But in front of me, he managed to sneak more alcohol off the trolley,” Baum recalls.
For Baum, who was seated in the economy cabin, being in such close proximity to the “unruly” passenger for multiple hours wasn’t pleasant.
“I actually thought I’d throw up,” he tells CNN Travel. “The guy pulled out his nails. He was bleeding. He stank, and he was blind drunk.”
Moreover, Baum was worried the passenger, who didn’t seem fully in control, “was going to completely lose it” at any moment.
“In the end, I spent about four hours talking to him and calming him down,” Baum recalls.
Throughout the flight, Baum felt himself working hard to control his own reaction to the situation. He felt, at several points, on the precipice of giving in to his own anger and frustration.
“The only reason I didn’t become unruly was because I thought, ‘Philip, you know better. You can’t suddenly become unruly,’” he says.
Baum is an aviation security expert, the founder of DISPAX World, the international conference on Unruly Airline Passenger Management and Restraint.
Given his background, Baum found himself wondering – only half-jokingly – whether the whole incident was some kind of “test.”
Pre-pandemic, statistics recorded by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) indicated unruly airplane passengers were on the rise. Discussions about the issue were ramping up, with the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) launching its #notonmyflight initiative in 2019, aiming to increase passenger awareness.
During the peak Covid years, fewer flights didn’t equal fewer problems – at least not in the US, where reported incidents ballooned. In early 2021, Federal Aviation Authority data reached what an FAA spokesperson tells CNN Travel was “record highs,” with many altercations based around the then-mandated face mask rule. As American flight attendant Susannah Carr told CNN Travel that year: “I come in expecting to have a passenger that could potentially get violent.”
Reported incidents in the US have since fallen, but remain notably higher than pre-pandemic levels. IATA and FAA data can only tell us so much (not every airline that’s part of IATA submits data, while not every airline records every instance of unruly behavior) but the conversation around disruptive passengers remains heated.
As incidents regularly hit the headlines (including passengers sliding down the evacuation slide, hitting and biting flight attendants and forcing aircraft to divert from their intended destination, to name but a few) aviation authorities are clamping down, flight attendants are speaking up and aviation experts are questioning how we got here, and whether we can change the tide.
IATA classifies unruly behavior incidents into four levels. Level 1 is “minor” (IATA’s “Cabin Operations Safety Best Practice Manual” suggests this could be argumentative behavior or non-compliance with safety regulations). Level 2 is “moderate” (physically aggressive behavior, for example). Level 3 is “serious” (i.e. dangerous behavior, an “intent or threat to injure,” as IATA puts it). Level 4 is “flight deck breach” (which IATA classifies as “credible threat of death).
The latest available IATA data, from 2022, indicates most disruptive passenger incidents involved non-compliance, verbal abuse and intoxication. These incidents are less extreme, but are still seen as potentially detrimental to flight safety.
In a 2023 document called “Even safer and more enjoyable air travel for all: A strategy for reducing unruly and disruptive passenger incidents,” IATA states that while “only a tiny minority” of passengers behave badly, these travelers “have a disproportionate impact.”
Incidents could “threaten the safety and security of the aircraft, other passengers, and crew,” says IATA. There’s also the mental health impact on crew and passengers, and increased likelihood of inconvenient diversions, delays or cancellations.
Unruly passengers, “can compromise the ability for cabin crew to undertake their safety duties,” former flight attendant Liz Simmons, who flew for 17 years, tells CNN Travel.
Simmons, who is Australian, is now working on a PhD examining the physical and psychosocial well-being of cabin crew in Oceania, and how that intersects with performance and safety behaviors.
Simmons says disruptive passenger incidents can cause “physical, emotional or psychological injury,” for flight attendants and other passengers alike.

Of the 5,981 unruly passenger incidents reported to the FAA in 2021, 4,290 were face mask-related.
It’s not surprising then, that as the pandemic waned and mask mandates were lifted, aviation workers and officials alike assumed the situation would improve.
European flight attendant Kris Major, who sits in groups within the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) recalls conversations about pandemic bad behavior being “kind of a blip” and assumptions that they’d quickly be a “bounceback.”
Short answer, there wasn’t. The pandemic, as former Japan Airlines flight attendant Mizuki Urano puts it, was a “turning point.”
John Franklin, head of safety promotion at EASA, tells CNN Travel he believes the uptick in unruly passenger behavior correlates with a more general societal behavior shift that’s taken place in the last couple of years.
“It has become clear that the increase in unruly passenger behavior matches what police see in general society since the Covid pandemic,” says Franklin, who says EASA’s been discussing the rise of disruptive behavior with European law enforcement.
People behaving badly in public spaces is a conversation that’s taken place beyond the aviation industry. In the UK, for example, there’s been an increase in what performing arts union Bectu calls “extreme anti-social behavior” among theater goers. Meanwhile, 2023 saw a slew of reports of tourists behaving badly across the globe – damaging heritage sites, eating endangered species and stealing.
Aviation psychologist Aleksandra Kapela posits that “prolonged online work and limited social interactions” might have impacted our “comfort levels in close spaces, such as airplanes.”
Kapela also attributes the increase in unruly passenger behavior to some “now viewing travel as both a right and a privilege after enduring uncertainty and restrictions.”
That outlook brings “heightened expectations to their journeys,” Kapela tells CNN Travel.
Anti-social behavior has negative impacts in any setting, but as IATA notes, “behaviors which some people may deem to be acceptable on the ground take on a completely different complexion in the confines of an aircraft traveling at 500 miles per hour six miles above the ground.”

During the pandemic years, airlines and airports furloughed staff. Many didn’t return. Then, when international air travel started to ramp up, restaffing quickly proved tricky.
It’s a vicious circle, suggests flight attendant Kris Major. Staffing issues, he says, are behind several general issues with the aviation industry right now – “flight delays, cancellations” – and such problems can also be the source of passenger tension and lead to unruly incidents.
Fewer staff, says Major, also means less “vigilance in the terminals” – meaning it’s harder for ground crews to spot and weed out a potential disruptive passenger.
Newly hired staff and cabin crew also bring less experience to the table. Former flight attendant Simmons suggests that no matter how good training might be, experience is often integral in handling unruly passenger incidents.
And while practical training – on how to restrain passengers, for example, and self defense – is mandatory for flight attendants, Simmons says “emotional intelligence” is one of the key skills needed by cabin crew.
Human skills are part of the training programs, but they’re often honed on the job.
“Time and exposure makes for a better diffuser,” she says. “We’re trained on the ground, but then you go into the air and everything you encounter on a daily basis could be considered on the job training as well.”
In recent years, airlines and airports have also increasingly relied on automated processes – think self check-in, automated gates. DISPAX World organizer Philip Baum says automation “dehumanizes the whole experience” of flying.
Passengers may not directly interact face-to-face with another person until they’re at the gate or boarding the aircraft. When they finally do, air rage hits.
“The passenger could be carrying all types of grievances about the booking process, the security screening – something may have happened in their life – and it’s just that buildup of anxiety and anger that compounds with other issues,” says Simmons.

Bearing the brunt of disruptive passenger incidents places “a significant emotional burden” on cabin crew, as aviation psychologist Kapela puts it.
“Their already demanding job, focused on ensuring safety, becomes even more challenging when dealing with disruptive passengers.”
There’s also a knock-on impact on other passengers, who could follow in the disruptive passenger’s footsteps – a potential that crossed Philip Baum’s mind when he was seated next to a drunk passenger and actively worked to control his own frustrations.
There’s also the potential physical and emotional threat to aviation workers – as evidenced in the news reports of flight attendants at the receiving end of violence – and other passengers.
At the 2023 iteration of DISPAX World – Baum’s conference on unruly passenger behavior – presenter Polly Hilmarsdóttir, from Icelandair, said the airline’s ground staff are instructed, when they encounter an unruly passenger, to consider the question “Would you be happy for this passenger to sit next to a child you care about?” If the answer is ‘no’, Icelandair staff are instructed to deny boarding.
Their already demanding job, focused on ensuring safety, becomes even more challenging when dealing with disruptive passengers.
Aviation psychologist Aleksandra Kapela, on flight attendants
Daniela Modonesi, who works at an Italian airport and who is chair of the European Transport Workers’ Federation (ETF)’s Ground Staff Committee, agrees ground staff have an important role to play. She adds that disruptive passenger-related issues are also prevalent on the ground and can cause knock-on effects.
“If (passengers are) in a line with somebody screaming, they don’t want to go on board with this person,” Modonesi tells CNN Travel.
Unruly passengers also lead to attrition across the aviation industry, says Modonesi. She regularly sees fellow ground staff leaving work, crying, following interactions with aggressive passengers. Often they hand in their notice not long after.
“You start thinking, ‘Why should I do this? I could change jobs so that this goes away,’” says Modonesi.

Disruptive behavior at 30,000 feet isn’t without consequences.
An FAA representative told CNN Travel they review every unruly passenger report received from airlines. The FAA will investigate further when they believe a passenger “may have violated a regulation or federal law.”
Unruly passengers in the US face fines of up to $37,000 per incident, as well as criminal prosecution.
“While we do not have criminal prosecution authority, the FAA is working closely with the FBI and TSA to ensure unruly passengers face additional punishments when warranted,” the FAA spokesperson told CNN Travel.
Airlines can also choose to place disruptive travelers on internal no-fly lists. These may be shared with partner airlines – for example, Dutch airline KLM shares this data with its low cost sister airline Transavia, and passengers are banned from flying with either airline for a minimum of five years if they misbehave on a Transavia or KLM flight.
However, penalizing disruptive passengers – particularly on international flights – can be complicated. Under existing international law (the Tokyo Convention 1963), offenses committed on board an aircraft are under the jurisdiction of the authorities in the state in which the aircraft is registered.
Essentially it’s “quite a legal minefield,” as flight attendant Major puts it.
The Montreal Protocol 2014 seeks to get around this issue by enabling prosecution in the state where the airplane lands, but not every nation has ratified this protocol.
The FAA uses the threat of steep fines in its digital signage and public service announcements – which aim to clamp down on disruptive passengers.
The FAA’s also created social media memes, with the FAA spokesperson pointing CNN Travel to one made especially for Halloween 2023, depicting a “police officer and unruly passenger” couple’s costume.
In Europe, EASA’s Not on my Flight Campaign also draws attention to the safety implications of people behaving badly on board via online advertisements.
Baum is skeptical about the potential positive impact of these campaigns.
“If you are a potentially unruly passenger, do you really not become unruly because you saw some zero tolerance unruly behavior video?” he questions.
Instead, Baum thinks the focus should be on the aviation industry’s approach to alcohol – which can be free flowing in the airport and on the plane and is often cited as a factor in unruly passenger incidents – and as a general threat to cabin safety. IATA says it’s working with airports and duty-free retailers to encourage responsible sales and marketing of alcohol, as often it’s the alcohol consumed prior to the flight that causes issues on board.
Former flight attendant Simmons thinks the FAA memes are effective – “visual images are such a powerful tool,” she says. But Simmons suggests there should also be reminders within the airport. Preboarding announcements that “crew are there for safety, first and foremost, and they’re not there as an outlet for aggression” could also be helpful, she says.
Simmons also encourages airlines and airports emphasizing cabin crew’s role as safety professionals.
“The way that flight attendants are represented in advertising, or onboard safety demonstrations sends a very powerful message to passengers,” she says.
Aviation psychologist Kapela agrees that “pre-flight education” is key, suggesting “ensuring passengers get why safety measures are in place, the important role of cabin crew, and the reasons behind actions like fastening seatbelts or delays can clear up misunderstandings.”
I feel we’ve been incredibly lucky that an aircraft has not been brought down because of unruly behavior in the skies.
Philip Baum, organizer of DISPAX World, the international conference on Unruly Airline Passenger Management and Restraint
EASA’s Franklin says it’s still too early to know if there will be a sea change in 2024 – not all data is yet available from 2023, for one.
He says EASA hopes “to see a reduction, particularly in events involving physical violence” and believes the industry will get there “through proactive passenger behavior management that deals with situations early before they escalate.”
So far in 2024, the problem doesn’t seem to have gone anywhere. In January, an American passenger bit an All Nippon Airways (ANA) flight attendant, forcing the plane to return to Tokyo, and an American Airlines flight was diverted to a Texas airport mid-flight after a passenger punched a flight attendant multiple times and assaulted at least one police officer.
“We’ve got a problem,” says Philip Baum, who fears that “one day there will be a disaster because of an unruly passenger incident.”
“At the moment, I feel we’ve been incredibly lucky that an aircraft has not been brought down because of unruly behavior in the skies.”"
3AS7PO3Y5Y_VHRKBXPIYOTR3UR,Jon Stewart’s return to ‘The Daily Show’ could shake up 2024 politics,"Analysis by Oliver Darcy, CNN","3 minute read Published 7:08 AM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/25/media/jon-stewart-daily-show-return-2024-politics/,"Editor’s Note: A version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here.
Jon Stewart is returning to his old home at “The Daily Show” — but the neighborhood in which the comedic house resides has dramatically changed since he last signed off from host chair.
Stewart, who hosted the iconic program for 16 years, decamped Comedy Central in 2015 — just as Donald Trump ascended to power and as the seams of American politics tore apart. While there is never a shortage of material pouring out of Washington for comedians to use as punchlines, Stewart returns to the cable lineup in an environment battered by an ill-tempered information monsoon.
Misinformation, conspiracy theories, and outright lies saturate the 2024 public discourse in a way that stands in stark contrast to the pre-Trump era in which Stewart previously operated. Trump and his stable of MAGA political allies have at their disposal a powerful media machine that pumps propaganda into the national conversation and sends it viral on a daily basis.
Back when Stewart helmed “The Daily Show,” he was needling much more establishment figures, such as conservative news personality Bill O’Reilly or Republican President George W. Bush. When he returns to Comedy Central after the Super Bowl next month to begin hosting the network’s signature show each Monday, Stewart will be confronted with a new, far more insidious breed of media and political figures, such as the radicalized Tucker Carlson and the twice-impeached, four time-indicted, election-denying, insurrection-inciting Trump.
That means that not only is Stewart going to have plenty of fodder to work with, but his voice may very well be more important than ever.
While the cable platform he once helmed, and its massive audience reach, is a mere shadow of its former glory, the show still carries significant weight. That is perhaps evidenced by the fact that when Stewart launched an Apple TV+ show — “The Problem with Jon Stewart” — in 2021, it failed to gain a foothold in the public consciousness and establish the cultural cachet he enjoyed from his more accessible cable perch.
Stewart’s talent has always been using humor to disarm dishonest politicians and expose the absurdities of their arguments in a highly entertaining way. He is uniquely talented at drawing on his sharp comedic wit to cut through the political noise and separate fact from fiction for audiences. And during the 2024 election year, that work will be vital.
Stewart also reenters the scene at a time when traditional newsrooms are being pummeled by layoffs and contracting at an alarming pace. The number of journalists and media figures holding the morally bankrupt accountable has slimmed considerably — a service much of the country is thirsting for.
Meanwhile, the mechanisms in which media are distributed have also undergone a revolution. Far fewer people are reading ever-shrinking newspapers and watching the decaying linear television lineups. Instead, they’re being algorithmically-fed information that conforms to their existing viewpoints, regardless if such viewpoints are consistent with the facts.
Stewart has the potential to break through these digital barriers. His stinging political monologues appeal not only to D.C. politicos, but to mass audiences. It’s without a doubt that in the months ahead, social media feeds will be rife with clips of his tongue-in-cheek, truth-based narration of the circus that is American politics.
Of course, Stewart’s comedy returns in a far more challenging environment with a smaller direct audience on cable. He will have an impact, unquestionably, but also won’t single handedly keep the dark forces at bay.
But at this particular moment in American society, when antidemocratic forces are actively poisoning the public information well in their bids to seize power, not only does the reality-dwelling public hunger for spine-possessing, clear-eyed soldiers like Stewart, it arguably demands it."

It’s not just you, it’s been record foggy in the US","By Mary Gilbert, CNN Meteorologist","2 minute read Published 2:58 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/25/weather/weather-fog-us-climate/,"Impacted by dense fog Thursday morning? So were over 90 million others across the continental United States.
Dense fog alerts were so extensive nationwide that they reached record levels for the third consecutive day. The alerts are issued by the National Weather Service when widespread fog is expected to drop visibility levels to a quarter mile or less for at least two hours.
Fog alerts stretched from the Canadian border to the Mexican border and reached as far east as the Northeast just after daybreak Thursday. A few alerts were also active along the West Coast.
In total, these alerts encompassed more than 1,500 National Weather Service forecast zones – areas that can be smaller than a county the weather service provides specific forecasts for.
The record number is now 1,517 zones simultaneously under a Dense Fog Advisory at 1315z this morning.  Top 4 dates are now 2024-01-25 | 1,517 2024-01-24 | 1,341 2024-01-23 | 1,1072023-01-02 |  926 https://t.co/1cwn9Y83nB pic.twitter.com/sz5avJGYLj
Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday were three of the foggiest days in terms of forecast zones covered since in nearly two decades, according to Daryl Herzmann, a meteorologist and systems analyst with Iowa State University. The data used for this dense fog alert analysis dates to October 2005, Herzmann told CNN.
The fog is unfolding in the wake of a week featuring ice, snow, rain and a dramatic warmup for much of the US that’s making some areas feel more like March than January.
Rain and melting snow are evaporating due to the influx of warm-for-January air across the country. This evaporation is overloading the air near the surface with moisture. When the air can’t hold any more moisture it condenses into tiny water droplets that take the visible form of a cloud – and clouds right at the surface are called fog.
Winter has become the fastest-warming season for nearly 75% of the US as global temperatures rise because of human-caused climate change. Warmer than normal temperatures are also a hallmark of El Niño across a large portion of the US."

He is the author and editor of 25 books, including The New York Times bestseller “Myth America: Historians Take on the Biggest Lies and Legends About Our Past” (Basic Books). The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.
Democrats should not make the mistake of underestimating former President Donald Trump. This is exactly what the party did in 2016, when former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was the Democratic nominee, and there are some who currently risk repeating the error.
Following Trump’s strong showing in the New Hampshire primary, which has effectively knocked his final opponent — former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley — out of the race, some of his critics continue to search for slivers of good news.
They point to the fact that despite “almost” being an incumbent, he didn’t receive a share of the vote on par with what previous incumbents have encountered in primary contests. Incumbents usually bring to the table unequaled name recognition, fund-raising capacity and the benefit of looking presidential as they run for reelection. Trump has most of this, with his supporters holding on to the memory of him in the Oval Office, and with many of his backers believing he literally won the presidency in 2020, yet Haley pulled a decent part of the electorate away from him.
Moreover, they note, Haley was able to win independent voters who theoretically would be more amenable to President Joe Biden than Trump in the fall. Moreover, the number of Republicans who keep saying they won’t vote for Trump under any circumstances, gives Democrats hope that on Election Day, many voters in the GOP won’t turn out.
Related article Opinion: Are Biden and Trump too old to run?
But these arguments downplay the threat Trump will pose to Biden in November by ignoring several fundamentals. In fact, given the extraordinary baggage and problems Trump brings to the table, it is remarkable that the former president is doing so well and points to the formidable threat he poses.
Most important, Trump is not an incumbent; he is a one-term president who lost to the person he is running against just four years ago. Moreover, he is polling well and defeating his primary opponents despite the fact that the GOP suffered stunning blows to their congressional power, costing the party control of the Senate in 2020 and again in the midterm elections of 2022, and hurting them in state offices in a number of special elections.
Trump is succeeding even though the United States has never had a major presidential candidate saddled with so much legal baggage. Trump is not just a defeated one-term president, but a one-term president who allegedly attempted to overturn an election he lost — a period that can truly be called unprecedented in American history. As if that was not enough, he has subsequently been indicted four times, including on charges that revolve around an alleged massive abuse of presidential power (he has denied all wrongdoing).
Meanwhile, two states have decided to ban him from the ballot based on allegations of insurrection (he is appealing). And civil cases about sexual assault, tax fraud and defamation are also underway (he has challenged these as well). Yet, not only is Trump defeating his Republican opponents despite these legal challenges, but they keep defending him and rallying to his side even in the heat of political battle.
Related article Opinion: Nikki Haley’s right. Red flags about Trump’s mental fitness can’t be ignored
Indeed, Donald Trump continues to win as Donald Trump. There has been no turning point, no shift to acting presidential and no serious effort to abide by the traditional norms of national politics. He has continued to blast his opponents with name-calling insults, to spread disinformation and falsehoods and to conduct politics in the spirit of a WWE cage match rather than a forum of serious deliberation. Trump 2024 is acting very much like Trump 2020 and 2016.
That’s no doubt because the qualities that propelled him in the past to command media attention continue to be effective. Even if he has lost many steps as a result of age — as Haley and others have argued — Trump continues to retain all of his talents as a showman. Trump still knows how to do television. He is the entertainer in chief.
Trump’s enduring ability to garner attention through provocative performances was clear right after the media projected Trump as the winner in New Hampshire. Instead of a standard victory speech, Trump lit into Haley. He unleashed a series of vindictive comments about her, even going so far as to insult her clothing. Though some analysts were surprised by his decision and noted that he might have goaded Haley into continuing to run, they missed the point. The point was to do and say things that drew attention to him, that created 24 hours of social media conversation about Trump, that took attention from everyone else on the playing field.
Related article Opinion: In victory, Trump loses it
Trump, who lives by the maxim that all publicity is good publicity, will no doubt create similar obstacles for Biden in communicating his message and securing national attention as the race heats up.
Finally, by most indications, Trump still has strong support in the Republican Party. It is not clear whether those currently telling pollsters they would never vote for Trump will feel the same way by November, once Trump has unleashed his scorched-earth attacks on Biden and depicted him in conservative circles as the second coming of Karl Marx.
When voters go to vote on November 5, many of those Americans might very well decide that tax cuts, deregulation and conservative justices are much more important than any concerns they have about what a second term Trump presidency would do.
And despite the legislative success of the Biden presidency, as well as strong economic indicators, Trump benefits from the fact that many Republicans perceive the pre-Covid years of his presidency to have been much more prosperous than today, when they see higher prices, major wars abroad and chaos at the borders as well as in cities as a result of undocumented immigration. To them, it is “American carnage” all over again.
In 2016, many observers wondered if the election would be like 1964, when President Lyndon Johnson trounced right-wing Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater, who many saw as an extremist and dangerous to the nation. The answer was no. Most Republicans came home.

None of this is to say that Trump is invincible. He is not. Indeed, 2020 proved the point. Polls for 2024 show that the race is close and will probably come down to turnout in a handful of swing states. A few swing state polls have Biden ahead. As Democratic strategist Simon Rosenberg recently told The New York Times’ Ezra Klein, Democrats have been doing extraordinarily well in national elections.
Trump can be defeated with a massive voter turnout operation. But his performance thus far in the caucuses and primaries, especially given the context of what he faces, has been notable for the underlying strength behind his candidacy that the contests have revealed."
3DB6ZDKEVO_VJAXH4YVLES9H45,Trump wins New Hampshire Republican primary,"By Eric Bradner and Gregory Krieg, CNN","5 minute read Updated 5:56 AM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/23/politics/trump-new-hampshire-primary/,"Former President Donald Trump won New Hampshire’s Republican presidential primary on Tuesday, defeating former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and moving him closer to a rematch with President Joe Biden this fall.
Trump’s victory, after a big win in the Iowa caucuses, marks the first time in the modern primary era that the same non-incumbent candidate has won both the Iowa and New Hampshire Republican contests. His hold on the GOP further solidified, Trump’s campaign on Tuesday night sent a fundraising text to supporters declaring, “THIS RACE IS OVER!”
It’s a crushing blow to Haley’s 2024 hopes and those of the party’s anti-Trump factions. New Hampshire’s primary electorate is much more moderate than other early voting states, thanks to nearly 40% of the state’s voters being registered as “undeclared” and allowed to participate in the primary of their choosing. Polls consistently showed Haley, who was Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations, performing best among moderate voters and those eager to move on from the former president.

Haley, though, insisted Tuesday night that she plans to stay in the race and delivered, during her concession speech New Hampshire, some of her sharpest lines of attack on Trump since the campaign began nearly a year ago.
“New Hampshire is first in the nation, it is not the last in the nation,” Haley told supporters in Concord. “This race is far from over. There are dozens of states left to go. And the next one is my sweet state of South Carolina.”
Haley is the last candidate standing in the way of Trump’s third consecutive Republican presidential nomination, after entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy dropped out following a disappointing fourth-place finish in the Iowa caucuses and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis exited on Sunday.
She’d sought to portray Trump, who will be 78 by Election Day in November, and Biden, who will be 81, as past their primes and “equally bad.”
In her Tuesday remarks, Haley pinned recent Republican election failures on Trump, while also warning of the potential backlash to his criminal indictments and questioning his mental acuity following an incident in which the former president confused Haley with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
“With Donald Trump, you have one bout of chaos after another,” Haley said. “This court case, that controversy, this tweet, that senior moment. You can’t fix Joe Biden’s chaos with Republican chaos.”
Eight days after a delighted Trump gave a mostly gracious speech following his Iowa caucus victory, a plainly angry and frustrated Trump spent the majority of his New Hampshire speech railing against Haley.
“Who the hell was the impostor that went up on the stage that went before and claimed victory?” Trump said. “She did very poorly actually.”
Trump first responded – in real time as Haley spoke – in a series of social media posts calling her campaign a lost cause and demanding she drop out.
“Haley said she had to WIN in New Hampshire,” Trump wrote. “SHE DIDN’T!!!”
Moments after Haley began her remarks, he continued: “DELUSIONAL!!!” “SHE CAME IN THIRD LAST WEEK!” Trump wrote in a third post.
Outside groups aligned with Haley appear to disagree.
Mark Harris, executive director of the pro-Haley super PAC SFA Fund, told CNN they’re “on to South Carolina” and plan to spend millions on ads, direct mail and more.
“Trump struggled to get 50% in two states,” Harris said, suggesting that the twice-nominated former president is shedding overall support in the race, his third consecutive presidential campaign.
While Haley had a prominent supporter in New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu – as demonstrated by DeSantis’ loss in Iowa despite Gov. Kim Reynolds’ endorsement – there are limits to a popular Republican governor’s influence when stacked up against Trump.
It wasn’t enough to stop Trump from making history by becoming the first non-incumbent Republican in modern presidential politics — since the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary moved to the front of the nominating calendar — to win both states.
The campaign manager for Biden, who spent the day with Vice President Kamala Harris in Manassas, Virginia, rallying to “restore Roe” and codify abortion rights, said in a statement late Tuesday that the Democrat expects Trump to be his opponent in November.
“Tonight’s results confirm Donald Trump has all but locked up the GOP nomination, and the election denying, anti-freedom MAGA movement has completed its takeover of the Republican Party,” Julie Chavez Rodriguez said. “Donald Trump is headed straight into a general election matchup where he’ll face the only person to have ever beaten him at the ballot box: Joe Biden.”
The next contest is in Nevada — but Haley has already ceded that state to Trump. Circumventing the state’s primary, where Haley will on the ballot on February 6, the Nevada GOP opted to award its delegates instead through caucuses that will take place on February 8. Haley chose to file for the primary and not the caucuses, which means Trump is certain to dominate in the delegate-awarding contest.
Her next real shot at Trump would come on February 24, when her home state of South Carolina holds its primary.
The “first in the south” primary has a long history of picking presidential nominees. It’s where Biden cemented his status as the Democratic front-runner in 2020 and where Trump’s win thinned out a still-crowded GOP field in 2016.
Already, Trump has sought to embarrass Haley with a raft of Republican endorsements from her former allies in her home state. Sen. Tim Scott, who Haley appointed to the Senate when she was governor in 2013, and Rep. Nancy Mace, who Haley supported against a Trump-backed challenger in 2022, both endorsed Trump in recent days.
“I have watched the political class line up with Donald Trump. I have fought the political class all my life. You won’t see the political class with me in South Carolina,” Haley said at a Monday campaign stop in Franklin, New Hampshire.

Rep. Virginia Foxx, the Republican chairwoman of the Committee on Education and the Workforce, is requesting that UPenn respond to the document request by no later than February 7.
The committee is seeking a wide range of documents, including reports of antisemitic activity on campus since early 2021; how UPenn responds to hate crimes; disciplinary actions against staff and students related to alleged targeting of Jews; documents and financial information linked to a Palestinian literature festival held on campus last year; and information on foreign donations, including donations from Qatar.
“We have grave concerns regarding the inadequacy of Penn’s response to antisemitism on its campus,” Foxx wrote in the letter to Larry Jameson, UPenn’s interim president, and Ramanan Raghavendran, the chair of the board of trustees.
Lawmakers launched a formal investigation into UPenn, Harvard University and MIT last month following disastrous testimony about antisemitism from the leaders of the three schools.
Liz Magill stepped down last month as UPenn’s president in the wake of her testimony on Capitol Hill. Scott Bok, the chair of the board of trustees, also stepped down.
A UPenn spokesperson told CNN in a statement that the university has received the document request and “will respond after we complete a review of the request.”
Foxx slammed Harvard on Tuesday evening for an “unacceptable” response to the committee’s document request and suggested lawmakers could issue a subpoena if the university does not comply.

3H4OURFXEX_1XUFTKOQ9V0N1Y3,Even Jenna Ortega can’t save the icky ‘90s throwback ‘Miller’s Girl’,"Review by Brian Lowry, CNN","3 minute read Published 7:00 AM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/25/entertainment/jenna-ortega-millers-girl-review/,"Between “Wednesday” and her previous forays with the “Scream” franchise, Jenna Ortega might be enjoying a pop-culture moment, but even that star power can’t overcome the flaws in “Miller’s Girl,” a sort-of psychological, semi-erotic drama that, despite its literary pretensions, possesses roughly the intellectual heft of a perfume ad. Dated and creepy in all the wrong ways, it’s a movie that might have escaped derision in the 1980s but deserves to get slapped around today.
Indeed, more than anything, this debut feature from writer-director Jade Halley Bartlett feels like a modern version of “The Crush” – one of those icky ‘90s artifacts that really didn’t age well – with a teenage Alicia Silverstone seeking to seduce a much older Cary Elwes and lashing out when he doesn’t fully succumb to her charms.
Here, the filmmakers make a point of noting that the protagonist, Ortega’s Cairo Sweet, has turned 18, but she’s still a high-school student when she develops a strangely intense relationship with her teacher, Jonathan Miller (Martin Freeman), who frequently sees her tromping through the woods from the mansion she occupies while her absentee parents are traveling.
“I’m the scariest thing in there,” she says, when he asks her about walking that path alone.
Alas, Jonathan doesn’t have the good sense to listen to that warning, dazzled as he is by Cairo’s writing talent and engagement, as well as the fact that she read his largely ignored book. At first blush the thrill of that discovery proves understandable, sort of, but it’s clear the teacher is sorely lacking inspiration as he sleepwalks through life, dealing with an alcoholic, work-obsessed wife (“Succession’s” Dagmara Domińczyk) who barely tolerates him.
Set in a remote corner of Tennessee (which explains the Southern accents that drop in and out), the story plays off Cairo’s off-the-charts potential and burning desire to get out, citing Yale as a goal, juxtaposed with Jonathan’s sense of entrapment. That unfolds, alas, against a gender and power dynamic that’s a mixture of fantasies run amok, though it’s frankly hard to tell if the writing is consciously provocative or simply tone-deaf.
Everyone in the cast deserves better, but for Ortega, the role provides one of those overt signals she’s no longer the girl people watched on the Disney Channel, a message that seems particularly unnecessary given her abundant media exposure. Nor does it help that the film saddles her with a running narration designed to sound literary in style (while namechecking authors like Henry Miller) that just feels like an especially pretentious episode of “Gossip Girl.”
While the age gap has served as the focus of advance coverage, the most uncomfortable aspect of “Miller’s Girl” involves portraying Cairo and her friend Winnie (Gideon Adlon) as the vaguely predatory pursuers of their much-older teachers. The latter brazenly flirts with Jonathan’s best pal (“Top Gun: Maverick’s” Bashir Salahuddin), who, by not backing away immediately, appears to be playing with fire as well, just on a slightly lower setting.
The film is produced by, among others, Seth Rogen, so there were some adults in the room enabling its questionable decisions. “No excuses to be made for your choices,” Cairo muses in voiceover near the end. At least she, and the filmmakers, got that part right.
“Miller’s Girl” premieres January 26 in US theaters. It’s rated R."
3H7C7J6DGW_18G2OA81YC2DLG9,China’s wild week in markets: Calm returns but big challenges remain,"Analysis by Laura He, CNN","4 minute read Updated 7:03 AM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/26/investing/china-stock-market-slump-challenges-intl-hnk/,"Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter, which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.
It’s been a rollercoaster week for stocks trading in mainland China and Hong Kong.
Key market indexes plunged Monday, taking year-to-date losses to between 7% and 10% and extending a protracted $6 trillion-dollar rout that began in 2021.
Then, following a series of unusual interventions and announcement by worried Chinese officials, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index (HSI) rebounded to end the week up 4.2%, while the blue-chip Shanghai Shenzhen CSI300 logged a 2% weekly gain.
Does the rally mark an end to the country’s three-year long market meltdown? Analysts say not just yet. A slew of economic problems — including a record downturn in real estate, deflation, debt, a falling birthrate and shrinking work force — haven’t gone away, and they will limit longer term gains.
“Over the past 48 hours, China has announced a flurry of measures to support its economy and financials markets,” Nomura analysts said on Thursday. “We think these measures are likely to stabilize stock market sentiment and could potentially even support a relief rally in China stocks, given extremely low valuations, very light investor positioning, and technically oversold markets.”
China is facing a myriad of economic problems, including rising debt levels and worsening demographics. Beijing’s shift towards ideology-driven policies have also scared away foreign firms and investors and soured relations with the United States.
Without progress in tackling some of those deep-seated challenges, investors are likely to remain on the sidelines and markets will continue to drift.
“For a sustained rally in China stocks, we think China will need to address the core of these concerns (predominantly property sector issues and US-China tensions),” the analysts added.
The measures Beijing took this week to boost the stock market were surprising because they mark a rapid turnaround from the previous week, when Premier Li Qiang dashed hopes of major stimulus measures in a speech in Davos, Switzerland. But that was before shares tanked.
On Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that Chinese authorities were considering ordering state-owned enterprises to use money held in offshore accounts to buy shares worth as much as 2 trillion yuan ($282 billion).
A day later, in an unprecedented move, regulators said they were considering evaluating the performance of the heads of state-owned companies based on their stock market value.
The move was aimed at guiding executives “to pay more attention” to their companies’ share prices and to use “methods such as increasing holdings and share buybacks to stabilize market expectations,” a spokesperson for the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission told reporters in Beijing.
On the same day, Li Yunze, director of the recently-established National Administration of Financial Regulation (NAFR), vowed at an international financial conference in Hong Kong to further open its $64 trillion financial industry to international investors.
Hours later, Pan Gongsheng, the governor of the People’s Bank of China, unexpectedly announced that the central bank would slash the amount of cash banks are required to hold as reserves, which could provide one trillion yuan ($141 billion) in long-term liquidity to the economy.
“All these measures were unexpected and likely prompted by the significant rout seen in stock markets recently,” Nomura analysts said, adding that stronger actions were likely to follow.
The measures worked. By the end of Thursday, the HSI had risen for three days in a row, up a combined 8.4%. The CSI300 gained 4% during the same period.
In the 7 days to January 24, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking Chinese stocks recorded large inflows of $12.6 billion, according to a Citi survey of global fund managers. Over the previous week, $2.3 billion flowed out of those funds.
Beijing’s determination to support the equity markets has been successful and the gains could continue, analysts from Enodo Economics said Friday.
“An equity upturn could run a few quarters, especially if [it] leads to foreign investors reassessing their severely underweight China position,” they said.
Still, investors have been fleeing Chinese stocks over a much longer period because they are worried about the country’s economic prospects.
As of January, mainland China had seen six months of consecutive outflows, with foreign institutional investors selling a total of $30 billion of shares listed on mainland Chinese exchanges, a HSBC survey showed on Friday.
“We do not think the market rescue package [in recent days] can change the economic fundamental, that is, weak aggregate demand,” said Raymond Yeung, chief economist for Greater China at ANZ Research.
Deflation is haunting the Chinese economy, which has grappled with weak prices for many months. The country is facing the prospect of a vicious cycle whereby lower demand leads to lower investment, lower production and lower income, thus causing even lower demand.
“A wholesale reflation strategy like the one [at] the end of 2015 is required to avert assert price deflation,” Yeung said, referring to a series of stimulus measures rolled out over several months to support the economy. It included a number of initiatives aimed at reviving home buying.
He called the rescue measures announced this week “piecemeal” and “reactive,” saying they would not be sufficient to fix the economic problems in the longer term."
3P8Z3WVJET_GSORSZNUKR0G48K,Biden administration to pause proposed natural gas export projects until federal review is complete,"By Ella Nilsen, CNN","4 minute read Updated 11:24 AM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/26/politics/natural-gas-export-projects-pause-biden-administration/,"The Biden administration will pause federal approval for several pending liquified natural gas export projects as it undertakes a broad review of the massive increase in US exports to foreign nations, administration officials announced Friday – roiling the US gas industry and handing a temporary victory to climate groups.
US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm and White House National Climate Adviser Ali Zaidi said the recent boom in US liquified natural gas exports, especially to Europe following Russia’s war in Ukraine, prompted the need for a thorough analysis of the entire industry in the US – which hasn’t been done since 2018.
“The pause will not affect already authorized exports, nor will it impact our ability to supply our allies in Europe, Asia, or other recipients of already authorized exports,” Granholm told reporters.
The US is the world’s largest exporter of natural gas; new liquified natural gas projects that are currently under construction here would triple the nation’s current export capacity, Granholm said. Granholm and Zaidi said the review would, among other things, examine whether US producers are sending too much natural gas overseas instead of using it at home to help power the electric grid.
Related article The world successfully tackled a dangerous pollutant. But did it accidentally warm the planet in the process?
In a statement, President Joe Biden tied the pause to the climate crisis, which is drastically raising global temperatures and fueling extreme weather.
“This pause on new LNG approvals sees the climate crisis for what it is: the existential threat of our time,” Biden said. “During this period, we will take a hard look at the impacts of LNG exports on energy costs, America’s energy security, and our environment. While MAGA Republicans willfully deny the urgency of the climate crisis, condemning the American people to a dangerous future, my Administration will not be complacent. We will not cede to special interests.”
Natural gas is big business for the US fossil fuel industry, which has recently been exporting much of the product to other countries, particularly after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Europe’s subsequent move away from Russian gas. US companies have stepped in to fill that gap, compressing or freezing gas at export terminals and shipping it across the ocean in enormous tankers.
The review will also look at the climate implications of fracking and shipping billions of cubic feet of natural gas overseas, Zaidi said. The planet-warming superpollutant methane is the main ingredient of natural gas, and the Biden administration has taken several actions to try to crack down on methane leaks as part of its climate agenda.
“We take this action in a context where the United States has been an unwavering partner to our allies in Europe who, by the way, are our partner in calling for a transition away from fossil fuels,” Zaidi told reporters.
Sixty members of the European Parliament said Thursday that Europe did not need a hike in LNG from the US and said Europe was being used as an excuse for more drilling.

“We are concerned that a false depiction of European energy needs is now being used as an excuse by the fossil fuel industry and their allies to dramatically expand US LNG exports to the global market,” the lawmakers said in a letter Thursday addressed to Biden and Granholm.
The Europe lawmakers acknowledged natural gas from the US had been helpful in weaning off Russian gas. But the continent’s consumption of natural gas is already being met, they said.
“Even with current demand, the European LNG import infrastructure has been used at only 60% in 2023, suggesting that there is likely no infrastructure bottleneck impeding more US LNG from reaching EU markets, and that an LNG facility build-out in the US would be even less needed.”
Senior administration officials said the pause on four pending projects in front of the Department of Energy would take several months as federal scientists and experts do their analysis. The analysis will then undergo a public comment period, officials said.
And senior administration officials said the pause on pending projects wouldn’t yet impact CP2, the largest proposed gas export project to date in the US, which could ultimately export up to 20 million tons of natural gas a year. CP2 is still pending final approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, after which it would head to the Energy Department. However, CP2 development could effectively be paused if FERC approves it while the Energy Department review is ongoing.
Eight other LNG projects that the Biden administration has already approved won’t be impacted by the pause.
Fossil fuel industry groups decried the administration’s decision.
“This is nothing more than a broken promise to US allies, and it’s time for the administration to stop playing politics with global energy security,” American Petroleum Institute president and CEO Mike Sommers said in a statement.
Climate and environmental justice advocates on the Gulf Coast, meanwhile, celebrated it as a major victory and vowed to continue fighting new LNG projects.
“They made a monumental decision in this fight for climate justice,” said Roishetta Ozane, the founder of Vessel Project of Louisiana, a mutual aid organization. She added that Biden’s decision “sets the stage for potential rejections and slows down the progress of these projects.”
Ozane is a resident of Sulphur, Louisiana – a town near several major LNG terminals. “Living in a community that smells like rotten eggs and chemicals, I know that these facilities are not in the public interest,” she said."
3PX3R3G12L_TDHTJ8545PZ2TI3,Arizona GOP chair resigns amid leaked Kari Lake audio controversy,"By Eric Bradner, CNN","5 minute read Updated 10:56 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/24/politics/arizona-republican-chairman-resigns-kari-lake/,"The chairman of the Arizona Republican Party said Wednesday he is resigning, claiming he was doing so amid pressure from GOP Senate candidate Kari Lake.
Jeff DeWit’s resignation comes after The Daily Mail published an audio recording of a conversation between DeWit and Lake in which he explained to her that there were financial benefits to staying out of the state’s 2024 Senate race. DeWit said Lake threatened to release a “more damaging” audio recording if he did not resign Wednesday.
Lake senior advisers Caroline Wren and Garrett Ventry described DeWit as making “false claims.”
“No one from the Kari Lake campaign threatened or blackmailed DeWit,” Wren and Ventry said in a statement. “It is unfortunate that Dewit hasn’t recognized how unethical his behavior was and still hasn’t apologized to Arizona Republicans.”
DeWit, a former Trump campaign chief operating officer and NASA chief financial officer, said that the conversation had taken place in Lake’s home 10 months ago, while she was an employee of his private business.
In a statement posted Wednesday by the Arizona Republican Party on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, DeWit said he believes he “was set up” in a bid by Lake “to have control over the state party.”
Related article Republicans worry that turmoil plaguing state parties could hurt GOP up and down the ballot in 2024
“This morning, I was determined to fight for my position. However, a few hours ago, I received an ultimatum from Lake’s team: resign today or face the release of a new, more damaging recording. I am truly unsure of its contents, but considering our numerous past open conversations as friends, I have decided not to take the risk. I am resigning as Lake requested, in the hope that she will honor her commitment to cease her attacks, allowing me to return to the business sector — a field I find much more logical and prefer over politics,” DeWit said in the statement.
In the audio recording published Tuesday, DeWit says he was asked by “very powerful people” from “back east” whether there are companies that could put Lake on their payroll and keep her from running. He also says he would like to see a “fresh face” in the Senate race.
“Is there a number at which,” DeWit begins to ask in the audio recording.
“I can be bought? That’s what it’s about,” Lake interjects.
“Not be bought,” DeWit says. “You can take a pause for a couple of years. Then go right back to what you’re doing.”
“No,” she says. “$10 million, $20 million, $30, no. $1 billion, no. This is not about money, this is about our country.”
“The tape speaks for itself: The Arizona GOP Chairman Jeff DeWit attempted to bribe Kari Lake,” Lake’s aides, Wren and Ventry, said. “Thankfully Kari is an extremely ethical person who rejected DeWit’s multiple attempts to offer her money and corporate board seats in exchange for Kari not running for public office. She will be an incredible senator for Arizonans.”
Lake said in a livestreamed campaign event on Wednesday she thought DeWit’s conduct on the recording was “disgusting” and said she felt DeWit “did a horrible job” as head of the Arizona GOP.
“It came very late,” Lake said of DeWit’s resignation letter, which was released Wednesday afternoon. “I didn’t see an apology to the people of Arizona. He tried to act like the behavior you heard on that audio is normal communication amongst friends. It’s disgusting.”
“I think he did a horrible job, and he should have just apologized, resigned and apologized and said he’s going to work to do better,” she added.
The former Arizona gubernatorial candidate did not respond to the allegations made by DeWit in his resignation letter in which he claimed Lake threatened to release a “more damaging” recording if he did not resign on Wednesday.
In his resignation statement, DeWit said, “Contrary to the accusations of bribery, my discussions were transparent and intended to offer perspective, not coercion.”
DeWit’s resignation is the latest chapter in years of turmoil atop the Arizona GOP, which has been divided between onetime establishment Republicans and a faction aligned with Donald Trump that is committed to pursuing the former president’s false claims of widespread fraud in the 2020 election.
A former Arizona state treasurer, DeWit was seen as a bridge between those factions – in part because of his work for Trump’s campaign and administration – when he was tapped as state GOP chairman in January 2023.
He said his conversation with Lake was “intended to offer perspective, not coercion,” adding that it had been an “open, unguarded exchange between friends in the living room of her house.” DeWit said he advised Lake, who lost the 2022 gubernatorial race, to seek the governor’s office again in 2026 instead of running for the Senate seat of independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema.
Since that conversation, he said, Lake “has been on a mission to destroy me.”
“The release of our conversation by Lake confirms a disturbing tendency to exploit private interactions for personal gain and increases concerns about her habit of secretly recording personal and private conversations. This is obviously a concern given how much interaction she has with high profile people including President Trump,” DeWit said. “I question how effective a United States Senator can be when they cannot be trusted to engage in private and confidential conversations.”
Arizona is poised to play a pivotal role in 2024 as one of the nation’s most competitive presidential battlegrounds, and with a key Senate race on the ballot, as well.
Lake is among several GOP contenders for the seat currently held by Sinema, who has not yet said whether she will seek reelection. The leading Democratic candidate for the seat is US Rep. Ruben Gallego.

3TR7O56NUT_NIUEPFY1QT00UXU,"Bloodied and cold, this Venezuelan couple is caught in the border battle between Texas and federal authorities","By Alisha Ebrahimji, Rosa Flores and Sara Weisfeldt, CNN","3 minute read Published 12:19 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/25/us/venezuelan-couple-us-border-battle/,"As the migrant crisis continues at the US-Mexico border and beyond, tensions between Texas and federal officials remain high.
Here are the latest developments:
Cold, hungry and bloodied from razor wire grazes.
This was the reality for one Venezuelan couple as they spent two days waiting to turn themselves in to immigration authorities on the US side of the Rio Grande, which is lined by sharp razor wire and shipping container border barriers.
Kevin, 25, and Vanessa, 21, left their home in Venezuela for Mexico three weeks ago, fleeing a regime they’ve protested against for years, they told CNN Wednesday. Now they’ve found themselves in the middle of the ongoing border battle between Texas and the US federal government.
CNN is sharing the couples’ first names only for safety reasons.
With only the clothes on their backs and a belt bag across their bodies, the architecture students, who spoke to CNN through thick layers of razor wire, said they only had one viable option: to cross the river through high water levels and strong currents, losing most of their belongings throughout the journey.

Home was no longer in Venezuela, a place where the pair said they have no rights. And home couldn’t be Mexico either, because of how dangerous it is, they said.
Their end goal, having endured the difficult conditions of the journey to the US, was to seek asylum once they arrived.
“We are dying of thirst and cold,” Kevin said.
Vanessa and Kevin hadn’t eaten since their wait for authorities began and were only able to share a single bottle of water between them, which a soldier with the Texas National Guard handed to them earlier in the day Wednesday, they said.
Under federal policy, migrants like Kevin and Vanessa would have surrendered two days ago, been taken into custody by federal authorities and transported for immigration processing. But in Eagle Pass, the zone recently taken over by Texas, migrants who jump the fence or crawl between the razor wire are arrested and charged with criminal trespassing, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety.
The razor wire lining the border is so dense, you can hardly see through it. What is visible are pieces of fabric, presumably clothing, caught in the middle of wired loop after loop stretching across the 2.5-mile line of fencing.
Despite the Supreme Court’s ruling this week allowing federal Border Patrol agents to remove the wire while the state’s legal challenge to its removal plays out, it still remains intact.
The concertina wire was installed by Texas authorities in the Eagle Pass area – recently the epicenter of the migrant crisis and near where three migrants drowned this month.
The federal government doesn’t have an immediate plan for a mass removal unless the situation changes drastically or there is an emergency, a law enforcement source familiar with operations told CNN.

However, given the high court’s ruling Monday, federal law enforcement can and will cut or remove the wire as needed to enforce immigration laws and in the case of medical emergencies, the same source said.
Federal agents were standing ready to breach the fencing to render aid to any individual in distress or if otherwise deemed “operationally necessary,” another enforcement source told CNN Tuesday.
The only way to get to the other side is up and over one of the shipping containers that run parallel to the barbed wire fence – and that’s exactly what Kevin and Vanessa did several hours after speaking with CNN, helping each other jump down onto the Shelby Park area.
Moments later, Texas National Guard members were seen contacting Texas DPS officers who then arrived and took them into custody, a CNN team observed.

3U8E44QS6J_TFONDWLZ22MNMQV,FAA approves a path for Boeing 737 Max 9s to return to operations,"By David Goldman, Gregory Wallace and Pete Muntean, CNN","6 minute read Updated 10:06 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/24/business/boeing-ceo-washington/,"Boeing CEO David Calhoun’s Wednesday was decidedly a mixed bag: The Federal Aviation Administration finally approved a set of inspection criteria for the 171 grounded 737 Max 9 planes that, if followed, could return the aircraft to service. But he also learned that his company faces yet another investigation into its safety issues.
The FAA late Wednesday opened its announcement with a stern warning: “The January 5 Boeing 737-9 Max incident must never happen again,” referring to an incident earlier this month in which part of an Alaska Airlines flight blew off in mid-air. And the FAA said it would not grant any production expansion of the 737 Max lineup while its safety probe of Boeing continues.
But the FAA cleared the way for the planes to return to the air. Airlines, especially Alaska and United, had faced hundreds of cancellations a day because of the grounding.
“The exhaustive, enhanced review our team completed after several weeks of information gathering gives me and the FAA confidence to proceed to the inspection and maintenance phase,” FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said in a statement.
Each of the 171 grounded aircraft must be inspected, including the bolts, fittings and guide tracks for the door plug, the piece of fuselage that flew off an Alaska Airlines plane earlier this month. The process also includes tightening fasteners and performing “detailed inspections of…dozens of associated components. ”
In a statement Wednesday, Boeing said it will “continue to cooperate fully and transparently with the FAA and follow their direction as we take action to strengthen safety and quality at Boeing. We will also work closely with our airline customers as they complete the required inspection procedures to safely return their 737-9 airplanes to service.”
On Wednesday, Alaska Airlines said it expects the inspections to take 12 hours and for the first of its 737 Max 9 planes to return to service Friday. It said inspections would be completed next week.
United Airlines announced that it has received approval from the FAA to return to its fleet 79 Boeing 737 Max 9 planes this weekend, according to a memo from the airline’s operations chief that was obtained by CNN.
“We will return each Max 9 aircraft to service once this thorough inspection process is complete,” said Toby Enqvist, executive vice president and chief operations officer at United. “We are preparing aircraft to return to scheduled service beginning on Sunday”
And Whitaker noted Boeing itself is not out of the woods.
“However, let me be clear: This won’t be back to business as usual for Boeing,” he said. “We will not agree to any request from Boeing for an expansion in production or approve additional production lines for the 737 Max until we are satisfied that the quality control issues uncovered during this process are resolved.”
Calhoun’s meeting with Washington lawmakers on Wednesday ended with a CEO’s nightmare: He was forced to defend the safety of his company’s planes to travelers, just before he learned Boeing faced yet another investigation.
“We fly safe planes,” Calhoun said to reporters assembled on Capitol Hill. “We don’t put planes in the air that we don’t have 100% confidence in.”
Calhoun acknowledged the seriousness of passengers’ concerns about flying, and he said he came to Washington in the spirit of transparency and openness to help lawmakers better understand the company’s efforts to improve safety.
“I’m here today … to answer all their questions, because they have a lot of them,” Calhoun said.
After speaking with reporters, Washington Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell, chair of the Senate Commerce Committee, announced that she should hold a future hearing to investigate Boeing’s safety record.
“The American flying public and Boeing line workers deserve a culture of leadership at Boeing that puts safety ahead of profits,” Cantwell said in a statement. “I will be holding hearings to investigate the root causes of these safety lapses.”
Cantwell said that in her meeting with Calhoun earlier in the day, she emphasized that Boeing has to prioritize quality and engineering first. After several incidents in recent years, including this month’s Alaska Airlines incident, that commitment has become a significant question.
The National Transportation Safety Board is also investigating the incident.
Not being able to increase production of the Max is a major blow to Boeing’s efforts to return to profitability.
Boeing’s production of the 737 Max, its best selling plane, has still not returned to the rate of production that it had before two fatal crashes led to a 20-month grounding of the plane in 2019. It is not clear when it will be able to move ahead with its efforts to resume production at a more profitable pace.
Industry experts have cast serious doubt about Boeing’s ability to walk away from its investigations unscathed. Last week, a Wells Fargo report, entitled “FAA audit opens up a whole new can of worms,” noted that Boeing’s quality control and engineering problems have been ongoing for years.
“Given Boeing’s recent track record, and greater incentive for the FAA to find problems, we think the odds of a clean audit are low,” the analysts said.
A week earlier, Calhoun acknowledged the company made a “mistake” at a staff-wide safety meeting, but he did not specify what that mistake was. NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy has demanded Boeing provide answers about any mistake it made as part of its safety investigation, which is separate from the FAA’s audit.
Boeing has faced repeated quality and safety issues with its aircraft for five years now, leading to the long-term grounding of some jets and the halt in deliveries of others.
The 737 Max’s design was found to be responsible for two fatal crashes: one in Indonesia in October 2018 and the other in Ethiopia in March 2019. Together, the two crashes killed all 346 people aboard the two flights and led to a 20-month grounding of the company’s best-selling jets, which cost it more than $21 billion.
Internal communications released during the 737 Max grounding showed one employee describing the jet as “designed by clowns, who in turn are supervised by monkeys.”
Late last month, Boeing asked airlines to inspect all of their 737 Max jets for a potential loose bolt in the rudder system after an airline discovered a potential problem with a key part on two aircraft.
Its quality and engineering problems have extended beyond the 737. Boeing also had to twice halt deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner, for about a year starting in 2021 and again in 2023, due to quality concerns cited by the FAA. And the 777 jet also suffered a grounding after an engine failure on a United flight scattered engine debris onto homes and the ground below.
Two Max variants — the Max 7 and the Max 10 — are still awaiting approval to begin carrying passengers. This latest incident complicates that, Wells Fargo analysts noted."
3VANTRH9DL_YWZIS8MICWT3GHG,Biden administration moves to increase assistance to Ecuador amid concerns over the deteriorating situation,"By Priscilla Alvarez, CNN","3 minute read Published 5:06 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/25/politics/us-ecuador-biden-administration-assistance/,"The Biden administration plans to increase assistance to Ecuador amid growing concerns over the deteriorating security situation in the country, ranging from equipment to deploying personnel, according to a senior administration official.
The scale of US assistance to Ecuador underscores the urgency and concern within the Biden administration over the unfolding situation in the country, where gangs have terrorized the population, as well as the growing power of criminal enterprises.
Ecuador, once known as the region’s “Island of Peace,” is nestled between two of the world’s largest cocaine producers, Peru and Colombia, and its deep ports have made it a key transit point for cocaine making its way to consumers in the United States and Europe. Its dollarized economy has also made it a strategic location for traffickers seeking to launder money.
Experts warn that Ecuador’s terror groups are aligned with a wider criminal network, including the notorious Sinaloa Cartel out of Mexico, complicating President Daniel Noboa’s attempts to “neutralize” criminal groups operating within his borders – and as a result, gripping the country, and its armed forces, in fear.
Earlier this month, President Joe Biden asked special adviser for the Americas Christopher Dodd and Commander of the United States Southern Command Gen. Laura Richardson to go to Ecuador, assess the situation and report back, the senior administration official said.
On the heels of that trip, the White House said the US would facilitate the delivery of 20,000 bulletproof vests “and more than $1 million worth of critical security and emergency response equipment, including ambulances and defense logistic support vehicles.”
And more is on the way.
The senior administration official described a whole-of-government approach to address the situation, including regular meetings chaired by deputy Homeland Security adviser Jen Daskal with administration officials to map a way forward.
“Is there intelligence that we can provide to the Ecuadorians? FBI teams have been going down there to help. We have the DHS Homeland Security Investigations Unit … deploying personnel in a couple of days to train police and prosecutors,” the official said, adding that the Secret Service and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency are also assisting.
“We’re throwing everything at this to see what it is in the next 30 days we can do to control the situation,” the official added, stressing that in addition to equipment and personnel, officials are also focused on helping bolster the economy.
Speaking to CNN’s Christiane Amanpour, Noboa said the country “would gladly accept cooperation from the US. We need equipment, we need weapons, we need intelligence and I think that this is a global problem. It’s not only in Ecuador, this is a problem that goes beyond borders.”
The senior administration official cited the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and lingering policy effects of the ex-president of Ecuador Rafael Correa as factors in what’s currently happening in the country.
The situation is alarming for officials not only because Ecuador has been a partner to the US but also because of the criminal enterprises at work and concerns that it will push people to flee and migrate to the US southern border.
“I think this should validate that what we’re dealing with is not a migration challenge at our border, but rather a region that in the post-pandemic has struggled to recover economically. And countries, like Ecuador, are facing enormous security challenges,” the official said.
“When families there feel like they’re not safe, or they can’t find opportunities, they vote with their feet, and they come up here,” the official added.
The number of migrants from Ecuador arriving at the US-Mexico border has increased over time. In November, Border Patrol apprehended more than 13,000 migrants from Ecuador at the US southern border, according to the latest available data from US Customs and Border Protection.
Homeland Security officials are monitoring the Darien Gap to observe any increased flows of Ecuadorians but have not recorded an uptick as of now."
3VFIR184D4_Q4WMP9VMH01YPBS,Biden’s abortion rights rally in Virginia beset by repeated protests over his handling of Gaza,"By Michael Williams and Donald Judd, CNN","5 minute read Updated 8:27 AM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/23/politics/biden-harris-abortion-rights/,"President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris rallied voters in Virginia during their first joint campaign appearance on Tuesday, seeking to emphasize the stakes for reproductive rights in the 2024 election.
“The Supreme Court did what it had never done before,” Biden said at the Manassas rally, which came one day after what would have been the 51st anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision, which had established a constitutional right to abortion. “They ripped away a fundamental constitutional right that was in place for nearly 50 years.”
“Let there be no mistake: The person most responsible for taking away this freedom in America is Donald Trump,” Biden added.
But as Biden sought to reinforce his administration’s biggest selling point against the Republican front-runner, its biggest weakness with young voters was on full display in the crowd, as protesters who oppose his support for Israel in its war against Hamas repeatedly interrupted the president.
The interruptions began as Biden was delivering his first line. A male protester unfurled a Palestinian flag and shouted, “Genocide Joe — how many Palestinian children have to die?” The president paused his speech and looked toward the man.
A second and third protester followed shortly after, prompting chants from the crowd of “Four more years!”
After a fourth protester, Biden broke from his prepared remarks to say, “They care deeply.” And at protester five Biden acknowledged, “This is going to go on for a while.”
All told, the president was interrupted about a dozen times. Eventually, the crowd urged Biden to keep speaking, and the president ignored further outbursts from the crowd.
The hectic rally and Biden’s seemingly futile attempts to keep the crowd focused on reproductive rights represent a new normal for the president, who has repeatedly been interrupted by protesters criticizing his administration’s stance on Israel and his refusal to call for a ceasefire in Gaza.
He was also interrupted by protesters while delivering a speech on democracy near Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, and while speaking at a church in Charleston, South Carolina, earlier this month.
He’s often appeared conciliatory toward those protesters. “I understand the passion and I’ve been quietly working – been quietly working with the Israeli government to reduce – significantly get out of Gaza,” Biden said as the protesters were led out of his South Carolina remarks.
But still, the protests provide a window into Biden’s potential problems among young voters, Arab Americans and the most progressive flank of the Democratic Party.
At the rally, Harris also delivered a stark warning on abortion access in the wake of the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision, which overturned Roe.
“We all know 19 months ago, the highest court in our land – the court of Thurgood (Marshall) and RBG – took a constitutional right from the people of America, from the women of America, and in the 19 months since, in states across our nation, extremists have proposed and passed laws that criminalize doctors and punish women, laws that make no exception even for rape and incest,” she said.
The vice president blasted Trump for his role in gutting abortion rights, warning even more restrictive measures would follow if Republicans have their way.
“Across our nation, women are suffering – and let us be very clear about who was responsible: Former President Trump hand picked three Supreme Court justices because he intended for them to overturn Roe,” she said.
“He intended for them to take your freedoms, he is the architect of this health care crisis, and he is not done — and the extremists are not done,” she said.
Looking forward, Harris pledged the Biden administration’s support for safeguarding abortion access.
“We have a president who has a vision for our future, a future where reproductive freedom is protected for every woman, every person in America,” she said. “And we have a president who has – and this is so critically important – the compassion, as well as the determination and skill, to make our vision for our country and our future real.”
The Biden campaign is banking on abortion rights being one of the pivotal issues driving voters out against the GOP nominee in November. Nearly two-thirds of Americans polled after the 2022 decision that overturned Roe said they disagreed with the decision, according to a CNN Poll conducted by SSRS in the decision’s aftermath.
Biden’s campaign has also been homing in on recent comments made by Trump taking credit for the decision that overturned Roe. The former president faces a crucial night Tuesday in New Hampshire in his two-person race against Nikki Haley for the Republican nomination.
Harris, the administration’s point person on abortion rights, kicked off a “reproductive freedoms tour” this week with a Monday stop in Wisconsin. She is expected to travel “across the country” to hold a number of events bringing together “thousands of people,” her office previously said.
The campaign began hitting the airwaves in battleground states this week with ads featuring emotional testimony from a Texas woman who had to travel out of state to seek an abortion because of a state law banning abortions after six weeks of pregnancy.
“Donald Trump is the reason that more than 1 in 3 American women of reproductive age don’t have the freedom to make their own health care decisions. Now, he and MAGA Republicans are running to go even further if they retake the White House,” said Julie Chavez Rodriguez, the Biden campaign manager. “In 2024, a vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris is a vote to restore Roe, and a vote for Donald Trump is a vote to ban abortion across the country.”

41O90SMOK5_GSDIG55WCDHB4J4,"CIA director expected to meet with Israeli, Egyptian and Qatari negotiators to push for hostage deal","By Kevin Liptak, CNN","2 minute read Updated 1:57 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/25/politics/cia-director-israel-hamas-hostages/,"CIA Director Bill Burns is expected to meet in the coming days with Israel and Egypt’s intelligence chiefs and the Qatari prime minister to discuss a deal to secure the release of remaining hostages held by Hamas, according to a US official familiar with the plans.
The meetings with Mossad director David Barnea, Egyptian intelligence director Abbas Kamel and Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani will come amid intensive discussions on the parameters of a new deal that would pair hostages’ release with a cessation in the fighting in Gaza.
The meetings are expected to occur in Europe, the official said. The CIA declined to comment.
Another top American official, White House Middle East coordinator Brett McGurk, has been in the Middle East this week to continue discussions on the release of hostages. McGurk has visited Cairo and Doha for the talks.
Egypt and Qatar have acted as key players in brokering with Hamas, including securing a temporary pause and hostage release in November.
The White House, which declined to confirm Burns’ meetings, said Thursday that ongoing hostage talks were “sober and serious.”
The Washington Post first reported Burns’ plans.
Burns and McGurk’s discussions with regional players come amid tensions between Israel and Qatar over a leaked recording said to be of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticizing Qatar.
On the recording, which aired on Israeli television, a voice purportedly Netanyahu’s describes Qatar as “problematic.” The speaker also says he is “very mad at the Americans” for renewing a lease on their military base in Qatar without extracting a concession on hostages from the country. CNN cannot verify that the voice on the leaked recording belongs to Netanyahu.
Responding to the tape, Qatar said Netanyahu was undermining mediation efforts in the Israel-Hamas war.
The White House said it remains focused on securing a release of hostages, including in discussions with Israel and Qatar, after the leaked recording.
“I don’t think I’m gonna comment on leaked comments attributed to another foreign leader,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters aboard Air Force One.
He said efforts on striking a hostage deal — which have included Qatar as a mediator — would proceed apace.
“The Israeli people want their loved ones back, we want to make sure we get our American hostages back to their families where they belong,” Kirby said. “There is a lot of energy being put at this across the region, with our Israeli counterparts as well as our other counterparts, including the Qataris. And we’re just going to keep working at that.”"
41SG5ZVSWQ_CRRFJAMTB7MNXD2,British zoo has new plan to rehabilitate its potty-mouthed parrots,"By Issy Ronald, CNN","3 minute read Published 12:11 PM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/23/travel/lincolnshire-wildlife-park-potty-mouthed-parrots-intl-scli-scn-gbr/,"A British wildlife park has hatched a new plan to rehabilitate its potty-mouthed parrots after they unleashed a tide of expletives.
Back in 2020, five foul-mouthed African gray parrots, donated to Lincolnshire Wildlife Park in eastern England, were isolated from the flock in an attempt to improve their language.
But, from Tuesday, the team is adopting a different, riskier approach of integrating three newly donated, cuss-happy birds – named Eric, Captain and Sheila – alongside the original five miscreants into the flock.
“When we came to move them, the language that came out of their carrying boxes was phenomenal, really bad. Not normal swear words, these were proper expletives,” the park’s chief executive, Steve Nichols, told CNN.

“We’ve put eight really, really offensive, swearing parrots with 92 non-swearing ones,” he said.
If the new strategy works, the eight parrots could learn “all the nice noises like microwaves and vehicles reversing” that the other parrots in the flock favor, Nichols added. But if the other 92 instead pick up the expletives, “it’s going to turn into some adult aviary.”
After some time in isolation, integrating the five original birds into the flock was “mostly” successful, Nichols said, but they still curse sometimes, and even laugh afterward, mimicking the most common reaction to their foul language.
Parrots precisely echo the sounds they hear, so “six of them have got men’s voices, two of them have got ladies’ voices and when they’re all swearing it does sound really bad,” Nichols explained.

The park has installed large signs warning visitors about the parrots’ language, but Nichols said it hasn’t received a single complaint.
In fact, historically, “we did hear a lot more customers swearing at parrots than we did parrots swearing at customers,” Nichols said.
African grays are highly social parrots, forming groups of up to 1,000 birds to roost at night in the wild, and communicating with each other through various calls.
Researchers believe their intelligence is almost unparalleled in the animal kingdom, comparable to that of apes, whales and dolphins.
Expletives are particularly easy to mimic for African grays since they are almost always said in the same tone and context, without any other words surrounding them, Nichols explained.
“When you tell someone to eff off, you usually say it the same every time,” he said.
For now, the park is hoping they will learn the sounds of the flock, and mend their potty-mouthed ways.
“I’ve just left them up there and there’s lots of noises, which is brilliant … from squeaking gates to doors slamming, people laughing and mobile phones,” Nichols said.
“I’m hoping that’s part of the settling-in period, but I don’t think they will ever lose the swear because as soon as somebody swears, they’ll be swearing as well.”"
41UDKVLQ3U_XSSPCF4ODNVUPRA,"Opinion: In victory, Trump loses it",Opinion by CNN contributors,"18 minute read Updated 10:15 AM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/24/opinions/primary-election-new-hampshire-trump-haley/,"CNN Opinion asked political contributors to weigh in on the results of the New Hampshire primary. The views expressed in these commentaries are their own.
This isn’t the Olympics. This is the GOP contest for the presidential nomination — and there are no medals for second place. Although former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley is the last contender standing between former President Donald Trump and the Republican nomination, the results in New Hampshire do not bode well for her future.
Haley cast herself as a reasonable alternative to Trump, a traditional Republican who could attract “Never Trump” GOP voters and Independents. The problem with this approach is that most Republican voters do not want an alternative to Trump; they overwhelmingly back him. Polling shows Trump even leads Haley in her home state of South Carolina.
Haley’s campaign suffers from an identity crisis. She presents herself as a moderate, and yet on issues like immigration, she echoes Trump’s hardline positions, including mass deportations of undocumented migrants and finishing the border wall.
She declared that “America has never been a racist country,” despite recounting discrimination that she experienced growing up. While she called for a “national consensus” on abortion, her vague stance on reproductive rights confused voters.
She questioned whether Trump was mentally fit for office and criticized him for “too many lies.” Yet she also suggested that, if elected, she would pardon him. And despite Trump’s bigoted attacks on her heritage (like calling her by a mangled version of her birth name), Haley told CNN’s Dana Bash that she would vote for him if he became the Republican nominee.
How does any of this add up to a coherent message?
Over the last few months, Haley has alternated between being a principled conservative and a Trump sycophant. In the process, she lost herself and any viable shot at the White House. On a broader level, Haley’s failure to launch in the Granite State is more evidence that the GOP is becoming less of a political party and more of a cult of personality.

This primary isn’t over. At least that’s what the Nikki Haley campaign said after finishing second to former President Donald Trump in the New Hampshire primaries on Tuesday.
While conventional wisdom, political analysts, talking heads and the Trump campaign insist this race is over, and that former Trump is the inevitable Republican nominee, it bears pointing out that nearly half of New Hampshire voters chose someone other than Trump. In Iowa last week, 49% of voters in Iowa chose someone other than Trump.
The only accurate way of describing the state of this race is that the voters in the Republican primary are divided, and have not, in fact, coalesced around Trump as he’d have us believe. That’s not a great way to go into a general election, with so many voters explicitly saying, as they did to CNN field reporters, that they were over Trump. That might change over the course of the primary, but if New Hampshire offers us a snapshot in time, the picture is of a fairly weak frontrunner. As the Haley campaign told me earlier on Tuesday, it’s almost as if a bunch of Republicans have left the party because of Trump … and Nikki is bringing them home.
Can the former South Carolina governor bring them all the way home? The map gets harder for her from here. But Haley has a $4 million ad buy starting Wednesday in South Carolina, and the campaign is looking ahead to Michigan, which votes a few days after her home state, as another place she can give Trump a run for his money.
For independents, moderates and disaffected Republicans, Haley represents an all-too-important candidate in this race: the woman standing between Trump and the White House. For everyone – including the Biden campaign – declaring this race over, she owes it to those voters to stay in and not succumb to Trump’s inevitability posturing, or Biden’s eagerness to face a weaker candidate. She’s earning votes to stop Trump, and that’s what she must continue to do.
SE Cupp is a CNN political commentator.
There are two very different storylines that emerged from New Hampshire: The first is former President Donald Trump’s cult-like support among diehard Republicans. The more important story, though, is his stunning weakness among independents.
Trump lost a stunning two-thirds of New Hampshire voters who are not in either political party, according to initial results from a CNN exit poll. In Iowa, 43% of former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s supporters said they would vote for President Joe Biden against Trump.
That the Republican Party is now one more Trump property is news from nowhere. In the eight years since he slithered down that escalator in Manhattan’s Trump Tower, he has remade the party. Where Reagan-Bush Republicans stood for limited government, strong national defense, and traditional family values, Trump added about $8 trillion to the national debt, disdains NATO, and has been found by a jury of his peers to be civilly liable for sexual abuse (which he has denied).
Trump’s challenge, now that the nomination fight is effectively over, will be to appeal to voters who are turned off by his cult of personality. His angry, bitter speech Tuesday night was a terrible beginning for the general election. Did the grievance-filled rant against Haley sound like a winner to you? No, it sounded like a guy who is in deep doo-doo with independents.
This is a potential disaster for Trump. To attend this year’s Iowa GOP caucuses in the freezing cold, you had to be a very committed Republican. (Unlike New Hampshire, Iowa does not allow independents to vote in the GOP caucus.) And yet nearly half of the loyal Republicans who supported Haley in Iowa say they cannot support Trump in November; Biden wins them by a margin of 20 points.
Trump’s team should have a well-deserved drink. But the hangover is going to be brutal.
Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist and CNN political commentator, was a political consultant for Bill Clinton’s presidential campaign in 1992 and served as a counselor to Clinton in the White House.
No matter how you feel about former President Donald Trump’s decisive victory in New Hampshire, there is bad news: Our country is now in general election mode, and it will be for 285 more days. Almost a full year. Even if the names at the top of the ticket change (which is still within the realm of possibility), the die is cast for the rest of the contest.
I am uncertain as to how the country survives the sensory assault of a prolonged presidential campaign — the ads; the endorsements; the controversies, real and imagined — and lives to vote about it. Remember how the monotony of the pandemic — hearing the same thing on the news every day, the same background sense of enormity — warped our sense of time? This could be like that, but louder.
What American will still feel like voting after nine months of being asked to? Nagging someone just encourages tuning out. We have lost the patience to watch television on a week-to-week basis; to keep us engaged, someone (the campaigns or the media covering them) will have to come up with cliffhangers far beyond the traditional questions of vice-presidential choices and debate performances.
If so, what could those stakes be? I fear the campaigns could become an ever-escalating war of even more extreme statements, on both sides, though I cannot imagine how we go more apocalyptic than we already are. President Joe Biden has said to voters, “Your freedom is on the ballot.” Trump … well, Trump finds the apocalypse in everything from the presence of immigrants to windmills. He warns constantly that the country itself may come to an end.
But Trump’s ego cannot abide any subsiding of attention; his word salad will get spicier every time he senses the nation’s eyes wandering. Then Biden will have to alert his voters to Trump’s extremism, his warning amping up the emotional charge even more.
Potentially, it becomes a contest as to whose base is more terrified of the other.
Trump — and Trumpism, or whoever represents it — is dangerous. Raise alarms! But the relentlessness of what’s to come troubles me. I have trouble picturing a high voter turnout if our experience of democracy is a series of campaign ads stomping on a human face, forever.

Getting a primary challenger is usually the harbinger of doom for a president. Often, that challenge has roots in an ideological critique. Not so for Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips. His challenge to President Joe Biden is rooted in chronology, not policy.
President Jimmy Carter faced a challenge from the left by Senator Edward Kennedy in 1980. Kennedy was a liberal icon. Carter won the nomination but suffered a devastating loss in the general election against Republican Ronald Reagan that year.
President George H.W. Bush was challenged by conservative columnist and ideological pitchfork holder Pat Buchanan in 1992. Democratic nominee Bill Clinton and third-party candidate Ross Perot exploited that division in the Republican Party against Bush in the fall. Bush lost that campaign.
Biden’s main intraparty challenger, however, isn’t attacking him for being out of touch with the party or the country. His main line of attack is that the president is too old.
That’s not insignificant. Voters care. It comes up in just about every survey. But agism isn’t an alternative vision for the future. It’s process. If most Democrats agree that Biden’s strengths are more important than his advanced years, the president should be okay. Time will tell.
More worrying would be an anti-war candidate running on Biden’s embrace of Israel in the war against Hamas after its brutal October 7 attack on Israel. There’s real ideological sand out there that could help a challenger get traction. Young people and many people of color reject Biden’s Israel policy. It was Eugene McCarthy’s anti-Vietnam campaign that undid President Lyndon Johnson in 1968.
Marianne Williamson is running that campaign in the Democratic primary but with no success. In an alternate universe, more prominent progressives such as US Sen. Bernie Sanders or Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal might. Not this year.
Instead, Democrats are wrestling with whether an 81-year-old Biden is up to the job. Tuesday night in New Hampshire we had the first answer to that question, and it appears Biden is passing the test.
Jamal Simmons is a longtime Democratic political and communications advisor. He was most recently communications director for Vice President Kamala Harris at the White House and is currently a CNN political commentator.
Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley had everything going for her in the New Hampshire primary. This is a state that often rewards moderates and mavericks: where John McCain beat former President George W. Bush by 18 points in 2000. With President Joe Biden not even appearing on the New Hampshire Democratic ballot this time, liberal-leaning independents who wanted to participate in an exciting race had an easy excuse for voting in the Republican primary. They could show their disapproval for former President Donald Trump by voting for Haley.
It wasn’t enough. Trump has comfortably won New Hampshire, and the Republican race that looked like it was already over after the Iowa caucuses is unquestionably finished now. The next big contest is in her home state, South Carolina, but she polls worse there than she has in the Granite State. South Carolina looks like a safe state for Trump — the only question is what his margin of victory will be.
Haley knows this, and so does her campaign staff. So do her donors. Will they stay in the fight for another month, just to lose to Trump by a bigger margin than Tuesday night? As Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis showed in the days between his second-place finish in Iowa and his withdrawal from the race, it’s agony to keep campaigning when you know you only face humiliation in the races to come.
The Republican Party is united behind Trump, and with optimal conditions for an opponent like Haley, Trump was still unstoppable. Now he’s weighing vice presidential picks, and the ultimate contest — the rematch between him and Biden — begins.

The results Tuesday night, while not awarding any delegates to the current president, only confirmed what many of us liberal Democrats suspected: The Democratic Party no longer gives a fighting chance to candidates other than establishment neoliberals, so we must look elsewhere.
That President Joe Biden will be the winner of the nomination seems a foregone conclusion, even though I think author Marianne Williamson, who represents more traditional liberal values, could have made a bigger impact if she was given a chance.
Williamson might have picked up the pro-peace contingent if she hadn’t been mostly ignored by the traditional media and other Democrats. She was one of the few peace candidates, calling for a ceasefire early on in Gaza, and even wrote that rather than bombing the Houthis in Yemen, we might resolve the Red Sea shipping crisis by stopping the bombing of Gaza, the stated reason for the Houthis’ attacks on merchant vessels – a principled liberal stance that no other mainstream candidate seems willing to say out loud. Biden’s stance on both Gaza and Ukraine seem to align more with neoliberal and neocon values.
After liberal stalwart Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator, criticized Biden for failing to address working-class voters’ concerns, Williamson pointed out that there was a Democrat who was already doing so (herself), but was largely ignored by Sanders and the media.
Even failed 2020 candidate Andrew Yang, who suffered a similar fate to Williamson in the Democratic primaries, encouraged Williamson to step aside in favor of Minnesota Rep. Dean Philips just a few days before the New Hampshire primary. Williamson’s response to Yang should make traditional liberals beam: “The days of a woman stepping aside on the assumption that a man can do a better job are over.”

It’s all over but the shouting – former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley may have barely mustered a close enough showing in the New Hampshire primary Tuesday to justify a push toward her home state, but for all intents and purposes, the Republican Party has chosen to nominate former President Donald Trump for a third time.
The roster of those whom Trump defeated on his way to victory in 2016, 2020 and 2024 shows the deep bench of possible presidential contenders that Republicans had prided themselves on during the presidency of Barack Obama.
Dozens took their shot and lost: Successful governors who turned out to be paper tigers, like former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis; self-described compassionate conservatives like former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott; principled conservative senators like Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio; business-friendly moderates like former Ohio Gov. John Kasich and, of course, Haley. All of them, plus many more, proved more out of touch with the base of the party than the twice-divorced former reality TV star from New York.
There’s little doubt, now, that Trump has remade the party in his own image. In so doing, he cleared out an entire bench of those who would have offered a different path to the White House. Even if the likes of Cruz or DeSantis were to run again, they would do so as a Trump product, not a tea party one.
The next time there’s a meaningful Republican primary election, it will be a question of which of the post-Trump figures can best channel his energy — not which of his contemporaries can best present an alternative.

After the results of the Iowa caucuses, too many considered the trailblazing former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley dead in the political water. It turns out she wasn’t. Finishing third in Iowa to former President Donald Trump and Florida’s Gov. Ron DeSantis, many thought Haley seemed a long shot to be competitive in a two-person race with Trump at the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday night after DeSantis dropped out of the presidential primary this past weekend. And yet, she held her own on Tuesday.
But the real news coming out of New Hampshire is the ugly gender war in the GOP. Nearly all the fellas came to Trump’s rescue, including South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, who owes his political rise to Haley after she appointed him to the US Senate in 2012. At a time when the women of America feel under assault when it comes to reproductive rights and the Biden-Harris team centered an event Tuesday night in Virginia around reproductive rights, the Republicans seem badly out of touch with the women of America.
Case in point: once-rising Republican star Haley. At age 51, she was the only woman to go toe-to-toe with the guys on the debate stage, and by some accounts, she won every single time. And yet, the men of the Trump Party just do not get it from where this former moderate Republican woman of color sits.
They do not understand how vulnerable they are with women voters, and I expect 2024 will showcase that. As for Haley, I hope she stays in the race and finally finds the courage to call Trump out for the threat to American democracy that he is. Regardless, she should not under any circumstance be his running mate; she needs to run again in 2028, when the GOP and America will finally be free of Trump.

Overshadowed by the contentious GOP primary between former President Donald Trump and former UN Ambassador and South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, Tuesday’s New Hampshire Democratic primary was unique in its own right.
The outcome for Democrats was only symbolic since none of the votes translated to delegates for the presidential nomination after New Hampshire rejected the Democratic National Committee’s decision to take away its first-primary-in-the-nation status.
That made Tuesday’s vote more of a referendum on the strength of President Joe Biden. Indeed, the DNC’s decision to disregard the New Hampshire primary forced the state’s Democratic establishment to organize an 11th-hour write-in campaign for Biden – since he wasn’t on the ballot given the DNC’s move – to avoid a possible embarrassment by upstart challenger Dean Phillips, a third-term congressman from Minnesota, whom I have known since he launched his promising political career back in 2018.
Phillips’ hoped that the incumbent president’s absence from New Hampshire would provide an opening for testing his thesis that rank-and-file Democrats are keen on having an alternative to Biden and that the Democratic establishment is “sleepwalking towards disaster” with the 81-year-old president as its nominee, but that hypothesis met a somewhat icy reception in New Hampshire.
Sure, Biden might fail to hit the same 80%+ threshold that Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton achieved in the New Hampshire primary as they ran for second terms in 2012 and 1996, respectively. But the fact that Biden’s results were strong despite being a write-in candidate who spent basically zero time campaigning in the state speaks volumes about the power he still commands among the party faithful.
Phillips, for his part, is undeterred, telling me Tuesday night that he vows to fight on. “We’re taking our message to South Carolina and then Michigan and then maybe all the way to the finish line. We’re just getting started,” he told me. “Democrats deserve options, and it’s not clear at all that President Biden can beat Donald Trump. And once Americans become more familiar with the daylight that exists between me and the president on a host of issues from Israel to the southern border to Medicare for all – I am confident our campaign will only grow in support.”
Kudos to Phillips for sticking to his guns, but the road ahead won’t be getting any easier. With Biden on the ballot in future states and his campaign machine operating at full speed, Phillips’ reception in the next few primaries will likely be even more frigid than in New Hampshire.

Sometimes the biggest story of a New Hampshire primary is the thing that didn’t happen.
Heading into the evening, there were already rumblings that Donald Trump would not just win New Hampshire, but win by a landslide.
Meanwhile, on the Democratic side, it was unclear how Joe Biden would fare as a write-in candidate – and in a state which he just demoted from its prized first-in-the-nation status.
In short, it seemed reasonable to wonder: What would the political consequences be for the Democratic incumbent if he failed to get a larger percentage of the Democratic vote than Trump did in the GOP primary?
But none of that happened.
Trump earned a solid victory, with about 55% of the vote. But while he retained his blue-collar base, he trailed Haley among White voters with a college degree by an 18% margin.
In New Hampshire and other swing states, he may well face continued skepticism among suburban voters.
Meanwhile, it appears that more than 60% of Democratic voters supported Biden, even though voters had to write-in his name.
Gone are the comparisons to Lyndon Johnson and 1968. Dean Phillips is no Gene McCarthy.
2024 will go down in New Hampshire primary history as rather forgettable. But only if you forget what didn’t happen.

Intensity. Identification. Anger. The results from New Hampshire show persistent strengths for former President Donald Trump with Republican voters that President Joe Biden can’t ignore as both look past the remaining primaries toward a general-election rematch.
Almost three in four of Trump’s backers in exit polls expressed “strong” support for him; Biden can’t match that right now in his own party.
It seems that Trump’s zeal to fight and his supporters’ perceptions that he shares their values are more important to them than temperament or electability — especially those without college degrees and with negative perceptions of the economy and mistrust of the 2020 election results.
Dissatisfaction with the economy and direction of the country seem top of mind for voters this year. But on top of that, Trump’s backers appear to be disproportionately dissatisfied, another factor that may keep them engaged.
New Hampshire’s results do carry some real warnings for Trump in terms of the general election. Nikki Haley’s closer-than-expected New Hampshire loss shows many independents and a significant minority of Republicans don’t want Trump back in the White House.
They include moderates who want to preserve women’s access to abortion and institutionalists who dislike Trump’s past conduct, legal troubles, hardline immigration or foreign policy approaches.
Haley’s backers said they were driven more by their quest for a Trump alternative than devotion to her. But Trump’s back-to-back hold on his party in two very different states, Iowa and now New Hampshire, shows how formidable he may still be.

44RYGU0VLS_DKRNJFWNYXZ95IB,Federal appeals court lets Trump gag order stand in federal January 6 case,"By Hannah Rabinowitz, Katelyn Polantz and Devan Cole, CNN","2 minute read Updated 2:19 PM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/23/politics/gag-order-trump-appeals-court-en-banc/,"The federal appeals court in Washington, DC, declined to rehear arguments over whether former President Donald Trump can be prohibited from talking about witnesses and court staff while he awaits trial in the special counsel’s January 6 criminal case.
Trump has unsuccessfully tried to challenge the gag order placed on him by Judge Tanya Chutkan late last year through appeals.
The 11 judges from the DC Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday declined to touch the case after a three-judge panel previously upheld the gag order against Trump. There were no statements or dissents made by any of the judges.
Trump can appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court, and his attorneys have previously indicated that they would appeal the matter to the nation’s highest court if necessary.
CNN has reached out to Trump’s legal team for comment.
In a unanimous decision issued last month, the three appellate judges said that Trump can be barred from talking about witnesses as well as prosecutors, the court staff and their family members.
But the court said the gag order does not apply to comments made about special counsel Jack Smith and narrowed the prohibition Trump had regarding speaking about witnesses in the case, a change from the original gag order.
The three judges on the panel — Patricia Millett, Nina Pillard and Bradley Garcia, all Democratic appointees — found Trump’s words on the public stage could undermine the fairness of a jury trial, sway or intimidate witnesses and imperil court staff. The court said that justifies limiting Trump’s speech, even while he campaigns to return to the presidency.
“Mr. Trump’s documented pattern of speech and its demonstrated real-time, real-world consequences pose a significant and imminent threat to the functioning of the criminal trial process in this case,” the appeals court wrote.

More than 100,000 people in the US are on the transplant waiting list, and an average of 17 die every day while waiting. Doctors have spent decades experimenting with alternatives, and many now see potential in replacing failing human organs with genetically modified pig organs.

Xenotransplantation, as cross-species organ transplantation is called, is still in the early stages. There are no human clinical trials taking place that have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, but the researchers behind a study published Thursday in the Journal of Clinical Investigation say their findings might bring human trials even closer.
For the study, doctors at the University of Alabama-Birmingham’s Marnix E. Heersink School of Medicine transplanted genetically modified pig kidneys into three people who were brain-dead and showed that they could do so using the same FDA-approved drugs used in human-to-human donations.
With any kind of transplant, whether from a human or an animal, doctors have to give the recipient medications that suppress their immune system so their body doesn’t reject the unfamiliar organ. In some cases, when patients are particularly vulnerable to infection, they might get additional therapy to offer protection from encapsulated bacteria like Neisseria meningitidis, the germ that causes meningitis.

The researchers behind the new study compared results from two pig kidney recipients who got the standard immune-suppressing drugs and an additional FDA-approved therapy called eculizumab with results from someone who got only the immune suppression drugs. The combination appeared to work best.
The study showed that doctors didn’t need to use specialty or experimental drugs for this transplant process, which would make it easier to get the work into FDA-approved human trials, said study author Dr. Jayme Locke, a professor of surgery and director of the Division of Transplantation at the Heersink School of Medicine.
“When we move this into the living, the scientist in me thinks the best way to do this is that we should change only one thing at a time, and so in this case, the only thing that we will have to change and have to be different is the organ source,” she said.
Keeping things as similar and as simple as possible would also make the process generalizable, Locke said.

“Doing this using medications that transplanters across the globe know how to use, when you start thinking about scaling this up and being able to offer this to as many people as possible, that’s also very appealing,” she added. “It just decreases the complexity of what you’re trying to do.”
The new research is limited because it was demonstrated in only three patients. As with any science, the advance shows a stepwise progression, but doctors who work on research involving transplants complimented the team for what transplant surgeon Dr. Sheri Krams called “extraordinarily innovative work.”
What the paper adds to the body of knowledge is “somewhat incremental,” said Krams, senior associate dean of graduate education and postdoctoral affairs and a professor of surgery at Stanford Medicine, who did not work on the new research – particularly compared with a study published in August that showed how to test this kind of procedure in a model using brain-dead donors, what UAB calls the Parsons Model after the first person in the study whom Locke and her team transplanted with a modified pig organ in 2021. But Krams agreed that “anything we do in transplant is great.”

Dr. Mandy Ford, scientific director of the Emory Transplant Center, agreed that the extreme need for organs makes any advance in this area important.
“There’s a critical donor organ shortage in the United States and worldwide, and xenotransplantation really has the potential to be a revolutionary permanent solution to the problem,” said Ford, who did not work on the new study but characterized it as a “major advance.”
“Using this FDA-approved regimen, I think, gets us closer to the clinical reality of being able to start clinical trials and one step closer to making xenotransplantation a clinical reality,” Ford added."
48ULZECBWM_5MQKVEEMQTLP7L8,Nikki Haley sweeps 6-person midnight vote in New Hampshire,"By Eva McKend and Jack Forrest, CNN","3 minute read Updated 6:26 AM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/23/politics/dixville-notch-new-hampshire-primary/,"Voters in Dixville Notch have cast the first votes in the New Hampshire primary, with all six voters choosing former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley.
“A great start to a great day in New Hampshire,” Haley said in a statement reacting to the vote minutes after it was recorded. “Thank you Dixville Notch!”
The tiny town in northern New Hampshire opened and closed its poll just after midnight ET on the morning of the state’s primary. Four registered Republican voters and two independents participated in the vote, in which former President Donald Trump, the front-runner for the GOP presidential nomination, failed to earn support.
In New Hampshire’s northern tip, Dixville Notch is the first place to declare primary results because voters there cast ballots so early. Its midnight voting tradition dates back to 1960.
While the neighboring cities of Hart’s Location and Millsfield began midnight voting earlier than that, they haven’t participated continuously and aren’t conducting midnight voting this year. A fictionalized version of the three neighbors was featured in an episode of Aaron Sorkin’s “West Wing” dubbed “Hartsfield’s Landing.”
Midnight voting in Dixville Notch has historically been held at the now-dormant Balsams Hotel, which has become a media event over the years.
Recently, with the hotel closed and awaiting redevelopment, there have been questions about whether Dixville Notch would have enough voters, but the tradition has continued.
As its population has dwindled over the years, Dixville Notch’s hold on the mini-contest is a success story for local leaders – and a reason to smile for political junkies eager for an early taste of what’s to come.
In 2020, voters backed former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg in the Democratic primary, but went on to support the eventual winner in the general election, unanimously casting five votes for Joe Biden.
Biden’s name did not appear on the ballot, and no delegates will be awarded because of a dispute between the state and the Democratic National Committee, which moved the first approved primary to South Carolina. Democratic Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesota appeared on the ballot but did not receive any votes.
According to Town Moderator Tom Tillotson, his father – former Balsams resort owner Neil Tillotson – worked to get Dixville Notch incorporated specifically so the community could vote and residents would not be forced to travel close to an hour away in the snow to participate in elections.
But he cautioned against thinking the midnight results would be too instructive.
“There’s no magic bullet that comes out of here that tells people what to do or what’s going to happen. Sometimes we are right. Sometimes we are wrong,” said Tillotson.
The core takeaway, he said, is that people should not shy away from participating in the democratic process.
“If all these people in the wilderness can get up at midnight and go vote, 100% of the town, maybe we should take voting a little more seriously. If we do anything positive, it’s maybe encourage a few extra people to vote,” Tillotson said.

4BSEKMU5HT_AMN9H7TL4NOB24E,These Ukrainian teenagers sought refuge from war in Israel. Then they were caught up in the horrors of Hamas’ attack,"By Lianne Kolirin, CNN","8 minute read Updated 4:41 AM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/26/middleeast/teenage-refugees-ukraine-israel-intl-cmd-scli/,"It was supposed to be a safe haven – a new life for those seeking refuge from the turbulence of war.
But when tens of thousands of Ukrainians fled to Israel in the wake of Russia’s invasion, they had no idea of what the future would hold.
With men aged 18 to 60 forbidden to leave Ukraine, the refugees were mostly women, children and the elderly. Among them, four courageous teenagers who arrived alone in Israel to start a new life as a result of Moscow’s assault on their homeland on February 24, 2022.
Little more than a year and a half later, these young people found themselves immersed in another conflict, as they study at a boarding school just 8 miles from Gaza.
“The day before was very peaceful,” recalled Artem Karpin, 18, of Hamas’ attack on Israel on October 7. “I remember thinking I wasn’t really ready with my homework and wondering how to postpone my deadlines.”
Karpin lives and studies at Kfar Silver, a youth village near Ashkelon, close to where Hamas militants infiltrated the border that Saturday morning. He is one of about 40 Ukrainian refugees to enrol there since Russia invaded his country.
Run by the global education charity World ORT, the “village” is effectively a sprawling complex for 1,090 children from challenging backgrounds – including 250 boarders.
Originally from the southwestern city of Odesa, Karpin had been visiting relatives in Israel when Russia invaded Ukraine. His father gave him no choice but to stay put.
“I started crying when I began to understand that I’m not going back,” he told CNN at Kfar Silver. “I felt betrayed. I didn’t think it was a wise decision to leave me here.”
Nearly 2,000 miles from his parents, Karpin, then 16, enrolled at Kfar Silver, where he soon began to learn the language, make friends and settle in. That was until life was upended again on October 7.
“That morning we all ran from the dorms to the shelter in the school,” he said. “I was scared but not terrified. I was trying to talk it all through rationally and it really helped.”
Karpin was one of 63 of pupils on site that day, as was 18-year-old Michael Reider.
Originally from Kyiv, Reider arrived in Israel in March 2022 following a gruelling journey from his homeland to Poland, where he spent a week on his own before flying out.
On that “black Shabbat” of October 7, he said: “I woke up and there were a lot of sirens and rockets were flying.

“I had already experienced one invasion and now this was a second one. I don’t know how to explain it – I wasn’t really afraid. I felt kind of angry and like I had the energy to fight.”
Pupils and staff remained in the shelter for hours as the unprecedented terror raged around them.
Amos Gofer, who served in the IDF for 25 years before becoming chief executive of Kfar Silver, told CNN: “During my military service I spent time in Lebanon, Gaza, occupied territories. I saw some stuff but October 7 was the hardest day of my professional life.
“We were terrified. We knew very early that the situation was very bad, that there were a lot of terrorists.”
Friday had marked the end of a week-long religious holiday, so fortunately very few pupils were at school, said Gofer. Most of the Ukrainian students, however, had nowhere else to be.
“I was sure the terrorists were going to come here to kill us,” said Gofer, who keeps the remains of a rocket which exploded on the school grounds on his desk.
“I had three people with personal pistols, which was nothing compared to the heavy ammunition the terrorists had.
“We saw no helicopters, no police, no military – I still don’t understand why it took so long,” said Gofer, referring to widespread reports on October 7 that the army and security forces took hours to react to the incursions.
Gofer told CNN that “thousands of rockets” flew over the village, while fires broke out everywhere around them.
With no response to his repeated calls to the army and emergency services, who were dealing with ongoing attacks in multiple locations, Gofer finally called a bus company manager he knew.
“He told me none of his bus drivers were willing to come… everyone was terrified.”
Two drivers from the bus company eventually volunteered to evacuate the children to another village further north, he added. “They told me if they’re not out of here in two, three minutes they would go without the students.”
Karpin recalled: “We had several minutes to pack our clothes and run for the buses. I got the most essential stuff and that’s it. In an hour or two we were in Netanya.”
Four days later, Karpin’s parents, back in Ukraine, insisted that he leave Israel with other relatives for Europe.
“After three weeks I started to feel that I wanted to return (to Israel),” he said of his time in Greece and Germany. “I missed my studies and my friends. It was getting a little safer in Israel, so I convinced my family I needed to get back.”
In common with some other foreign boarders, 17-year-old Maria, who asked not to give her surname for privacy reasons, was staying with a nearby “host family” because of the religious holiday when Hamas launched its assault on October 7.
“At six in the morning we were all running to the shelter and you could hear sirens,” she said.
Originally from the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, Maria and her younger brother had moved to their father’s home in Kyiv following the Russian invasion. Eventually the two siblings left the country via Moldova and flew to Israel.
“When war broke out in Ukraine it was like life fell apart and this time it was very similar - I had flashbacks,” she said. “I was scared but also thought if I tried to distance myself as much as possible everything would be OK.”
She remained with the family, who live in Ashkelon, for several days before heading north to join the evacuees, including her brother. There they remained until last month when they returned to the school.
“My mum was worried about us,” she said, adding that their mother suggested they return home to Ukraine.
“I told myself I could go back but that I’d be going back to war and I couldn’t possibly know if it’s safer. At the same time, I didn’t want to leave Israel. I thought ‘do I need to flee again to start life again once more?’”
After lengthy family discussions, the siblings decided to stay.

“In some ways I’d rather be here,” said Maria. “I just wish for my family to be brought together again in peace.”
Fellow Ukrainian Sviatoslave Kulyk, 17, told CNN he had “not been afraid at all” about leaving his family for Israel back in 2022.
“I understood that it was better to live in a country with no war,” he said.
That all changed when he woke up at his friend’s house in Ashkelon on October 7.
“I had flashbacks to Ukraine, especially when we watched TV about what was happening,” said Kulyk, who told CNN he had witnessed Russian forces roll into his street from his home in Kharkiv.
“My mum was really afraid of me being in Ashkelon but I was trying to explain that I had a bomb shelter here,” he said, adding that Ukrainian homes are not equipped with so-called safe rooms. All Israeli homes built after 1993 must have such a shelter, designed to protect residents from rocket attacks.
With the village now at “95% operational,” according to Gofer, counsellors, social workers and psychologists are on hand to support pupils as they navigate the mental and emotional fallout of the war.
Kulyk said he feels safe but admitted that “sometimes it’s really hard for me to live in Israel.” However, he added: “I’m not sure I’ll go back to Ukraine. My main goal is to finish school right now.”
In the immediate aftermath of Hamas’ attack “hundreds of terrorists were caught in the area,” said Gofer, who told CNN that around 35 pupils at Kfar Silver had relatives who were murdered or kidnapped.
Many families and staff remain evacuated from their homes, while some teachers are serving in the IDF reserves.
Rockets continue to fly, though less frequently, while some staff – including Gofer – now have access to long-range rifles.

“Everyone’s on high alert,” he said. “People aren’t afraid of sirens – they’re afraid of terrorists.”
And yet the situation has not dented the optimism and determination of these four youngsters.
Both Maria and Kulyk are interested in studying international relations – something they are surely more qualified for than most teenagers.
Reider has other ideas. “When the war started here there was relative silence in Ukraine and my family felt more safe,” he said.
“They were very worried (about me) but I didn’t want to go back. I’m a Jew and Israel is my country. If Israel calls me to the army, I’ll go.” A period of military service is compulsory for most Israelis when they turn 18.
Karpin plans to study electrical engineering in Israel.
“I want to go back home once I have two university degrees so I can work on rebuilding and improving Ukrainian infrastructure and make my country a safe and better place,” he said."

The movement on Wednesday of the USS John Finn through the waterway that separates democratically governed Taiwan from communist mainland China was also the first transit of a US warship through the strait since elections on the island two weeks ago.
The vote gave Taiwan’s ruling Democratic Progressive Party a historic third consecutive presidential victory, with the island’s voters shrugging off warnings from Beijing that its reelection would increase the risk of conflict.
China’s ruling Communist Party views Taiwan as part of its territory, despite having never controlled it, and leader Xi Jinping has not ruled out the use of military force to “reunify” the island with the mainland.
The US meanwhile is obligated under the Taiwan Relations Act to provide Taiwan with the military means to defend itself, something Beijing regards as interference in its internal affairs.
US Navy 7th Fleet spokesperson Cmdr. Meagan Greene said in a statement Wednesday that the transit of the USS John Finn through the strait was made “in accordance with international law.”
“The ship transited through a corridor in the Strait that is beyond the territorial sea of any coastal State. John Finn’s transit through the Taiwan Strait demonstrates the United States’ commitment to upholding freedom of navigation for all nations as a principle,” Greene said.

While the John Finn’s transit of the Taiwan Strait was the first of 2024, US warships and warplanes regularly travel through and over the waterway. In 2023, US Navy and Coast Guard ships and Navy reconnaissance planes made 11 transits of the strait, according to a database kept by Collin Koh, research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.
On Thursday, China’s Defense Ministry said Washington was courting danger with its military activities in the region, saying a change in behavior is “needed to avoid maritime and air accidents,” according to the state-run Xinhua news agency’s English-language website.
“The root cause of the China-U.S. maritime and air security issues lies in the U.S. military’s harassment and provocations on China’s doorstep, engaging in prolonged, extensive and high-frequency activities in the maritime and aerial areas surrounding China,” the Xinhua story said, citing Defense Ministry spokesperson Wu Qian.
“He urged the U.S. side to stop abusing international law, cease all dangerous provocations, and strictly discipline its troops on the ground,” the story said.
Earlier this month, the commander of the US Indo-Pacific Command, Adm. John Aquilino, accused Beijing of ramping up tensions.
Aquilino told a defense forum in Hawaii that he expected a show of force from China against Taiwan in the wake of the election result.
“When something occurs that they don’t like, they tend to take actions,” Aquilino told the Pacific Forum’s Operationalizing Integration in the Indo-Pacific conference in Honolulu.
Koh, the Singaporean analyst, said Beijing may be a bit “miffed” at Washington at the moment, especially after agreeing to restart military-to-military talks in December.
“Given that Beijing very likely believes that it extended the olive branch by agreeing to reopen military-to-military communications and other high-level exchanges, it might have perceived a lack of reciprocity from the US,” Koh said."

People with symptoms can return to school or work once their symptoms are improving and they’ve been fever-free for at least 24 hours, according to the state policies.

These two states — which have tended to take a more precautious approach to pandemic policies — are the first to break from federal guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which recommends at least five days of isolation for anyone with Covid-19. Oregon changed its isolation policy in May when the Covid-19 public health emergency lifted, and California followed suit earlier this month.
Officials in both states say the changes reflect policy that’s evolving along with the pandemic.
“We are now at a different point in time with reduced impacts from COVID-19 compared to prior years due to broad immunity from vaccination and/or natural infection, and readily available treatments available for infected people,” Dr. Tomás Aragón, director of the California Department of Public Health, wrote in the official order about the change. “Our policies and priorities for intervention are now focused on protecting those most at risk for serious illness, while reducing social disruption that is disproportionate to recommendations for prevention of other endemic respiratory viral infections.​”

The CDC recommends at least five days of isolation because people are likely to be most infectious during that time, and the science around that hasn’t changed. The recent order from the California health department notes that the potential infectious period spans from two days before through 10 days after symptoms or a positive test.
But experts broadly agree that easing isolation timeframes won’t significantly increase community transmission or severe outcomes — in part because the virus has been circulating at very high levels, even with more restrictive guidance in place.
“I don’t think this is reflecting updated science, but this is reflecting changing social norms and increasing workplace crunches,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiology professor and director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health.
Recent data from Oregon suggest the policy change has had minimal effect on virus trends. The state has seen a surge this winter, like the rest of the country, but Covid-19 hospitalization rates and emergency department visits have stayed below the national average, according to data from the CDC.
“We are not going to be able to completely stop transmission, and we’re not going to be able to get rid of this virus in the human population,” said Dr. Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. “Then, the decision of how to bring something into policy is really a summation of the medical risks as well as the risks to society as a whole.”
Instead, as the burden of severe disease has lessened, some experts say that stricter isolation policies may have unintended negative effects on public health.
“When we’re sick, we typically want to know what we have so that we can get treatment and possibly feel better,” said Dr. Sarita Shah, a clinical care provider and infectious disease epidemiologist at Emory University. “The ironic thing is, what I think has happened with Covid because of the isolation policies is that people kind of don’t want to find out because it leads to negative things.”

People with mild symptoms may not test because they can’t afford to miss a week of work and they might avoid wearing a mask because it could raise questions, she said. Less restrictive isolation policies could allow people to feel more comfortable with testing, which could prompt them to get treatment or feel more comfortable taking other protective measures.
Dr. Dean Sidelinger, Oregon’s state health officer, said that equity was a key factor considered in the decision to change isolation policy in the state.
“From a pragmatic standpoint, from an evidence-based and equity standpoint — trying to make sure that we weren’t unnecessarily burdening families, keeping kids out of school, or keeping people out of work who may have very limited sick leave — this made sense for us,” he said.
Public health policy decisions are rarely black-and-white, experts say, and weighing tradeoffs can be more of an art than a perfect science.
“There are different perspectives on the best way forward, even with everyone looking at the same data, everyone with the same good intentions in mind,” Barouch said.  “Well-meaning people could come to different conclusions.”
The CDC says that it will “continue to evaluate the latest data, including the continued decline in hospitalizations and COVID-related deaths compared to last year – likely the result of widespread vaccination and prior infection – as it considers its recommendations for how people can best protect themselves and their loved ones from the virus.”

But the agency notes that local jurisdictions have “shaped health guidelines to address situations on the ground” since the start of the pandemic.
In many ways, the changes California and Oregon made to their isolation policies for Covid-19 put it more in line with the way public health approaches other respiratory viruses, experts say. For example, if a child has a mild sore throat or fever, the decision about whether to go to school or not shouldn’t depend on the results of a Covid-19 test.
“It’s really challenging to have disease-by-disease policies in a respiratory season for which we don’t have ubiquitous testing,” Nuzzo said. People who are sick should take precautions, she said, and “we should be using tests as a tool, not as a penalty.”
While severe outcomes for Covid-19 have decreased over the years, it is still not just a cold, or even like the flu. The latest CDC data shows that Covid-19 hospitalization rates have consistently been at least twice as high as they’ve been for flu this respiratory virus season, and thousands of people have died from Covid-19 in the first two weeks of this year.
This ongoing burden of disease is why there is such strong debate about policy change, Shah said.
Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.
But the tools we have to manage Covid-19 have evolved rapidly and are much more in line with what’s available to manage other respiratory diseases, experts say — and isolation is just one strategy. Oregon and California, for example, still encourage people who test positive to wear a mask for at least 10 days.
Also, the policy changes in California and Oregon offer a broad, population-level approach to Covid-19 management. But individuals and places like hospitals may adjust based on their own risk tolerance.
“Health decisions generally are individual. At the end of the day, you’re always having that discussion with your doctor about what’s going to be best for you,” Shah said. The same internal analysis has now been happening around Covid-19 for years, and the risk-benefit balance may have shifted for many people, she said.
“I think it’s time to have that conversation and to have that debate.”"
4K5KXERKHI_UE76Y7VYSREDZT5,Opinion: It’s over 100 days since you were taken hostage. Our baby girl is crawling now,Opinion by Lishay Lavi,"5 minute read Updated 10:15 AM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240122,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/22/opinions/wife-letter-israeli-hostage-husband-lavi/,"Editor’s Note: Editor’s note: Lishay Lavi’s husband Omri Miran, father of their two daughters Roni and Alma, was kidnapped by Hamas on October 7 and remains captive in Gaza. Her letter has been translated from Hebrew by her brother, Moshe Lavi. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. Read more CNN Opinion.
Dear Omri, my Omri,
Alma began crawling soon after you were taken from us. She now sits and stands as well and tries to eat on her own. She smiles and reaches for the space you once occupied as if trying to grasp a memory that slips through her tiny fingers.
I wonder, will you be free to see her walk for the first time?
I have been writing daily to you, myself and the world. Writing about our pain, our agony, our despair. I hope that you’ll return to Roni, Alma and me.
We heard that one of the released hostages told you we survived October 7 against all odds; we were rescued from the house of horrors that saw the death of loved ones, our hours-long abuse and your violent abduction.
We hope that news is true. We hope that the knowledge we are here waiting for you helps you persevere through your captivity, just as the hope of your return is what helps me persevere.
I think of Penelope’s words about Odysseus: “How I long for my husband – alive in memory, always.”
Roni has been both a beacon of light and a mirror reflecting the pain in my heart. She speaks so much now, my love, with a wisdom that transcends her years.
Her words are bittersweet, a constant reminder of your absence. She asks every night where you are, why you are still lost. She speaks of the bad people who took you away in front of our eyes. She draws you every day. And her smile reminds me of you.
Her eyes search mine for reassurance, and I try to give her the certainty she craves. But real comfort can only come when you are returned to us.
Roni’s resilience is both inspiring and heartbreaking. She found hope when Mojo, your dog, returned injured but wagging his tail. He too longs to see you!
Alma is too young to understand what is happening; her laughter echoes through the hall of our temporary housing in Kibbutz Kramim. It’s a haunting reminder of the joy that once permeated our home.
Yes, I forgot to say. We are no longer in Nahal Oz. There’s no more Nahal Oz, at least not in the way we remember it, and at least not until this painful war ends.
The Nahal Oz community and spirit, however, live on through us, the survivors who are rallying in support of each other and fighting for your and (fellow hostage) Tsaci Idan’s release.
We also found a community and support system in Kramim, people who care and love us and give us the strength to wake up every morning and work for your release.
Your friends visit, supporting and loving us more than I could have wished.
The last time we saw each other, I told you that I love you, that I’ll care for the girls, and that you should not try to be a hero. You told me that you love me, and then Roni tried to run to you. Thankfully, I managed to stop her in time.
Your captivity, with all its unknowns, has been all-encompassing. Are you injured? Do you eat? Do you need any medication? Are you being tortured or abused?
The not-knowing is a torment that wraps around my heart and squeezes it.
Some of those who returned from captivity shared their horrifying stories; others might share more in the coming days and weeks.
But for now, parts of the world seem to have turned their backs on us – and most of all, on you – in our most difficult time. The United Nations, the International Committee of the Red Cross, some of those we viewed as friends and allies.
The international community’s corridors of power and palaces of justice resonate with a silence that is deafening. Meanwhile streets and public spaces around the world have become places of hateful discourse; extending the violence of October 7 with people ripping down posters bearing your name, your photo, your story. Leaving me with a sense of abandonment that cuts deep.
How did we arrive at a place where the humanitarian pleas of families are met with indifference and mockery, where the principles that should guide us are overshadowed by political posturing?
Lishay Lavi
How did we arrive at a place where the humanitarian pleas of families are met with indifference and mockery, where the principles that should guide us are overshadowed by political posturing?
There are times we feel that our government, too, has forsaken us. Though I truly believe it is committed to bringing about your, and all the hostages, release.
But do know that while some are silent, and some are hateful, many others are loud and full of love.
You are not alone; we are not alone.
Omri, in the face of despair, I choose hope. I believe in the power of love and the resilience of the human spirit to win the fight for your freedom.
Our families tirelessly advocate for you in Israel and worldwide. Your face and name appear everywhere – and we demand others to say your name, share your story and call for your release.
There are moments when I imagine crossing into Gaza, holding Roni and Alma close, marching in and looking into the eyes of your captors as we did in Nahal Oz.
In that daydream, I bring you home with us.
But the reality is darker, more complex. Love and humanity, as much as they define us, do not always triumph.
I remain hopeful that we will get to hug you again; that Roni will run to you just as she tried to run to you that day, and this time I will not hold her back. Alma will be crawling behind her. And those first steps will come before we know it.

Omri, my love, know that you are missed and fiercely fought for.
Until that day we bring you home, I will continue to write, speak and fight for the life we built together for our daughters.
I will continue to love you like Penelope loved Odysseus during his 20 years of absence.
I refuse to believe you will not return to me.
Lishay"
4KJI2JLTQR_FIDZE9FZCJTCCXH,This is why nothing gets done in Congress on border policy,"Analysis by Zachary B. Wolf, CNN","5 minute read Published 5:30 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/25/politics/border-policy-congress-what-matters/,"A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.
It might surprise Americans to learn that high-level bipartisan talks have been underway to find a compromise solution to the crisis at the border.
It should shock no one who has paid attention to US border policy over the past 30 years that the talks may soon be dead. Even less shocking is that former President Donald Trump can be blamed for killing them.
Trump, the Republican Party’s likely presidential nominee, again wants the border to be his main election issue. He’s opposing any sort of compromise between Republicans and Democrats, especially one that could give President Joe Biden a legislative victory, even as he now acknowledges there is a border crisis. Lawmakers find themselves in a bind, left with nothing much beyond talking points.
Versions of this story have been on repeat for the past several decades. Every recent president, Republican and Democrat, has tried to put his name on a border compromise. They ultimately fail because of hard-line resistance on Capitol Hill.
Here’s the anatomy of how a border compromise never came to be:
► May 2023 - House Republicans pass hard-line border bill. As a Trump-era border policy known as Title 42 expired, House Republicans pass their own policy proposal to restart construction of a border wall, increase funding for border agents and upgraded border technology, reinstate the “remain in Mexico” policy, place new restrictions on asylum-seekers and enhance requirements for E-verify, a database employers use to verify immigration status. It’s immediately rejected by Senate Democrats and the White House.
► September 30 – House passes a spending bill without the border element. To avoid a government shutdown, then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy abandons a Republican spending bill that includes tough new border policies and works with Democrats to pass a short-term spending bill.
► October 3 - McCarthy ousted. The speaker is kicked out of his position by hard-line Republicans. A chaotic search for a new speaker ensues.
► October 20 - Biden requests $105 billion with a border sweetener. In an effort to get aid for Ukraine and Israel passed through Congress, Biden adds $13.6 billion to his national security package to address border security. Biden makes no mention of border policy in a prime-time address from the Oval Office making the case for the package. But in a letter to House Republicans, his budget director says the money would be spent on 1,300 more Border Patrol agents as well as immigration judges, asylum officers and Customs and Border Protection officers focused on stopping the flow of fentanyl.
► October 25 - New House Speaker Mike Johnson says the border is the top priority. “Inaction is unacceptable and we must come together and address the broken border,” he says on the House floor. “We have to do it.”
► November - A bipartisan group of senators works on a border compromise. Trying to find common ground, meetings are underway between a group of senators, including the Oklahoma Republican James Lankford and the Connecticut Democrat Chris Murphy, among others. If a deal on the border can be reached, there is hope among lawmakers that it will unlock support for passage of aid to Ukraine.
► November 14 - House passes another short-term spending bill. In an effort to buy more time on a long-term spending bill, Johnson pushes another short-term bill. No border policy changes are included.
► December 7 - Biden promises “significant compromises on the border.” Desperate for Ukraine aid, Biden says in a White House speech that he’s willing to make a deal on the border. He says Republicans have been unwilling to come to the table.
► January 3, 2024 - Johnson travels with House Republicans to the border. The speaker tells CNN the situation at the border is a “catastrophe,” throws cold water on the Senate negotiations and points instead to the bill House Republicans passed in 2023 and which the White House rejected. CNN reports the chances of a Senate compromise passing the House seem slim.
► January 17 - Biden and Johnson meet at the White House. There is some optimism for accord after the meeting that lasts 1 hour and 23 minutes. But in an interview later, Johnson tells CNN he cannot guarantee a Senate compromise would even get a vote on the House floor.
► January 18 - Trump turns squarely against compromise. Encouraging Johnson only to accept a “perfect” deal, Trump helps mobilize the GOP base and hard-line Republicans against any kind of deal.
► January 18 - House passes another short-term spending bill. Still trying to avert a shutdown and without any kind of compromise, Johnson again pushes a short-term funding bill to keep the government completely open through early March.
► January 22 - Compromise group continues working. With more and more focus on the Senate compromise talks, Republican leaders say the cost of the border elements of the bill could increase beyond Biden’s suggested $13.6 billion and that larger policy elements are being discussed. These could include a return to Trump-era policies for asylum-seekers and more.
► January 23 - Republicans feud. After winning Iowa’s Republican caucuses and New Hampshire’s Republican presidential primary, the front-runner to be Republicans’ 2024 presidential nominee throws more cold water on any immigration deal. Senate Republicans feud at a lunch, raising questions about whether they could support a deal.
► January 24 - It’s officially a “quandary.” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell acknowledges in a closed-door meeting the difficulty of the situation. House Republicans, pushed by Trump, are revolting against the idea of compromise. To be sure, there is always the chance the deal could be salvaged and finalized, and House Republicans could be convinced to accept it. But that currently seems like a very remote possibility, which leaves border policy and Ukraine and Israel funding in limbo."

Summers, a former president of Harvard, strongly criticized the selection of Harvard professor Derek Penslar as the co-chair of a newly-formed presidential task force on antisemitism.
“I have lost confidence in the determination and ability of the Harvard Corporation and Harvard leadership to maintain Harvard as a place where Jews and Israelis can flourish,” Summers said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.
The backlash underscores how Harvard remains under close scrutiny even after the resignation earlier this month of Claudine Gay as university president. Lawmakers and federal officials are investigating Harvard’s handling of antisemitism on campus and a House panel is probing how the school handled the plagiarism allegations surrounding Gay.

Even efforts to fight antisemitism are creating controversy.
Summers, a former top adviser to Presidents Clinton and Obama, argued that Penslar is “unsuited” to co-chair the task force because he has “publicly minimized” Harvard’s antisemitism problem.
“Could one imagine Harvard appointing as head of anti-racism task force someone who had minimized the racism problem or who had argued against federal anti-racism efforts?” Summers said.
Earlier this month, Penslar suggested the problem of antisemitism at Harvard may have been exaggerated by “outsiders.”
“Yes, we have a problem with antisemitism at Harvard, just like we have a problem with Islamophobia and how students converse with each other,” Penslar told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. “The problems are real. But outsiders took a very real problem and proceeded to exaggerate its scope.”
In December, Penslar wrote an op-ed in The Crimson calling for a rethink of definitions of antisemitism that include criticism of Israel.
Before the October 7 Hamas attacks on Israel, Penslar was also one of many academics who signed an open letter arguing that Israel’s “long-standing occupation” of Gaza has “yielded a regime of apartheid.” That same letter, titled “The Elephant in the Room,” stated that the ultimate purpose of the controversial judicial overhaul is to “ethnically cleanse all territories under Israeli rule of their Palestinian population.”
Although Summers said Penslar is a “person of good will without a trace of personal” antisemitism, the economist still called for him to step aside as co-chair of the task force.
Hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman, a frequent critic of Harvard leaders, responded to the appointment of Penslar by posting on X: “Harvard continues on the path of darkness.”
Penslar, a professor of Jewish history, referred questions from CNN to Harvard’s media office.
Harvard representatives declined to comment.
The American Academy for Jewish Research, which describes itself as the “oldest organization of Jewish studies in North America”, issued a statement on Sunday defending Penslar, who previously led the group.
“Professor Penslar is a prolific scholar with a stellar international reputation,” the group said. “It is precisely this kind of expertise that is needed in the current moment.”
The American Academy for Jewish Research added that it was “dismayed by the attacks being leveled against Penslar’s scholarship and his commitment to the task force’s work.”
Two Harvard professors, Alison Frank Johnson and Steven Levitsky, penned an op-ed in the Crimson on Monday defending Penslar as the “right choice” and arguing his “academic credentials stnd out even by Harvard’s standards.”
“Unfortunately, the leadership of the antisemitism task force was immediately attacked by outside political forces,” they wrote, “threatening to undermine its work before it even begins.”
Alan Garber, Harvard’s interim president, unveiled a pair of presidential task forces on Friday designed to fight both antisemitism and Islamophobia. The task forces will be charged with examining bias, determining root causes and compiling recommendations to combat hate.
“Reports of antisemitic and Islamophobic acts on our campus have grown, and the sense of belonging among these groups has been undermined,” Garber said in the announcement. “We need to understand why and how that is happening—and what more we might do to prevent it.”

Notably, Summers directly criticized the Harvard Corporation, the secretive yet powerful board that runs the university.
The Corporation, run by billionaire former Obama Cabinet secretary Penny Pritzker, has faced scrutiny for how it handled the crisis at the school.
Summers said he hopes “Harvard’s leadership will recognize that they have exacerbated Harvard’s credibility problems on anti-Semitism with the Penslar appointment and take steps to retore their credibility.”
The former Harvard president noted that amid the turmoil, the school’s early admissions applications tumbled through November 1.
“As things currently stand, I am unable to reassure Harvard community members, those we are recruiting or prospective students that Harvard is making progress in countering anti-Semitism,” Summers said.
Harvard officials recently met with executives from social media app Sidechat to discuss concerning content on the platform that allows users to make anonymous posts.
The meeting comes amid concerns about a spike in antisemitic messages on Sidechat, which is popular among college students.
A Harvard spokesperson confirmed to CNN on Monday that the university has “taken steps to address the concerning content,” including by meeting with Sidechat leaders.
Harvard received “reassurances that content will be moderated according to their terms of use and community guidelines, and that membership in the Harvard community space will be strictly limited to current College students,” the spokesperson said.
Harvard has also forwarded a sample of content to the university’s police department to determine whether the posts warrant law enforcement action, the spokesperson said, adding that going forward concerning content will be escalated directly to Sidechat leaders.
The Harvard Crimson previously reported on the university’s interface with Sidechat. Executives from Sidechat did not respond to requests for comment from CNN.
Sidechat is a social media platform that allows students to log in with their university email addresses to make anonymous posts. It has in the past been hailed as a way for students to combat mental health struggles, giving them an outlet to vent about struggles they may not want their Instagram followers to know about.
However, some students have described a surge in antisemitic posts on Sidechat recently.
A lawsuit filed against Harvard earlier this month by Jewish students over alleged antisemitism on campus stated that after Claudine Gay resigned as president “antisemitic messages were plastered all over Harvard’s community group” on Sidechat.
That lawsuit listed multiple examples, including one message on Sidechat that said: “All you Zionists are the same. Killers and rapists of children!”
Another message, according to the lawsuit, expressed support for Hamas and for the October 7th attack as “a moment of decolonization.”
“The antisemitism on Sidechat is appalling,” Jacob Miller, who chairs the Crimson’s editorial board and previously served as president of the Harvard Hillel, said in a post on X."

“There can be no compromise on territorial integrity, neither for Ukraine, nor for Slovakia, nor for any other country,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Oleh Nikolenko wrote on Facebook.
“Let’s be honest: if Ukraine is not secure, there will be no security, neither in Slovakia nor in Europe in general.”
In an interview with Slovak radio over the weekend, Fico offered a direct challenge to that idea, and the core position of most of his partners in the European Union.
Speaking just days ahead of a scheduled visit to Ukraine, Fico told the public broadcaster both Kyiv and Moscow would need to make painful compromises to bring the war to an end. For Ukraine, that meant accepting at least some of Russia’s gains.

“What are they expecting? That Russia will leave Donbas and Luhansk? Or that they will leave Crimea? No, that’s completely unrealistic. Everybody knows that,” Fico continued.
The Donbas and Luhansk are territories in eastern Ukraine, over parts of which Russia gained control in 2014, and from where it has expanded its territorial gains since launching its full-scale invasion in 2022. Crimea was also captured, and annexed, in 2014.
Widely seen as a pro-Kremlin figure, Fico won election in October, having run on a promise that he would block further military support for Ukraine - which he told the radio interviewer had been under the “total control of the United States” since 2014, when Ukrainians overthrew their pro-Moscow president Viktor Yanukovich.
In the European Union, he is closely aligned with Hungary’s Victor Orban and has been very open about his intentions to block Ukraine’s bid to join the EU and NATO. That blunt message would be repeated when he meets his Ukrainian counterpart, Denys Shmyhal, on Wednesday in the border town of Uzhhorod, he said.
“I will tell him that I am completely against Ukraine’s NATO membership and that I will veto it, because the only thing that would lead to is a Third World War.”
In a reversal of the policy of his predecessor, which saw Ukraine receive an air defense system and fighter jets from Slovakia, as well as other military aid, Fico also promised to tell his Ukrainian host that “he will not be getting any weapons from the Slovak Army” or from “Slovakia’s state stockpiles.”
Instead, he says he would bring an “offer of humanitarian help.”
Shmyhal’s office has not responded to a CNN enquiry about whether the visit will still go ahead.

Bringing a very different sort of message Monday to Ukraine was Poland’s new Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv.
The two leaders discussed possible joint arms production, as well as what Zelensky referred to in a statement from his office as “a new form of our cooperation – aimed at a larger scale of arms purchases for Ukrainian needs,” though no further details were given.
Tusk told his host Poland would try to help Ukraine’s accession to the EU, “so that Ukraine’s full membership in the European Union becomes a fact as soon as possible.”
The two men also expressed confidence that they could achieve lasting solutions to disputes over Ukrainian grain exports and permit-free access to the European Union for Ukrainian truck drivers, which led to blockades for many weeks at border crossings between the two countries."

So were over 90 million others across the continental United States.
Dense fog alerts were so extensive nationwide that they reached record levels for the third consecutive day. The alerts are issued by the National Weather Service when widespread fog is expected to drop visibility levels to a quarter mile or less for at least two hours.
Fog alerts stretched from the Canadian border to the Mexican border and reached as far east as the Northeast just after daybreak Thursday. A few alerts were also active along the West Coast.
In total, these alerts encompassed more than 1,500 National Weather Service forecast zones – areas that can be smaller than a county the weather service provides specific forecasts for.

The data used for this dense fog alert analysis dates to October 2005, Herzmann told CNN.
The fog is unfolding in the wake of a week featuring ice, snow, rain and a dramatic warmup for much of the US that’s making some areas feel more like March than January.
Rain and melting snow are evaporating due to the influx of warm-for-January air across the country. This evaporation is overloading the air near the surface with moisture. When the air can’t hold any more moisture it condenses into tiny water droplets that take the visible form of a cloud – and clouds right at the surface are called fog.
Winter has become the fastest-warming season for nearly 75% of the US as global temperatures rise because of human-caused climate change. Warmer than normal temperatures are also a hallmark of El Niño across a large portion of the US."

Hewlett Packard Enterprise, also known as HPE, revealed the breach in a securities filing last week. The incident took place on December 12, 2023, and affected “a small percentage of HPE mailboxes belonging to individuals in our cybersecurity, go-to-market, business segments, and other functions,” the company said.
“The Company, with assistance from external cybersecurity experts, immediately activated our response process to investigate, contain, and remediate the incident, eradicating the activity,” HPE said in the filing.
HPE said it suspects a group sometimes referred to as “Midnight Blizzard” was responsible for last month’s attack.

The hacking group, which US officials and private experts say has links to Russia’s foreign intelligence service, has gained a reputation as one of the stealthiest and most advanced cyber espionage groups in the world. Private analysts have referred to the group as “Midnight Blizzard” or as part of a group known as “APT29,” among other names.
The hackers used bugged software made by US tech firm SolarWinds to break into multiple US government agencies in 2020 to read emails between senior agency officials, US officials have alleged. (The Kremlin denied responsibility.) The spying campaign lasted well over a year and forced a major shakeup in how the US government defends its networks from hackers.
In the years since, the Russian hacking group has continued to use software providers to try to infiltrate US and European government agencies as part of a long-running quest for intelligence to serve the Kremlin, experts who track the hackers have told CNN.
The alleged Russian computer operatives have been particularly adept at breaking into cloud computing networks, as they did with the recent breach of HPE. The FBI has observed the hackers targeting cloud computing environments as far back as 2018, in what the bureau said was a likely tactic meant to cover their tracks.
HPE said in its filing that an investigation found that the December hacking incident was linked to an earlier breach and theft of some of its SharePoint files by the same group in May. The company said that after being notified of that breach in June, it “immediately investigated … and took containment and remediation measures intended to eradicate the activity” and that the incident did not materially impact the company.
HPE added regarding the December breach that it has “not determined the incident is reasonably likely to materially impact the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.”
Microsoft last week disclosed that the same group had accessed a small number of its corporate email accounts, including those belonging to some senior leaders, weeks earlier. Microsoft similarly said it had “immediately activated our response process to investigate, disrupt malicious activity, mitigate the attack, and deny the threat actor further access.”
But the Russian hackers used a relatively rudimentary technique — known as password spraying — on their way to breaching the email accounts of Microsoft executives, the tech giant said. The revelation has added to the already stiff scrutiny facing Microsoft’s security practices from US lawmakers and federal officials.
A senior US National Security Agency official told reporters Wednesday it was “disappointing” that the Russian hackers were able to breach Microsoft using password spraying “in this day and age.”
Big tech firms like Microsoft are going to be the repeated targets of state-backed hackers and have to prepare accordingly, the NSA official said in response to questions during the on-background media briefing.
Microsoft declined to comment Wednesday.
The tech firm was also at the center of an alleged Chinese hack last year that saw hackers break into the email accounts of senior US officials, including Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and US Ambassador to China NIcholas Burns. The hacking campaign began after the attackers breached a Microsoft engineer’s corporate account, according to Microsoft."
50BDKW3A6I_8O3LD08QAOG1TNO,King Charles III in London hospital for prostate procedure,"By Lauren Said-Moorhouse and Max Foster, CNN","3 minute read Updated 11:27 AM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/26/uk/king-charles-iii-hospital-prostate-procedure-intl/,"Britain’s King Charles III is “doing well” after undergoing a corrective procedure for an enlarged prostate, CNN understands.
The 75-year-old monarch was admitted to a London hospital on Friday morning for a “scheduled treatment,” Buckingham Palace said earlier in a statement.
“His Majesty would like to thank all those who have sent their good wishes over the past week and is delighted to learn that his diagnosis is having a positive impact on public health awareness,” it added.
The palace revealed on January 17 that the king was set to undergo treatment “in common with thousands of men each year” and that his condition was “benign.”
Charles arrived at The London Clinic, a private hospital near Regent’s Park, accompanied by his wife, Queen Camilla. The move was seen as unusual as the late Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip always went into hospital by themselves.
Camilla was seen leaving the hospital several hours later on Friday afternoon. As made her way to the car, well-wishers could be heard calling out, “We love you.”
The London Clinic is where Catherine, Princess of Wales remains following her abdominal surgery last week. The king visited his daughter-in-law before he went for his own treatment, a royal source told CNN.

Charles will postpone engagements for a short period while he recuperates. It was not immediately clear how long the monarch would remain in hospital.
Queen Camilla has been reassuring the public about her husband’s health during engagements over the past week, saying while in Swindon, southwest England on Monday that he was “fine,” and that he was “looking forward to getting back to work” during an art gallery visit in Aberdeen, Scotland last Thursday.
Specific medical conditions of members of the royal family are rarely divulged publicly. The palace’s perspective is that they are entitled to some level of medical privacy despite their positions as public servants.
But the king made a rare intervention and opted to share his diagnosis as he was keen to encourage other men who may be experiencing symptoms to get checked, a royal source previously told CNN.
And it would appear his approach worked. There was a surge in men seeing if they are at risk of prostate cancer, according to figures from NHS England.

Visits to its “enlarged prostate” webpage - which provides information on causes, symptoms and treatment options - saw traffic surge more than 1,000% above its daily average after the palace’s announcement.
It received 16,410 visits on the day of the announcement, compared to 1,414 visits the day before, according to the organization.
Prostate Cancer UK also said the number of individuals using its online risk checker had jumped 97%. The charity praised the monarch “for his openness that’ll inevitably raise more awareness about the condition.”
In an unprecedented double royal health shock, news of Charles’ procedure was revealed on January 17, only 90 minutes after Kensington Palace separately announced that the Princess of Wales was in hospital.
Kate, 42, is not expected to return to her royal duties until after Easter. Her husband, Prince William has also temporarily stepped away from engagements to juggle supporting Kate’s recovery and childcare.

The royal family’s health woes continued days later as Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York revealed she was also recently diagnosed with skin cancer.
Ferguson, the ex-wife of Prince Andrew, said she was “in good spirits and grateful for the many messages of love and support” following her second cancer diagnosis since the summer.
“I have been taking some time to myself,” she wrote on Instagram on Monday. “Naturally another cancer diagnosis has been a shock.”
The duchess underwent a mastectomy in June last year, followed by reconstructive surgery. Several moles were removed and analyzed at the time of her surgery, the UK Press Association reported Sunday, citing Ferguson’s spokesperson.

50O0GLCGUG_MZ21ZB11VCG2PVO,"Husband arrested in Costa Rica in connection with wife’s death after more than 30 years on the run, police say","By Nic F. Anderson, CNN","2 minute read Updated 7:09 PM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/22/us/jose-lazaro-cruz-arrest-costa-rica/,"A man wanted in connection with the 1991 killing of his wife was extradited earlier this month from Costa Rica, putting an end to his more than three decades on the run, officials said in a news conference Monday.
Jose Lazaro Cruz was arrested in Costa Rica in 2022 and brought back to Fairfax County, Virginia, earlier this month to face trial in the 32-year-old murder case, police said.
It is unclear if Lazaro Cruz has an attorney. CNN reached out to the Commonwealth Attorney for Fairfax County and the Fairfax County Public Defender Office for information about his legal representation.
On April 30, 1991, Fairfax County police officers responded to a call of a stabbing and found Ana Jurado, 24, dead in the street from trauma to her upper body, according to Eli Cory, Fairfax County’s deputy chief of investigation.
Lazaro Cruz was Jurado’s then-estranged husband and was identified as the alleged killer by police, but he fled, according to Cory. First, Lazaro Cruz tried going to Canada but was refused entry due to using falsified documentation, Cory said, adding border agents said they noticed what appeared to be a “fresh cut” on his hand at the time.
After being unable to get into Canada, Lazaro Cruz evaded authorities by traveling to Houston, Texas, and is believed to have used a smuggler to get out of the country, eventually going to El Salvador, according to Cory.
Cory said at the time, El Salvador did not have any mechanisms or policies in place to extradite him to the United States. The country eventually amended its constitution in 2000, allowing for the extradition of Salvadoran nationals.
Jurado was the mother of three young children. Her 3-year-old and 7-month-old daughters lived with her in the US and her 4-year-old son lived in El Salvador at the time of her death.
While official charges are still being sorted, Fairfax County Police Chief Kevin Davis said this case is not a “traditional cold case” because Lazaro Cruz was identified right away, he was just “on the lam.”
On July 29, 2022, Lazaro Cruz was arrested while trying to enter Costa Rica, according to Cory.
Lazaro Cruz remarried and had several children since the 1991 killing and “definitely started a whole new life in El Salvador,” according to Cory.
He is currently in the Fairfax County Correctional Center awaiting trial."

Putin thanked Kim for an invitation to visit Pyongyang and pledged to go there “at an early date,” the report from the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said.
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the dates for Putin’s visit to North Korea were still being discussed through diplomatic channels and would be announced later, Russian state-run news agency TASS reported.
Last Tuesday, North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui met Putin and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow to discuss issues regarding the Korean Peninsula, Northeast Asia and international peace and security, according to TASS.
At that meeting the two sides expressed a “strong will to further strengthen strategic and tactical cooperation in defending the core interests of the two countries,” KCNA said.
A Putin visit to Pyongyang would reciprocate one Kim made last September, when the North Korean leader traveled in his armored train to Russia’s far eastern region, visiting a factory that produces fighter jets and a rocket-launch facility among other stops.
During that visit, Kim praised Russia for standing up to “hegemonic forces” with its war in Ukraine, while Putin signaled a willingness to assist North Korea in developing its space and satellite programs.
Signs of increasing Russian-North Korean cooperation have been seen in Ukraine.
According to the US Defense Department, Russia has twice in the past month fired North Korean-made missiles at targets in Ukraine. And South Korean intelligence has reported that Pyongyang has supplied Moscow with more than 1 million artillery shells that could be used in the invasion of Ukraine.

Meanwhile, Western analysts say Russia could be a source of technology and expertise for Kim as he refines a nuclear-capable missile program that could threaten not only his neighbors in East Asia, but possibly the mainland United States with intercontinental ballistic missiles.
Kim has been drawing an increasingly harder line against South Korea in recent weeks, saying the North will no longer seek reconciliation and reunification with the South and instructing the country’s army, munitions industry, nuclear weapons and civil defense sectors to accelerate war preparations in response to “confrontation moves” by the US.
Last week, in a speech to a Supreme People’s Assembly (SPA) meeting in Pyongyang, Kim called the South the North’s “primary foe and invariable principal enemy” and said a reunification monument in the North Korean capital was an “eyesore” that should be demolished."
523ZS9BGOX_B8O65RX4NU9MC86,US and Iraqi governments expected to start talks on future of US military presence in the country,"By Natasha Bertrand and Oren Liebermann, CNN","6 minute read Updated 1:28 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/24/politics/us-military-iraq-talks-future/,"The US and Iraq are expected to soon begin talks on the future of the US military presence in the country, according to sources familiar with the matter, amid public calls from the Iraqi government for the US to withdraw its troops.
The US and Iraq agreed to form a higher military commission last summer, according to the Pentagon, as a vehicle for the talks. The discussions between US and Iraqi officials, akin to a working group, will focus on the next phase of the US-led anti-ISIS coalition, with the terror group now reduced to a shadow of its former self. US military officials and diplomats will be involved in the discussions, officials said.
The talks about the future of the US’ military presence have now taken on a greater urgency amid the wider regional instability, and amid growing public calls by the Iraqi government for the US to withdraw its troops from the country. Those calls have come in response to the US launching airstrikes inside Iraq targeting Iran-backed militants who have been attacking US personnel there.
Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin confirmed on Thursday that the military commission will launch “in the coming days.”
Military and defense officials will advise the commission “on the most effective evolution of the D-ISIS Coalition mission, ensuring that ISIS can never resurge, in consultation with Coalition partners at all stages of the process,” Austin said in a statement.
The US has roughly 2,500 troops currently in Iraq who have been operating there in an advise and assist capacity since December 2021, when the US military announced the end of its combat role in the country.
A senior military official told reporters on Thursday that the remaining contingency of ISIS fighters in Iraq and Syria is assessed to be “around the 1,000 or so,” including fighters, financiers, facilitators, and the “network that would support the Daesh fighters.”
“They’re disrupted, they’re suppressed … Daesh is not capable beyond small attacks, currently, in Iraq and Syria,” the military official said.
Part of the discussions will focus on whether and when it will be feasible to end the US military presence in Iraq. The US prefers a schedule that would be based on conditions in Iraq, including the ongoing defeat of ISIS and the stability of the government and the Iraqi security forces, US officials said.
But some elements within the Iraqi government prefer a schedule based on a timeline, setting the date for an American withdrawal regardless of the stability or the security situation within the country. On January 10th, the office of Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani said they would soon begin the process “to end the presence of the international coalition forces in Iraq permanently.”
A US official told CNN that “the US and Iraq are close to agreement on starting the Higher Military Commission dialogue that was announced back in August.”
“The HMC will be an opportunity to jointly evaluate the conditions required for the future of the D-ISIS fight in Iraq and shape the nature of the bilateral security relationship,” the official said. “We have been discussing this for months. The timing is not related to recent attacks. The US will maintain full right of self-defense during the talks.”
Jonathan Lord, the director of the Middle East security program at the Center for New American Security, told CNN that the US needs to transition its support for Iraq toward building “a lasting and sustainable military capacity in the [Iraqi Security Forces], to avoid another 2014. That hasn’t happened.”
“If we leave now, with no plan in place, we’re sending the patient back out on the street, with no plan to stay healthy,” he added, comparing the initial anti-ISIS intervention to an emergency room hospital stay. “Chances are, if things go bad, they’ll end up right back there. And it’s the most expensive, least efficient way to help them.”
On Tuesday, following the latest round of US strikes in Iraq, a spokesperson for the prime minister said in a statement that the strikes are “undermining agreements and various sectors of joint security cooperation” as the two countries are working to “reshape the future relationship.”
“There will be some cosmetic changes, but I don’t think the Iraqis want us to leave,” said a former senior US military official.
The former official pointed to a vote in the Iraqi parliament to remove US forces from the country shortly after the US assassinated a senior Iranian commander in Baghdad. Four years after that vote, the US military remains in Iraq at the invitation of the government.
“I think they recognize it will be difficult for them to survive without significant US assistance,” the former official said.
The US and Iraq agreed to start talks on the future of the US’ military presence last year, before the October 7 terror attack by Hamas on Israel sparked wider regional tensions and emboldened the Iran-backed groups, particularly Kataib Hezbollah, in Iraq and across the Middle East.
The Pentagon has maintained that the Iraqi government has not formally asked the US military to withdraw, emphasizing that the troops are still there at the invitation of the Iraqi government. And there is no set deadline for a conclusion to the higher military commission discussions, or their ultimate outcome.
Jon Alterman, the director of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the politics of the US military presence in Iraq have been “treacherous” for more than a decade, but it’s not a binary choice of staying or leaving. Nor is this a process that needs to move quickly, he said.
“This is a choice of where you want to be on a spectrum,” said Alterman. “Diplomats can manipulate both the timing and the direction of the talks and arrive at a wide variety of potential outcomes.”
Still, rumblings of a potential US change in its force posture in Iraq would be a victory for Iran, Alterman said. “Any sign that this is the beginning of the end would be widely celebrated in Iranian corridors.”
On Wednesday, Iraq’s foreign minister hinted at the coming discussions, saying in a statement that he met with the US Ambassador to Baghdad, Elena Romanowski, and “received from her an important message from the American government to the Iraqi government, which will be studied by the Prime Minister and the relevant concerned authorities. Next steps will be taken regarding it soon.”
The US also has a presence in Syria to fight ISIS, but administration officials told CNN that a withdrawal from that country is not under consideration.
“The Biden administration is not considering a withdrawal of forces from Syria,” a senior US official told CNN.

52TUEERZEZ_1Y1HGRLKY0B8RA8,Belarus arrests families of political prisoners in fresh crackdown,"By Christian Edwards, Catherine Nicholls and Niamh Kennedy, CNN","2 minute read Published 7:57 AM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/25/europe/belarus-kgb-arrest-political-prisoner/,"Belarus has conducted mass raids, interrogations and arrests of dozens of friends and relatives of political prisoners, a Belarusian human rights group said, in the regime’s latest crackdown on dissent.
At least 159 people were persecuted across the country on Tuesday in a “massive security raid” carried out by the Belarusian State Security Committee, referred to as the Belarusian KGB, according to Viasna Human Rights Center.
The Belarusian KGB reportedly came to the homes and workplaces of the friends and family of political prisoners, interrogating around 100 people and arresting at least 26 others. Many said they were forced to sign non-disclosure agreements, Viasna said, adding some detainees’ phones were inspected before being returned with monitoring software installed.
Criminal proceedings have been opened for some of the individuals accused of “promoting extremist activities,” Viasna wrote on X Thursday.
Maryna Adamovich, the wife of political prisoner and former presidential candidate Mikalai Statkevich, was sentenced to 15 days in prison for “petty hooliganism,” the human rights group said.

Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya said she was “shocked” by the raids and called on the global community “to respond decisively to this atrocity.”
Tsikhanouskaya, who was forced into exile in 2020 after President Alexander Lukashenko won a presidential election deemed by observers to be fraudulent, called Adamovich’s arrest a “stark reminder of the regime’s ruthless tactics.”
“This latest wave of repression is the regime’s revenge on those who love our country & seek a real path out of the political crisis in Belarus created by the dictator,” Tsikhanouskaya wrote Thursday on X.
The Belarusian State Security Committee did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment.
Several European governments on Wednesday condemned the detentions. Norway’s Foreign Ministry said it was “deeply concerned by yesterday’s arrest of Maryna Adamovich, other human rights defenders and their family members.” It called for all political prisoners to be released immediately.
The Dutch Foreign Ministry called the raids “yet another escalation in a long row of human rights violations by the Belarusian authorities.”
In its annual report published earlier this month, Human Rights Watch said Belarusian authorities had carried out a “widespread and systematic crackdown on dissent” during 2023.
“Over the past year, Belarusian authorities doubled down to create an information vacuum around raging repressions by cutting political prisoners off from the outside world and bullying their lawyers and families into silence,” the group said."

At Grafenwoehr Training Area in Germany — the US military’s largest training base in Europe — approximately 1,500 Ukrainian troops are taking part in weapons training, leadership courses, and reconstitution training, according to Col. Martin O’Donnell, a spokesman for US Army Europe and Africa.
Another 80 Ukrainian troops are undergoing training at the US base in Rheinland-Pfalz in Germany, O’Donnell said. A small number of Ukrainian pilots are also undergoing pilot training in Tucson, Arizona, to fly F-16 fighter jets.
Celeste Wallander, the assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs, said earlier this week that the goal is to have Ukraine operating F-16s this year, “which would entail trained pilots, the platforms, but in addition, trained maintainers and sustainers, infrastructure, and spare parts, [and] ammunition.”
To date, the United States has trained approximately 18,000 Ukrainian troops in different programs like combined arms training, leadership training, and learning to use specific weapons and systems, O’Donnell said. The coalition of countries that are providing training to Ukrainian forces have trained more than 118,000 troops in 80 different training areas.
The training program for Ukrainian forces has continued, even as the US has run out of money to provide Ukraine with any more security packages. The Biden administration is pushing for $61.4 billion dollars for Ukraine aid in a supplemental national security package, but its future prospects remain unclear amid ongoing congressional negotiations over the southern border and immigration policies.
The last Ukraine security package, worth up to $250 million, was announced on December 27. Some weapons and equipment from previous drawdown packages and Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) packages are still flowing into Ukraine, but the US has not been able to announce new packages.
Wallander warned that Ukraine has concerns about how equipped their units are and whether they have enough ammunition to stay in the fight against Russia.
“We have heard reports from the Ukrainian government that they have concerns … that they believe that units do not have the stocks and the stores of ammunition that they require, and that is one of the reasons we have been focusing on the need to answer Congress’ questions so that they are able to move forward on a decision to pass the supplemental,” Wallander told reporters Tuesday."

The actress (and recent Emmy winner) took to social media on Tuesday to congratulate her cousins, Sterling K. Brown and Danielle Brooks, on their Oscar nominations.
“Both of my COUSINS are OSCAR NOMINATED,” Nash-Betts wrote in the caption of a photo featuring the three of them on her Instagram, adding by way of clarification, “Yes! We are blood related! REAL cousins!”
“I’m so proud of my fam!” the “Claws” star added, concluding the caption with, “I’m rooting for you!”
While it’s unclear exactly how the three are related, a publicist for Brooks confirmed that she and Nash-Betts are cousins.
CNN has reached out to reps for Nash-Betts and Brown for further clarification.
Brooks and Brown are each nominated in the supporting actor categories at the Academy Awards this year.
Brooks is nominated for her role of Sofia in “The Color Purple,” while Brown received his nod for his work in “American Fiction.”
It turns out, Nash-Betts also has another famous relative.

Anderson, CNN","2 minute read Updated 7:09 PM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/22/us/jose-lazaro-cruz-arrest-costa-rica/,"A man wanted in connection with the 1991 killing of his wife was extradited earlier this month from Costa Rica, putting an end to his more than three decades on the run, officials said in a news conference Monday.
Jose Lazaro Cruz was arrested in Costa Rica in 2022 and brought back to Fairfax County, Virginia, earlier this month to face trial in the 32-year-old murder case, police said.
It is unclear if Lazaro Cruz has an attorney. CNN reached out to the Commonwealth Attorney for Fairfax County and the Fairfax County Public Defender Office for information about his legal representation.
On April 30, 1991, Fairfax County police officers responded to a call of a stabbing and found Ana Jurado, 24, dead in the street from trauma to her upper body, according to Eli Cory, Fairfax County’s deputy chief of investigation.
Lazaro Cruz was Jurado’s then-estranged husband and was identified as the alleged killer by police, but he fled, according to Cory. First, Lazaro Cruz tried going to Canada but was refused entry due to using falsified documentation, Cory said, adding border agents said they noticed what appeared to be a “fresh cut” on his hand at the time.
After being unable to get into Canada, Lazaro Cruz evaded authorities by traveling to Houston, Texas, and is believed to have used a smuggler to get out of the country, eventually going to El Salvador, according to Cory.
Cory said at the time, El Salvador did not have any mechanisms or policies in place to extradite him to the United States. The country eventually amended its constitution in 2000, allowing for the extradition of Salvadoran nationals.
Jurado was the mother of three young children. Her 3-year-old and 7-month-old daughters lived with her in the US and her 4-year-old son lived in El Salvador at the time of her death.
While official charges are still being sorted, Fairfax County Police Chief Kevin Davis said this case is not a “traditional cold case” because Lazaro Cruz was identified right away, he was just “on the lam.”
On July 29, 2022, Lazaro Cruz was arrested while trying to enter Costa Rica, according to Cory.
Lazaro Cruz remarried and had several children since the 1991 killing and “definitely started a whole new life in El Salvador,” according to Cory.
He is currently in the Fairfax County Correctional Center awaiting trial."
5AB7CBD31R_H6FIQ7R8E3U8DLO,Trials of Michigan school shooter’s parents set to test limits of who’s responsible for a mass shooting,"By Eric Levenson, CNN","8 minute read Updated 5:09 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/25/us/james-jennifer-crumbley-school-shooting-trial/,"The parents of Ethan Crumbley, the teenager who in 2021 opened fire at his high school in Oxford, Michigan, are going on trial for manslaughter in cases that will test the limits of who is responsible for a mass shooting.
James and Jennifer Crumbley have pleaded not guilty to four charges of involuntary manslaughter for their alleged roles in their son’s rampage, which left four students dead and seven others wounded. They face up to 15 years in prison.
They are standing trial separately. Opening statements in Jennifer Crumbley’s trial began Thursday, and James Crumbley’s trial is tentatively scheduled to start March 5.
In bringing manslaughter charges, prosecutors alleged the gunman’s parents are also responsible for the students’ deaths – a novel and unusual legal theory.
“Jennifer Crumbley didn’t pull the trigger that day, but she is responsible for those deaths,” Oakland County assistant prosecutor Marc Keast said in opening statements.
In particular, prosecutors accuse the gunman’s parents of disregarding the risks when they bought a gun for their son four days before the shooting, even though he was struggling with his mental health and contemplating violence. They also say the parents did not mention the gun to school officials in a meeting to discuss Ethan’s disturbing drawings just hours before the fatal shooting.

“Despite her knowledge of his deteriorating mental crisis, despite her knowledge of his growing social isolation, despite the fact that it’s illegal for a 15-year-old to walk into a gun store and walk out with a handgun by himself, this gun was gifted,” Keast said.
“Even with all of that,” on the day of the shooting, “Jennifer Crumbley was still given the opportunity to prevent these murders from ever happening,” Keast said. “Instead, she chose to do nothing.”
The parents’ defense attorneys have argued the charges have no legal justification, but appeals courts have upheld them.
In the defense’s opening statements, attorney Shannon Smith said Jennifer Crumbley did not know about her son’s deteriorating mental state and could not have reasonably foreseen he would use the gun in a mass shooting. Instead, Smith pushed blame on her husband for purchasing the firearm and on the school for failing to notify her about her son’s problematic behavior. Jennifer Crumbley plans to testify to explain her side of the story, Smith said.
“She is going to take the stand and tell you about her life with her son, about the day he became the shooter, and about the day he did something she could have never anticipated or fathomed or predicted,” Smith said. “She will tell you that when she saw the materials in this case, she learned that her son had not been her son for months. That he had been manipulating her, he had been hiding things from her, he had been sending alarming text messages to other people.”
“You will hear that the school never advised Mrs. Crumbley of problematic issues that, if she had heard about, she would have jumped right on top of it,” Smith added.
Parents have been charged for their child’s actions before, but not in this specific way, according to Misty Marris, a trial attorney who has followed the case.
“It’s not the first time that a parent has been held liable in some capacity for the acts of a child or a shooter, however, usually those charges relate to child neglect or manifest as a failure to keep a firearm locked up,” Marris said. “This is very different because it’s actually holding them responsible for the killings.”

Ethan Crumbley, speaking at his sentencing hearing in December, said, “They did not know, and I did not tell them what I planned to do, so they are not at fault for what I’ve done.” His testimony about his parents’ knowledge of his mental health struggles could be key, but it’s not clear at this point whether he will testify.
His attorneys have indicated he will invoke his Fifth Amendment right to silence if called to testify, as the appeal of his sentence remains open. In court Tuesday, Jennifer Crumbley asked the judge to compel her son and his two jail psychiatrists to testify, while the shooter’s attorneys indicated they will not waive privilege or confidentiality for his medical records, the testimony of his doctors or his own testimony.
Marris said the trials will particularly focus on what the parents did not do, and whether that makes them responsible. “That’s why this is a tricky case because a lot of it is based on omission, not action,” she said. “A lot of criminal culpability is because you did something, not because you failed to do something. That’s why this legal argument is so novel and new and actually pretty groundbreaking.”
The evidence and arguments may also differ for each parent. Jennifer and James Crumbley had been working toward a joint defense, but their cases were separated after their defense learned of a conflict between the two. According to a prosecution filing from last year, Jennifer Crumbley “placed blame” on her husband in the shooting, leading to the split.
On November 30, 2021, Ethan Crumbley, 15 at the time, took a gun from an unlocked container in his home, hid it in his backpack and took it out in a bathroom before opening fire on his schoolmates.
He has pleaded guilty to one count of terrorism causing death, four counts of murder and 19 other charges related to the deadly rampage, and last year was sentenced to life in prison without parole.
In court Thursday, the first two witnesses were educators at Oxford High School, including Molly Darnell, a teacher who was shot in the arm. In addition, Cammy Back, an employee at an Oxford store that sells guns, testified she sold a 9 mm Sig Sauer firearm to James Crumbley on November 26, 2021, with Ethan there as well.
With ATF special agent Brett Brandon on the stand, prosecutors showed a series of videos of Ethan Crumbley shooting at the gun range with his father in the months before the attack. Ethan and Jennifer Crumbley went to the gun range on November 27, and they took turns shooting, surveillance video showed. “Mom & son day testing out his new Xmas present,” she wrote afterward in an Instagram post. “My first time shooting a 9mm I hit the bullseye.”
Further, Ethan texted a video to a friend just after midnight on August 20, 2021, showing him holding and loading a pistol inside his house. “My dad left it out so I thought, ‘Why not’ lol” he wrote.
In pre-trial hearings, prosecutors introduced text messages and other evidence they said showed his parents ignored clear warning signs.
According to phone evidence, Ethan had texted a friend saying he was experiencing hallucinations and hearing voices and had asked his parents to take him to a doctor. In response, his dad gave him pills and told him to “suck it up,” and his mom laughed at him, according to the texts.
Days later, when the school notified them that Ethan had been searching online for ammo on his phone, Jennifer Crumbley texted her son: “LOL I’m not mad at you. You have to learn not to get caught,” according to prosecutors.
Finally, on the morning of the shooting, a teacher found a drawing from Ethan showing a gun and a person bleeding along with the phrases, “the thoughts won’t stop help me,” “blood everywhere” and “my life is useless.” His parents were called into school for a meeting, but they did not inform the school Ethan had access to a gun and declined to take him out of classes for the day.
Shortly after, Ethan took the gun out of his backpack and opened fire.
His parents have been held in jail since they were arrested on manslaughter charges days after the shooting.
There have been several other cases in which parents were charged for shootings carried out by their children, though not one in a school mass shooting.
For example, the father of the July 4 mass shooter in the Chicago suburb of Highland Park, Illinois, was accused of wrongdoing for signing his son’s application for an Illinois Firearm Owners Identification card months after his son displayed concerning behavior. The father, Robert Crimo Jr., ultimately pleaded guilty to misdemeanor reckless conduct charges and agreed to serve 60 days in jail.
In a similar vein, the mother of a 6-year-old boy who shot his teacher at a Virginia school last year faced charges. The boy’s mother ultimately pleaded guilty to a state child neglect charge and felony charges of unlawful use of a controlled substance while possessing a firearm and making a false statement while purchasing a firearm.

Frank Vandervort, clinical professor of law at the University of Michigan Law School, said parents can be held responsible for their children’s actions, such as for truancy. But the level of severity in the case of the Crumbleys is different.
“We do impose on parents certain obligations regarding their children, to say you have a heightened degree of responsibility for what happens when your kids do things. That’s generally in the law,” he said. “The severity of the charges, I think, are what’s unique here.”
Could these cases set a new precedent for parents?
In a written opinion filed last March, a panel of judges for the state’s appellate court acknowledged the possible precedent-setting nature of these cases but called the situation unique and unusual.
“We share defendants’ concern about the potential for this decision to be applied in the future to parents whose situation viz-a-viz their child’s intentional conduct is not as closely tied together, and/or the warning signs and evidence were not as substantial as they are here,” wrote the panel.
The opinion said those concerns are “significantly diminished” by the fact that Ethan Crumbley’s actions “were reasonably foreseeable, and that is the ultimate test that must be applied.”
Vandervort similarly said he believed these cases were so unusual and uncommon that the impact would be limited.
“I don’t anticipate there’s going to be a lot of this kind of thing filed. I think this is a pretty unique case,” he said. “It’s hard to talk about shootings by teenagers as being run of the mill. Unless you’ve got really unusual factual situations, I don’t anticipate a lot of parents getting charged.”
Even so, Joey Jackson, a CNN legal analyst, said the prosecution’s broad goal in bringing these cases was to deter other parents.
“They want to deter other parents from being negligent,” he said. “They want to make sure we have diligent parents who don’t put their kids in a position where they can gain access to firearms easily.”

By running ads for “free” tax services that many customers were not qualified for, the tax filing software violated the FTC Act and deceived consumers, the agency said.
The FTC had first sued Intuit, TurboTax’s owner, for its deceptive advertising in 2022. The FTC staff alleged most tax filers couldn’t use the company’s “free” services — “such as those who get a 1099 form for work in the gig economy, or those who earn farm income.” TurboTax advertising their products as free misled those customers, according to the FTC.
The FTC Administrative Law Judge D. Michael Chappell announced the initial decision in September, which the commission upheld Monday. Intuit had appealed to the FTC as part of the process.
In a statement Monday, Intuit said it has appealed “this deeply flawed decision” to federal circuit court outside of the FTC.
“Absolutely no one should be surprised that FTC Commissioners — employees of the FTC — ruled in favor of the FTC as they have done in every appeal for the last two decades. This decision is the result of a biased and broken system where the Commission serves as accuser, judge, jury, and then appellate judge all in the same case,” an an Intuit spokesperson said.
Intuit cannot advertise or market any goods or services as free unless it’s free for all customers, the FTC ordered.
It could also clearly disclose the percentage of customers that actually do qualify for the free service, somewhere close to the “free” claim advertised, the commission said. The FTC added if the service isn’t actually free for the majority of consumers, TurboTax could state that as well.
The FTC ordered Intuit to “disclose clearly and conspicuously all the terms, conditions, and obligations that are required in order to obtain the ‘free’ good or service.”
“The order also prohibits Intuit from misrepresenting any material facts about its products or services such as the price, refund policies or consumers’ ability to claim a tax credit or deduction or to file their taxes online accurately without using TurboTax’s paid service,” the release from the FTC said.
Last May, roughly 4.4 million people were to receive checks from TurboTax, following a 50-state settlement with parent company Intuit for allegedly steering millions of low-income Americans away from free tax-filing services.
The investigation opened after a 2019 ProPublica report that accused the company of steering eligible clients away from federally supported tax filing products by making them difficult to find in web searches — instead directing them toward the paid version of the company’s filing services.
Most customers will get about $30, with some customers that used TurboTax for three consecutive years getting up to $85. A website has also been set up for more information.
“TurboTax’s predatory and deceptive marketing cheated millions of low-income Americans who were trying to fulfill their legal duties to file their taxes,” said New York Attorney General Letitia James in a May 4, 2023, press release. “Today we are righting that wrong and putting money back into the pockets of hardworking taxpayers who should have never paid to file their taxes.”

Hockney, 86, painted “California,” showing two naked figures in an outdoor swimming pool, in 1965 after his first trip to Los Angeles and it has been held in a private collection since 1968.
The painting, last seen in public in 1979, is a highlight of auction house Christie’s “20th/21st Century: London Evening Sale” on March 7. It is listed with “a price on request,” with an estimate in the region of £16 million ($20.37 million).
“This is one of the earliest examples (of Hockney’s pool paintings),” Tessa Lord, a senior specialist and director of the post-war contemporary department at Christie’s London, told Reuters at a press preview on Thursday.
In 2018, Hockney’s 1972 piece “Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)” sold for $90.3 million, setting a then record for the highest price ever paid at auction for a work by a living artist.
“There is a lot of crossover between the two works but also we’ve seen since that world record price in 2018 a real broadening of the market for David Hockney,” Lord said.

“We have sold works from the Paul Allen estate over the past few years, which in particular shone a light on his later practice, his landscapes and what we’re coming to feel is a real international recognition amongst collectors of Hockney’s contribution to 20th and 21st century art, and a real drive to seek out the best examples of his practice.”
“California” will go on a touring exhibition to Paris and New York next month before returning to London to go on public view before the sale."
5EKWNPQ573_DNBLGESWO7GQHIY,Trump comes out against draft RNC resolution from supporter declaring him presumptive nominee,"By Daniel Strauss, Kristen Holmes and Kaitlan Collins, CNN","4 minute read Updated 8:57 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/25/politics/rnc-trump-presumptive-nominee-resolution/,"A Republican National Committee draft resolution that would have formally declared Donald Trump the Republican Party’s 2024 presumptive nominee was withdrawn Thursday amid pushback from the former president.
David Bossie, the RNC committeeman from Maryland who recently endorsed Trump and introduced the resolution, withdrew it, according to two sources familiar with the matter.
The Trump campaign had initially approved going forward with the resolution and the former president himself was also on board until a backlash began, a source familiar told CNN.
Trump said on his social media platform Thursday that the RNC should not move forward with the resolution, saying he appreciated the effort but was opposing it “for the sake of Party unity” and wanted to “finish the process off AT THE BALLOT BOX.”
His statement came amid concerns from Trump allies that the resolution could anger Republicans because of the perception that Trump was trying to stack the deck against former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, a source close to the former president said.
While the former president would have still needed to reach the delegate requirements necessary to win the nomination, if the resolution had been approved and the RNC had shifted to a general election mode, he would have access to the RNC’s data operation, benefit from fundraising with the RNC, and have the support of all of the committee’s ground operations. It would also have meant the committee would have been supporting Trump and effectively opposing Haley – an unprecedented break from the party’s past approach to the nominating process.

The resolution, which was being reviewed by the RNC earlier Thursday, was first reported by The Dispatch on Thursday. A draft copy of the resolution was obtained independently by CNN.
“RESOLVED that the Republican National Committee hereby declares President Trump as our presumptive 2024 nominee for the office of President of the United States and from this moment forward moves into full general election mode welcoming supporters of all candidates as valued members of Team Trump 2024,” the resolution reads.
An RNC spokesperson said in a statement earlier Thursday that this resolution was still just a resolution and not the stance of the committee.
“Resolutions, such as this one, are brought forward by members of the RNC. Chairwoman McDaniel doesn’t offer resolutions,” communications director Keith Schipper said in the statement. “This will be taken up by the Resolutions Committee and they will decide whether to send this resolution to be voted on by the 168 RNC members at our annual meeting next week.”
The Haley campaign brushed off the resolution and said GOP Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel should organize a debate ahead of the South Carolina primary at the end of February.
“Who cares what the RNC says? We’ll let millions of Republican voters across the country decide who should be our party’s nominee, not a bunch of Washington insiders,” Haley spokeswoman Olivia Perez-Cubas said in a statement. “If Ronna McDaniel wants to be helpful she can organize a debate in South Carolina, unless she’s also worried that Trump can’t handle being on the stage for 90 minutes with Nikki Haley.”
But her campaign was soon fundraising off of the draft resolution. “The RNC is leveraging the establishment to try and crown Trump the presumptive nominee,” Haley wrote in a fundraising email. “Well I have news for them: I’m in this to win it and I’m not going anywhere.”
The resolution comes just a few days after Trump defeated Haley in New Hampshire by more than 30,000 votes, following his decisive win in the Iowa caucuses. Those victories have led many prominent figures in the Republican Party to coalesce around Trump and call on Haley to exit the race. Earlier this week, McDaniel told Fox News, “We need to unite around our eventual nominee, which is Donald Trump.”
Current RNC rules require Trump to secure 1,215 delegates to officially become the party’s nominee. As of Thursday, CNN estimates Trump has 32 delegates while Haley has 17.
Some RNC members were discussing the resolution during a conference call Wednesday night, according to a Republican with knowledge of that call.

The most significant national threat to reproductive rights is not a looming Supreme Court judgment or a bill being considered by Congress. It’s already here, in the form of an extant but long dormant law from 1873 that could ban abortion nationwide: the Comstock Act. The act is named after Anthony Comstock, an anti-vice crusader from the late 1800s who used his power as a special agent of the US Postal Service to enforce his beliefs about sex and propriety. He was able to persuade Congress to pass laws against “indecent or immoral” materials, including broad definitions of contraception, pornography and abortion.
Some antiabortion advocates are interpreting this law, which remained on the books during the half century that Roe v. Wade was in force, to ban mailing anything that induces an abortion. Because virtually everything used for an abortion — from abortion pills, to the instruments for abortion procedures, to clinic supplies — gets mailed to providers in some form, this interpretation of the Comstock Act could mean a nationwide ban on all abortions, even in states where it remains legal.
The Comstock Act must be repealed, and in our view, that process needs to begin this year. As tempting as it is to ignore this law, allowing it to remain on the books is too dangerous, and the stakes are too high.
Related video Jessica Valenti on the impact of abortion bans post-Roe
The Comstock Act has long been considered a relic of history and a symbol of outdated, discriminatory beliefs. The Act had already fallen into disuse by the late 1930s and was presumed unconstitutional after the Supreme Court found a constitutional right to contraception and abortion. However, in 1971, before Roe v. Wade was decided, Congress deleted the Comstock provisions related to contraception. It left untouched the provisions on abortion, including a ban on mailing through interstate commerce “every article or thing designed, adapted, or intended for producing abortion, or for any indecent or immoral use.” This language applies to the US Postal Service as well as express carriers, such as UPS or FedEx.
The act, however, has not been enforced against abortion provision in almost 100 years. And when it was enforced in the early 1900s, federal appeals courts had read the language of the law very narrowly to apply only to illegal abortions. This interpretation was necessary for many reasons, but one of the most obvious was that the act, by its terms and contrary to pre-Roe standards, doesn’t contain an exception to save a pregnant person’s life. The Department of Justice reinforced that narrow interpretation in 2022.
But antiabortion activists, emboldened after the demise of Roe, have a new interpretation that contradicts this almost-century worth of precedent: The law is as broad and as strict as its plain terms would indicate. And, in effect, interpreting Comstock this way would solve the problem of a divided Congress that won’t pass a nationwide abortion ban. They have set forth this new interpretation in litigation, local ordinances, threatening letters by state legislators and attorneys general, media statements and plans for a Republican administration in 2025.
For now, the current Department of Justice will not enforce the Comstock Act. As long as a Democrat sits in the White House, the law will remain in the dustbin of history. But a future Republican administration could exhume the law and make enforcing Comstock a top priority. Even worse, given that the Act has a five-year statute of limitations, an antiabortion administration could not only prosecute people for violations that occur in the future, but also for any violations occurring right now. Current abortion providers targeted under this interpretation would try to make arguments about due process and entrapment, but they’d have to raise those arguments in court after being prosecuted, a precarious position.
Related article Opinion: How Republicans intend to bounce back from devastating losses on abortion
With this potential threat, the Comstock Act is too dangerous to stay on the books and remain unchallenged or in the shadows. We need a repeal bill now.
We concede that the questions of when and how to go about repealing Comstock involve complex strategic considerations. It is reasonable to worry that a repeal bill would draw even more attention to the Comstock Act and inadvertently confer legitimacy on the broad antiabortion interpretation. Moreover, courts might view a failed repeal effort—and given the current Congress, failure is likely—as evidence that Congress believes the Comstock Act is good law and applies to all abortion, not just illegal abortions. It’s true that courts sometimes look to this subsequent legislative history to interpret laws, though doing so is generally disfavored for good reasons.
These concerns are real but should be evaluated alongside other strategic considerations. Most notably, as already described, antiabortion extremists are already hard at work pushing their interpretation of the Act into the mainstream discourse. Ignoring those strategies will not stop them from gaining momentum unless those in power call out the severe (and absurd) consequences of enforcing this law.
And antiabortion judges wouldn’t need a failed repeal attempt to achieve the outcome they want. They can and will rely on Comstock’s current text whether Congress tries to repeal the law or not. Federal courts in Texas and the Fifth Circuit of the US Court of Appeals have already accepted the antiabortion interpretation without a whisper of Congressional action to repeal the Act. And there are ways to mitigate the risks of a failed repeal bill. The bill could include ample language in the preamble or purpose section that explicitly rejects any endorsement of the broad, antiabortion interpretation of Comstock.
The risks of a repeal effort also need to be balanced against the benefits. We are not naive enough to think the repeal law will pass in this Congress given the Republican-controlled House and lack of a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate. Nonetheless, there is much to be gained in introducing a repeal bill that forces every federal legislator to take a public position on Comstock.

With a repeal bill on the table, representatives would have to state publicly whether they defend a law written at a time when women couldn’t vote, couldn’t say no to their husbands’ sexual advances, were barred from most professions (including the legal profession), and had their legal identity disappear upon marriage. They should be forced to say whether they support banning not only abortion-inducing items but also lingerie and sex toys and any other items that could be put to “indecent or immoral use.” And perhaps most forcefully, they should look their constituents in the eyes when they explain that, with Comstock still on the books for an antiabortion Department of Justice to enforce, there will likely be nowhere for them to go when they need an abortion resulting from pregnancy complications, inevitable miscarriage, fetal anomaly, rape, incest or unwanted pregnancy.
Again, the Comstock Act has no exceptions and applies nationwide. Everyone implicated by the act, even pregnant people, are subject to punishment, and the penalties for violating the act are steep: federal prison time and fines.
It’s time for legislators who support abortion rights to take control of the conversation — to force their colleagues to say the quiet part out loud and to vocalize their support for these draconian laws. And even if a repeal effort fails, making Comstock an issue now might influence voters to choose a president and other politicians in November who do not want Anthony Comstock’s moral judgments, from a bygone era, governing our modern life."

Radnor married clinical psychologist Jordana Jacobs earlier this month in an outdoor wedding ceremony, much to the chagrin of their chilly guests.
“I got married! Two weeks ago. In a *light* blizzard. It was an incredible overwhelming snowy bliss-filled weekend,” Radnor wrote on his Instagram page on Sunday, showcasing photos from their big day.
The actor and Jacobs wed in front of 164 guests at Cedar Lakes Estate in Port Jervis, New York, according to the New York Times.
The pair met at a meditation ceremony in 2022, during a psychedelic trip, according to the article. Radnor proposed during a trip to Joshua Tree National Park.
Radnor told the newspaper that their very snowy wedding night was both “cold and anxiety-producing, but also cosmic and divine.”
Part of what may have added to that anxiety was that the weather conditions were so intense, that all of the wedding guests and vendors were forced to spend the night at the venue due to unsafe driving conditions.
Still, Radnor calls himself a lucky guy.
“I can’t believe my great good fortune that I get to call this extraordinary woman my wife,” Radnor wrote in his post on Sunday.

Bennett will not cooperate in any other case as a condition of his plea, Findling said.
According to the indictment against him, Bennett was associated with a faction of The Bloods street gang. Prosecutors allege the particular faction Bennett was associated with had come into conflict with the YSL gang, which stands for Young Stoner Life or Young Slime Life.
A number of alleged YSL members, including Grammy-winning rapper Young Thug, are also currently on trial facing racketeering and murder charges.
Prosecutors also alleged members of YSL had discussed getting Young Thug’s permission to kill Bennett, CNN previously reported."

Unofficial returns at time of publication have the former president at about 55% of the vote to Nikki Haley’s 43%. Not only does Trump’s win make him the prohibitive favorite for the GOP nomination, but it leaves Haley with an unclear road map heading forward.
Indeed, in a number of ways, Trump’s New Hampshire triumph puts him on a GOP primary tier few, if any, Republicans have reached.
Let’s start off with Trump’s share of the vote. He’s only the second nonincumbent Republican to win a majority of the GOP primary vote in New Hampshire in the modern era. The only other was Ronald Reagan in 1980, and Trump’s 55% surpasses Reagan’s 50.2%.
Trump’s big vote share isn’t the only way we know New Hampshire Republicans love him. He is also just the second nonincumbent Republican to win the New Hampshire primary twice in the modern era. The other Republican was John McCain – a name synonymous with success in the first-in-the-nation primary.
Trump’s win comes on the back of his dominant victory in the Iowa caucuses, where he became the first nonincumbent Republican to earn a majority of the vote in the modern era.
Putting aside his wide victory margins, the fact that Trump was able to win both Iowa and New Hampshire is quite unusual. No other nonincumbent Republican has ever done it. Mitt Romney in 2012 came the closest (winning New Hampshire but losing Iowa by 24 votes) – and he took less than 40% in New Hampshire and under 25% of the vote in Iowa.
Related article Five takeaways from the New Hampshire primary
Trump’s ability to win Iowa and New Hampshire with such ease tells you how strong his candidacy is among Republicans. He appeals to different parts of the party, as evidenced by the fact that he succeeded in two very different contests in two fairly different states.
Iowa is a low turnout caucus that engages most with core party activists. New Hampshire is a primary, which sees relatively high turnout. Whereas New Hampshire openly invites registered independents (or undeclared voters) to cast a ballot, Iowa’s caucuses have few non-Republicans taking part.
Moreover, Iowa is a contest dominated by conservatives and evangelical Christians. New Hampshire voters are more moderate and far less religious. New Hampshire’s electorate is wealthier than Iowa’s, as well.
Put another way, New Hampshire should have been a far worse state for Trump. His biggest backers look a lot more like the Iowa electorate than New Hampshire voters: conservatives, religious Republicans and Republicans of more modest financial means.
None of that stopped Trump from pulling in the largest share of the vote for an nonincumbent in New Hampshire GOP primary history.
All of this, of course, is bad news for Haley. The former South Carolina governor, who insisted Tuesday she was staying in the race, is strongest among voters who can be found in disproportionately large quantities in New Hampshire compared with other primary and caucus states.
The polling in South Carolina, the next major contest to see Haley and Trump on the same ballot, is not good for Haley, despite it being her home state. Trump is again pulling in a majority of the vote, well ahead of Haley, and this polling was done before he won Iowa and New Hampshire.
The national polling has Trump ahead of Haley by more than 50 points. No nonincumbent Republican has ever been ahead of his nearest rival by more than 50 points in the immediate aftermath of both Iowa and New Hampshire.
Indeed, at this point, Trump does not appear to be trailing in any state, according to the polls. He’s even well ahead in Vermont, which should be one of Haley’s best states because it has an even less conservative GOP electorate than New Hampshire.
It seems quite plausible at this point that Trump may pull off the ultimate historic GOP primary win: becoming the first nonincumbent Republican to go undefeated in all 50 states during the primary season."

The ex-president is trying to intimidate Nikki Haley into abandoning the GOP presidential race. He’s warning donors who contribute to the former South Carolina governor they’ll be ostracized. Trump’s supporters launched a bid to jolt the Republican National Committee to anoint him presumptive nominee after only two nominating races — until Trump backtracked amid concern from his allies it could backfire.
And the 45th president is now pressuring GOP members of Congress to kill an immigration deal to deprive President Joe Biden of a victory and to ensure he can exploit the border crisis on the campaign trail. Trump has also been browbeating former opponents and key decision makers in the GOP to quickly endorse him as he forces the party to genuflect before him as he did during four years in the White House.

Trump’s brisk assertion of his growing power as the likely nominee is a characteristic dismantling of constraints that echoes his behavior in office. He was twice impeached in his single term, which ended after he tried to overturn an election in which voters ejected him from office. It is consistent with Trump’s self-created persona as the strongest person in every room that sustained him through a life in business, reality television and as an ex-president.
Among Trump’s critics, his behavior is stirring fresh concerns that his potential second term could mean a dawn of autocracy in the Oval Office. And Trump’s desire to pressure Haley out of the race after only two contests – while he leads in the delegate count 32 to 17, out of the 1,215 needed for the GOP crown – is consistent with his disrespect for democratic processes.
The former president is not hiding his intent. He has frequently warned, for instance, that he would dedicate a second term to exacting “retribution” on his enemies. Almost every day he demands full criminal immunity for presidents, partly as an effort to avoid prosecution for his attempt to overturn the 2020 election but also to permit him to behave exactly as he pleases in a possible second term with no risk of consequences.
In a rally Saturday night in Manchester, New Hampshire, that pulsated with aggressive imagery, the ex-president praised Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán as a “great man.” Orbán has methodically eroded political freedoms, cracked down on the independent press, and discredited the electoral system, the courts and alternative sources of power. He’s regarded by many “Make America Great Again” supporters as a hero and a model. “Some people don’t like him because he’s too strong. It’s good to have a strong man at the head of a country,” Trump reflected. His comments cemented an impression that Orbán may be a better prototype for the authoritarian leader that the ex-president would like to become than the extreme 1930s European dictators to which his recent rhetoric, toward immigrants especially, has drawn comparisons.
The former president’s autocratic instincts are one reason why the coming election promises to be one of the most fateful in modern American history.
But there are also risks for Trump in his truculent approach. By throwing his weight around he could confirm Biden’s arguments that he’d endanger democracy if elected to a second term in November. And the bullying approach and sexist language he’s using toward Haley could alienate some of the more moderate, independent, suburban voters that she’s attracting in the GOP primary. These are exactly the kinds of voters that Trump alienated in his 2020 defeat. If he’s to win another term, he must at least mitigate his deficit to Biden among this group in November.
Katon Dawson, a former chairman of the South Carolina GOP, noted the potential consequences of Trump’s behavior in an interview with Kasie Hunt on “State of the Race” on CNN International and CNN Max on Thursday. Dawson, one of the few Palmetto State GOP heavyweights supporting Haley, warned that Trump would “polarize” women in South Carolina with his “seedy little comments about what Nikki had on.” He added: “Donald Trump is running more like he wants to be the President of Cuba instead of the President of the United States.”
Haley might not have beaten Trump in Iowa or New Hampshire. But she provoked him by refusing to quickly fold her campaign and endorse him like other GOP candidates, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott. Trump’s fury was revealed in a self-absorbed victory speech in New Hampshire on Tuesday night. Haley’s mockery of that performance has infuriated the former president even more.
“We did our thing and we said what we had to say and then Donald Trump got out there and just threw a temper tantrum,” Haley said in Charleston on Wednesday. “He pitched a fit. He was insulting. He was doing what he does, but I know that’s what he does when he’s insecure.”
Trump has appeared deeply frustrated that Haley is defying his calls for her to leave the race, CNN’s Kaitlan Collins has reported. During his New Hampshire speech, he mocked the dress she wore on caucus night in Iowa. He has been calling her “birdbrain” on social media. Trump has also warned that anyone who makes a financial contribution to her will be “barred from the MAGA camp” – which Haley has turned around into a fundraising pitch for her campaign.

It is not surprising that there have been calls for Haley to end her campaign, given the size of her defeats to Trump and the fact that New Hampshire, where independents can vote in the GOP primary, was her best shot at a win. Parties generally like to consolidate quickly behind a nominee to look ahead to a general election once the destiny of the primary race becomes obvious. But the disdain toward Haley from Trump world is remarkable.
For instance, even before all the polls had closed on Tuesday night, Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, one of Trump’s top supporters, issued a statement saying Haley’s campaign “must end” after the ex-president’s “monumental” victory “for the sake of the republic.” The history of past campaigns suggests that restraint and respect might be more effective in prodding Haley out of the race than threats. And while her prospects appear grim, the idea that a candidate should abandon a campaign after just two contests in a nationwide primary season just because the front-runner says so is in itself an affront to a democratic process.
Even Trump seems to have been convinced some of this has gone too far. The former president on Thursday came out against an RNC draft resolution that would have declared him the presumptive nominee — a move that would have allowed him access to the RNC’s data and fundraising operation. It would have essentially joined the party’s forces with Trump while an election involving a rival was still taking place.
But Trump wrote on Truth Social that while he appreciated the RNC’s “respect and devotion,” he wanted to win the “old fashioned way,” at the ballot box. While the campaign had initially approved of the resolution and Trump himself was on board, that changed when a backlash ensued, a source familiar told Collins. The resolution was withdrawn later Thursday.
The former president, whose business career was mythologized in “The Art of the Deal,” is more concerned currently with the art of killing a deal – one being painfully pieced together by Republican and Democratic senators to address a southern border crisis. Trump has been lobbying Republicans in both private conversations and public statements on social media to oppose the deal because he wants to campaign on the issue this year and ensure Biden doesn’t get a legislative victory that could ease pressure at the border and help his reelection, sources said.
Related article GOP senators seethe as Trump blows up delicate immigration compromise
Trump’s maneuvering has infuriated some GOP senators looking for a deliverable for their voters at a moment when Biden appears willing to accept the return of some hardline Trump-era immigration policies in a compromise. Republican Sen. Todd Young of Indiana called any efforts to disrupt the ongoing negotiations “tragic.” Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, a frequent Trump antagonist who’s not running for reelection, said that if Trump sabotaged the deal just to blame Biden, it would be “appalling.” Trump and his acolytes on Capitol Hill have also made clear their opposition to Biden’s latest $60 billion aid package for Ukraine, which is running out of bullets and ammunition.
Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, who has been heavily involved in both the immigration and Ukraine discussions, raised concerns that the looming shadow of one man – who doesn’t currently hold any governing role – could overwhelm a branch of the US government.
“I hope we don’t live in a world today in which one person inside the Republican Party holds so much power that they could stop a bipartisan bill to try to give the president additional power at the border to make more sense of our immigration policy,” Murphy told CNN’s Manu Raju.
“I would hope that one person isn’t so powerful inside the Republican Party to hand Ukraine to Vladimir Putin, but we’ll find out the answer to that.”"

The freezing rain is being made possible by a large push of milder air slowly starting to overspread much of the winter-weary US.
A barrage of back-to-back winter storms this month have left at least 90 people dead in 13 states as severe conditions have left people crushed under fallen trees, trapped in tornadoes or tangled in snowy car accidents. Tennessee has experienced the brunt of the fatalities, with 34 storm-related deaths.
Now people from the southern Plains to the Great Lakes are seeing accumulating ice and freezing rain Monday. Weather officials and several local transportation departments have warned drivers to exercise caution – or stay off the roads entirely.
“Icy roads will make driving hazardous. Use extra caution and drive slowly!” the Weather Prediction Center said.
Morning commuters in parts of Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas discovered slick sidewalks and icy roadways Monday. At least a glaze of ice was reported in each state, according to National Weather Service data.
Even small amounts of ice are enough to cause significant issues on untreated, paved surfaces like roads and sidewalks. Areas that receive greater amounts of ice are more likely to endure tree damage and power outages.
Several school districts across the region have canceled classes Monday, including in Tennessee, Missouri, Arkansas and Oklahoma.
Meanwhile, parts of eastern Texas and the Lower Mississippi Valley have been showered with rain and thunderstorms as a wave of warm air engulfs the region. Unseasonably warm air will go on to overrun more of the US as the week progresses.
Moisture from the Gulf of Mexico began pushing northward over the weekend and into Monday, colliding with the cold air still hovering over parts of the central US to create ice and freezing rain conditions over the Plains and Midwest.
More than 50 million people from Arkansas to the Great Lakes are under winter weather alerts Monday, prompting road hazard warnings in several states.

Ice began to build up on bridges and overpasses in the area Sunday night, the weather service in Tulsa said in a forecast message. The forecasters warned drivers to use “extreme caution” if they have to travel and leave ample distance for stopping.
“Please slow down and use caution as rain may freeze to your vehicle while driving and roads that appear wet may actually be icy!” the Tulsa weather service said in a post.
In Missouri, videos on social media showed cars losing control traveling down an ice-covered hill. Elsewhere in the state, emergency responders literally spun out in any icy development.
Air travel was also hampered by the icy conditions. By Monday afternoon at least 850 flights were canceled in the US with more than 3,300 delayed. Cancellations jumped early Monday for Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport and the St. Louis Lambert International Airport due to freezing rain in the vicinity of each airport.
In Memphis, Tennessee, cold temperatures caused water mains to break, leaving thousands with their service interrupted over the weekend, Memphis Light, Gas, and Water CEO Doug McGowen said Sunday. Most should have their service restored by Monday, and a boil water advisory could be lifted by Thursday, McGowen said.
Separate from the early-week ice, brutal winter cold triggered time-sensitive rescues in Vermont. Twenty-three skiers and snowboarders were rescued after getting lost Saturday in the backcountry, according to the Killington Police Department, which deployed a team that “hiked, snowshoed and skinned approximately 5 miles, in frigid temperatures” to guide them to safety.
Significantly above-average temperatures will spread across the East by later in the week as a series of fronts and low-pressure systems usher in warmer air and tropical moisture.
After shivering through a frigid weekend, some cities will see daily high temperatures soar by nearly 30 degrees in the coming days.
Daily high temperatures across the region will tick up a few degrees each day through midweek before some of the warmest air arrives Thursday.
Thursday’s highs are set to hit the upper 60s and 70s in the Southeast and the 50s as far north as New York. More than 140 records for warmest daily lows could be broken by Friday in parts of the Southeast, where overnight lows will soar into the 60s.
The significant warm-up will not be confined only to the East. A large swath of the central US will also finally recover from the bone-chilling cold that persisted much of January.
“Temperatures thaw out this week & will stay well above normal through the end of January,” the weather service office in the Twin Cities posted on X, later adding a future of near-record highs “certainly looks possible, stay tuned!”
Though the rush of warm air will shake off the arctic blast that dominated much of the country’s weather through the weekend, it could usher in hazardous rain and flooding.
Heavy rain will bring a threat of flooding along the Gulf Coast and western portions of the Southeast until late in the week.
Approximately 37 million people across the affected areas are under threat of flash flooding and excessive rainfall through Thursday morning. As many as 5 to 6 inches of rain could fall by the end of the week, with some areas seeing even more.
Here’s a glimpse of where the heaviest rainfall is expected across the South through throughout the week:
• Monday – eastern Texas, western Louisiana and southwestern Arkansas• Tuesday – eastern Texas to Mississippi and southwestern Tennessee• Wednesday – Texas-Louisiana border to central Tennessee and northern Alabama• Thursday to Friday morning – Eastern Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama to the far western corner of North Carolina
Some areas will be under a Level 2 of 4 risk of excessive rainfall for several days in a row.

5PXTXBRPG2_M2FRXWOIIQKUXYO,Stanley and other drink cups contain lead. Should you be worried?,"By Madeline Holcombe and Sandee LaMotte, CNN","5 minute read Published 4:27 PM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/26/health/stanley-cups-lead-wellness/,"First, Stanley cups were all over social media because so many people wanted them. Now, the oversize tumblers are back in the spotlight over fears they may contain lead.
Videos on social media sites such as TikTok show people breaking out a lead testing kit and trying it on their Stanley cups and other travel flasks.
It’s true: There is some lead sealed within the base of some brands of travel drinking cups — including the wildly popular brand Stanley.
Lead is used as part of the tumbler’s vacuum insulation and is covered by a stainless steel layer that protects consumers from lead exposure, according to the Stanley cup manufacturer, Pacific Market International.
“Our manufacturing process currently employs the use of an industry standard pellet to seal the vacuum insulation at the base of our products; the sealing material includes some lead,” a Stanley spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “Once sealed, this area is covered with a durable stainless steel layer, making it inaccessible to consumers.”
“Rest assured that no lead is present on the surface of any Stanley product that comes into contact with the consumer nor the contents of the product,” the statement said.
But people on social media are nervous, considering the dangers of any exposure to lead. The toxic metal can lead to kidney problems, anemia, reproductive issues and developmental problems, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And Stanley cups are everywhere.
The tumblers, which come in a rainbow of colors and hold up to 40 ounces of water while still fitting in a car cup holder, have become both a status symbol and a wellness essential for those who ascribe to the “clean girl” beauty trends of hydrated, natural skin.
Stanley cups are in the hands of beauty bloggers, the cars of parents at school pickup, and even on the Christmas lists of many kids this past year. Some parents have reported their children were bullied by peers if they came to school with any other brand of cup.

Some caution is warranted, said Jane Houlihan, research director for Healthy Babies, Bright Futures, an alliance of nonprofits, scientists and donors with a stated mission of reducing babies’ exposures to neurotoxic chemicals.
“If the cup stays intact, there’s likely no lead exposure risk for consumers. But if that bottom seal comes off, all bets are off,” Houlihan said.
“Lead is so toxic you just can’t take chances with it,” she said in an email. “If a company has to rely on their product remaining perfectly intact in order for it to be safe, that company has a basic material safety problem that they are passing on to their customers.”
If the base cap of a Stanley cup does come off and exposes the seal, which is rare, the cup is eligible for replacement under the lifetime warranty, according to a statement from Stanley.
It’s not just the Stanley brand that utilizes lead. Other brands have been subject to recall over their use of the material, according to the US Consumer Product Safety Commission.
In November, the federal agency announced the recall of about 84,000 Tiblue Stainless Steel Children’s Cups and 3,600 Klickpick Home Children’s Cup Sets sold on Amazon due to “an accessible solder bead with levels of lead that exceed the federal lead content ban.”
Earlier that month, some 1,600 PandaEar and 200 Laoion stainless steel children’s cups sold on Amazon were recalled for the same reasons, according to the CPSC website.
And in July of last year, around 346,000 Cupkin stainless steel children’s cups were recalled by the manufacturer because they contained levels of lead that exceeded the federal lead content ban of 100 parts per million. (For water, the action level is 15 parts per billion, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency.)
“In general CPSC has strict regulations on lead in the content, especially for children’s products. We have issued several recalls for lead in children’s products,” said CPSC Press Secretary Patty Davis.
“And we encourage consumers to report if they’re concerned about a safety hazard with a product to tell us about it at our website, which is http://www.saferproducts.gov/,” Davis said.
Why would lead be found in a drinking cup at all?
“Using lead to solder is a very old manufacturing practice, which had been quite common,” said Olga Naidenko, vice president of science investigations at the Washington, DC-based Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization “dedicated to protecting human health and the environment.”
“In insulated cups, lead was used in solder that seals the vacuum between the inner and the outer layer of a cup,” she said via email. “Many manufacturers are now stating that they are using alternatives to lead for sealing vacuum in those types of cups.”
Any potential lead exposure is unacceptable, and companies should move to make these products without lead, Naidenko added.
There is no safe level of lead for children, according to the US Consumer Product and Safety Commission. “Even low levels of lead in blood have been shown to affect learning, ability to pay attention, and academic achievement,” the CDC said.
Lead “bio-accumulates” in the body, which means it stays and builds up over time, so ongoing exposure, even at extremely low levels, can become toxic. Children, especially fetuses and infants are the most vulnerable, says the Environmental Protection Agency, because it takes very little lead exposure to damage a child compared with an adult.

“A dose of lead that would have little effect on an adult can have a significant effect on a child. In children, low levels of exposure have been linked to damage to the central and peripheral nervous system, learning disabilities, shorter stature, impaired hearing, and impaired formation and function of blood cells,” the EPA states on its website.
The main source of lead exposure in the United States comes from inhaling dust or eating particles contaminated by paint chips. That’s because lead was a common additive in house paint, gasoline and many other materials for years before its toxicity was known.
Between 10% and 20% of our exposure to lead comes from contaminated water, according to experts. It’s even worse for the youngest and most vulnerable: Babies can get between 40% and 60% of their exposure to lead by drinking formula mixed with contaminated water.
Many experts suggest that parents get their child’s lead level tested at ages 1 and 2, and possibly more often, depending on the area of the country. The test is easily done by a pediatrician, or at a local state, county or city department of health."
5QWV2N12C1_7XVS7K0BXZB1KID,Alaska Airlines CEO says company found loose bolts on ‘many’ Boeing Max 9s,"By Ramishah Maruf, Pete Muntean and Gregory Wallace, CNN","3 minute read Updated 8:50 PM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/23/business/alaska-airlines-ceo-boeing-max-9-loose-bolts/,"Alaska Airlines CEO Ben Minicucci revealed the carrier found “some loose bolts on many” Boeing 737 Max 9s in an interview for “NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt” on Tuesday.
It was the CEO’s first interview since a door plug on one of its Max 9 airplanes shot out from the side of the fuselage only a few minutes into a flight from Portland, Oregon, to Ontario, California, forcing the pilot to make an emergency landing.
“I’m more than frustrated and disappointed. I am angry. This happened to Alaska Airlines. It happened to our guests and happened to our people,” Minicucci said, according to excerpts released ahead of the interview’s airing.
“Boeing is better than this. Flight 1282 should never have happened,” Minicucci said during the interview.
Boeing’s 737 factory will have what the company calls a “quality stand down” at its Renton, Washington facility Thursday, the company announced Tuesday.
“During the session, production, delivery and support teams will pause for a day so employees can take part in working sessions focused on quality. This is part of the immediate quality actions recently shared by Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stan Deal,” the company said in a statement.
The internal notice Boeing sent to its employees indicates that the 737 stand down is the first of several that it will hold at its facilities.
NBC asked Minicucci if Boeing has a problem with quality control extending beyond a single plane.
“I think this is the issue that’s at question right here, which is what is Boeing going to do differently on their quality program, to make sure that when we get an airplane, it’s at the highest degree of excellence and that’s what’s got to be different going forward,” he said.
He added that the company is adding its own extra oversight on the airplane maker’s production line.
The US Federal Aviation Administration urged airlines on Sunday to inspect so-called door plugs on an earlier version of Boeing 737 airplanes. After recent inspections of the newer Max 9s, United Airlines and Alaska Airlines have found loose bolts.
FAA opened a formal investigation into Boeing’s quality control around two weeks ago. The agency said it continued to review data collected from inspections of 40 sample aircraft as it considered how to determine if the planes were safe to fly again.
Minicucci noted in the interview that the inspections take about 10 hours per door.
In a statement, Stan Deal, the CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said: “We have let down our airline customers and are deeply sorry for the significant disruption to them, their employees and their passengers. We are taking action on a comprehensive plan to bring these airplanes safely back to service and to improve our quality and delivery performance. We will follow the lead of the FAA and support our customers every step of the way.”
The CEO of United Airlines, one of the biggest buyers of Boeing jets, also expressed frustration with the company.
“I’m disappointed that… this keeps happening at Boeing. This isn’t new,” said Scott Kirby, CEO of United, in an interview Tuesday on CNBC. “We need Boeing to succeed. But they’ve been having these consistent manufacturing challenges. They need to take action here.”
NBC said Minicucci told the network Alaska Airlines would continue to fly an all-Boeing fleet.
In contrast, United appeared more unsure about its relationship with Boeing.
United has 79 of the Max 9s, more than any other airline, and had originally scheduled nearly 8,000 flights with the plane for this month before the incident, according to Cirium, an aviation analytics firm. Boeing’s future is uncertain regarding orders for the 737 Max 10, a newer, larger version and more expensive version of the 737 Max that has yet to be certified by the FAA.
“I think the Max 9 grounding is probably the straw that broke the camel’s back for us,” said Kirby. “We’re going to build a plan that doesn’t have the Max 10 in it.”

Here are the latest developments:
Cold, hungry and bloodied from razor wire grazes.
This was the reality for one Venezuelan couple as they spent two days waiting to turn themselves in to immigration authorities on the US side of the Rio Grande, which is lined by sharp razor wire and shipping container border barriers.
Kevin, 25, and Vanessa, 21, left their home in Venezuela for Mexico three weeks ago, fleeing a regime they’ve protested against for years, they told CNN Wednesday. Now they’ve found themselves in the middle of the ongoing border battle between Texas and the US federal government.
CNN is sharing the couples’ first names only for safety reasons.
With only the clothes on their backs and a belt bag across their bodies, the architecture students, who spoke to CNN through thick layers of razor wire, said they only had one viable option: to cross the river through high water levels and strong currents, losing most of their belongings throughout the journey.

Home was no longer in Venezuela, a place where the pair said they have no rights. And home couldn’t be Mexico either, because of how dangerous it is, they said.
Their end goal, having endured the difficult conditions of the journey to the US, was to seek asylum once they arrived.
“We are dying of thirst and cold,” Kevin said.
Vanessa and Kevin hadn’t eaten since their wait for authorities began and were only able to share a single bottle of water between them, which a soldier with the Texas National Guard handed to them earlier in the day Wednesday, they said.
Under federal policy, migrants like Kevin and Vanessa would have surrendered two days ago, been taken into custody by federal authorities and transported for immigration processing. But in Eagle Pass, the zone recently taken over by Texas, migrants who jump the fence or crawl between the razor wire are arrested and charged with criminal trespassing, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety.
The razor wire lining the border is so dense, you can hardly see through it. What is visible are pieces of fabric, presumably clothing, caught in the middle of wired loop after loop stretching across the 2.5-mile line of fencing.
Despite the Supreme Court’s ruling this week allowing federal Border Patrol agents to remove the wire while the state’s legal challenge to its removal plays out, it still remains intact.
The concertina wire was installed by Texas authorities in the Eagle Pass area – recently the epicenter of the migrant crisis and near where three migrants drowned this month.
The federal government doesn’t have an immediate plan for a mass removal unless the situation changes drastically or there is an emergency, a law enforcement source familiar with operations told CNN.

However, given the high court’s ruling Monday, federal law enforcement can and will cut or remove the wire as needed to enforce immigration laws and in the case of medical emergencies, the same source said.
Federal agents were standing ready to breach the fencing to render aid to any individual in distress or if otherwise deemed “operationally necessary,” another enforcement source told CNN Tuesday.
The only way to get to the other side is up and over one of the shipping containers that run parallel to the barbed wire fence – and that’s exactly what Kevin and Vanessa did several hours after speaking with CNN, helping each other jump down onto the Shelby Park area.
Moments later, Texas National Guard members were seen contacting Texas DPS officers who then arrived and took them into custody, a CNN team observed.
The takeover at Shelby Park by Texas authorities is a separate dispute from the razor wire legal battle that is also expected to play out in the courts, the same source added.

5SDZS2M3CB_MINOBSBON2UY12A,Opinion: America failed to heed Stanley Kubrick’s warnings. Trump is the proof,Opinion by Noah Berlatsky,"6 minute read Updated 2:30 PM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/26/opinions/dr-strangelove-60th-anniversary-kubrick-trump-berlatsky/,"Editor’s Note: Noah Berlatsky (@nberlat) is a freelance writer in Chicago. The views expressed here are his own. View more opinion on CNN.
“I can no longer sit back and allow Communist infiltration, Communist indoctrination, Communist subversion and the international Communist conspiracy to sap and impurify all of our precious bodily fluids.” Cigar-chomping Colonel Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) intones those classic lines of anticommunist paranoia in Stanley Kubrick’s “Dr. Strangelove, Or How I Learned To Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.” The movie was released 60 years ago this week.
Ripper’s obsessive anticommunism, and the film’s particular nuclear worries, date it to its Cold War year of release in 1964. But Kubrick’s portrait of a US government mired in fascism, incompetence and cowboy fantasies of violence still has a queasy relevance. The Soviet Union is no more, but Jack Ripper with all his precious bodily fluids and his terror of invasion by outside, feminizing forces is still a recognizable stand in for the border-obsessed, homophobic America of former President Donald Trump and his MAGA movement.
The plot of “Strangelove” riffs on, and critiques, the Cold War doctrine of Mutually Assured Destruction. The US and the USSR built up large nuclear stockpiles on the theory that as long as both sides believed that any attack would result in planetwide annihilation, no one would attack.
In Kubrick’s film, however, the mentally unstable Col. Ripper decides that nuclear war is necessary to prevent sneaky, impure Communist infiltration. He orders a wing of bombers to attack the Soviet Union—and all the safeguards designed to ensure credible deterrence make it almost impossible to call them back. The Soviet Union, for its part, has created a Doomsday device which will destroy the world if even one bomb falls on the country. Gripped by mutual fear and impelled by one rabid doofus, the world swoops and stumbles towards annihilation.
Nuclear war remains a live fear today. Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in 2022 once again raised the specter of open conflict between global nuclear powers. The worries about the Soviet Union outpacing the US in number of warheads—the “missile gap,” discussed with great bluster and mugging in the film by General Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott)—have largely been set aside. The collapse of the USSR left the US as the world’s sole superpower, and Russia and the US basically have parity in warheads. Today, even critics of US militarism tend to focus more on the potential of another pointless tragic quagmire like Vietnam, Afghanistan or Iraq rather than on the threat of nuclear apocalypse.
Strangelove’s terrors aren’t precisely our terrors. But the nightmare still has a lot of familiar contours. For example, per far right John Birch conspiracy theories of the era, Ripper believes that fluoridation of drinking water to prevent tooth decay is “the most monstrously conceived and dangerous Communist plot we have ever had to face.”
Ripper thinks public health campaigns are a threat to his moral, physical and sexual autonomy—that somehow fluoride makes him vulnerable to Communist control and, implicitly, makes him sexually impotent. Similarly, far-right extremists today have embraced Covid anti-vax conspiracy theories, claiming (falsely) that Covid vaccines cause large numbers of deaths or that they lead to infertility or change people’s DNA. You can easily see Ripper today donning a yellow star while claiming that vaccine mandates are the equivalent of the Holocaust, as many on the right have done.
The appropriation of Jewish suffering in the antivax protests also resonates with Kubrick’s morbidly funny skewering of ongoing fascist influence post-World War II. In his book, “The Anatomy of Fascism,” Robert O. Paxton defines fascism in part as “political behavior marked by obsessive preoccupation with community decline, humiliation, or victimhood and by compensatory cults of unity, energy and purity.” Ripper’s violent fear of his bodily fluids becoming corrupted and Trump’s ranting insistence that immigrants are “poisoning the blood” of our country both fit with standard fascist rhetoric of purity. Whether it’s immigrants or Communists coming over the border, the far-right frames it as a breach of bodily integrity which must be answered with violence.
Ripper’s Americanized fascism is mirrored by the film’s actual Nazi; Dr. Strangelove himself. Strangelove is based on Wernher von Braun, a Nazi rocket scientist who emigrated and worked on American military programs. Peter Sellers plays him with an Austrian accent and a manic sneer; his black-gloved hand is only partially under his control and keeps snapping up into a Nazi salute as shouts “Heil, Mein Fuhrer” when he should say “Mr. President.”
The disturbing part about Strangelove isn’t that he’s a Nazi; it’s that he fits so well into the American milieu. US generals mumble a couple disparaging remarks about “Krauts” but when Strangelove suggests that they escape fall-out radiation by moving all the most important and valuable people into mine shafts, they listen with breathless enthusiasm. They’re especially taken with Strangelove’s idea for creating a breeding program with 10 women for each man. “The women will have to be selected for their sexual characteristics which will have to be of a highly stimulating nature,” he hisses.
The plan to outbreed the Soviets echoes neo-fascist conspiracies about White genocide, otherwise known as “The Great Replacement Theory” — the fear that there’s a plot to lower White birthrates and overwhelm (supposedly) American culture with alien, non-White babies. Nearly half of Republicans agree that there’s a sinister plan to encourage immigration and replace White voters. The history of the anti-abortion movement is also rooted in worries about falling White birthrates; the fear was that abortions would reduce the White population, destroying American culture.
Getting distracted by horny fantasies while the world burns isn’t exactly indicative of great focus or competence. And in fact, Strangelove and his American admirers are farcical bumblers; the doctor can’t even conquer his own hand, much less the world. Ripper virtually boasts about his own sexual dysfunction. For Kubrick, though, this ineptness doesn’t undercut the malice. It compounds it.
The US president (also played by Sellers) doesn’t realize he’s signed orders that give power to use nuclear devices to lower officials. For its part, Russia’s Doomsday device is more dangerous because the Communist leader Kissoff foolishly didn’t let the US know it existed. (“The premier loves surprises,” his ambassador admits apologetically.) Ripper wouldn’t even attempt to destroy the world if he weren’t a self-bamboozled buffoon; his stupidity leads him to take horrific risks. Similarly, Donald Trump wouldn’t have attempted an almost sure-to-fail coup if he weren’t the most dangerous kind of fool: one who is also a demagogue. It’s not enough to want to overturn democracy; you need to have fooled yourself into thinking you can get away with it.

At the end of the film, bomber commander Major T.J. “King” Kong (Slim Pickens) manually opens his bomber doors and rides a nuclear warhead down towards its target, waving his cowboy hat and yodeling triumphantly as he ensures the end of the world. For Kubrick, that image of American patriotism, bloodthirstiness and utter foolishness encapsulated American reckless nuclear brinkmanship.
Sixty years later, the mix of terrifying violence and reckless incompetence still resonates, even if the Cold War is over. We can still see King Kong’s approach reflected in a range of issues. Today, it suggests the eagerness with which we have thrown ourselves into global warming on a great belching cloud of carbon dioxide. Or our march towards a potential second Trump term. Or our blithe refusal to embrace even moderate public health measures, like masking, in our current Covid-19 surge. Or President Joe Biden’s insistence on sending Israel weapons despite accusations that the weapons are being used for war crimes.
Kubrick in 1964 warned that American hyper-patriotism coupled with fascistic conspiracy theories and the human propensity for bumbling could result in disaster. The nuclear explosion he foresaw didn’t quite happen (at least not yet.) There are now also many other additional options for chaos and misery. We may now be learning to love greenhouse gases, or Covid, or fascist takeovers, rather than (or in addition to) the bomb. But Jack D. Ripper is still smoking that same cigar, and Dr. Strangelove is still smiling."

BFMTV reported that the boy had been left to live alone in the family’s apartment in the town of Nersac in the Charente region for two years, from 2020 to 2022, and appeared to survive on cake, canned goods, and stolen tomatoes.
According to BFMTV, the child’s mother lived with her partner in another apartment five kilometers (3.1 miles) away and would only visit the child from “time to time.”
The Mayor of Nersac, Barbara Couturier, as reported by BFMTV, said the child often did not have hot water or heating. Nevertheless, he continued attending school during this time and was a good student, Couturier also stated.
Couturier said she alerted the local and national police about the situation after the mother asked social services to help buy food.

“I met his mom on May 2022. She came to tell us that she had financial problems, and we gave her four vouchers for food, but she took some processed food products instead so that got me suspicious. Some residents told me that there was a child living alone, so I connected the two things and I called the local police and the national police,” Couturier explained.
Couturier stated that the child had been under the care of social services since September 19, 2022.

“We regret to announce that after a 10-day exhaustive search, our two missing U.S. Navy SEALs have not been located and their status has been changed to deceased,” Central Command said in a statement Sunday. “Out of respect for the families, no further information will be released at this time.”
CENTCOM added that teams from the US, Japan and Spain searched more than 21,000 square miles to try to locate the two missing SEALs. The two sailors were boarding a vessel in search of illicit Iranian weapons when one fell into the water due to eight-foot swells, and the second jumped in after them according to protocol, CNN previously reported.
“We mourn the loss of our two Naval Special Warfare warriors, and we will forever honor their sacrifice and example. Our prayers are with the SEALs’ families, friends, the U.S. Navy, and the entire Special Operations community during this time,” said Gen. Michael Erik Kurilla, US CENTCOM commander.
“We mourn the loss of our two brave Navy SEALs, and our hearts are with their families,” Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement Sunday. “The entire Department is united in sorrow today. We are grateful to all who worked tirelessly to try to find and rescue them.”
The US maintains a small military presence in Somalia that focuses on the threat of the al-Shabaab militant group, an extremist Islamist organization that has carried out attacks against the Somali government. The US recognizes al-Shabaab as a terrorist organization.
In addition to training Somali forces, the US has also coordinated with the Somali government to carry out strikes against al-Shabaab.
According to US Africa Command, “Al-Shabaab is the largest and most kinetically active al-Qaeda network in the world and has proved both its will and capability to attack U.S. forces and threaten U.S. security interests.”

5ZI7JLDSXV_FJYNEAD8OH9B2B8,The conservative legal world lines up behind Donald Trump at the Supreme Court,"By Joan Biskupic, CNN Senior Supreme Court Analyst","7 minute read Published 5:00 AM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/26/politics/supreme-court-trump-colorado-mitchell-analysis/,"As Donald Trump wages a Supreme Court battle to stay on state presidential ballots, a potent contingent of the conservative legal world has united behind him.
His new principal attorney for the case, Jonathan Mitchell, is a former Supreme Court clerk connected to the right-wing elite who devised the 2021 Texas abortion ban that helped lead to reversal of the Roe v. Wade landmark decision. The Texas law, which included a shrewd mechanism impeding judicial review, prompted liberal Justice Elena Kagan to refer disparagingly to its masterminds as “some geniuses.”
Also backing Trump, with “friend of the court” briefs, are the Republican National Committee and GOP establishment forces, similarly represented by elite appellate advocates who’ve worked for the justices and speak their language. They include former Trump Solicitor General Noel Francisco, George W. Bush-era legal adviser John Yoo and other ex-clerks of conservative Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas.
The leading Republican presidential candidate appears to be benefitting from ideological kinship, and perhaps personal loyalty, in the case that arose in Colorado but will have nationwide implications for the November general election.
The new filings in the case of Trump v. Anderson also reinforce the tight world of Supreme Court lawyering. From the start, the Colorado voters trying to keep Trump off the ballot, and who won at the state Supreme Court level, have been represented by former US Supreme Court clerks who’ve become prominent advocates.
The arguments tied to an anti-insurrectionist safeguard in the Constitution are scheduled for February 8 and bound to be hard fought and high energy. Given the GOP-appointed conservative dominance of the bench, the Trump side could find more allies in the give-and-take.

In his brief, Mitchell cited Thomas, whose influence has grown with the addition of more conservative colleagues in recent years. Mitchell highlighted what he insisted was the proper textualist reading of the disputed constitutional provision. Lawyers for the Republican National Committee similarly emphasized textualist arguments, repeatedly citing the late Justice Scalia, a prominent disciple of the textualist mode of legal interpretation.
At the lectern opposing Mitchell, who clerked for Scalia two decades ago, will be Jason Murray, a more recent law clerk to Justice Kagan. Murray’s partners in the case, Eric Olson and Sean Grimsley, who argued in Colorado lower courts, served as law clerks to the late Justices John Paul Stevens and Sandra Day O’Connor, respectively.
They, and their side’s “friend of the court” briefs, have until January 31 to respond to the Trump arguments. Based on the Colorado challengers’ preliminary submission to the high court, they will likely try to turn the justices’ attention to what happened on January 6, 2021, when Trump sought to overturn the election results that legitimately gave Joe Biden the White House.
Referring to the findings of a Colorado trial court judge, the lawyers wrote that Trump caused “the insurrection on January 6, 2021, having intentionally incited the mob to violence in a desperate ploy to cling to power.”
The former president is urging the justices to overturn the Colorado Supreme Court decision that said he should be disqualified from the state ballot for his role in the attack on the US Capitol based on the Constitution’s 14th Amendment.
Adopted after the Civil War and aimed at former Confederate leaders, Section 3 says, “No person shall … hold any office … under the United States … who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States … to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.”
Mitchell opened his arguments with the assertion that the president is not an “officer” of the United States, as the term is used in the Constitution, and therefore not covered by Section 3. (This theory was adopted by the Colorado trial judge but rejected by the state Supreme Court, which found it “inconsistent with the plain language and history of Section 3.”)
Mitchell highlighted oaths that are separately delineated in the Constitution and taken by the president and other top officials. “The president swears a different oath set forth in Article II, in which he promises to ‘preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States’ — and in which the word ‘support’ is nowhere to be found,” Mitchell wrote.

Focusing on the specific words of the text, he told the justices, “Section 3’s disqualification can apply only to those who have ‘previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States.’ It is undisputed that President Trump never took such an oath.”
Trump’s lawyers also are arguing that Section 3 applies only to a person who would “hold” office, not “run” for office. That contention has been endorsed in court brief by Francisco on behalf of the National Republican Senatorial Committee.
A group of former Republican attorneys general, which includes William Barr, Michael Mukasey and Edwin Meese, is also emphasizing that Section 3 does not cover the president, even as the group subtly acknowledges the national divisions arising from the attack on the Capitol.
In their interpretation of Section 3, they say, “The text speaks to a hierarchy of public offices in descending rank order, and its reference to an ‘officer of the United States’ low in that hierarchical list cannot include a President because an office ‘under the United States’ and ‘officer of the United States’ did not include the presidency as those terms were historically understood.”
The former attorneys general add, “Whatever one thinks of President Trump’s behavior on January 6, 2021, the stakes in this case are much larger than any one candidate or election. The overriding question is whether the Court will interpret Section 3 in a way that would henceforth empower partisan officials to unilaterally disqualify their political opponents from the ballot, especially the presidential ballot.”
Mitchell was already scheduled to make an appearance at the high court in February.
He will argue on behalf of a gun owner on February 28 in a dispute over government-banned bump stocks, devices that augment semiautomatic rifles to fire hundreds of bullets a minute.
After his clerkship, Mitchell became a lawyer in the George W. Bush administration’s Office of Legal Counsel and taught law school, including at the University of Chicago, where he had earned a law degree. He served as Texas state solicitor general from 2010 to 2015.
Recalled by colleagues over the years as smart but somewhat eccentric, Mitchell, now 47, seemed destined to become a solo operator. He opened his own firm in 2018. Mitchell has gravitated to culture-war issues, notably against reproductive rights and LGBTQ interests.
During the Colorado proceedings, Trump was represented by Scott Gessler, a Republican lawyer and former Colorado secretary of state, and the Dhillon Law Group, which has shepherded other Trump litigation related to January 6.
As Mitchell has taken over the Supreme Court appeal, he has focused Trump’s legal attack, eliminating some arguments and leading with the claim that the president is simply not an “officer of the United States” covered by the anti-insurrectionist provision.
For Supreme Court justices, reviewing the Trump arguments and soon-to-be-filed responses from the Colorado challengers, they are likely in only the first chapter of litigation related to the former president this election year.
Among the other controversies on the near horizon is whether Trump can claim immunity from criminal prosecution for election subversion related to the 2020 presidential contest.
Special counsel Jack Smith had tried to persuade the court to hear arguments related to the immunity claim, well in advance of a scheduled March trial for Trump. The justices spurned the December request, and as a result a US appellate court heard arguments on January 9 over whether Trump should be shielded for alleged crimes while in office.
A decision could come any day, and when that happens, the case of United States v. Trump would, no doubt, return to the justices."

Colombia’s President Gustavo Petro declared a “situation of disaster and calamity,” telling reporters that funds previously approved for other purposes are being redirected to deal with the crisis.
The government is also seeking international help, he said, adding that the United States, Chile, Peru and Canada, “which has enormous experience [fighting fires],” have responded to the call. Petro said he’s also seeking the cooperation of the United Nations and the European Union.
The fires are the result of hot and dry conditions linked to the El Niño weather phenomenon, according to officials. El Niño is expected to continue for the next few months before ending during the Northern Hemisphere spring.
Petro warned that the situation, which he described as a “climate crisis,” will get worse. “We are going toward an increasingly difficult stage,” he said.
Temperatures across much of the country have been 5 to 10 degrees Celsius above normal in recent days and weeks. Many locations are in the mid to even upper 30s C (upper 90s to low 100s F) and are coming on the heels of above-average temperatures across the region in recent months.
At least 25 active fires were reported on Thursday by the National Disaster Risk Management Unit. Ten are under control and 217 have been extinguished, the agency said.
Billowing smoke has overwhelmed some areas in the country and led to flights being cancelled in the capital Bogota.
The city’s El Dorado airport operated with restrictions Thursday morning due to low visibility from smoke and fog.
“We estimate that the phenomenon is composed of 70% fog and 30% smoke,” the Civil Aviation Authority of Colombia said on X.
At least 138 flights were affected, 48 were canceled and 16 were rerouted to other airports, the authority reported."
62S28HEYB1_KIT46SN9VUCPB2X,Royal Mail is on the brink. Cutting letter deliveries to 3 days a week could save it,"By Anna Cooban, CNN","3 minute read Published 10:45 AM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20230124,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/24/business/royal-mail-cut-letter-delivery/,"Royal Mail could ditch its near-daily deliveries of letters as the centuries-old British institution attempts to modernize its service and plug a growing hole in its finances.
Ofcom, the UK regulator overseeing the postal service, published proposals to rescue the beleaguered company Wednesday. It said Royal Mail could save as much as £650 million ($828 million) a year if it cut letter deliveries to three days a week from the current six.
The company’s business model is “getting out of date” and risks becoming “unsustainable” as people send fewer letters and receive more parcels, Ofcom said.
The number of letters sent via the Royal Mail network had halved since 2011, and financial losses have ballooned.
Among its other proposals, Ofcom suggested that Royal Mail could save up to £200 million ($255 million) a year by cutting its letter deliveries down to five days a week, or by extending the time it takes to get mail to customers.
“Something’s got to give, or the service is going to be too costly, and either stamp prices will go up or it will become unsustainable,” Melanie Dawes, Ofcom’s chief executive, said in an interview with the BBC Wednesday.

Any changes to Royal Mail’s Monday-Saturday letter delivery schedule would need to be approved by lawmakers because the company’s service obligations are set out in legislation. It delivers parcels five days a week, Monday to Friday.
Kevin Hollinrake, the United Kingdom’s postal services minister, told the BBC Wednesday that it was important to maintain a six-day service, and that Saturday deliveries were “sacrosanct,” in part, because many businesses, such as those producing magazines and greeting cards, required deliveries over the weekend.
Ofcom said Royal Mail was not currently providing a “reliable service” and change was urgently needed, a view shared by the company’s parent — International Distribution Services (IDS).
“It is not sustainable to maintain a network built for 20 billion letters when we are now only delivering 7 billion,” IDS CEO Martin Seidenberg told CNN in a statement.
The regulator fined the company, which was owned by the UK government until its privatization around a decade ago, £5.6 million ($7 million) last year for failing to deliver mail on time.
At the time, Ofcom said the pandemic had significantly hampered Royal Mail’s operations, but that the firm could “no longer use that as an excuse” for poor performance.
Royal Mail reported an operating loss of £319 million ($407 million) in the six months to the end of September, up 46% from the loss it recorded during the same period a year earlier. Its parent company, International Distribution Services, said low revenues and the cost of a pay deal agreed with a major postal workers’ union were behind the loss.
Ofcom said its proposals were meant to start a “national discussion” about the future of Royal Mail — an institution that is more than 500 years old — and that it would hold events in the next few months with individuals and businesses to ask for feedback."
64OD4YQ3Y7_SX4WYAX5BH5DVYL,Israeli hostage posters at Harvard vandalized with antisemitic messages,"By Matt Egan and Paul Murphy, CNN","4 minute read Updated 2:42 PM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/23/business/harvard-israeli-hostage-posters-vandalized/,"Israeli hostage posters that were hung up at Harvard University had been vandalized with antisemitic messages just as students returned from winter break.
Harvard condemned the vandalization on Tuesday and said university police are investigating the incident.
“The University strongly condemns the senseless and horrific vandalization on Harvard’s campus of posters displaying the faces of Israeli hostages,” a university spokesperson told CNN in a statement.
Footage shared with CNN by Harvard student Alexander Kestenbaum shows a handful of hostage posters defaced with messages such as “Israel did 9/11.” A poster of a four-year-old Israeli hostage was defaced, while “LIES FAKE” was scrawled over another hostage poster.
Photos and videos geolocated by CNN indicate the vandalized posters were hung just outside Holworthy Hall, a first-year student dorm located on the northern edge of Harvard Yard.
The Harvard spokesperson said the vandalized posters near the Thayer Gate have been removed and the Harvard University Police Department is investigating the incident.
At this time, there is “no indication” whether the perpetrator is affiliated with Harvard, the spokesperson said.
It’s not clear whether the posters were vandalized by students or outsiders on campus, which is located in the middle of Cambridge, Massachusetts. Visitors are able to walk through the gates into Harvard Yard. It’s also not clear how widespread the vandalism was.
Kestenbaum, a Harvard student who was one of the plaintiffs in a lawsuit recently leveled against the university over antisemitism, alerted Harvard officials to the vandalism on Sunday night, according to emails Kestenbaum shared with CNN.
Harvard’s Office for Equity, Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging (OEDIB) responded to Kestenbaum in an email on Monday afternoon saying officials are investigating the matter and explaining how bias-related incidents and formal complaints on discrimination can be filed.
The incident comes as Harvard is hoping to turn the page on a tumultuous period marked by soaring tensions over the Israel-Hamas war, a backlash from donors and politicians and the sudden end of Claudine Gay’s tenure as university president.
Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, called the hostage poster vandalism a “truly depraved and hideous act” and demanded Harvard leaders speak out on the incident.
“This is not political speech, but pure, unadulterated, inexcusable evil,” Greenblatt told CNN in a statement on Tuesday. “This needs to be called out forcefully by all, but especially by the Harvard leadership, particularly because the university has failed time and again when faced with similar instances.”
“Jewish students at Harvard returned from winter break this week excited to start the spring term,” said Getzel Davis, the Harvard Hillel campus rabbi, in a statement to CNN. “Instead, they were confronted with vandalism, the defacement of hostage posters, and vile antisemitic conspiracy theories. This is inexcusable and intolerable.”
Davis called on Harvard to “step up and do more” to defend students against antisemitism, both on campus and online.
Harvard told CNN on Monday that it recently met with executives from social media app Sidechat to discuss “concerning content” on the platform. Some students have complained about a surge in antisemitic posts on Sidechat, which is popular at colleges and allows users to make anonymous posts.
Alan Garber, Harvard’s interim president, unveiled a pair of presidential task forces late last week aimed at fighting both antisemitism and Islamophobia.
“Reports of antisemitic and Islamophobic acts on our campus have grown, and the sense of belonging among these groups has been undermined,” Garber said in the announcement. “We need to understand why and how that is happening—and what more we might do to prevent it.
However, famed economist Larry Summers slammed Harvard’s leaders for the selection of professor Derek Penslar as the co-chair of the antisemitism task force. Summers, a former president of Harvard, argued Penslar is “unsuited” for the key role because he previously “publicly minimized” the university’s antisemitism problem.
Some Harvard professors, students and the American Academy for Jewish Research rushed to Penslar’s defense, saying his academic credentials make him the right choice to lead the task force.
The Israel-Hamas war is fueling tensions at other major universities as well.
Last week, Columbia University students attending a pro-Palestinian protest sought medical treatment after saying they were sprayed by a foul-smelling substance. The NYPD said it received reports from six different victims who reported smelling an unknown odor, feeling nauseous and experiencing burning sensation in their eyes.
Columbia on Monday described the incident as “deeply troubling” and announced it has banned the “alleged perpetrators” from campus.

66E98D19XF_LN9RKT84AP3ONAC,"Some states are loosening their Covid isolation guidelines, shifting away from CDC recommendations","By Deidre McPhillips, CNN","6 minute read Published 11:38 AM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/23/health/covid-isolation-guidance-california-oregon-break-from-cdc/,"People who test positive for Covid-19 in California and Oregon are no longer expected to isolate for a set period of time — and those without symptoms don’t have to isolate at all, state policies now say. People with symptoms can return to school or work once their symptoms are improving and they’ve been fever-free for at least 24 hours, according to the state policies.

These two states — which have tended to take a more precautious approach to pandemic policies — are the first to break from federal guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which recommends at least five days of isolation for anyone with Covid-19. Oregon changed its isolation policy in May when the Covid-19 public health emergency lifted, and California followed suit earlier this month.
Officials in both states say the changes reflect policy that’s evolving along with the pandemic.
“We are now at a different point in time with reduced impacts from COVID-19 compared to prior years due to broad immunity from vaccination and/or natural infection, and readily available treatments available for infected people,” Dr. Tomás Aragón, director of the California Department of Public Health, wrote in the official order about the change. “Our policies and priorities for intervention are now focused on protecting those most at risk for serious illness, while reducing social disruption that is disproportionate to recommendations for prevention of other endemic respiratory viral infections.​”

The CDC recommends at least five days of isolation because people are likely to be most infectious during that time, and the science around that hasn’t changed. The recent order from the California health department notes that the potential infectious period spans from two days before through 10 days after symptoms or a positive test.
But experts broadly agree that easing isolation timeframes won’t significantly increase community transmission or severe outcomes — in part because the virus has been circulating at very high levels, even with more restrictive guidance in place.
“I don’t think this is reflecting updated science, but this is reflecting changing social norms and increasing workplace crunches,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiology professor and director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health.
Recent data from Oregon suggest the policy change has had minimal effect on virus trends. The state has seen a surge this winter, like the rest of the country, but Covid-19 hospitalization rates and emergency department visits have stayed below the national average, according to data from the CDC.
“We are not going to be able to completely stop transmission, and we’re not going to be able to get rid of this virus in the human population,” said Dr. Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. “Then, the decision of how to bring something into policy is really a summation of the medical risks as well as the risks to society as a whole.”
Instead, as the burden of severe disease has lessened, some experts say that stricter isolation policies may have unintended negative effects on public health.
“When we’re sick, we typically want to know what we have so that we can get treatment and possibly feel better,” said Dr. Sarita Shah, a clinical care provider and infectious disease epidemiologist at Emory University. “The ironic thing is, what I think has happened with Covid because of the isolation policies is that people kind of don’t want to find out because it leads to negative things.”

People with mild symptoms may not test because they can’t afford to miss a week of work and they might avoid wearing a mask because it could raise questions, she said. Less restrictive isolation policies could allow people to feel more comfortable with testing, which could prompt them to get treatment or feel more comfortable taking other protective measures.
Dr. Dean Sidelinger, Oregon’s state health officer, said that equity was a key factor considered in the decision to change isolation policy in the state.
“From a pragmatic standpoint, from an evidence-based and equity standpoint — trying to make sure that we weren’t unnecessarily burdening families, keeping kids out of school, or keeping people out of work who may have very limited sick leave — this made sense for us,” he said.
Public health policy decisions are rarely black-and-white, experts say, and weighing tradeoffs can be more of an art than a perfect science.
“There are different perspectives on the best way forward, even with everyone looking at the same data, everyone with the same good intentions in mind,” Barouch said.  “Well-meaning people could come to different conclusions.”
The CDC says that it will “continue to evaluate the latest data, including the continued decline in hospitalizations and COVID-related deaths compared to last year – likely the result of widespread vaccination and prior infection – as it considers its recommendations for how people can best protect themselves and their loved ones from the virus.”

But the agency notes that local jurisdictions have “shaped health guidelines to address situations on the ground” since the start of the pandemic.
In many ways, the changes California and Oregon made to their isolation policies for Covid-19 put it more in line with the way public health approaches other respiratory viruses, experts say. For example, if a child has a mild sore throat or fever, the decision about whether to go to school or not shouldn’t depend on the results of a Covid-19 test.
“It’s really challenging to have disease-by-disease policies in a respiratory season for which we don’t have ubiquitous testing,” Nuzzo said. People who are sick should take precautions, she said, and “we should be using tests as a tool, not as a penalty.”
While severe outcomes for Covid-19 have decreased over the years, it is still not just a cold, or even like the flu. The latest CDC data shows that Covid-19 hospitalization rates have consistently been at least twice as high as they’ve been for flu this respiratory virus season, and thousands of people have died from Covid-19 in the first two weeks of this year.
This ongoing burden of disease is why there is such strong debate about policy change, Shah said.
Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.
But the tools we have to manage Covid-19 have evolved rapidly and are much more in line with what’s available to manage other respiratory diseases, experts say — and isolation is just one strategy. Oregon and California, for example, still encourage people who test positive to wear a mask for at least 10 days.
Also, the policy changes in California and Oregon offer a broad, population-level approach to Covid-19 management. But individuals and places like hospitals may adjust based on their own risk tolerance.
“Health decisions generally are individual. At the end of the day, you’re always having that discussion with your doctor about what’s going to be best for you,” Shah said. The same internal analysis has now been happening around Covid-19 for years, and the risk-benefit balance may have shifted for many people, she said.
“I think it’s time to have that conversation and to have that debate.”"

“Everything burned down,” Acting Minister of Culture Dinara Smyr said, according to the region’s Apsnypress news agency. “This is an irreparable loss for the national culture of Abkhazia. I am choking with tears. It is difficult for me to speak.”
Apsnypress reported that the gallery’s collection included around 300 works by Alexander Chachba-Shervashidze, an exiled painter whom the breakaway republic considers to be the “first professional Abkhazian artist.” None of his pieces are thought to have survived, said Smyr.
The National Art Gallery is in Sukhumi, the separatist republic’s capital city. Abkhazia has declared its own government and is propped up by Russia, but is not officially recognized as a state by most countries or by the United Nations. According to Abkhazia’s State Committee for Statistics, the region’s population was around 244,000 in 2021.

The National Art Gallery’s Central Exhibition Hall caught fire overnight, and emergency services were called to the scene early Sunday morning, according to state media. By 7 a.m. local time the flames were contained, and by 11 a.m. the blaze was extinguished, Apsnypress said, adding that 11 fire brigades were called to the site from surrounding areas.
“The death of the works of art that made up the fund of the National Art Gallery is an irreparable loss for the cultural heritage of our state,” Abkhazia’s Parliament said in a statement posted on state media.
Around 150 paintings by Abkhaz artists survived the fire, Apsnypress reported, citing Smyr. The news agency also said that Abkhazia’s Prosecutor General’s Office has opened an investigation into the cause of the blaze.
In a social media post, Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili called the fire a “tragedy for us all.”  She also criticized the region’s leadership, saying, “I deplore what is a direct consequence of the neglect of cultural identity both by the de-facto leadership and the Russian occupants.”

67IN2BRBTS_OEEIZJBWPHA3UP8,Defense secretary expected to return to Pentagon Monday after nearly a month away,"By Oren Liebermann, CNN","3 minute read Updated 6:19 PM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/26/politics/defense-secretary-austin-pentagon-return/,"Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is expected to return to the Pentagon Monday after nearly a month away and host NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, according to a defense official.
Austin was admitted to the hospital on New Year’s Day due to complications from surgery to treat prostate cancer in late-December. He spent two weeks at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center before he was released on January 15. Since then, he has been working from home, where he has continued his recovery.
On Friday, Austin visited Walter Reed Medical Center for a follow-up appointment. Doctors at the hospital released a statement saying he is recovering well and is expected to make a full recovery.
“Beyond planned physical therapy and regular post-prostatectomy follow up appointments, he has no planned further treatment for his cancer,” a statement from his doctors said.
Austin’s unannounced hospitalization, which was not disclosed to the media or President Joe Biden and other senior administration officials for days, raised major questions about transparency and communications within the Biden administration. Republicans have been highly critical of how the Pentagon handled Austin’s illness and the House Armed Services Committee has called on the defense secretary to testify next month about the failure to notify key government leaders.
The White House has new guidelines for agency notification of key absences following its review of each federal agency’s plans for “delegation of authority” when a Cabinet member is unable to perform his or her duties, White House chief of staff Jeff Zients said in a memo first reported by The Associated Press and obtained by CNN.
Every time there is a delegation of authority, Zients said in the memo to Cabinet secretaries, the agency must notify the offices of Cabinet affairs and White House chief of staff. Additionally, any delegation of authority must be documented in writing both when it has gone into effect and when it is over, he added.
Biden acknowledged earlier this month that Austin’s failure to notify him about his hospitalization was a lapse in judgment.
Austin’s chief of staff, Kelly Magsamen, directed a 30-day review of the Pentagon’s processes and procedures for notifying senior national security leaders and the White House when the defense secretary needs to transfer authorities to the deputy secretary, which was required during Austin’s hospitalization. And the Defense Department inspector general launched a separate investigation of whether the Pentagon had the appropriate policies in place to ensure an effective transfer of power and duties.
During Austin’s hospitalization and subsequent recovery at home, the Pentagon has said that he had full access to secure communications capabilities and was able to oversee a number of national security issues.
From the hospital, Austin authorized the first round of strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen and spoke daily with senior Pentagon officials. From his home on Tuesday, Austin hosted a virtual meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, making his first public remarks since he had been hospitalized.
Asked if Austin would take questions from the media upon his return to the Pentagon, press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder demurred.
Ryder said the Pentagon was “very aware of the request” but did not have a date to provide.

“I reaffirmed that the Hungarian government supports the NATO membership of Sweden,” Orban wrote Wednesday on X.
Orban said he told Stoltenberg in a phone call he would urge Hungary’s National Assembly to vote in favor of Sweden’s bid to join the bloc at the first possible opportunity. The NATO chief said he welcomed Orban’s “clear support” for Sweden’s bid.
Hungary was until this week one of two countries that objected to and obstructed Sweden’s accession to NATO. The Turkish parliament voted Tuesday to approve Sweden’s bid, allowing President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to sign the protocol into law.
Sweden and Finland applied for NATO membership in May 2022, swiftly after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine earlier that year. Finland joined NATO in April 2023 – doubling the alliance’s border with Russia – but Sweden’s bid was mired in challenges.

Erdogan objected to Sweden’s accession, accusing Swedish officials of being too lenient on militant groups, including the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK). Sweden has since tightened its anti-terror legislation and pledged closer cooperation with Turkey on security concerns.
Another obstacle was Sweden’s approval of a small Quran-burning demonstration outside a mosque in its capital, Stockholm, which coincided with the Muslim holiday of Eid-al-Adha, one of the most significant in the Islamic calendar. Turkey’s Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan condemned the decision, saying “to turn a blind eye to such heinous acts is to be complicit in them.”
Erdogan’s eventual approval was won in part by a commitment from the United States, with the Turkish president signaling that he won’t sign the protocol into law unless Washington approves the sales of F-16 fighter jets to Ankara. US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chair Ben Cardin said Tuesday that Congress is waiting for the completion of accession documents before moving forward on the matter.
Orban, considered to be the European Union leader closest to Russian President Vladimir Putin, initially indicated he was not opposed to Sweden joining the bloc, before working to stall it. Katalin Cseh, a Hungarian Member of the European Parliament, said last year that Orban’s blocking of Sweden’s bid was “quite simply, another favor to Vladimir Putin.”
But, following the Turkish parliament’s decision, Orban on Tuesday said he had invited his Swedish counterpart Ulf Kristersson to visit Hungary to negotiate the terms of Sweden’s accession.
Stoltenberg said he had a “good call” with Orban on Wednesday, adding “I look forward to the ratification as soon as parliament reconvenes.”"
6DCVX72TWI_MZWWEKOLX5I4TYK,Haley remains defiant as Trump ratchets up attacks on last-standing 2024 GOP rival,"By Eric Bradner, Arit John, Alayna Treene, Kylie Atwood and MJ Lee, CNN","10 minute read Updated 8:32 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/25/politics/nikki-haley-trump-republican-primary/,"Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley is growing more defiant in the face of Donald Trump’s efforts to push her out of the 2024 Republican primary race, poking and prodding at the former president and encouraging supporters to wear Trump’s attacks as a badge of honor.
Returning to her home state Wednesday, Haley mocked Trump’s victory speech in New Hampshire the night earlier — one in which the former president raged about the concession speech Haley had just delivered.
She said Trump “pitched a fit,” called him “insecure” and declared he “should feel threatened, without a doubt.” She cast doubt on his mental competency — the same line of attack Trump and his allies have long leveled at President Joe Biden — and dared Trump to debate her one-on-one.
“Bring it, Donald,” she said in North Charleston. “Show me what you got.”
Haley’s increasingly pointed attacks on Trump come amid pressure from many Republicans for her to drop out of the 2024 primary race so that the party can coalesce around the former president — who is seeking a third consecutive nomination.
Polls show Haley is far behind Trump in South Carolina, where many of her former allies have turned on her and the Republican primary electorate is much more conservative than that of New Hampshire — where she lost to Trump by 11 points.
Still, she remains a thorn in the former president’s side, provoking his ire in ways the 2024 Republican presidential contenders he’s already dispatched never did.
Related article Iowa and New Hampshire showcased Trump’s strengths – and exposed his weaknesses
And Haley’s aides say that’s intentional.
Her campaign is bracing for Trump to go too far in attacking Haley and believes those attacks are likely to boost her support in South Carolina. One campaign official said Trump’s attacks would be a “key piece” of Haley’s pathway to winning over Palmetto State voters ahead of the February 24 primary.
It’s the same strategy she used in her home state in 2010 — when she seized on allegations of affairs and racist attacks to fend off three Republican primary rivals in the governor’s race.
“Those attacks were one part of why she won,” the campaign official said. “South Carolinians didn’t like it then and they won’t like nasty attacks now.”
With Haley refusing to drop out of the race, Trump has shifted from viewing her as a primary rival to a full-blown enemy, and has grown increasingly angry with her, sources close to the former president said.
“Before she was a gnat. Now she is an enemy, and Trump plans to bludgeon her in the lead-up to South Carolina,” a person who spoke with Trump following his victory in New Hampshire told CNN.
He is also targeting Haley’s donors, warning that they’ll be “permanently barred” from his orbit if they continue to contribute her campaign.
“Nikki ‘Birdbrain’ Haley is very bad for the Republican Party and, indeed, our Country. Her False Statements, Derogatory Comments, and Humiliating Public Loss, is demeaning to True American Patriots,” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform Wednesday night.
“Anybody that makes a ‘Contribution’ to Birdbrain, from this moment forth, will be permanently barred from the MAGA camp. We don’t want them, and will not accept them, because we Put America First, and ALWAYS WILL!” he said.
Haley’s campaign leaned into those attacks Thursday, releasing T-shirts emblazoned with the words“Barred. Permanently.” Haley posted a photo of the new T-shirts on social media, saying, “Enough said … Grab your shirt here.”
Haley also told supporters in North Charleston that her campaign had already raised $1 million after her concession speech and Trump’s election night address in New Hampshire.
Trump’s latest attacks are an escalation of weeks of digs at Haley, who served as his US ambassador to the United Nations.
Trump has already attacked Haley with a racist dog whistle, referring to her on Truth Social by her first name Nimarata, which he misspelled “Nimrada” and later “Nimbra.” He has also falsely suggested Haley is not eligible for the presidency.
Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants, was born Nimarata Nikki Randhawa. She has gone by “Nikki” since childhood and took her husband Michael Haley’s last name after they married. The attacks were reminiscent of Trump referring to former President Barack Obama by his middle name, Hussein, and demanding to see his birth certificate.
“It’s a little bit of a take off on her name — you know, her name, wherever she may come from,” Trump said of Haley on Fox News.
Trump and his campaign had hopes that a win in New Hampshire would effectively end the GOP presidential primary, his advisers said. They are eager to declare that the former president has become the presumptive Republican nominee as soon as possible and pivot their efforts toward a general election rematch with Biden.
Emboldened by the flood of endorsements he has received in recent days — from former primary rivals, congressional leaders and governors — Trump personally believes the party has fallen in line and wants to move forward with the weight of the GOP behind him, his advisers said. But from Trump’s point of view, Haley is getting in the way.
Haley’s decision to stick it out for now has infuriated the former president, the sources said, and he is now determined to hurt her as much as possible ahead of South Carolina, where his campaign will continue to try and paint Haley as being unpopular with people in her own backyard.
“We need to unite around our eventual nominee, which is Donald Trump,” Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said Tuesday on Fox News.
The Trump campaign had initially approved going forward with a draft RNC resolution to formally declare Trump the party’s presumptive 2024 nominee and the former president himself was also on board until backlash began, a source familiar told CNN.
Trump wrote on Truth Social that he appreciated the effort but was opposing it “for the sake of Party unity” and wanted to “finish the process off AT THE BALLOT BOX.” Dave Bossie, an RNC committeeman from Maryland who recently endorsed Trump, withdrew the resolution Thursday night, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN, but not before Haley’s campaign began fundraising off of it.

“The RNC is leveraging the establishment to try and crown Trump the presumptive nominee,” Haley wrote in a fundraising email. “Well I have news for them: I’m in this to win it and I’m not going anywhere.”
Trump’s attempts to embarrass Haley were on display in New Hampshire. In the final days before the GOP primary there, Trump paraded a series of South Carolina Republican officials onstage at his rallies, including Gov. Henry McMaster, Lt. Gov. Pamela Evette and multiple congressmen.
For Trump’s victory speech Tuesday night, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott — a onetime presidential rival whom Haley appointed to the Senate in 2012 — stood onstage behind Trump days after endorsing him.
“She actually appointed you, Tim,” Trump said. “You must really hate her.”
Scott stepped forward and leaned into the microphone in an effort to defuse the situation. “I just love you,” he said.
“That’s why he’s a great politician,” Trump responded.
Even as her campaign team plans for a monthlong fight in South Carolina, officials say Haley is gaugingthe support of donors and taking the temperature of longtime supporters about her path forward. Those private conversations could help influence any campaign decisions.
Trump did not do well with independents in New Hampshire, which further bolsters Haley’s argument that he would lose in the general election, her aides said. Haley got the vote of about 6 out of 10 independent voters in New Hampshire, according to CNN exit polls.
Art Pope, a North Carolina retail magnate who is supporting Haley, sharply criticized Trump’s threat to blacklist the former governor’s donors, saying it “emboldens me” and only increases his commitment to her candidacy for the GOP presidential nomination.
“I and most Americans do not respond well to a bully,” Pope, an influential player in North Carolina Republican politics, told CNN on Thursday while noting that he voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020. “President Trump wants to be the leader of the country … but rather than unifying, reaching out and building support, he’s basically telling us to go away and take a hike and threatening us. I decline to be threatened. I’m not going to be intimidated.”
He said Haley clearly is “getting under the skin” of someone “who wants an anointment, rather than letting the voters have a choice in the primaries.”
However, other donors, including a prominent Democrat who had crossed party lines in a bid to stop Trump, said they will no longer back Haley’s efforts financially after her loss in New Hampshire.
Reid Hoffman, the co-founder of LinkedIn and a prominent Democratic donor who initially gave $250,000 to the pro-Haley super PAC, SFA Fund Inc., has no plans to continue donating to Haley’s presidential campaign after she lost the New Hampshire primary, his adviser Dmitri Mehlhorn said.
“If she had won New Hampshire there would have been a huge push to raise many tens of millions for her to build on that momentum in SC and Super Tuesday. The investment was based on winning NH,” Mehlhorn told CNN.
Haley’s campaign declined to comment on the donor moves.
Biden campaign officials have been privately cheering on Haley’s decision to stay in the presidential race, sources say, as they monitor Trump lashing out at her.
The Biden campaign made clear after the New Hampshire primary that it fully believes Trump will be the president’s GOP opponent. Still, Biden’s reelection team has welcomed seeing Haley prolong the Republican contest and force the Trump campaign to use its resources and time to attack her.
“Go forth and prosper,” one Biden campaign official said in describing the team’s delight to see the Trump-Haley battle continue.
The Biden campaign account on Truth Social has amplified some of Haley’s ongoing attacks on Trump, including her saying in an interview this week that Trump is prone to throwing “temper tantrums” when he is nervous or feels threatened.
Haley and her supporters have embraced her status as a long-shot candidate, drawing connections to tough fights she has waged, and won, at the start of her political career in South Carolina.
“This is nothing new to her,” said South Carolina state Rep. Nathan Ballentine, a longtime Haley ally. “She’s always been the underdog, and frankly, she thrives in that environment.”
She won her first race, a 2004 contest for a state House seat, after beating a 30-year incumbent in a Republican primary by 9 points.
Six years later, she faced the real test of her political fortitude during her 2010 bid for governor. First, a key political ally – South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford – became a major liability after he revealed he’d secretly left the country to visit his mistress in Argentina.
“People looked at me with pity,” Haley wrote in her 2012 autobiography. “They no longer treated me like a real candidate. Worst of all, no one returned my calls.”
Fundraising dried up, and Haley’s campaign directed most of its funds to TV. She ran on a shoestring budget with donated office space and supplies, and charged supporters for yard signs.
“Any other person probably would have just quit and caved in there, but she knew that South Carolina needed her,” Ballentine said.
Haley went on to win the endorsement of Sarah Palin, which helped propel her in a GOP primary field that included McMaster, then the state’s attorney general, the state lieutenant governor and a congressman. And she stayed in after two men claimed without evidence that she’d had extramarital affairs. Haley won the nomination in a runoff election by about 30 points.
Related article On the campaign trail, Haley’s time in South Carolina is both an asset and a liability
The pressure Haley may have faced to drop out in 2010 is a fraction of the national pressure she’s facing now. The Republican Party has also changed dramatically since then. There is no Palin-figure whose endorsement might change the tide of the race – an overwhelming majority of South Carolina politicians, as well as national leaders, have fallen in line behind Trump.
That hasn’t stopped Haley from attempting to get under his skin.
“I think part of her strategy is to make him mad, which seems to be very effective,” said Chip Felkel, a South Carolina GOP strategist not working for any campaign. “He gets off script, he says stupid stuff, he tweets stupid things, and it’s been indicative that he’s not controlled.”
Felkel, who described Haley’s approach as “guerrilla warfare,” said he doesn’t think she can win South Carolina but speculated that she may try to stay in until the convention.
“She got a lot of fight in her, but at some point conventional wisdom says you’ve got to get a W somewhere or the mind dries up,” Felkel said. “And maybe she’s banked enough, going to be judicious enough with it, that she thinks she can be in for the long haul.”

6FRJ1FW1RM_56HV2LY93VL5FZ1,Why airlines plug up emergency exits,By Amy Fraher,"4 minute read Published 6:59 AM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/travel/why-airlines-plug-up-emergency-exits/,"Editor’s Note: The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer. CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation, a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation.
The aviation industry is still in shock from a near disaster on January 5, 2024, in which a 60-pound “door plug” blew out from a nearly new Boeing 737 MAX 9 in flight at 16,000 feet, leaving a gaping hole in the fuselage.
In response, the Federal Aviation Administration grounded all 737 MAX 9 planes with such plugs, and aviation authorities in other countries have followed suit.
The industry is watching closely.
A lot of news coverage has emphasized the impressive safety record of the global airline industry, particularly since an Alaska Airlines crew managed to land the plane with no fatalities. I commend the outstanding performance of airline employees, air traffic controllers and emergency responders who achieved this impressive feat.
However, as a former United Airlines pilot now lecturing in Yale University’s School of Management, I believe the wrong questions are being asked about what happened on Alaska Airlines Flight 1282. As the National Transportation Safety Board and numerous news outlets have explained, door plugs are commonly used to seal unused exits on commercial airliners. The question we need to ask is: Why wouldn’t an airline use all of an aircraft’s emergency exits? Wouldn’t that make passengers safer?
It’s all about money.
Airlines have lots of expenses. Some, such as jet fuel, are easier to calculate. Others, such as emergency exits, are more opaque to travelers.
Believe it or not, every functioning emergency exit comes at a price for an airline. Each requires routine maintenance and frequent inspections – for example, to make sure that emergency evacuation slides work properly – and flight attendants must staff emergency exits during takeoff and landing for safety reasons.
In other words, every working exit comes with associated costs in salaries, health benefits, pension plans, training and related expenses. Sealing off an emergency exit cuts costs.
But is every one of those emergency exits crucial? From the US government’s perspective, not necessarily.
In the US, airlines must comply with federal aviation regulations, which dictate aircraft maintenance procedures and in-flight personnel assignments – and minimum standards for emergency exits.
The issue is that Boeing sells the same airplane to different airlines with different needs.
Boeing notes that its 737 MAX 9 can carry up to 220 passengers, which, under US regulations, requires it be built with a specific number of emergency exits. This dense seating configuration is common among lower-cost global airlines such as Jakarta-based Lion Air.
However, given Americans’ desire for legroom, most US carriers are equipped with considerably fewer than 220 seats – and when there are fewer than 190 seats, the rules allow fewer emergency exits to be in service. The Alaska Airlines Max 9 had just 178 seats.
Under these conditions, the federal rules allow air carriers to disable these exits and plug the openings. That’s precisely what happened with Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 – and how “door plug” suddenly entered the American vernacular.
Although this sort of workaround is authorized, it’s unclear to me that this is in the best interest of air safety. Wouldn’t it be better for the FAA to require that all exits are available for use in an emergency, regardless of aircraft seating capacity, even if it required some additional expense for airlines?
The 737 MAX is a plane of many firsts – not all of them positive.
The MAX is the latest addition to Boeing’s 737 family of aircraft. The 737 family has far eclipsed all rivals as the most popular commercial airliner ever built, with over 10,000 sold worldwide since its introduction in 1967.
Some carriers, such as Southwest Airlines in the United States and Ryanair in Ireland, fly only 737s; it’s a critical element of their low-cost business strategy. By flying just one type of aircraft, these airlines significantly improve scheduling flexibility while cutting maintenance and training costs.
That’s all to say that demand for the latest 737 was high. In 2017, when the FAA certified the 737 MAX safe for flight, Boeing had already received more than 3,600 new orders from 83 customers.
But very shortly afterward, two crashes that together killed 346 people grounded the 737 MAX for nearly two years – another first as the longest airline grounding in aviation history. Destined to profit US$12 million on the sale of each $121 million MAX, there was significant incentive for Boeing to press on with MAX development even though it had already proved to be a dangerously problematic aircraft design.
In 2020, the FAA recertified the MAX as “safe for flight”; by 2023, Boeing had logged more than 7,000 total orders for the MAX, far eclipsing the sale of any other type of airliner. This fact alone ought to raise safety concerns. It may soon prove impossible to avoid flying on a 737 MAX, particularly in the U.S. domestic market. United, American, Southwest and Alaska airlines all currently fly the MAX.
When airplane parts and passengers’ cellphones are raining from the sky, it could be a sign that the industry needs to think harder about unintended costs – and consequences.

6I36T0S2TZ_Y9HXX83DMUVA63B,Police arrest California woman for allegedly stealing 65 Stanley cups,"By Jordan Valinsky, CNN","2 minute read Published 7:30 AM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/23/business/stanley-cups-arrest/,"Police responding to a retail theft call in a California city discovered what is likely the most 2024 thing ever: A Sacramento woman allegedly stole about five dozen Stanley cups valued at a whopping $2,500.
Last Wednesday, Roseville Police officers responded to a report of a theft at a retail store where staff “saw a woman take a shopping cart full of Stanley water bottles without paying for them,” and refused to stop for staff, police said on Facebook.
An officer saw the unidentified 23-year-old woman’s vehicle travel on a nearby highway, pulled her over and arrested her for grand theft. After a search of the car, the police recovered 65 Stanley cups.
The inexplicable allure of Stanley cups has led people to go to extreme lengths to collect them. Recently at Target, its special edition Valentine’s Day cups quickly sold out, and the cups appeared on the resale market for hundreds of dollars above sticker prices that range from $20 to $50 depending on size.
“While Stanley Quenchers are all the rage, we strongly advise against turning to crime to fulfill your hydration habits,” the police said on Facebook. “The Roseville Police Department remains committed to stopping retail theft.”
The 111-year-old Stanley brand is enjoying a massive resurgence of sorts with a much younger clientele of tweens, teens and young adults.
Invented by William Stanley, Jr., in 1913, the all-steel vacuum-insulated bottle was originally invented for keeping food and beverages hot or cold, and has since become a popular go-to camping and hiking accessory.
Related article The Stanley craze begs the question: Why do we love our special little cups so much?
In 2020, Stanley’s global president Terence Reilly revamped the brand and specifically chose women as a potential new consumer base. Then, with a new palette of colors and designs, the company relied on trusted influencers on social media to get the word out.
The strategy worked: Stanley’s 40-ounce Quencher cup gained rabid popularity for its candy-like array of colors and its ability to keep beverages hot and cold for long periods of time.
Once the cups took off on social media, Stanley’s annual sales reportedly jumped from $75 million to $750 million in 2023 alone.

6I3OFHUSVR_7PQZKLWK6AO1NTZ,Pro-war Putin critic Igor Girkin sentenced to four years in Russian prison on extremism charges,"By Rob Picheta, Sebastian Shukla and Anna Chernova, CNN","4 minute read Updated 10:30 AM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/25/europe/igor-girkin-russia-trial-verdict-intl/,"Igor Girkin, a prominent Russian pro-war blogger who criticized President Vladimir Putin’s handling of the war on Ukraine, has been found guilty on extremism charges and sentenced to four years in prison by a Moscow court.
Moscow City Court convicted Girkin, also known under his pseudonym, Strelkov, of inciting extremism – a charge he denied.
A former officer of Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) and an ex-military commander, Girkin played a crucial role in Russia’s annexation of Crimea and the early stages of invading Donbas, before becoming a prominent Russian military blogger with over half a million followers on Telegram.

Girkin was also closely linked to the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 in July 2014 and was convicted in absentia of mass murder for his role in the tragedy.
As part of his Thursday sentence he was also barred from accessing the internet, a move that essentially shuts off his ability to publicly lambast Putin’s leadership.
Girkin was arrested in July and charged with calling for extremist activities after he became increasingly critical of Putin and his military’s mishaps in Ukraine.
His detention came weeks after the failed rebellion by Wagner mercenaries in Russia, a period in which Putin’s grasp on power appeared to be more fragile than ever.
A group of around 100 of his supporters gathered outside the Moscow court on Thursday to show opposition to his sentencing.
Girkin’s wife told CNN on Thursday she had been unable to see her husband for six months. “Today I am very worried now. To be honest, I have a storm of negative emotions,” she said.
“It seems to me that now this is a demonstrative flogging for everyone and thus all the heroes of Russian,” she said. “They are simply not wanted now and are being removed. We hope that we still have justice and that my husband will be released sooner or later, and I hope that this will happen after the elections, because now a purge is underway.”
Girkin is among the best-known of Russia’s “milbloggers,” a group of war correspondents who support the invasion but have grown increasingly critical of the military’s faltering operations in Ukraine, and pushed for a harsher approach.
He co-founded an ultra-nationalist political group called the Angry Patriots Club last spring, and told Reuters that Russia was “on the cusp of very grave internal political changes of a catastrophic character.”
But just days before his arrest Girkin intensified his criticisms of Putin, calling the president a “lowlife” and a “cowardly bum” in a blistering post on his Telegram channel.
“For 23 years, the country was led by a lowlife who managed to ‘blow dust in the eyes’ of a significant part of the population. Now he is the last island of legitimacy and stability of the state,” the post read. “But the country will not be able to withstand another six years of this cowardly bum in power.”
Thursday’s verdict highlights the increasing paranoia emanating from the Kremlin about how the war on Ukraine is being conducted.
Both Girkin and another famous war critic, Yevgeny Prigozhin, have now paid a heavy price for overstepping the mark in their criticism of Putin.
Girkin faces a prison sentence in a Russian penal colony with his access to the internet cut – effectively severing his sharp tongue from his 500,000 Telegram followers.
Prigozhin, who ultimately died in a plane crash, was marginalized, had business operations clipped and was publicly rebuked by Putin for stoking a rebellion just weeks before Girkin’s arrest.
Both Girkin and Prigozhin had constantly called for more military support and ammunition for units in Ukraine and personally attacked the top brass of the Russian Defense Ministry, Sergei Shoigu and Valery Gerasimov.
Girkin is a former colonel in Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) and served as defense minister in the separatist so-called Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) in eastern Ukraine, territory captured by pro-Russian forces in 2014.
It was during his time in the DPR that he contributed to the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over eastern Ukraine in 2014, a court in the Netherlands found. All 298 people onboard were killed. The court in 2022 found Girkin guilty of mass murder for his role in the incident and he was sentenced in absentia to life in prison.
According to the court, Girkin participated in the conflicts in Chechnya, Transnistria and Bosnia.

6JCRMYI837_M5BSBB8K9VBVWI0,Illinois election board hears objection to Trump candidacy based on January 6 insurrection,"By Marshall Cohen, CNN","3 minute read Published 3:14 PM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/26/politics/illinois-14th-amendment-trump-january-6/,"A retired judge hired by the Illinois State Board of Elections held a hearing Friday on whether the 14th Amendment’s “insurrectionist ban” applies to former President Donald Trump.
Several voters filed the challenge against Trump, arguing that Illinois should join Colorado and Maine in removing him from their 2024 presidential ballots based on his role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol. The decisions in those states were paused pending the outcome of Trump’s appeal of the Colorado case to the US Supreme Court.
Retired Illinois judge Clark Erickson presided over the roughly two-hour hearing in Chicago on Friday. His recommendation is expected to be announced on Tuesday when the full election board meets. The panel will then vote on the recommendation.
An attorney for the challengers, Matthew Piers, asserted that Trump filed “false” paperwork with Illinois election officials when he certified that he was “fully qualified to serve as president.” As a result, Piers argued, Trump “may not be placed on the ballot.”
Piers played harrowing video footage from the assault on the US Capitol, and pointed out that Trump has “repeatedly failed to denounce what happened on January 6 and has recently referred to persons convicted of criminal misconduct on that day as ‘hostages.’”
“What binds us all, in this profession, is the respect for the rule of law,” Piers told the judge at the end of his arguments. “If we lose that, we all might as well find something else to do, or maybe another country to live in. That is what is at the center of this case.”

Trump lawyer Scott Gessler, who defended him in the Colorado case, reiterated many of the defenses that were used to beat back similar cases across the country. Lawsuits have been dismissed on procedural grounds in Michigan, Minnesota and other states.
Gessler, a former Colorado secretary of state, argued that the insurrectionist ban doesn’t apply to the presidency, that “there was no engagement by President Trump in any violence” and that the deadly events of January 6 didn’t amount to an insurrection. He also raised due process concerns.
“We are a country of rule of law, and we are a country of democracy,” Gessler said, accusing the challengers of “using highly spurious legal theories … to drive home a political point and to prevent President Trump from being able to appear on the ballot.”
Erickson, the judge, is a Republican and served on the Kankakee County Circuit Court for 25 years, until his retirement in 2020. He was appointed in 1995, elected to a full term on the GOP ticket in 1996, and won retention elections in 2002, 2008, and 2014.
The Illinois State Board of Elections, which is expected to vote Tuesday on whether to accept Erickson’s recommendation in the Trump case, is a bipartisan panel with four Democrats and four Republicans. Their decision can be appealed in Illinois state courts.
Illinois’ Republican primary is on March 19. With Trump dominating the GOP nomination race, the Illinois contest may have little political impact. But the battle over his spot on the primary ballot is a proxy fight over his overall eligibility to return to the White House.
At its Tuesday meeting, the election board is also slated to vote on a 14th Amendment challenge lodged against President Joe Biden by a group of conservative activists.
They say Biden “provided aid or comfort to the enemies of the United States” by failing to secure the US-Mexico border. Legal experts have largely panned the idea of applying the “insurrectionist ban” against Biden as a meritless stunt, even as some Republicans have embraced the move as a way to retaliate against the Democratic incumbent."
6LSJTG3XJZ_EWWBIDWCFM0YJGF,Opinion: Defendants in the Georgia election case have no reason to complain — even if the Fani Willis allegations are true,Opinion by Bruce A. Green,"6 minute read Updated 9:06 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/24/opinions/fani-willis-trump-georgia-election-case-green/,"Editor’s note: Bruce A. Green is the Louis Stein chair at Fordham Law School, where he directs the Stein Center for Law and Ethics. He is a former federal prosecutor in New York. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely his own. View more opinion on CNN.
The Georgia prosecutor who brought the 2020 election interference case against former President Donald Trump and 18 co-defendants is facing an allegation of having a romantic relationship with the man she appointed as a special prosecutor in the case. One of the co-defendants, Michael Roman, a campaign official for Trump in 2020, has asked a judge to remove Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis and special prosecutor Nathan Wade from the case, asserting that the two prosecutors have an impermissible conflict of interest due to an “improper” relationship.
Neither Willis nor Wade has directly addressed the allegations. Speaking publicly for the first time after the accusations emerged, Willis told the congregation at Atlanta’s Big Bethel AME Church on January 14 that Wade was a “legal superstar” and “a great friend and a great lawyer.” Fulton Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee has scheduled a hearing on the matter for February 15, and prosecutors have been instructed to file a written response to the allegations by February 2.
While Willis may have engaged in nepotism in appointing Wade to lead an important prosecution, it seems doubtful that any of the defendants have a legitimate cause to complain.
Prosecutors have considerable power and discretion, which they should exercise in a disinterested fashion. To the extent possible, they should avoid prosecuting cases in which they have a significant personal interest at stake.
In extreme cases, such as when prosecutors have an ax to grind against a defendant because of self-interest or a relationship, or because the prosecutor will benefit financially from decisions made in the case, courts have authority to replace the prosecutor with a disinterested lawyer. (If Willis were disqualified, the case would go to the Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council of Georgia, which would then decide on a new prosecutor.)
Related article Opinion: What Fani Willis’ case shows us about the power of local prosecutors
For example, the Supreme Court has held that when a party violates a federal court order to stop infringing a company’s copyright, the company’s lawyer may not be appointed to prosecute the infringer for contempt of court. That lawyer, being beholden to the victim, would not be sufficiently disinterested and would be likely to treat the defendant too harshly.
As New York Law School professor Rebecca Roiphe and I have previously written however, courts rarely remove prosecutors based on a conflict of interest because as professionals, prosecutors are able to put self-interest and personal preferences to the side except in extreme cases. For example, a Republican prosecutor can be trusted to investigate or prosecute a Democratic president (as in the case of Ken Starr and President Bill Clinton), notwithstanding political preferences that in theory might bias the prosecutor against the accused.
An elected prosecutor who works daily with a police department can investigate allegations of police misconduct, notwithstanding an interest in maintaining good relations with the police department. The law presumes that prosecutors will overcome their biases.
In the Georgia prosecution of Trump and his co-defendants, an alleged romantic relationship between two top prosecutors seems to be even less of a problem, as far as disinterested prosecutorial decision-making is concerned, than the alleged conflicts of interest that courts ordinarily overlook.
Related article Opinion: A powerful weapon for prosecutors is now in the hands of Fani Willis
The prosecutors’ relationship, if confirmed, has little, if anything, to do with their attitude toward the defendants; it may have affected Willis’ initial decision to appoint Wade, but beyond that, it has no logical impact on how they are making decisions in the case. Whatever affection the prosecutors may have for each other would not lead them to treat any of the defendants too harshly — it does not give them an ax to grind. Nor, for that matter, would it lead them to treat the defendants too leniently.
In a court filing, Roman asserted that Willis appointed Wade not because he was the best lawyer to serve as special prosecutor, but because of her affection for him. If so, such an appointment does not explain why either Willis or Wade might treat the defendants unfairly or abuse their authority in the criminal case.
Wade answers to Willis, but there’s nothing in the fact of a relationship that would prejudice him against a defendant. Ditto Willis: Her fondness for Wade wouldn’t affect her exercise of discretion regarding the defendants. (Four of the 19 defendants in the Georgia case have pleaded guilty, while Trump and the rest have maintained not guilty pleas.)
If anyone has the right to complain, it is not the defendants, but the county and the public. Willis may have engaged in nepotism (as when President John F. Kennedy appointed his brother Robert Kennedy to be US attorney general or when Trump appointed his daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner to positions in his presidential administration).
Related article Opinion: America needs Trump’s election subversion trial to be televised
Willis may have picked Wade not (or not only) because he is a terrific trial lawyer but because of her personal affection for him. If so, she may have violated state or local anti-nepotism or conflict of interest laws.
Indeed, Fulton County Commissioner Bob Ellis, a Republican, has raised questions about whether Willis misused county funds for her benefit after allegations emerged in Wade’s divorce proceedings that he paid for airline tickets for Willis to accompany him on out-of-state trips. Wade has earned more than $650,000 from the case over the past two years, according to Roman’s court filing. In a letter to Willis, Ellis also asserted that Wade lacks “relevant prosecutorial experience in a case of this type and complexity.”
Republicans at both the state and national levels are investigating the allegations. House Republicans are asking Wade to turn over any communications with federal investigators, the House January 6 committee and other executive branch agencies, including the White House. A state senator has filed legislation to create a special panel to investigate Willis.

Of course, if the allegations are true, Willis’ selection of Wade would be a colossal misjudgment, even if she violated no state or local law. Such a misstep would raise questions about the quality of Willis’ judgment in general. By appointing Wade, she may have turned a personal relationship into a personally embarrassing public issue in a high-profile criminal case. And she would be handing the defendants an issue to raise in a pretrial motion that, regardless of how it is decided, would delay the proceedings. Surely, there was at least one other skillful trial lawyer in Georgia who could have been appointed, thereby avoiding these problems.
But the judge should not linger over Roman’s motion, because the defendants have no legal reason to complain to the court or to seek some sort of judicial remedy such as removing the prosecutors. If Willis had picked a less-than-capable lawyer, which seems unlikely, the defendants would be beneficiaries of her misjudgment, not victims of it. They cannot plausibly claim that they are being prosecuted unfairly on account of the prosecutors’ alleged relationship with each other, whatever it may turn out to be."
6R3N8OQ2MF_AS82IL5LHSBDTFF,Why are measles cases popping up across the United States? Here’s what to know about the highly contagious virus,"By Amanda Musa and Carma Hassan, CNN","7 minute read Updated 3:13 PM EST, Mon January 29, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/23/health/measles-cases-xpn-wellness/,"Nearly two dozen cases of measles have been reported since December 1, according to an alert from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. International travel, coupled with declining global vaccination rates, is probably behind this spate of cases, experts say.
The Philadelphia Department of Public Health has confirmed at least nine cases of measles over the past month after a person contracted the highly contagious virus outside the United States and exposed a parent and child at a children’s hospital, according to health department spokesperson James Garrow. That exposure then led to a Philadelphia day care outbreak that includes at least five children.

Health officials in Virginia are also warning people who recently traveled out of two D.C.-area airports – Dulles International Airport on January 3 and Reagan Washington National Airport on January 4 – of potential exposure to the virus after someone returning to the US from abroad traveled through Northern Virginia.
Additionally, a single case of measles has been confirmed in “an unvaccinated resident of the metro Atlanta area,” the Georgia Department of Public Health announced this month.
“The individual was exposed to measles while traveling out of the country,” a news release said. “DPH is working to identify anyone who may have had contact with the individual while they were infectious.”
It’s not only the United States. In the UK, a measles outbreak continues to widen: As of January 18, there have been 216 confirmed cases and 103 probable cases reported since October. The UK Health Security Agency has declared a national incident to signal the growing public health risk.
“It’s always concerning when we have a case of measles because of the probability that it’s going to spread to other individuals,” said Dr. Thomas Murray, a professor of pediatrics at the Yale School of Medicine who focuses on infectious diseases and global health.
“About 90% of susceptible people who are exposed will come down with signs and symptoms of the disease, so it’s very contagious.”
Measles was eliminated in the United States in 2000, after zero virus spread for more than a year, largely due to a “highly effective vaccination campaign,” according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

However, clusters in the US are still possible because the virus is not eliminated worldwide. There are several countries with active outbreaks.
“Many of the diseases for which we have vaccines have virtually disappeared from the United States but certainly not in other places around the world,” Murray said.
If an unvaccinated person goes to a country where a disease is still common, becomes infected and brings it back to the US, Murray notes, they can spread the virus to other unvaccinated people.
“There’s a lot of travel back and forth,” he said. “If there are pockets of unvaccinated individuals that are congregating closely together and that disease gets introduced into that population, you can have large clusters of cases.”
Vaccination rates in the US also remain low, particularly among children, according to American Academy of Pediatrics spokesperson Dr. Christina Johns, a Maryland-based pediatric emergency physician at a PM Pediatric Care urgent care.
The CDC noted in its alert that the majority of the measles cases “were among children and adolescents who had not received a measles-containing vaccine (MMR or MMRV), even if age eligible.”
About 92% of US children have been vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella (called the MMR vaccine) by age 2, according to a 2023 report from the CDC – below the federal target of 95%.

The percentage of kindergartners who got their state-required vaccines for measles also remained below the federal target for the 2022-23 school year, according to CDC data. And the rate of vaccine exemptions for children has reached the highest level ever reported in the US.
Children should get two doses of the MMR vaccine, according to the CDC: the first dose at 12 to 15 months of age and the second at 4 to 6 years of age.
Before the nation’s measles vaccination program, about 3 million to 4 million people got the virus every year, and about 400 to 500 died.
The last significant measles outbreak in the US was in 2018-19 in Rockland County, New York, focused among unvaccinated children in Orthodox Jewish communities.
Although the CDC reported only 56 measles cases in 2023, Johns says that is too many when a highly effective vaccine exists.
“Most people haven’t seen a case of measles,” she stressed. “They don’t really have an appreciation for the severity of the illness.”
The measles virus can spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes, lingering in the air for up to two hours after they leave a room, according to Murray. The virus can also live on surfaces such as doorknobs for about the same amount of time.

When symptoms begin, they’re similar to those of many respiratory illnesses – high fever, cough, red eyes, runny nose and congestion – followed by a “fairly characteristic” rash, Murray said.
“You get flat red lesions, flat red spots that typically start on your face and move down across the body across the chest and trunk and extremities,” he said. “It can be a total body rash, and it’s pretty severe.”
The incubation period for measles is very long, Murray adds. It takes about 10 to 12 days for initial symptoms to appear after exposure.
Because of this, most infected people assume their respiratory symptoms are nothing but a cold until the rash appears three to five days after the initial illness begins, according to Murray. Even then, most people – including some doctors – will not recognize a measles rash.
“Infected people are contagious from 4 days before the rash starts through 4 days afterwards,” the CDC says.
“The younger the health care provider, the less likely they are to have seen a case,” Murray said. “But certainly, when it’s circulating, we do everything we can to get the word out on what to look for.”
The CDC advises health-care workers to isolate patients who may have measles in specific isolation rooms or private rooms instead of having them waiting in common areas; to test patients with suspected cases; and promptly alert state and local health departments.
Lower MMR vaccination rates can put unvaccinated and undervaccinated individuals at risk, Johns says, especially children and those with immune system problems.
Measles can lead to serious complications, especially in children under 2, such as blindness, encephalitis or inflammation of the brain, and severe pneumonia, according to Murray.
“Measles is also a virus that knocks down parts of the immune system,” he said. “There’s recent evidence that having measles increases your susceptibility to other infections.”
A rare complication called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis can also happen seven to 10 years after infection and may result in seizures as well as behavioral and mental deterioration.
Additionally, someone who doesn’t get the MMR vaccine is at risk of contracting mumps and rubella, which are rare but still in circulation in the US due to international travel.
In 2023, 436 mumps cases were reported by 42 jurisdictions, according to CDC data. Rubella is less common, with fewer than 10 people in the US getting the virus each year.
If you’re fully vaccinated against measles, your chance of infection after exposure is very low because the two childhood doses typically confer lifelong immunity, experts say.
Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.
“It’s not impossible, but it’s very, very low,” Murray notes.
But for people who aren’t unvaccinated or who have weak immune systems, the risk increases – “especially if they know they’re in an area where measles has been circulating,” he said. “In that case, what you would do is, you would call your health care provider and work with [them] to determine next steps.”
If you think you might have been exposed to measles, stay home until a plan is in place, Murray advises.
“Call ahead before you go to any health care facility, because that health care facility can anticipate your arrival and make sure you are placed in the appropriate isolation rooms,” Murray said. “The last thing we want to do is have someone with measles sitting in the emergency room waiting room.”
Unvaccinated people who know when they were exposed can get the MMR vaccine within 72 hours of exposure to prevent the disease altogether or lessen the severity of the illness, Murray adds.
As for treatment, the virus simply has to run its course, he says. There is no specific antiviral treatment, and medical care is mainly supportive: staying home from school or work to rest and drink plenty of fluids.
If a person infected with measles is showing symptoms of encephalitis, such as a headache, high fever or seizures, they should be taken to a hospital immediately.
“Typically, hospitalization for measles occurs when children are in respiratory distress from lung involvement like pneumonia or are dehydrated and need IV fluids,” Johns said.
Severe measles cases among children can also be treated with vitamin A, according to the CDC, to support the immune system.
“Vitamin A should be administered immediately on diagnosis and repeated the next day,” the agency said.

6S2LZI1LX9_AL5YUZDF7JAC1RS,China’s wild week in markets: Calm returns but big challenges remain,"Analysis by Laura He, CNN","4 minute read Updated 7:03 AM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/26/investing/china-stock-market-slump-challenges-intl-hnk/,"Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter, which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.
It’s been a rollercoaster week for stocks trading in mainland China and Hong Kong.
Key market indexes plunged Monday, taking year-to-date losses to between 7% and 10% and extending a protracted $6 trillion-dollar rout that began in 2021.
Then, following a series of unusual interventions and announcement by worried Chinese officials, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index (HSI) rebounded to end the week up 4.2%, while the blue-chip Shanghai Shenzhen CSI300 logged a 2% weekly gain.
Does the rally mark an end to the country’s three-year long market meltdown? Analysts say not just yet. A slew of economic problems — including a record downturn in real estate, deflation, debt, a falling birthrate and shrinking work force — haven’t gone away, and they will limit longer term gains.
“Over the past 48 hours, China has announced a flurry of measures to support its economy and financials markets,” Nomura analysts said on Thursday. “We think these measures are likely to stabilize stock market sentiment and could potentially even support a relief rally in China stocks, given extremely low valuations, very light investor positioning, and technically oversold markets.”
China is facing a myriad of economic problems, including rising debt levels and worsening demographics. Beijing’s shift towards ideology-driven policies have also scared away foreign firms and investors and soured relations with the United States.
Without progress in tackling some of those deep-seated challenges, investors are likely to remain on the sidelines and markets will continue to drift.
“For a sustained rally in China stocks, we think China will need to address the core of these concerns (predominantly property sector issues and US-China tensions),” the analysts added.
The measures Beijing took this week to boost the stock market were surprising because they mark a rapid turnaround from the previous week, when Premier Li Qiang dashed hopes of major stimulus measures in a speech in Davos, Switzerland. But that was before shares tanked.
On Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that Chinese authorities were considering ordering state-owned enterprises to use money held in offshore accounts to buy shares worth as much as 2 trillion yuan ($282 billion).
A day later, in an unprecedented move, regulators said they were considering evaluating the performance of the heads of state-owned companies based on their stock market value.
The move was aimed at guiding executives “to pay more attention” to their companies’ share prices and to use “methods such as increasing holdings and share buybacks to stabilize market expectations,” a spokesperson for the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission told reporters in Beijing.
On the same day, Li Yunze, director of the recently-established National Administration of Financial Regulation (NAFR), vowed at an international financial conference in Hong Kong to further open its $64 trillion financial industry to international investors.
Hours later, Pan Gongsheng, the governor of the People’s Bank of China, unexpectedly announced that the central bank would slash the amount of cash banks are required to hold as reserves, which could provide one trillion yuan ($141 billion) in long-term liquidity to the economy.
“All these measures were unexpected and likely prompted by the significant rout seen in stock markets recently,” Nomura analysts said, adding that stronger actions were likely to follow.
The measures worked. By the end of Thursday, the HSI had risen for three days in a row, up a combined 8.4%. The CSI300 gained 4% during the same period.
In the 7 days to January 24, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking Chinese stocks recorded large inflows of $12.6 billion, according to a Citi survey of global fund managers. Over the previous week, $2.3 billion flowed out of those funds.
Beijing’s determination to support the equity markets has been successful and the gains could continue, analysts from Enodo Economics said Friday.
“An equity upturn could run a few quarters, especially if [it] leads to foreign investors reassessing their severely underweight China position,” they said.
Still, investors have been fleeing Chinese stocks over a much longer period because they are worried about the country’s economic prospects.
As of January, mainland China had seen six months of consecutive outflows, with foreign institutional investors selling a total of $30 billion of shares listed on mainland Chinese exchanges, a HSBC survey showed on Friday.
“We do not think the market rescue package [in recent days] can change the economic fundamental, that is, weak aggregate demand,” said Raymond Yeung, chief economist for Greater China at ANZ Research.
Deflation is haunting the Chinese economy, which has grappled with weak prices for many months. The country is facing the prospect of a vicious cycle whereby lower demand leads to lower investment, lower production and lower income, thus causing even lower demand.
“A wholesale reflation strategy like the one [at] the end of 2015 is required to avert assert price deflation,” Yeung said, referring to a series of stimulus measures rolled out over several months to support the economy. It included a number of initiatives aimed at reviving home buying.
He called the rescue measures announced this week “piecemeal” and “reactive,” saying they would not be sufficient to fix the economic problems in the longer term."
6SPY4FWEHH_AWBBOT98Z1S8ZL5,These Japanese beef croquettes are so popular there’s a 43-year waitlist,"By Maggie Hiufu Wong, CNN","6 minute read Published 8:42 PM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/travel/japanese-kobe-beef-croquettes-43-year-wait-list-intl-hnk/,"If you order a box of frozen Kobe beef croquettes from Asahiya, a family-run butcher shop in Takasago City in western Japan’s Hyogo Prefecture, it’ll take another 43 years before you receive your order.
That isn’t a typo. Forty. Three. Years.
Founded in 1926, Asahiya sold meat products from Hyogo prefecture – Kobe beef included – for decades before adding beef croquettes to the shelf in the years following WWII.
But it wasn’t until the early 2000s that these deep-fried potato and beef dumplings became an internet sensation, resulting in the ridiculously long wait buyers now face.
CNN Travel spoke to Shigeru Nitta, third-generation owner of Asahiya, in 2022. At that time, the wait for the croquettes was a mere 30 years.
The highly coveted “Extreme Croquettes” are one of four types of Kobe beef croquettes available at Asahiya. Can’t wait nearly four decades? The shop’s Premier Kobe Beef Croquettes currently have a more palatable four-year waitlist.
“We started selling our products through online shopping in 1999,” Nitta said. “At that time, we offered Extreme Croquettes as a trial.”
Growing up in Hyogo, Nitta has been visiting the local ranches and beef auctions with his father since he was young.
He took over the shop from his father in 1994 when he was 30 years old.
After experimenting with e-commerce for a few years, he realized customers were hesitant to pay a hefty sum for prime beef online.
That was when he made a bold decision.
“We sold Extreme Croquettes at the price of JPY270 ($1.80) per piece… The beef in them alone costs about JPY400 ($2.70) per piece,” Nitta explained.
“We made affordable and tasty croquettes that demonstrate the concept of our shop as a strategy to have customers enjoy the croquettes and then hope that they would buy our Kobe beef after the first try.”
To limit the financial loss in the beginning, Asahiya only produced 200 croquettes in their own kitchen next to their shop each week.
“We sell the beef raised by the people we know. Our shop only sells meat that was produced in Hyogo Prefecture, whether it’s Kobe beef, Kobe pork or Tajima chicken. This has been the style of the shop since before I became the owner,” said Nitta.
In fact, Nitta’s grandfather used to ride to Sanda – another famous Wagyu-breeding area in Hyogo – by bike with a handcart to pick up the produce himself.
“Since around that period our shop had connections with local beef producers, so we did not have to get them from outside the prefecture,” Nitta added.

The cheap price tag of the Extreme Croquettes flies in the face of the quality of the ingredients. They’re made fresh daily with no preservatives. Ingredients include three-year-old female A5-ranked Kobe beef and potatoes sourced from a local ranch.
Nitta said that he has encouraged the ranch to use cow manure to grow the potatoes. The stems of the potatoes will then be fed to the cows, creating a cycle.
Eventually, his unique concept caught the attention of locals and media. When a report about Asahiya’s croquettes came out in the early 2000s, their popularity skyrocketed.
“We stopped selling them in 2016 because the waiting time became over 14 years. We were thinking of stopping orders, but we got many calls requesting to keep offering them,” Nitta said.
Asahiya resumed accepting orders for these croquettes in 2017 but raised the price.
“At that time, we raised the price to JPY500 ($3.40)-JPY540 ($3.65) with consumption tax. But since the export of Kobe beef began, the prices of beef have doubled, so the fact that the production of croquettes makes a deficit has not changed,” said Nitta.
Production has also been boosted from 200 croquettes a week to 200 per day.
“In reality, the Extreme Croquettes got way more popular than other products,” Nitta chuckled, laughing at his own money-losing business idea.
“We hear that we should hire more people and make croquettes more quickly, but I think there is no shop owner who hires employees and produce more to make more deficit… I feel sorry for having them wait. I do want to make croquettes quickly and send them as soon as possible, but if I do, the shop will go bankrupt.”
Fortunately, Nitta said that about half of the people who try the croquettes end up ordering their Kobe beef, so it’s a sound marketing strategy.

Each box of Extreme Croquettes, which includes five pieces, sells for JPY2,700 ($18.20).
The shop sends a regular newsletter to waiting customers updating them on the latest shipping estimate.
A week before the delivery date, the shop will confirm the delivery with the patient customers once again.
“Of course, some people have changed their email addresses. For those people, we call them directly and let them know the delivery date. They can change their address themselves through our website or when we call them, they can let us know,” explained Nitta.
Customers receiving croquettes these days placed their orders about 10 years ago. There are currently 63,000 people in ‘line’ as of January 2024.
Having a 40-plus-year list of unprofitable orders to fulfill can be stressful, especially as the price of Kobe beef and labor continues to rise.
But something more important has encouraged Nitta to keep going.
“When I started selling croquettes on the internet, I got many orders from remote isolated islands. Most of them had heard of Kobe beef on TV but had never had them because they had to go to cities if they want to try it. I realized that there were so many people who have never had Kobe beef.
“For that reason, I continued offering croquettes as a trial and get more orders for Kobe beef if they liked it. That was why I started it in the first place, so I didn’t really care if it was a deficit,” said Nitta.
One of the most memorable moments was when they got an order from a cancer patient who was about to go through surgery while waiting for their Extreme Croquettes.
“I heard that our croquettes were the patient’s motivation to go through surgery. That surprised me the most,” said Nitta.
The patient survived and has placed multiple orders since then.
Nitta received a call from the patient who told him “I hope to live long without reccurrence of cancer” after sampling his croquettes.
“I still remember that. I was moved by the comment,” said Nitta.
By letting more people enjoy Kobe beef, he hopes that the fame of these croquettes will help promote the local industry.
“I’m grateful. By becoming famous, I think I can help the whole industry, not just my shop, by making people who have not been interested in Kobe beef get interested. I want to have as many people as possible eat Kobe beef – not just from my shop,” said Nitta.

Asahiya now has two locations: their original store at Takasago City and a shop in Kobe city. Its frozen beef croquettes are only shipped domestically.
Though Asahiya primarily operates as a butcher, Nitta says travelers can visit their Kobe shop, where they sell two types of ready-to-eat takeaway snacks, called “Tor Road” and “Kitanozaka” croquettes, named after nearby streets.
“Kitanozaka” uses lean beef and is priced at JPY360 ($2.40) each. “Tor Road” uses short loin and chuck, and costs JPY460 ($3.10)."
6TC7M0RCFT_6HQ21BDVJM7J99I,Why both South Africa and Israel are welcoming the UN court’s ruling in a landmark genocide case,"Analysis by Nadeen Ebrahim and Abbas Al Lawati, CNN","4 minute read Updated 10:13 AM EST, Sat January 27, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/26/middleeast/israel-genocide-case-icj-ruling-analysis-mime-intl/,"Editor’s Note: A version of this story appears in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here.
A historic ruling by the United Nations’ top court in a genocide case against Israel on Friday was welcomed by the three main parties it involved: Israel, South Africa and the Palestinians. But at the same time, no one got what they asked for.
The International Court of Justice in The Hague, the Netherlands, ordered Israel to “take all measures” to prevent genocide in Gaza after South Africa accused Israel of violating international laws on genocide in its war in the territory.
It rejected Israel’s request for the case to be thrown out, but it also stopped short of ordering Israel to halt the war as South Africa has asked.
“I would have wanted a ceasefire,” said South African foreign minister Naledi Pandor after the ruling in The Hague. She said that she was still satisfied with the outcome.
Israel went to war with Hamas in Gaza after the Palestinian militant group launched a brutal attack on the country on October 7, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 people hostage.
The war has resulted in the death of more than 26,000 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, and left much of the enclave in ruins. Israel has pledged not to stop its campaign until all the remaining hostages are released and Hamas is destroyed.

The case at the ICJ marks  the first time Israel has been brought before the court on accusations of violating the 1948 UN Genocide Convention, which was drafted in part due to the mass killings of Jewish people in the Holocaust during the Second World War.
Still, many Israelis hailed the ruling on Friday as a win for the Jewish state. Eylon Levi, an Israeli government spokesperson, said the court “dismissed (South Africa’s) ridiculous demand to tell Israel to stop defending its people and fighting for the hostages.” Avi Mayer, the former editor in chief of the Jerusalem Post called it “a devastating blow to those accusing the Jewish state of ‘genocide’.”
“The most dramatic thing is that no ceasefire was ordered,” Shelly Aviv Yeini, head of the international law department at the Hostages and Missing Persons Families Forum, told CNN, adding that a potential ceasefire order was Israel’s biggest fear, especially as it would have come as over a hundred hostages remain in Gaza.
The discourse in Israel has so far focused on only ending the war once the hostages are freed, she said, adding that Israel would have “struggled to live” with a ceasefire order that doesn’t guarantee the return of the captives.
“So, I think this is quite (an) expected outcome, and something that Israel will be able to comply with,” she said, adding that the court’s order for Israel to deliver humanitarian aid and report back to the ICJ on its actions is “doable.”
Despite the outcome being perceived by some as being in Israel’s favor, experts warned of the reputational damage faced by the Jewish state.
“I would not call it a win, but I would say it could have been worse,” Robbie Sabel, professor of international law at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, told CNN. “The fact that in public eyes there’ll be an association that Israel’s acts could have led to genocide, clearly this is harmful public relations.”
Friday’s measure was an interim measure by the ICJ as the court considers a full ruling on whether Israel is guilty of violating the Genocide Convention. That ruling could take years.
Sabel said that while he is “absolutely convinced” that the ICJ will eventually find Israel not guilty of genocide, he worries that by that time “the public may have forgotten that.”
“If they had asked us to stop defending ourselves, we would have had a problem, and at least we don’t have that problem,” he said.
Yeini said it was nonetheless a “a very dark day” in Israel’s history.
For some Palestinians, however, the court’s ruling didn’t go far enough.
Mohammed el-Kurd, a Palestinian activist from Jerusalem, said the ICJ failed on South Africa’s “most important request” to suspend the military operations. “Not shocking, but stings nonetheless,” he said on X, formerly Twitter.
“Until the Israeli regime’s genocidal assault on Gaza stops, we should keep protesting and disrupting in every way possible. This is today’s lesson,” he said.

6WETF5JZRL_P75X3D9K8P452JF,Opinion: Three ways to help millennials overcome the cost of living crisis,Opinion by Jill Filipovic,"8 minute read Published 2:26 PM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240122,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/22/opinions/millennials-cost-of-living-crisis-filipovic/,"Editor’s Note: Jill Filipovic is a journalist based in New York and author of the book “OK Boomer, Let’s Talk: How My Generation Got Left Behind.” Follow her on Twitter. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely her own. View more opinion on CNN.
Millennials, as you’ve have probably heard, have gotten pretty screwed.
By some accounts, we’re the most educated generation in American history, but also underwater with educational debt. We haven’t amassed the kind of wealth our parents had at our age, and it’s unclear whether we’ll ever catch up. We’ve been slower to purchase homes in part because Baby Boomers won’t sell theirs, and so we’re throwing our hard-earned cash away on skyrocketing rents, which in turn puts saving for a 20% down payment further out of reach. We’re so financially stressed that we can’t afford to have kids, and by staying childless we’re breaking our Boomer parents’ hearts.
I wrote an entire book on the plight of Millennials, on the many advantages Boomers enjoyed and then hoarded for themselves, and what Boomers and Millennials alike don’t understand about each other. There is much doom and gloom to be found in nearly all of the reporting about Millennial life, and things aren’t looking much better for Gen Z and younger generations. But there are also tremendous opportunities. American Boomers enjoyed unprecedented wealth and opportunity not just out of sheer luck or even sheer numbers, but because the government made unprecedented investments in them: in their education, in their health, in their ability to live independently.
Our country could do the same for Millennials. It may, frankly, be too little, too late for many of us. But it could ensure that the Millennial generation is an unfortunate aberration, and that future generations return to a path of prosperity and upward mobility.
The “how to fix it” list could itself fill an entire book. But here are three priorities:
One of the more troubling shifts of the past American decade has been the broad loss of faith in higher education. While 74% of young adults a decade ago agreed that a college degree is very important, only 41% say the same today. Nearly half of Gen Zers say that a high school diploma or GED is sufficient to ensure financial security. And they were the least likely among generations to say that colleges and universities are having a positive effect “on the way things are going in this country today.”
Perhaps unsurprisingly, a smaller proportion of high schoolers are continuing on to college. It’s a decline not seen around the rest of the developed world, where higher education is expanding. At its core, this uniquely American rejection of higher education seems to be about value: Given all we’ve heard about how even well-educated Millennials struggle financially, the price tag on a degree in the US just doesn’t seem worth it.
The truth is, of course, more complicated. A college degree does mean, on average, significantly better wages, and graduates of elite universities do best of all. Those higher wages, though, can be offset by debt. And people who take out loans to go to college but don’t graduate see the worst of both worlds: lower wages and higher debt.
Related article What broke the American Dream for Millennials
Jobs that require a college degree are also likely to remain higher-paying, while those that do not seem to be in a race to the wage bottom. Life for Americans without a college degree has become more perilous by a range of measures: This is the group most likely to perish from “deaths of despair” and to live in communities rife with alcoholism, substance abuse and financial struggle. And American economic growth and global competitiveness both require a workforce with plenty of college graduates.
This is not a problem that one-time student loan forgiveness is going to solve. We need massive state and federal investment in education: in higher education, to make college much more affordable, and in K-12 education, to ensure that where a child grows up doesn’t limit her prospects for college and beyond. The federal government needs to regulate the student loan industry and end the proliferation of predatory and exploitative for-profit educational institutions. Not every student needs to go to an Ivy League school, but every student should have access to an affordable, high-quality four-year education near their homes.
This is largely a solved problem across Europe. We could make it happen here in the US, too. Doing so would benefit young adults, of course, who could graduate without the weight of five- or six-figure debt weighing them down from the start. But it would also benefit the nation as a whole, equipping us with a more sophisticated workforce better prepared for the technological evolutions of the coming decades.
From my vantage point, the single highest barrier to Millennial economic stability is child care. Millennials are now squarely within childbearing age, and while many of us are forgoing children, most of us are or will be parents – but we’re having fewer children than women of previous generations, and we’re having them later. The reasons behind that are complex, but cost is certainly among them: The United States has some of the highest child care costs in the world.
And that isn’t because American kids are getting better-than-average care; it’s because our government simply doesn’t invest in it. The US government spends, on average, $500 per child per year on early childhood care costs. The average spent among OECD countries is $14,436.
Affordable, high-quality, universal child care helps mothers, and particularly low-income mothers, to stay in the workforce, which pays dividends for their families. Child care programs help to prepare kids for school and may keep them more active and socially engaged. As it stands, screens have become a stopgap measure for poor families, with kids in low-income households spending many more hours looking at them than kids in more affluent ones – something that was exacerbated during the pandemic.
Related article Boomers won’t part with their homes, and that’s a problem for young families
Social conservatives often prefer that mothers leave the labor force and stay home with their children, which is one reason there has been such broad resistance to universal child care on the American right. The demand that women stay home seems to be based more on nostalgia and gender traditionalism than evidence, of which there’s plenty, that working mothers bring significant benefits to their children, to themselves and to national economies.
The reality, for many American families, isn’t a well-paid dad who can support a family on a single income and a mom whose primary aspiration is to dedicate herself to raising children, were it not for manipulative feminists and scheming liberals who pressure her into the workforce. Much more often, reality is a complicated mix of mothers who want many sources of purpose and gratification, as well as the freedom and pride that financial independence brings; couples who need two incomes in order to raise their children in financial stability; and single moms who are the only person bringing home the bacon.
All of these groups would benefit hugely from free or affordable child care. It would radically decrease the stress American parents live under, it would enable parents to provide a higher standard of living for their children and it would give children a leg up.
It might also make having a child, or having an additional child, feel possible for a greater number of young people.
America’s housing system is broken, and not just because so many Millennials can’t afford homes. Millennials drove re-urbanization as many of us graduated college and moved to cities instead of returning to the small towns or suburban enclaves in which we were raised. But those cities simply don’t have enough housing units, especially affordable rentals for low-income people or starter homes (and even starter apartments) for those taking a big step into adult life. This housing shortage has expanded out into the suburbs and even rural areas.
This wasn’t the case for Boomers, in large part because the government invested in a massive expansion of housing stock during their early years. The federal government could do the same now, expanding tax credits and voucher programs. Cities could embrace growth and build, and tax homeowners who do not live in or rent out their units. States could expand aid to first-time homebuyers, ideally lowering closing costs for real estate purchases and making that so-hard-to-amass 20% down payment more doable.

And this is very pie-in-the-sky, but the US is far overdue for a total overhaul in property taxation. We are vastly over-reliant on property taxes for government revenue, which poses a big problem for homeowners who are just scraping by, as well as for retirees who may have paid off their homes but still owe a hefty tax bill every year. Property tax costs are inevitably passed down to renters, who also wind up paying more. And local property taxes, in turn, contribute to wildly unequal funding schemes for public schools, the outcome of which is that the kids in the richest enclaves also enjoy the best public educations — better-paid teachers, nicer facilities, smaller classes, updated textbooks, advanced science equipment, college and mental health counselors — while kids in poorer areas receive far less investment and far fewer educational resources.
This, too, hurts young families, who may spend beyond their means to get their kids in to a decent school district, or who see their children’s opportunities drastically diminished simply because a parent doesn’t make enough to move to a tony neighborhood. And it hurts children, who are, after all, future adults, keeping those who already come from challenging backgrounds at an even greater disadvantage, while giving the best-off an additional leg up. That’s fuel for growing inequality, and a compounding of the problems Millennials face for future generations.
There is much more than should be — could be, must be — done to help Millennials and the generations after us achieve the American dream (or at least financial stability). But there’s no time to waste. The oldest Millennials are in our early 40s, and the window to improve our future is rapidly narrowing. We may indeed wind up left behind. But the US can also refuse to repeat these mistakes and instead choose to invest in something better for the generations that come next."
6WVIRSHKY9_8NNKPTTMCLZRFAT,Arizona GOP chair resigns amid leaked Kari Lake audio controversy,"By Eric Bradner, CNN","5 minute read Updated 10:56 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/24/politics/arizona-republican-chairman-resigns-kari-lake/,"The chairman of the Arizona Republican Party said Wednesday he is resigning, claiming he was doing so amid pressure from GOP Senate candidate Kari Lake.
Jeff DeWit’s resignation comes after The Daily Mail published an audio recording of a conversation between DeWit and Lake in which he explained to her that there were financial benefits to staying out of the state’s 2024 Senate race. DeWit said Lake threatened to release a “more damaging” audio recording if he did not resign Wednesday.
Lake senior advisers Caroline Wren and Garrett Ventry described DeWit as making “false claims.”
“No one from the Kari Lake campaign threatened or blackmailed DeWit,” Wren and Ventry said in a statement. “It is unfortunate that Dewit hasn’t recognized how unethical his behavior was and still hasn’t apologized to Arizona Republicans.”
DeWit, a former Trump campaign chief operating officer and NASA chief financial officer, said that the conversation had taken place in Lake’s home 10 months ago, while she was an employee of his private business.
In a statement posted Wednesday by the Arizona Republican Party on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, DeWit said he believes he “was set up” in a bid by Lake “to have control over the state party.”

“This morning, I was determined to fight for my position. However, a few hours ago, I received an ultimatum from Lake’s team: resign today or face the release of a new, more damaging recording. I am truly unsure of its contents, but considering our numerous past open conversations as friends, I have decided not to take the risk. I am resigning as Lake requested, in the hope that she will honor her commitment to cease her attacks, allowing me to return to the business sector — a field I find much more logical and prefer over politics,” DeWit said in the statement.
In the audio recording published Tuesday, DeWit says he was asked by “very powerful people” from “back east” whether there are companies that could put Lake on their payroll and keep her from running. He also says he would like to see a “fresh face” in the Senate race.
“Is there a number at which,” DeWit begins to ask in the audio recording.
“I can be bought? That’s what it’s about,” Lake interjects.
“Not be bought,” DeWit says. “You can take a pause for a couple of years. Then go right back to what you’re doing.”
“No,” she says. “$10 million, $20 million, $30, no. $1 billion, no. This is not about money, this is about our country.”
“The tape speaks for itself: The Arizona GOP Chairman Jeff DeWit attempted to bribe Kari Lake,” Lake’s aides, Wren and Ventry, said. “Thankfully Kari is an extremely ethical person who rejected DeWit’s multiple attempts to offer her money and corporate board seats in exchange for Kari not running for public office. She will be an incredible senator for Arizonans.”
Lake said in a livestreamed campaign event on Wednesday she thought DeWit’s conduct on the recording was “disgusting” and said she felt DeWit “did a horrible job” as head of the Arizona GOP.
“It came very late,” Lake said of DeWit’s resignation letter, which was released Wednesday afternoon. “I didn’t see an apology to the people of Arizona. He tried to act like the behavior you heard on that audio is normal communication amongst friends. It’s disgusting.”
“I think he did a horrible job, and he should have just apologized, resigned and apologized and said he’s going to work to do better,” she added.
The former Arizona gubernatorial candidate did not respond to the allegations made by DeWit in his resignation letter in which he claimed Lake threatened to release a “more damaging” recording if he did not resign on Wednesday.
In his resignation statement, DeWit said, “Contrary to the accusations of bribery, my discussions were transparent and intended to offer perspective, not coercion.”
DeWit’s resignation is the latest chapter in years of turmoil atop the Arizona GOP, which has been divided between onetime establishment Republicans and a faction aligned with Donald Trump that is committed to pursuing the former president’s false claims of widespread fraud in the 2020 election.
A former Arizona state treasurer, DeWit was seen as a bridge between those factions – in part because of his work for Trump’s campaign and administration – when he was tapped as state GOP chairman in January 2023.
He said his conversation with Lake was “intended to offer perspective, not coercion,” adding that it had been an “open, unguarded exchange between friends in the living room of her house.” DeWit said he advised Lake, who lost the 2022 gubernatorial race, to seek the governor’s office again in 2026 instead of running for the Senate seat of independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema.
Since that conversation, he said, Lake “has been on a mission to destroy me.”
“The release of our conversation by Lake confirms a disturbing tendency to exploit private interactions for personal gain and increases concerns about her habit of secretly recording personal and private conversations. This is obviously a concern given how much interaction she has with high profile people including President Trump,” DeWit said. “I question how effective a United States Senator can be when they cannot be trusted to engage in private and confidential conversations.”
Arizona is poised to play a pivotal role in 2024 as one of the nation’s most competitive presidential battlegrounds, and with a key Senate race on the ballot, as well.
Lake is among several GOP contenders for the seat currently held by Sinema, who has not yet said whether she will seek reelection. The leading Democratic candidate for the seat is US Rep. Ruben Gallego.

The men – Noah Roush and Jatonia Bryant – were found missing around 10:30 a.m. Monday from the Dub Brassell Adult Detention Center in Pine Bluff – a city about 40 miles south of Little Rock, the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office said in a release.
Bryant, 23, was being held on probable cause for capital murder, and Roush, 22, was being held on probable cause for residential burglary and theft, according to the sheriff’s office. Roush is also a suspect in a homicide, it added.
“Both individuals are to be considered dangerous and should only be approached (by) law enforcement personnel,” the sheriff’s office warned.
The sheriff’s office is offering a reward of $2,500 per escaped inmate for any information leading up to the apprehension and return to custody of Roush and Bryant, it said in a release. As of 6 p.m. Wednesday, the two inmates are still on the run, the sheriff’s office said.
On Monday, authorities said the pair is believed to have escaped in the last 48 hours.
Bryant is 5’11,” Black and weighs approximately 145 pounds, the release said. Roush is 6’2”, White, approximately 180 pounds and has a scar on the right side of his head, it said.
The sheriff’s office is working with several agencies to track down the inmates, including the Arkansas State Police and state Department of Corrections.
Anyone with information about the men’s whereabouts or or who may have assisted in the escape are encouraged to reach out to the sheriff’s department.
Correction: An earlier version of this story had the wrong day for when the inmates' escape was discovered. They were found to be missing on Monday."

The 12 countries/members of OPEC: Algeria, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Venezuela.
The following countries have the world’s largest reserves of oil as of 2021, according to the US Energy Information Administration:
– Venezuela - 304 billion barrels
– Saudi Arabia - 259 billion barrels
– Iran - 209 billion barrels
– Canada - 170 billion barrels (non OPEC country)
– Iraq - 145 billion barrels
– Kuwait - 102 billion barrels
– United Arab Emirates - 98 billion barrels
– Russia - 80 billion barrels (non OPEC country)
– Libya - 48 billion barrels
– United States - 44 billion barrels as of December 2021 (non OPEC country)
– Nigeria - 37 billion barrels
In 2022, the United States produced about 11.911 million barrels of crude oil per day.
The United States leads the world in total petroleum production, ahead of Saudi Arabia and Russia in 2022.
The United States consumed an average of 20.01 million barrels of petroleum per day in 2022.
The United States is the world’s largest consumer of petroleum products.
In 2022, for the third consecutive year since at least 1949, the United States exported more petroleum than it imported. About 60% of gross petroleum imports comes from Canada.
US dependence on imported oil peaked in 2005.
July 11, 2008 - Oil prices hit a record high of $147.27 a barrel before settling at $145.08 at the end of the day.
September 22, 2008 - Oil prices experience the biggest one-day increase ever, settling up $16.37 to $120.92 a barrel.
1973-1974 - Due to US support of Israel in the Arab-Israeli conflict, the members of OPEC decide to raise the cost of oil from $3/barrel to around $12/barrel.
October 1973 - OPEC issues an embargo that halts exports of oil to the United States. Americans experience long lines at gas stations and gasoline shortages. Gasoline prices go from 36 cents a gallon in 1972 to over 50 cents a gallon in 1973.
March 18, 1974 - At an OPEC meeting, seven members lift the ban on exports to United States. The countries are Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Egypt and Abu Dhabi. Libya and Syria refuse to drop the ban and Iraq boycotts the talks.
December 31, 1974 - Libya lifts its 14-month-old oil embargo against the United States.
December 22, 1975 - US President Gerald Ford establishes the Strategic Petroleum Reserve when he signs into law the “Energy Policy and Conservation Act.” The law is created in response to the oil embargo of 1973-1974 and the severe effect it had on the economy. It mandates that the country maintain a stockpile of one million barrels of petroleum, which is the largest emergency supply in the world.
2013 - The United States imports less foreign oil than it produces for the first time in nearly two decades.
2020 - The United States imports less petroleum than it exports for the first time in more than seven decades."
6YDDV9CGWV_RB85X26TBUMWWSB,Opinion: Democrats could be repeating their mistake from 2016,"Opinion By Julian Zelizer, CNN","5 minute read Updated 3:27 PM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/25/opinions/trump-haley-biden-democrats-zelizer/,"Editor’s Note: Julian Zelizer, a CNN political analyst, is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University. He is the author and editor of 25 books, including The New York Times bestseller “Myth America: Historians Take on the Biggest Lies and Legends About Our Past” (Basic Books). The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.
Democrats should not make the mistake of underestimating former President Donald Trump. This is exactly what the party did in 2016, when former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was the Democratic nominee, and there are some who currently risk repeating the error.
Following Trump’s strong showing in the New Hampshire primary, which has effectively knocked his final opponent — former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley — out of the race, some of his critics continue to search for slivers of good news.
They point to the fact that despite “almost” being an incumbent, he didn’t receive a share of the vote on par with what previous incumbents have encountered in primary contests. Incumbents usually bring to the table unequaled name recognition, fund-raising capacity and the benefit of looking presidential as they run for reelection. Trump has most of this, with his supporters holding on to the memory of him in the Oval Office, and with many of his backers believing he literally won the presidency in 2020, yet Haley pulled a decent part of the electorate away from him.
Moreover, they note, Haley was able to win independent voters who theoretically would be more amenable to President Joe Biden than Trump in the fall. Moreover, the number of Republicans who keep saying they won’t vote for Trump under any circumstances, gives Democrats hope that on Election Day, many voters in the GOP won’t turn out.
Related article Opinion: Are Biden and Trump too old to run?
But these arguments downplay the threat Trump will pose to Biden in November by ignoring several fundamentals. In fact, given the extraordinary baggage and problems Trump brings to the table, it is remarkable that the former president is doing so well and points to the formidable threat he poses.
Most important, Trump is not an incumbent; he is a one-term president who lost to the person he is running against just four years ago. Moreover, he is polling well and defeating his primary opponents despite the fact that the GOP suffered stunning blows to their congressional power, costing the party control of the Senate in 2020 and again in the midterm elections of 2022, and hurting them in state offices in a number of special elections.
Trump is succeeding even though the United States has never had a major presidential candidate saddled with so much legal baggage. Trump is not just a defeated one-term president, but a one-term president who allegedly attempted to overturn an election he lost — a period that can truly be called unprecedented in American history. As if that was not enough, he has subsequently been indicted four times, including on charges that revolve around an alleged massive abuse of presidential power (he has denied all wrongdoing).
Meanwhile, two states have decided to ban him from the ballot based on allegations of insurrection (he is appealing). And civil cases about sexual assault, tax fraud and defamation are also underway (he has challenged these as well). Yet, not only is Trump defeating his Republican opponents despite these legal challenges, but they keep defending him and rallying to his side even in the heat of political battle.
Related article Opinion: Nikki Haley’s right. Red flags about Trump’s mental fitness can’t be ignored
Indeed, Donald Trump continues to win as Donald Trump. There has been no turning point, no shift to acting presidential and no serious effort to abide by the traditional norms of national politics. He has continued to blast his opponents with name-calling insults, to spread disinformation and falsehoods and to conduct politics in the spirit of a WWE cage match rather than a forum of serious deliberation. Trump 2024 is acting very much like Trump 2020 and 2016.
That’s no doubt because the qualities that propelled him in the past to command media attention continue to be effective. Even if he has lost many steps as a result of age — as Haley and others have argued — Trump continues to retain all of his talents as a showman. Trump still knows how to do television. He is the entertainer in chief.
Trump’s enduring ability to garner attention through provocative performances was clear right after the media projected Trump as the winner in New Hampshire. Instead of a standard victory speech, Trump lit into Haley. He unleashed a series of vindictive comments about her, even going so far as to insult her clothing. Though some analysts were surprised by his decision and noted that he might have goaded Haley into continuing to run, they missed the point. The point was to do and say things that drew attention to him, that created 24 hours of social media conversation about Trump, that took attention from everyone else on the playing field.
Related article Opinion: In victory, Trump loses it
Trump, who lives by the maxim that all publicity is good publicity, will no doubt create similar obstacles for Biden in communicating his message and securing national attention as the race heats up.
Finally, by most indications, Trump still has strong support in the Republican Party. It is not clear whether those currently telling pollsters they would never vote for Trump will feel the same way by November, once Trump has unleashed his scorched-earth attacks on Biden and depicted him in conservative circles as the second coming of Karl Marx.
When voters go to vote on November 5, many of those Americans might very well decide that tax cuts, deregulation and conservative justices are much more important than any concerns they have about what a second term Trump presidency would do.
And despite the legislative success of the Biden presidency, as well as strong economic indicators, Trump benefits from the fact that many Republicans perceive the pre-Covid years of his presidency to have been much more prosperous than today, when they see higher prices, major wars abroad and chaos at the borders as well as in cities as a result of undocumented immigration. To them, it is “American carnage” all over again.
In 2016, many observers wondered if the election would be like 1964, when President Lyndon Johnson trounced right-wing Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater, who many saw as an extremist and dangerous to the nation. The answer was no. Most Republicans came home.

None of this is to say that Trump is invincible. He is not. Indeed, 2020 proved the point. Polls for 2024 show that the race is close and will probably come down to turnout in a handful of swing states. A few swing state polls have Biden ahead. As Democratic strategist Simon Rosenberg recently told The New York Times’ Ezra Klein, Democrats have been doing extraordinarily well in national elections.
Trump can be defeated with a massive voter turnout operation. But his performance thus far in the caucuses and primaries, especially given the context of what he faces, has been notable for the underlying strength behind his candidacy that the contests have revealed."

Artisanal mining is a common activity across much of West Africa and has risen in recent years due to growing demand for metals and rising prices.
Deadly accidents are frequent as artisanal miners often use old-fashioned and unregulated methods of digging.
The incident in Mali occurred on Friday on a site in the Kangaba Cercle in the south-western Koulikoro Region, the mines ministry said in a statement on Tuesday that did not specify the number of deaths.

A spokesperson for the ministry, Baye Coulibaly, said via telephone on Wednesday that the death toll was still provisional.
“Gold panners have dug galleries without complying with the required standards, and we have advised them against it on several occasions in vain,” Coulibaly said.
The ministry would be a sending a mission to the Kangaba area on Thursday to get more details on the accident, he added.
According to mines ministry data, an estimated six tons of gold was produced in artisanal mines in Mali in 2023."
72AVLUZJ80_DGE9L7K20DZMCY1,"The NSA buys Americans’ internet data, newly released documents show","By Brian Fung, CNN","4 minute read Updated 10:59 AM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/26/tech/the-nsa-buys-americans-internet-data-newly-released-documents-show/,"The National Security Agency has been buying Americans’ web browsing data from commercial data brokers without warrants, intelligence officials disclosed in documents made public by a US senator Thursday.
The purchases include information about the websites Americans visit and the apps that they use, said Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden, releasing newly unclassified letters he received from the Pentagon in recent weeks confirming the sales.
The disclosures are the latest evidence that government agencies routinely buy sensitive information about Americans from commercial marketplaces that they would otherwise be required to obtain via court order.
And it comes amid rising concerns that foreign governments are doing the same; CNN reported earlier this week that the Biden administration is preparing an executive order meant to curb foreign purchases of US citizens’ personal data.
Wyden’s disclosure was earlier reported by The New York Times.
The NSA’s purchases include “information associated with electronic devices being used outside—and, in certain cases, inside—the United States,” wrote Paul Nakasone, the NSA’s director, in a letter to Wyden dated Dec. 11.
The purchases involve what Nakasone described as netflow data, or the technical information generated by devices as they use the internet.
While the data purchased from data brokers does not involve the content of Americans’ communications, Nakasone wrote, the data is “related to wholly domestic internet communications and internet communications where one side of the communication” is located inside the United States and the other side is located abroad.
Nakasone added that the NSA does not purchase cellphone location data of Americans or location data generated by automotive infotainment systems in the United States.
In a statement to CNN, the NSA affirmed that it buys the data from private vendors.
“NSA purchases commercially available Netflow data for its cybersecurity mission, to include but not limited to inform the Agency’s collection, analysis, and dissemination of cyber threat intelligence,” an NSA official said. “At all stages, NSA takes steps to minimize the collection of U.S. person information, to include application of technical filters.”
The NSA uses the commercially purchased data to support its cybersecurity and foreign intelligence missions, according to Nakasone’s letter and the NSA official. The NSA’s mission includes defending US military networks from foreign hacking.
In response to Wyden’s further questions, a top Defense Department intelligence official, Ronald Moultrie, wrote that agencies that purchase the data are responsible for complying “with existing law, regulation and policy, including the Fourth Amendment.”
And Allison Nixon, chief research officer at cybersecurity firm Unit 221B, said there were plenty of legitimate uses for netflow data that can help protect organizations against cyberattacks and do not involve spying on people.
“Netflow is useful for tracking malware and [distributed denial of service] attacks,” Nixon told CNN. “It’s not useful for finding who’s having abortions and calling the suicide hotline.”
“Netflow is one of the reasons your antivirus can catch malware, and it’s one of the reasons your bank can detect credit card fraud before you do,” Nixon said.
Wyden, one of Congress’ most vocal privacy advocates, said he spent nearly three years pushing to be able to disclose the NSA practice and only succeeded when he placed a hold on the nomination of Nakasone’s successor for NSA director, Lt. Gen. Timothy Haugh. In a similar disclosure in 2021, Wyden revealed that the Defense Intelligence Agency had purchased commercially available smartphone location data without a warrant.
As part of Thursday’s announcement, Wyden wrote a letter to the Biden administration urging it to stop the warrantless surveillance of Americans through the purchases of internet data.
“The U.S. government should not be funding and legitimizing a shady industry whose flagrant violations of Americans’ privacy are not just unethical, but illegal,” Wyden wrote to Avril Haines, the director of national intelligence.
“Although the intelligence agencies’ warrantless purchase of Americans’ personal data is now a matter of public record, recent actions by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the primary federal privacy regulator, raise serious questions about the legality of this practice,” Wyden added.
In a report that was declassified last year, Haines’ office acknowledged the risks posed by the easy availability of Americans’ personal data and recommended that US spy agencies catalog and develop procedures for protecting data they acquire by commercial means.
Wyden’s reference to the FTC reflects recent moves by privacy regulators to crack down on data brokers, including bans on the sale of certain personal information by two companies, InMarket Media and Outlogic, formerly known as X-Mode.
The FTC launched a separate process in 2022 that could lead to new regulations targeting what agency chair Lina Khan has called a “commercial surveillance” industry that profits from lax cybersecurity practices and weak restrictions on how consumer data can be collected, shared and analyzed.
In his letter Thursday, Wyden also called for intelligence agencies to delete any commercially acquired data that does not align with the FTC’s recent crackdowns.

76B5N9N6P1_5I423PYPKNXWRSI,Alabama plans the first nitrogen gas execution this week in largely secret process experts say raises concerns about cruelty,"By Dakin Andone, CNN","8 minute read Updated 11:04 AM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/23/us/nitrogen-gas-execution-kenneth-smith/,"Alabama intends to carry out the first known execution by nitrogen gas this week, when it’s scheduled to put to death Kenneth Smith some 14 months after failing to carry out his capital punishment by lethal injection.
But little is known about how the method, nitrogen hypoxia, will be carried out during a 30-hour execution window Thursday into Friday, as the state’s published protocol bears redactions that experts say shield key details from public scrutiny. The state, in court records, indicated the redactions were made to maintain security.
“This is a protocol that has been created out of whole cloth,” said Robin Maher, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, a non-profit that’s critical of how capital punishment is administered in the United States but does not take a stance on it.
Related article Executions in the US are in decline – but some jurisdictions lead the rest
“There’s no precedent for it,” she told CNN. “There’s no testing of this procedure. No one knows how it’s going to occur.”
Amid the uncertainty, Smith and his lawyers – along with experts from the United States to the United Nations – have questioned whether potential complications from the nitrogen gas procedure could lead to excessive pain or even torture for the inmate who previously asked to be put to death in this way.
“It’s not that nitrogen gas won’t kill you,” Dr. Joel Zivot, an associate professor of anesthesiology and surgery at Emory University, told CNN. “But will it kill you in a way that would comport with the Constitutional requirement that it not be cruel and it not be torture?”
Alabama is one of just three states, along with Oklahoma and Mississippi, that have approved use of nitrogen gas to carry out death sentences. But none has used it, and only Alabama has outlined a protocol.
While some US states decades ago used lethal gas to execute prisoners, the use of nitrogen would be new: In theory, it involves replacing the air breathed by an inmate with 100% nitrogen, depriving the body of the oxygen it needs to survive. Such displacement would lead to a painless death, according to the method’s proponents, who cite nitrogen’s role in deadly industrial accidents or suicides.
But those environments are different than an execution, said Zivot, who added he fears Alabama’s attempt could go awry and prompt myriad potential complications, such as causing Smith to have a seizure or vomit into the mask delivering the nitrogen, causing him to choke.

Meanwhile, though secrecy over the death penalty is not uncommon – many states keep private certain details of their execution procedures – experts say this moment is also troubling because Alabama in 2022 hosted three lethal injections, including Smith’s, that critics deemed “botched” because they deviated from protocol.
“Given the history that Alabama has, with so many botched executions, it seems hard to believe that they would be pivoting to a new, untested and risky procedure,” Maher said.
For its part, though, Alabama this week is “ready to go,” with the nitrogen hypoxia execution of Smith, its Republican governor told CNN in a statement:
“This method has been thoroughly vetted, and both the Alabama Department of Corrections and the Attorney General’s Office have indicated it is ready to go,” said Gov. Kay Ivey, whose office declined to provide an unredacted copy of the nitrogen hypoxia execution protocol or respond to CNN’s questions about experts’ concerns over it.
Smith was sentenced to death for his role in the 1988 murder for hire of Elizabeth Sennett. According to court records, her husband, minister Charles Sennett, hired someone who hired two others, including Smith, to kill his wife and make it look like a burglary.
Sennett, who court records say was having an affair and had taken out an insurance policy on his wife, killed himself a week after her murder as investigators’ focus turned to him. Smith was eventually arrested after investigators searched his home and found the Sennetts’ VCR.
Smith had expressed a desire to be executed by nitrogen hypoxia before Alabama tried to put him to death in November 2022 using lethal injection. The state aborted that attempt because officials could not set an intravenous line before the execution warrant expired.
He shared his wish again after that attempt – then reversed course in August, when the state suddenly agreed to use the method and released the heavily redacted protocol. Smith then challenged the protocol, claiming it left him at risk of “superadded pain,” could cause him to have a stroke or could leave him in a vegetative state if it fails, court records show.
A federal judge’s ruling this month cleared the way for Alabama to proceed, finding there was “simply not enough evidence to find” the protocol would cause Smith “superadded pain.” And while the judge acknowledged the “heavily redacted” protocol maintained the Department of Corrections’ “familiar veil of secrecy over its capital punishment procedures,” he also noted the state had provided Smith’s team an unredacted protocol. Further details, including the specific mask that will be used, were revealed in oral arguments last month.
The ruling placed Alabama “an important step closer to holding Kenneth Smith accountable” for Sennett’s killing, state Attorney General Steve Marshall said in a statement the day of the ruling. “Smith has avoided his lawful death sentence for over 35 years, but the court’s rejection … of Smith’s speculative claims removes an obstacle to finally seeing justice done.”
“Now that the State is prepared to give Smith what he asked for, he objects,” Marshall’s office told CNN this week in a separate statement, which also pointed out that an advocate for assisted suicide later called as an expert witness by Smith and his attorneys posted on X in September that nitrogen hypoxia was “not ‘cruel & unusual’” but “fast” and “effective.”
That expert subsequently testified in Smith’s case to the potential for complications to arise during the nitrogen hypoxia execution, saying he could not exclude the possibility Smith would be left with permanent brain damage, according to the judge’s ruling.
And still in the case, litigation continues: Last week, Smith’s attorneys asked the US Supreme Court for a stay of execution, asserting a second attempt to execute him would constitute cruel and unusual punishment.
For their part, Elizabeth Sennett’s sons plan to be present for Smith’s execution, finally here after 35 years, they told CNN affiliate WAFF.
“The man’s been in prison right at twice as long as we knew our mom,” Mike Sennett said.
The origins of nitrogen hypoxia as an execution method trace in most sources to a 1995 article in National Review, though it’s gained increasing traction in recent years as states struggle to implement lethal injection, according to Deborah Denno, a professor at Fordham Law School who has studied the death penalty for decades.
Since its inception 40 years ago, lethal injection has become by far the most prominent method of execution for the US government and the 27 states that still have the death penalty. But beginning around 2009, states began losing access to the drugs long used to carry it out, leading to use of alternative drugs that have led to a “surge in problems with lethal injection,” Denno told CNN.

That’s created a moment ripe for the rise of another method, she indicated, describing the circumstances as a pattern that has been repeated for more than a century and a half, such as when electrocution – conceived as more humane than hanging – was sidelined following grisly botches.
“It was when states are pushed into a corner and they are desperate, it’s at that point, they come up with a new method of execution,” Denno said.
Oklahoma was first to adopt nitrogen gas as an execution method in 2015 as a backup if lethal injection were ever found unconstitutional or “otherwise unavailable.” The legislation’s passage, per Denno, was based in part on an unpublished paper by three academics at East Central University, who concluded nitrogen hypoxia could “assure a quick and painless death.”
Then-Oklahoma Corrections Department Director Joe Allbaugh echoed that in 2018, when officials said they intended to move forward with nitrogen gas executions. “After a couple breaths,” Allbaugh said at the time, “the individual loses consciousness, doesn’t feel anything.”
Alabama adopted nitrogen hypoxia that same year, with the state lawmaker who sponsored the legislation telling AL.com he believed it would be more humane than lethal injection.
Many others, including Zivot, however, remain skeptical of nitrogen hypoxia, with the anesthesiologist pointing to several potential complications, including the risk that the nitrogen causes Smith to have a seizure, which could make him vomit into the mask and then choke.
Zivot also raised the possibility of an ineffective seal on the mask, allowing nitrogen to leak out, prolonging the execution or leaving Smith severely injured. A leak could also present a risk to others, like witnesses, corrections officials or Smith’s spiritual adviser, Zivot said. Indeed, the adviser had to sign a waiver acknowledging he could be exposed to the gas, NPR reported.
“Alabama, again, has no idea whether this will happen, whether it won’t happen, what they’ll do about it,” he said. “But these are all kind of concerns, you know, with this particular method of execution.”

Those concerns are shared by parties far beyond Alabama: Earlier this month, United Nations experts “expressed alarm” over Smith’s looming execution, saying in a news release, “We are concerned that nitrogen hypoxia would result in a painful and humiliating death.”
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights almost two weeks later called on Alabama to halt the execution, saying it “could amount to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment under international human rights law.”
While those sentenced to death are often convicted of particularly heinous crimes and deemed the “worst of the worst,” the Constitution still protects them, said Maher, the Death Penalty Information Center director.
“The people that we have placed in prisons and jails are still human beings who are deserving of the same kind of dignity that we would demand for ourselves and anyone that we love,” she said. “They are entitled to the protections of the Constitution the same as anyone else in this country. And they certainly should be free from being tortured or inhumanely executed.”
How the death penalty is used “says a lot about us as a society,” she added, noting secrecy about it “increases the risk of problems,” leading to more botched executions.
“The fact that this incredibly important function, which is probably the biggest use of government power, the details of which are being kept from the public,” she said, “that raises a lot of questions about whether this is the right thing to do.”"
77COEFU466_H8PDYH4FFCZDL71,"Defying age and health difficulties, Pope Francis takes on vested interests to speak out on humanitarian crises",Analysis by Christopher Lamb,"5 minute read Published 10:53 AM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/23/europe/pope-francis-vatican-social-justice-intl/,"Pope Francis frequently speaks out on issues such as war, migration and climate change, according to a senior Vatican cardinal, to warn world leaders they are making “suicidal” decisions.
Cardinal Michael Czerny, who leads a Vatican department focused on social justice, stressed that while Francis might face criticism or being misunderstood, he has a moral imperative to speak out on behalf of Catholics.
“I think [what] he would say is, I speak out because of the commitment of the faithful. In other words, I’m not speaking because I have personally some kind of a special response to give. No, I speak out because there are millions of Catholics and other Christians and other believers and other people of good will for whom or in whose voice I’m speaking,” he told CNN. “And we’re trying to say to the world’s decision-makers that their decisions are anti-human, short-sighted, suicidal.”
The cardinal’s remarks came after the pope met with reporters on Monday January 22 at the Vatican, where he underlined the importance of responsible journalism in today’s world.
“Being a journalist is a vocation, somewhat like that of a doctor, who chooses to love humanity by curing illnesses,” the pope said. “In a certain sense, the journalist does likewise, choosing to touch personally the wounds of society and the world.”
From the moment of his election almost 11 years ago, the 87-year-old pontiff has been a newsmaker. His decision to avoid the trappings of office, live simply in a Vatican guesthouse and call for a “poor church for the poor” caught the attention of the world. But it’s been his willingness to address the pressing issues of the day that has made him a pope with a voice on the global stage.
He’s been ready to speak to on a range of topics from the death penalty to Artificial Intelligence while repeatedly calling for peace in Gaza and Ukraine, action on climate and greater efforts to help refugees fleeing war and poverty. Francis has given more media interviews than any other pope, always ready to meet and greet reporters on his trips abroad.
In a recent interview broadcast on Nove, which is owned by CNN’s parent company Warner Bros. Discovery, Francis addressed concerns about his health. Francis, who has recently recovered from a bout of bronchitis and had an abdominal operation in June, said he will remain in office for “as long as (he has) the ability to serve.”
The pope’s news making has helped him communicate the pillars of his papacy, chief among them being his consistent support for migrants.
Francis, whose grandparents narrowly escaped a deadly shipwreck when they migrated from Italy to Argentina, ensured that his first visit outside of Rome as pope was to the tiny Italian island of Lampedusa.
While there, he lamented the “global indifference” to refugees while remembering those who had died while trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea. In 2016, he described then-US presidential candidate Donald Trump’s anti-immigration rhetoric as “not Christian” and in the same year he bought back a dozen refugees on his papal plane after a visit to the Greeks island of Lesbos.
Czerny works closely with Francis in this area, and his office has been working to galvanize Catholics to welcome migrants in their communities.
“What we try to do is to help the church locally, wherever it is, to accompany the migrants and refugees, to welcome them, to protect them, to promote them and to integrate them,” he explains.
For Czerny, like Francis, migration is not about numbers but names, faces and people. His family fled Czechoslovakia for Canada when he was four years old. His grandmother was sent to Auschwitz and died soon after World War II.
“I wouldn’t be here talking to you if a family in Canada had not sponsored us,” he said.
The Canadian cardinal said Francis sees the migrant crisis as “a litmus test of our humanity” but one that the developed world is “largely failing.”
The issue is featuring in the US presidential race, with Republican candidate Trump making inflammatory claims that immigrants are “poisoning the blood of our country.” According to polls, 63% of white Catholics who attend Mass monthly or more often supported the former president in the 2020 election.
“It’s the church in the United States that needs to deal with this, needs to respond to it and needs to help God’s people to evaluate whether this discourse has any validity or whether it’s just ideology and fear,” Cardinal Czerny said when asked about the rhetoric being used. “Then they have to vote accordingly and I trust that they will.”
Another concern for the pope and the cardinal is Artificial Intelligence, with Francis recently calling for a treaty to regulate its use. Cardinal Czerny said the development of AI is “so fast in its evolution that for society to respond responsibly to the risks while benefiting from the benefits is not easy.” However, he stressed that countries need to work together to ensure that it “doesn’t become an affliction, a new suffering or a new risk for human life.”
But speaking with a prominent voice means facing criticism. Francis’ critiques of capitalism have led to accusations that he is a “communist,” while some politicians have questioned whether the pope was a credible voice to speak on climate change.
Czerny admitted there is “resistance” to Francis’ progressive message, but said the pope will “continue to be criticized” because he’s touching on “well-to-do-interests” that are both financial and political.
“Jesus had the same trouble in his time,” he said. “People were quick to apply labels and to try to corner him because the basic message was not to their liking.”
Some of the internal opposition to the pope has intensified following his move to authorize the blessings of same-sex couples. The Vatican doctrine office’s ruling that priests can bless couples in “irregular” situations saw bishops in Africa said they “generally prefer” not to bless same-sex couples.
“Yes, there will be criticisms,” said Czerny, who before coming to the Vatican worked in Africa and central America. He stressed Francis’ priority is not to avoid criticisms but “to include and console and bless and reconcile those who are suffering.”
Despite his age, the pope is far from slowing down. And despite his recent health problems, he’s unlikely to be cowed."
77LT04OOL3_3TPFH3B7TPHFDS9,White House offers key GOP lawmaker access to unredacted January 6 panel transcripts as part of Republican probe,"By Annie Grayer and Zachary Cohen, CNN","3 minute read Updated 1:57 PM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/26/politics/white-house-letter-barry-loudermilk/,"The White House is offering a key Republican lawmaker the chance to review transcripts from the House January 6 committee’s interviews, according to a letter obtained by CNN, with the goal of appeasing a GOP-led investigation into the panel.
GOP Rep. Barry Loudermilk will have the opportunity to examine the unredacted transcripts “in camera” if he agrees to protect the names of the four witnesses who were mentioned anonymously in the January 6 committee’s final report, the letter says. As part of the White House offer, Loudermilk will be allowed to review but not keep the transcripts.
CNN has reached out to Loudermilk for comment on the White House offer.
Loudermilk, who is spearheading the Republican-led investigation into the work of the former January 6 select committee, prompted the White House for the unredacted transcripts because he claimed the redacted versions he had access to excluded key details, according to a letter obtained by CNN.
The offer from the White House comes as House Republicans have sought to discredit the January 6 committee’s investigation and related criminal cases against Trump since taking over the majority.
Since starting his probe, Loudermilk has alleged he is missing certain transcripts, video tapes of depositions and information from the former January 6 panel, claims that have been repeated by former President Donald Trump and his allies in court.
Trump’s attorney in the Georgia election subversion case has accused prosecutors of withholding deposition videos from the January 6 committee’s interviews with former Justice Department officials, claiming footage was shown to the grand jury but not turned over to defense attorneys in discovery.
The allegation was ultimately determined to be baseless as prosecutors confirmed in court that no such footage exists, but the claim successfully added fuel to an ongoing narrative of collusion between the committee and criminal prosecutors who have charged Trump in various election-related cases.
The transcripts Republicans are seeking from the White House are of officials who worked during the Trump administration on January 6, 2021, serving in non partisan roles, including positions with national security responsibilities, Richard Sauber, special counsel to President Joe Biden, wrote to Loudermilk.
“We will make the unredacted transcripts available to you for review in camera, provided that you agree in writing to abide by the commitments made on a bipartisan basis by the Select Committee—to maintain the anonymity of the four witnesses consistent with the conditions under which the witnesses agreed to appear before the Select Committee, and to prevent the disclosure of ‘operational details and private information,’ ” Sauber added.
Loudermilk has made a similar ask to the Department of Homeland Security for unredacted, complete transcripts of Secret Service agents who testified to the former select committee that he does not have in his possession.
He has also accused the former chair of the January 6 committee, Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson, of improperly archiving work in a series of letters. Loudermilk raised questions about whether Thompson’s committee improperly coordinated with federal and state prosecutors who have charged Trump with crimes tied to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election because he says that correspondence was not properly archived, according to a letter obtained by CNN. Loudermilk also asked Thompson to provide the passwords to files that he said were uncovered in a “forensic analysis of the archived hard drives” and are password protected.
Thompson has repeatedly defended his panel’s archival process, and said in his most recent letter back to Loudermilk, “the many accusations in your letter are false.”
Thompson pointed to a direct page number in the January 6 select committee’s final report that mentions the sharing of materials with federal and Georgia prosecutors. In response Loudermilk’s accusation about password protected recovered files, Thompson stated, “I have absolutely no idea what you are talking about.”"

She is a member of the Historians Council on the Constitution at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU Law School. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion at CNN.
As Wayne LaPierre prepares to take the stand this week in the corruption trial of the National Rifle Association (NRA), fresh questions are swirling around the timing of his resignation and the extent of his health problems, as well as what his continued presence at the trial means for the future of the organization - and the power politics behind the nation’s gun conversation.
On January 5, just five days before the opening of a major trial that alleges self-dealing and financial corruption at the highest level of the NRA, the organization’s executive vice president and CEO Wayne LaPierre, 74, abruptly resigned, citing health reasons.
The case was brought in May 2022 by New York State Attorney General Letitia James, who alleged misuse of funds for personal gain by LaPierre and other senior leaders of the organization, in violation of New York’s nonprofit laws — a charge to which he and his associates pled not guilty.
LaPierre, who has led the organization for more than 30 years, will be replaced on January 31 by Andrew Arulanandam, one of his top lieutenants, who has been instrumental in molding the NRA’s public persona.
Despite NRA leadership downplaying LaPierre’s resignation as a “course correction” (in effect, as nothing to see) in a recent filing, the long-time leader’s departure raises significant questions about his personal legacy, as well as the future of the NRA and the struggle for common sense gun laws.
LaPierre was a long-standing employee of the NRA — first joining the organization as a lobbyist in 1978—before becoming its unlikely executive vice president in 1991, when he also became the NRA’s chief spokesman, as outlined in his 2002 book, “Shooting Straight.” At the trial, a lawyer for New York state described how LaPierre ran the NRA as “Wayne’s World” for decades. And though he sometimes seemed awkward on stage at NRA events and tended to avert eye contact in person, he made up for his lack of charisma in his relentless focus on prioritizing gun rights over the right to live safely in a country where people fear—and live with the many consequences of — being shot.

During the 1990s, the NRA saw internal divisions over its political purity and financial problems. During the Clinton administration, therefore, the NRA focused much of its energy at the state level, successfully enacting numerous “right-to-carry” laws throughout the country, which provided individuals easier access to concealed weapons licenses. Yet, the NRA also experienced major stumbling blocks during this period, including the 1993 Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act — which imposed waiting periods and background checks on purchasers of handguns — and the now-expired 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban.
Significantly, following the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing that killed 168 people by former NRA member Timothy McVeigh, LaPierre referred in a fundraising letter to federal law enforcement agents as “jack-booted thugs,” a term commonly associated with fascism and Nazi SS soldiers. This led the former President George H. W. Bush and many others to resign their lifetime NRA memberships.
LaPierre is credited with the renewal and invigoration of the NRA’s cultural agenda in the years that followed. He recruited the actor Charlton Heston — best known for playing “Moses” on the big screen — to “part the red seas” in shaping a public image for the NRA. The pair led a campaign that encouraged civilian gun owners to believe that it was they who were victimized.
With LaPierre and Heston leading the organization, the NRA expanded its crusade to broaden gun rights and industry protections and positioned gun control advocates as adversaries in an all-out liberal culture war. Whereas before the 1990s, the NRA’s perceived opponents were mainly individuals who lacked rifle training, who were unwilling to fight for the nation, or were “hoplophobes” (a term coined by American marine Jeff Cooper in 1962 to describe an aversion to guns), now the “enemy” was much more expansive: including progressive social movements, government agencies, “globalists,” the UN, and the “mainstream media.”
In contrast, the NRA praised individual citizen gun rights defenders as patriots, defending individual rights and freedoms. As LaPierre wrote in his 2003 book, “Guns, Freedom, and Terrorism,” this battle is “about suppressing our culture, our heritage, our freedom.”  He oversaw the rise of NRA’s televisual presence, with its own high-end advertising campaign ads, films and NRATV station, which ceased operations in 2019. In 2000 the NRA introduced “America’s 1st Freedom” magazine, aimed beyond NRA members, to report “the news from the perspective of the concerned gun owner.” (LaPierre has written a regular monthly column, “Standing Guard,” for the magazine since 1991).

Following the 1999 mass shooting at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, LaPierre and Heston met ahead of the NRA’s annual meeting in Denver to discuss the group’s communications. Heston delivered a defiant message, similar to its position on mass shootings nowadays: The national media was not to be trusted and any conversation about guns and the NRA after mass shootings was a vulgar politicization of the issue. They cast gun rights as a religious and moral imperative, invoking comparisons to Nazi Germany and even hired lawyers who accused critics of gun rights of committing “blood libel.” They argued that other rights (including the right not to be shot) must be sacrificed in the process.
After the attacks of September 11, 2001, the NRA’s leadership compared Osama bin Laden’s attacks on American freedom with those “attacks on freedom” allegedly perpetrated by gun control advocates against gun owners.
The NRA’s defiant stance continued to strengthen. At the group’s 2002 meeting in Reno, Nevada, Heston memorably hoisted a gun in the air and boasted that it could only be taken, “From my cold dead hands!” NRA officers’ gloating messages to the board contrasted sharply with their portrayal of threats to gun rights at the members’ meetings. “The bottom line is, we’re on the offense,” LaPierre proudly announced at the Reno board meeting, meaning that the NRA was able to focus on lobbying for pro-gun legislation rather than against gun control legislation. In Orlando a year later, he told the board that the NRA is “stronger and more widely accepted than ever.”
The NRA’s approach resonated with a rising right-wing, anti-government shift in the Republican Party (as well as with some Democrats). Under pressure from the NRA and its supporters, in 2004 the Republican-controlled Congress allowed the federal assault weapons ban to expire.
LaPierre and the NRA saw another victory in the 2005 enactment of the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which granted immunity to firearms manufacturers and dealers from damages resulting from the misuse of their products. The NRA described the act as “the most significant piece of pro-gun legislation in 20 years.”
He will certainly be remembered for guiding the organization through a bumpy period and for taking the country to new and significantly more dangerous terrain when it comes to guns.
Jennifer Tucker
Lobbying against the inclusion of firearms in consumer product protections, the organization downplayed the state’s collective responsibility for protecting citizens, creating and mobilizing its membership around a slew of laws, policies and social norms that shield manufacturers, sellers and buyers from meaningful liability.
In December 2012, one week after Adam Lanza shot and killed 26 people at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, LaPierre announced during a press conference that “the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.” This narrative has landed with many Americans who believe that guns are essential for self-protection and the swift and just resolution of disputes. It also shifts the argument away from the characteristics of firearms as lethal weapons, to a debate about the moral character, social identities and mental states of the people carrying the gun.
LaPierre’s resignation brings to a close an extraordinary era of growth for America’s most powerful consumer lobby. He will certainly be remembered for guiding the organization through a bumpy period and for taking the country to new and significantly more dangerous terrain when it comes to guns. He oversaw the transformation of the NRA from its somewhat bipartisan past to its current status as a highly politicized social movement — and a political project that does not take the realities of gun violence or the need for equal protection under the criminal justice system seriously.
By both galvanizing gun safety supporters while also emboldening gun rights activists and facilitating a political and cultural evolution whereby defensive homicides are ever more justifiable in the legal system, LaPierre helped make the debate about guns in America even more contentious while shaping how the country talks about guns, gun control and itself.

But does LaPierre’s departure mark a turning point for guns in America?
It’s too soon to say, but it’s unlikely we’ll see significant changes any time soon. Notably, other gun rights organizations are rising in influence, many of which have long seen the NRA as too compromising.
LaPierre and the NRA are not entirely responsible for our country’s growing sense of vulnerability in the wake of mass shootings, police shootings of unarmed Black men and the threat of domestic terrorism. But in shaping a new set of rights and responsibilities, in which where citizens are sold the idea that private gun ownership is generally essential to be prepared to combat potential threats (and that “more guns means less crime”), they escalated the risk that even more people will be silenced, fearful, injured and killed. They moved us farther from being able to look at the distribution of harm rather than the pathologization of “bad actors.” They moved us farther from being able to approach the problem together."
791UAHARHO_8I1R11UTV0GJWRM,Fact check: Trump makes false claims in New Hampshire victory speech,"By Daniel Dale, CNN","4 minute read Updated 12:10 AM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/23/politics/fact-check-donald-trump-new-hampshire-victory-speech/,"Former President Donald Trump made several false claims in a speech Tuesday night after CNN and other media outlets projected that he would win the Republican presidential primary in New Hampshire.
CNN also watched rival candidate Nikki Haley’s Tuesday night speech in New Hampshire; Haley’s claims were either accurate or too general to fact check. Here is a fact check of some of Trump’s assertions.
Trump repeated some of his familiar lies about the 2020 presidential election.
At one point, he claimed, as he has repeatedly in the past, that “they used Covid to cheat.” At another point, he claimed that in addition to winning in 2016, “we also won in 2020 – by more. And we did much better in 2020 than we did in 2016.” He dismissively said, “But as they said, we lost by a whisker.”
Facts First: Trump’s claims are false. He lost the 2020 election fair and square to Joe Biden, by a 306 to 232 margin in the Electoral College, and also lost New Hampshire in that election. There remains no evidence of any fraud even close to widespread enough to have changed the outcome in any state.
Trump Tuesday night said, “Do they hate our country? They must hate our country. Because there’s no other reason that they can be doing the things they do. Take a look – the taxes, they want to raise your taxes times four.”
Facts First: This is false. Neither Biden nor other top Democrats are proposing anything close to quadrupling people’s taxes.
CNN previously fact-checked a similar Trump claim that “they want to double, triple everything.”
Howard Gleckman, senior fellow in the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center at the Urban Institute think tank, said in a November email: “I don’t know what ‘they want to double, triple everything’ means. But if he’s suggesting that Biden would ‘double, triple’ federal income taxes, he’s just making up numbers. There is no evidence to support that claim.”
Gleckman said his organization’s analysis of Biden’s budget proposal for fiscal 2024, which included his most recent tax plan, found that the major tax provisions would “would raise taxes by an average of $2,290, or reduce taxable income by 2.3 percent.”
Trump claimed that he has always won the state – not only in Republican primaries but in general elections.
“You know we won New Hampshire three times now three. We win it every time. We win the primary. We win the generals. We won it and it’s a very, very special place to me.” Trump said.
Facts First: Trump’s claim is false. He lost New Hampshire to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the 2016 general election and to Democratic candidate Joe Biden in the 2020 general election, though he did win the Republican primary each time.
Criticizing Republican New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, a supporter of Haley, Trump said that because of Sununu’s incompetence, “in the Republican primary, they accepted Democrats to vote. In fact, I think they had 4,000 Democrats – Democrats before October 6 – they already voted. Now, they’re only voting because they want to make me look as bad as possible.”
Facts First: Trump’s claims are misleading at best. People registered as Democrats were not allowed to vote in New Hampshire’s Republican primary. Only registered Republicans and independents (people registered as “undeclared”) were allowed to cast ballots in that primary. While it’s true that nearly 4,000 people who had been registered as Democrats switched their affiliation to either undeclared or Republican by October 6, the last day to switch in time to potentially cast a ballot in the GOP primary, it’s not yet clear how many of these people actually ended up voting. And it’s important to note that New Hampshire made its primaries open to independents decades before Sununu became governor in 2017.
Also, while Trump was complaining about people formerly registered as Democrats being permitted to vote in the Republican primary, it is standard for states to allow people to switch affiliations by a certain date in order to participate in another party’s primary – and some states have switching deadlines closer to an election day than New Hampshire does. In Trump’s state of Florida, to name one, voters can switch from Democratic to Republican by February 20 and cast a ballot in the Republican primary in the early voting window that begins less than three weeks later or in person a month later on the March 19 election day. (Unlike in New Hampshire, independents can’t cast Republican primary ballots there.)
Finally, the motivations of the recent New Hampshire affiliation-switchers are not nearly as clear as Trump suggested. While some might have indeed switched with the sole intention of opposing him, some others might have sincerely decided that they no longer saw themselves as Democrats. There was all kinds of affiliation-switching before October 6. For example, the New Hampshire Bulletin reported that 719 people switched from Republican to undeclared and 132 people switched from undeclared to Republican."
795MFWUR7N_V4SJ55H2MVO7JNL,Why airlines plug up emergency exits,By Amy Fraher,"4 minute read Published 6:59 AM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/why-airlines-plug-up-emergency-exits/,"Editor’s Note: The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer. CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation, a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation.
The aviation industry is still in shock from a near disaster on January 5, 2024, in which a 60-pound “door plug” blew out from a nearly new Boeing 737 MAX 9 in flight at 16,000 feet, leaving a gaping hole in the fuselage.
In response, the Federal Aviation Administration grounded all 737 MAX 9 planes with such plugs, and aviation authorities in other countries have followed suit.
The industry is watching closely.
A lot of news coverage has emphasized the impressive safety record of the global airline industry, particularly since an Alaska Airlines crew managed to land the plane with no fatalities. I commend the outstanding performance of airline employees, air traffic controllers and emergency responders who achieved this impressive feat.
However, as a former United Airlines pilot now lecturing in Yale University’s School of Management, I believe the wrong questions are being asked about what happened on Alaska Airlines Flight 1282. As the National Transportation Safety Board and numerous news outlets have explained, door plugs are commonly used to seal unused exits on commercial airliners. The question we need to ask is: Why wouldn’t an airline use all of an aircraft’s emergency exits? Wouldn’t that make passengers safer?
It’s all about money.
Airlines have lots of expenses. Some, such as jet fuel, are easier to calculate. Others, such as emergency exits, are more opaque to travelers.
Believe it or not, every functioning emergency exit comes at a price for an airline. Each requires routine maintenance and frequent inspections – for example, to make sure that emergency evacuation slides work properly – and flight attendants must staff emergency exits during takeoff and landing for safety reasons.
In other words, every working exit comes with associated costs in salaries, health benefits, pension plans, training and related expenses. Sealing off an emergency exit cuts costs.
But is every one of those emergency exits crucial? From the US government’s perspective, not necessarily.
In the US, airlines must comply with federal aviation regulations, which dictate aircraft maintenance procedures and in-flight personnel assignments – and minimum standards for emergency exits.
The issue is that Boeing sells the same airplane to different airlines with different needs.
Boeing notes that its 737 MAX 9 can carry up to 220 passengers, which, under US regulations, requires it be built with a specific number of emergency exits. This dense seating configuration is common among lower-cost global airlines such as Jakarta-based Lion Air.
However, given Americans’ desire for legroom, most US carriers are equipped with considerably fewer than 220 seats – and when there are fewer than 190 seats, the rules allow fewer emergency exits to be in service. The Alaska Airlines Max 9 had just 178 seats.
Under these conditions, the federal rules allow air carriers to disable these exits and plug the openings. That’s precisely what happened with Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 – and how “door plug” suddenly entered the American vernacular.
Although this sort of workaround is authorized, it’s unclear to me that this is in the best interest of air safety. Wouldn’t it be better for the FAA to require that all exits are available for use in an emergency, regardless of aircraft seating capacity, even if it required some additional expense for airlines?
The 737 MAX is a plane of many firsts – not all of them positive.
The MAX is the latest addition to Boeing’s 737 family of aircraft. The 737 family has far eclipsed all rivals as the most popular commercial airliner ever built, with over 10,000 sold worldwide since its introduction in 1967.
Some carriers, such as Southwest Airlines in the United States and Ryanair in Ireland, fly only 737s; it’s a critical element of their low-cost business strategy. By flying just one type of aircraft, these airlines significantly improve scheduling flexibility while cutting maintenance and training costs.
That’s all to say that demand for the latest 737 was high. In 2017, when the FAA certified the 737 MAX safe for flight, Boeing had already received more than 3,600 new orders from 83 customers.
But very shortly afterward, two crashes that together killed 346 people grounded the 737 MAX for nearly two years – another first as the longest airline grounding in aviation history. Destined to profit US$12 million on the sale of each $121 million MAX, there was significant incentive for Boeing to press on with MAX development even though it had already proved to be a dangerously problematic aircraft design.
In 2020, the FAA recertified the MAX as “safe for flight”; by 2023, Boeing had logged more than 7,000 total orders for the MAX, far eclipsing the sale of any other type of airliner. This fact alone ought to raise safety concerns. It may soon prove impossible to avoid flying on a 737 MAX, particularly in the U.S. domestic market. United, American, Southwest and Alaska airlines all currently fly the MAX.
When airplane parts and passengers’ cellphones are raining from the sky, it could be a sign that the industry needs to think harder about unintended costs – and consequences.

7BW3D1J1L7_GXL76D0K7YEVQVC,US and Iraqi governments expected to start talks on future of US military presence in the country,"By Natasha Bertrand and Oren Liebermann, CNN","6 minute read Updated 1:28 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/24/politics/us-military-iraq-talks-future/,"The US and Iraq are expected to soon begin talks on the future of the US military presence in the country, according to sources familiar with the matter, amid public calls from the Iraqi government for the US to withdraw its troops.
The US and Iraq agreed to form a higher military commission last summer, according to the Pentagon, as a vehicle for the talks. The discussions between US and Iraqi officials, akin to a working group, will focus on the next phase of the US-led anti-ISIS coalition, with the terror group now reduced to a shadow of its former self. US military officials and diplomats will be involved in the discussions, officials said.
The talks about the future of the US’ military presence have now taken on a greater urgency amid the wider regional instability, and amid growing public calls by the Iraqi government for the US to withdraw its troops from the country. Those calls have come in response to the US launching airstrikes inside Iraq targeting Iran-backed militants who have been attacking US personnel there.
Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin confirmed on Thursday that the military commission will launch “in the coming days.”
Military and defense officials will advise the commission “on the most effective evolution of the D-ISIS Coalition mission, ensuring that ISIS can never resurge, in consultation with Coalition partners at all stages of the process,” Austin said in a statement.
The US has roughly 2,500 troops currently in Iraq who have been operating there in an advise and assist capacity since December 2021, when the US military announced the end of its combat role in the country.
A senior military official told reporters on Thursday that the remaining contingency of ISIS fighters in Iraq and Syria is assessed to be “around the 1,000 or so,” including fighters, financiers, facilitators, and the “network that would support the Daesh fighters.”
“They’re disrupted, they’re suppressed … Daesh is not capable beyond small attacks, currently, in Iraq and Syria,” the military official said.
Part of the discussions will focus on whether and when it will be feasible to end the US military presence in Iraq. The US prefers a schedule that would be based on conditions in Iraq, including the ongoing defeat of ISIS and the stability of the government and the Iraqi security forces, US officials said.
But some elements within the Iraqi government prefer a schedule based on a timeline, setting the date for an American withdrawal regardless of the stability or the security situation within the country. On January 10th, the office of Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani said they would soon begin the process “to end the presence of the international coalition forces in Iraq permanently.”
A US official told CNN that “the US and Iraq are close to agreement on starting the Higher Military Commission dialogue that was announced back in August.”
“The HMC will be an opportunity to jointly evaluate the conditions required for the future of the D-ISIS fight in Iraq and shape the nature of the bilateral security relationship,” the official said. “We have been discussing this for months. The timing is not related to recent attacks. The US will maintain full right of self-defense during the talks.”
Jonathan Lord, the director of the Middle East security program at the Center for New American Security, told CNN that the US needs to transition its support for Iraq toward building “a lasting and sustainable military capacity in the [Iraqi Security Forces], to avoid another 2014. That hasn’t happened.”
“If we leave now, with no plan in place, we’re sending the patient back out on the street, with no plan to stay healthy,” he added, comparing the initial anti-ISIS intervention to an emergency room hospital stay. “Chances are, if things go bad, they’ll end up right back there. And it’s the most expensive, least efficient way to help them.”
On Tuesday, following the latest round of US strikes in Iraq, a spokesperson for the prime minister said in a statement that the strikes are “undermining agreements and various sectors of joint security cooperation” as the two countries are working to “reshape the future relationship.”
“There will be some cosmetic changes, but I don’t think the Iraqis want us to leave,” said a former senior US military official.
The former official pointed to a vote in the Iraqi parliament to remove US forces from the country shortly after the US assassinated a senior Iranian commander in Baghdad. Four years after that vote, the US military remains in Iraq at the invitation of the government.
“I think they recognize it will be difficult for them to survive without significant US assistance,” the former official said.
The US and Iraq agreed to start talks on the future of the US’ military presence last year, before the October 7 terror attack by Hamas on Israel sparked wider regional tensions and emboldened the Iran-backed groups, particularly Kataib Hezbollah, in Iraq and across the Middle East.
The Pentagon has maintained that the Iraqi government has not formally asked the US military to withdraw, emphasizing that the troops are still there at the invitation of the Iraqi government. And there is no set deadline for a conclusion to the higher military commission discussions, or their ultimate outcome.
Jon Alterman, the director of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the politics of the US military presence in Iraq have been “treacherous” for more than a decade, but it’s not a binary choice of staying or leaving. Nor is this a process that needs to move quickly, he said.
“This is a choice of where you want to be on a spectrum,” said Alterman. “Diplomats can manipulate both the timing and the direction of the talks and arrive at a wide variety of potential outcomes.”
Still, rumblings of a potential US change in its force posture in Iraq would be a victory for Iran, Alterman said. “Any sign that this is the beginning of the end would be widely celebrated in Iranian corridors.”
On Wednesday, Iraq’s foreign minister hinted at the coming discussions, saying in a statement that he met with the US Ambassador to Baghdad, Elena Romanowski, and “received from her an important message from the American government to the Iraqi government, which will be studied by the Prime Minister and the relevant concerned authorities. Next steps will be taken regarding it soon.”
The US also has a presence in Syria to fight ISIS, but administration officials told CNN that a withdrawal from that country is not under consideration.
“The Biden administration is not considering a withdrawal of forces from Syria,” a senior US official told CNN.

The French Data Protection Authority, or the CNIL, said in a statement Tuesday that Amazon France Logistique gave warehouse staff scanners that recorded their periods of inactivity and how quickly they performed certain tasks, such as removing an item from shelves or putting an item away.
The CNIL ruled the scanner system to be “excessive” partly because it measured “work interruptions with such accuracy, potentially requiring employees to justify every break or interruption.”
Amazon (AMZN) said in a statement posted on its European Union site: “We strongly disagree with the CNIL’s conclusions … and we reserve the right to file an appeal.
“Warehouse management systems are industry standard and are necessary for ensuring the safety, quality, and efficiency of operations and to track the storage of inventory and processing of packages on time and in line with customer expectations.”

The scanners used in France measure whether a worker scanned an item less than 1.25 seconds after scanning the previous item, based on the assumption that scanning too quickly increases the risk of error, the regulator said.
Amazon said this indicator was important to ensure that “employees take enough time to store the products so they can follow our safety guidelines” and to properly inspect each parcel before it is stored. But the company has decided to deactivate the collection of this data following the CNIL’s questions, it added.
Secondly, staff were judged to be “idle” if their scanners had been inactive for at least 10 minutes, the regulator found. Amazon said the data allowed its teams to “spot problems” that posed a risk to the firm’s operations or the safety of its employees. The company will now raise the threshold for logging “idle time” to 30 minutes, it noted.
A third indicator used by Amazon signaled when a worker’s scanner was interrupted anywhere between one and 10 minutes, according to the CNIL.
“Such systems kept employees under close surveillance for all tasks carried out with scanners and thus put them under continuous pressure,” the CNIL said, adding that the monitoring gave the company “a competitive advantage” over other companies in the online sales market.
The regulator fined Amazon France Logistique in late December following several investigations into the firm’s practices in its warehouses and complaints from employees. The CNIL found that the warehouse operator had kept data on the performance of its staff for 31 days — a length of time it also deemed “excessive.”
The regulator ruled that the firm had breached several elements of EU data protection law.
In the United States, Amazon has long faced scrutiny for the working conditions inside its warehouses, with employees complaining of punishing hours and close surveillance by bosses."
7DXUEICSUW_OXTEQ2JB60BQE0C,"The Never Trump movement might be in its last throes, but a news publication it birthed is booming","Analysis by Oliver Darcy, CNN","4 minute read Published 7:34 AM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/26/media/never-trump-bulwark-george-conway-podcast/,"Editor’s Note: A version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here.
The Never Trump movement might be on life support, but one of the outlets that it gave birth to is flourishing.
The Bulwark, a clear-eyed conservative news publication that stands in firm opposition to Donald Trump, is not only thriving online, but is in the midst of a “growth spurt,” publisher Sarah Longwell told me on Thursday.
The outlet, which features notable investors such as James and Kathryn Murdoch, aims to expand with new hires in the coming weeks. The first of them? George Conway, the conservative attorney whose sharp legal analysis and unsparing political commentary launched him from a well-known D.C. politico into a household name during the Trump administration.
Conway will join The Bulwark as the host of a new podcast, “George Conway Explains it All (to Sarah Longwell),” breaking down the president’s legal cases in plain, easily digestible terms. The program, co-hosted by Longwell, will air once a week and the first episode will drop Thursday night.
“The legal questions surrounding Trump are going to be an   enormous part of what happens in 2024,” Longwell noted to me. “And   I am not a lawyer. And I was constantly asking my friends who are lawyers to   explain things to me. And I was like, George, how about we just do a podcast   where you just explain stuff to me?”
The Bulwark, which now boasts nearly 30 staffers, is   “very close to breaking even,” Longwell said during our phone   conversation. The outlet generates about $3.6 million alone on newsletter   subscriptions, she said, and also draws on a separate dual revenue stream   made up of advertisements and live events.
Since its founding in 2018, the outlet has swelled in size. It now houses 10 podcasts (including Charlie Sykes’ hit show, which ranks in the top 25 news programs on Apple Podcasts), five newsletters, and has recently poured resources into a YouTube channel, which has amassed nearly 150,000 subscribers and more than 21 million video views.
Think of it like this: For the left, there is Pod Save America. For the reality-dwelling right, there is The Bulwark.
The success of the outlet might strike some as odd, given that the Never Trump camp has, at this juncture, lost the war for the soul of the Republican Party. It’s a reality that Longwell acknowledged. She described the publication’s audience as a group of Republican “expats,” “high information” Democrats looking for honest commentary from a conservative perspective, and others “trying to make sense of this political moment.”
“Part of what Never Trump was, was a way to separate   Trump from the rest of the Republican Party,” Longwell said. “As   Trump has absorbed the Republican Party, there is less of a mission over how   to save it. But that doesn’t mean that there is not a desperate need for a   voice in the center that is unapologetically pro-democracy.”
The Bulwark’s growth also comes at a time in which most news   publishers are pulling back, with the start of 2024 bringing news of brutal   layoffs from coast-to-coast. Longwell said the conservative publication has   found success by “building a community” willing to pay for a   subscription, even though most of the content is available outside its pay   wall, for free.
A key part of what gives The Bulwark an advantage in this   political moment, and inspires such loyalty, is that its writers intimately   understand the conservative movement, given they all were a part of it at one   point in time. Longwell described the outlet’s personalities as   “sherpas” helping those whom are perplexed by the GOP’s   radicalization under Trump make sense of the moment (to the greatest extent   that is possible).
That also means that those at The Bulwark don’t have a cloudy   vision and are willing to call out lies and misdeeds for what they are. While   some in the establishment press might worry about being perceived as   out-of-touch liberals, those at The Bulwark have no such fears.
“A lot of people talk about the false equivalence the   media supposedly has to do to tell ‘both sides.’ And it leads journalists to   make these false equivalencies,” Longwell said. “When you’ve been a   part of the conservative movement and seen how much it has changed, you have   no temptation to say these things are equivalent. You’re like, ‘These guys   have lost their minds! They have abandoned their principles!’ I think we have   been more unrestrained in our coverage because we’ve seen it from the   right.”
When asked whether the mainstream press is failing to call   balls and strikes properly, Longwell said she believes everyone is doing   their best to “navigate this particular unprecedented moment in their   own way.” But she did contend that she believes “we are   under-reacting as a country to this political moment.”
“And part of that is because a bunch of institutions, in   an attempt to behave, in their minds responsibly — they don’t know how to say   how dangerous this moment is and still feel like they are maintaining their   institutional objectivity,” Longwell said.
“We,” Longwell added, speaking of The Bulwark,   “are quite certain about how to handle this moment. This is really black   and white. Just say the things that are true, that are right and   wrong.”"
7FFGR059P1_M0FYXY39RNJ833P,Opinion: This is the difference Jon Stewart could make in the 2024 election,Opinion by Dean Obeidallah,"4 minute read Updated 8:05 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/24/opinions/jon-stewart-daily-show-return-trump-obeidallah/,"Editor’s Note: Dean Obeidallah, a former attorney, is the host of SiriusXM radio’s daily program, “The Dean Obeidallah Show.” Follow him on Threads. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.
It only took eight years, but apparently Jon Stewart has finally decided to answer the plea from my May 2016 CNN article titled, “We need Jon Stewart back now!”
At the time, my point was that we desperately needed Stewart back in “The Daily Show” host chair because he was the comedic antidote to then-candidate Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. And after Trump won that election, many — including myself — believed that if only Stewart had not abdicated his late-night show in August 2015, Trump might well have been defeated.
That is why the news that Stewart is returning to “The Daily Show” in February as an executive producer and a host — even if just one day a week in that latter role — is more than the “Moment of Zen” he treated us to on his show for 16 years. It’s truly a moment of celebration.
On a serious note, I don’t actually believe my 2016 article had anything to do with Stewart returning. And no one — not even the award-winning host himself — can save us from Trump or any other societal problem facing our nation today.
I am confident, however, that Stewart’s weekly hosting will bring us much-needed laughs as he points out the absurdity of the words and actions of people in power — including Trump, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene or even President Joe Biden. Stewart — while clearly leaning left on many political issues — had no qualms about directing his comedic barbs at Democrats while hosting “The Daily Show.” And, of course, Stewart also became an insightful critic of the corporate media — much to the chagrin of some cable news outlets. (I’m especially looking at you, Fox News, but who could forget his famous comments on CNN’s Crossfire in 2004, battling with then co-host Tucker Carlson?)

But … and you knew a but was coming … Stewart’s history of effectively ridiculing and taunting Trump is what so many of us will be tuning in for. And if history is any guide, Stewart will get under Trump’s pathetically thin skin, surely causing him to lash out on social media.
That’s how it went before. Just one example came shortly before Trump announced his 2016 run, when Stewart discussed the other GOP presidential candidates. When he got to Trump, Stewart joked, “They’re all very colorful characters, but for me there can only be one F**kface von Clownstick.” Stewart then did an impression of Trump, mercilessly mocking him for saying he had a secret, “foolproof” plan to defeat ISIS.
How did Trump respond? With a series of angry tweets calling Stewart “a wiseguy with no talent,” “the most overrated joke on television” who delivered “dumb clown humor” and more. For a comedian, having a person like Trump respond angrily on social media to your jokes is better than a standing ovation.
Now, however, there’s an added concern that Stewart didn’t have to deal with back in 2015 when he was last hosting “The Daily Show.” If Trump were to win in 2024, he may go beyond simply slamming Stewart on social media and employ the apparatus of government to silence him.
As a reminder, in 2019 as president, Trump threatened “Saturday Night Live” for parodying him by publicly demanding the Federal Communications Commission investigate the iconic comedy show. Trump even bemoaned that there was no form of “retribution” against the show for ridiculing him.

Given Trump has made “retribution” a central theme of his 2024 campaign, even vowing to be a dictator if he wins — but only for “one day” — Stewart has potentially more to lose. But as we’ve seen with his activism, Stewart has not backed down before to a fight with people in power. For example, in 2019 he confronted members of Congress to their faces, slamming them for not helping 9/11 first responders. And in 2022, he again took members of Congress to task for not passing legislation to help veterans who contracted illnesses after being exposed to burn pits during their active service. In both cases, Stewart’s work helped pass the legislation at issue.
As I wrote in 2016 when pleading with Stewart to return to the airwaves, “In what will likely be a truly ugly and stress inducing general election contest,” Stewart would offer “us a much needed comedic cathartic release.” Those words are even more true today given that Trump — or as Stewart called him, “F**kface von Clownstick” — is the likely 2024 GOP presidential nominee. Given what is coming between now and November, we have all earned Stewart back, and at least a few Moments of Zen!"
7H6FL20FOO_NBKSHQ39N3ODGIP,China takes delivery of Boeing 737 Max in show of support for troubled plane maker,"By Xiaofei Xu and Chris Isidore, CNN","2 minute read Published 10:10 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/25/business/china-boeing-737-max-delivery-hnk-intl/,"Boeing has delivered its first 737 Max to a Chinese airline for the first time in nearly five years, according to flight data, in a rare spot of good news for the embattled company.
The delivery is seen as an important affirmation from a key market for the plane maker, whose reputation for safety and quality in its commercial jets was dealt a massive blow following a terrifying accident aboard a 10-week-old 737 Max 9 flight on January 5.
According to flight tracking website Flightradar 24, China Southern Airlines flight CZ5073 departed from Boeing Field in Seattle, Washington, on Wednesday for China via Honolulu. The use of the airline’s flight number, instead of a Boeing one, suggests the ownership of the plane has already been transferred.
Boeing (BA) declined to comment on the apparent delivery.
The plane, a 737 Max 8 according to flight data, was built in September 2019 and has been parked in Boeing’s Seattle factory since then, according to flight tracking sites Flightradar 24 and Aviation Flights.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grounded the aircraft in March 2019 after 346 people died in two separate fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia. It was discovered that a safety feature meant to stop the plane from climbing too fast and stalling had improperly forced the nose of the plane down, causing the crashes, as CNN reported previously.
Chinese aviation authorities instructed its airlines in March 2019 to ground all their 737 Max 8 aircraft, citing the need for “strict control of safety risks.” That ban was lifted in 2021, following the model’s clearance by the FAA, but there haven’t been any new deliveries of the model to China until now.
In December, the trade publication the Air Current said Boeing had won a key clearance from China’s aviation regulator, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), allowing Boeing to prepare Max aircraft for delivery, Reuters reported."

GOP Rep. Barry Loudermilk will have the opportunity to examine the unredacted transcripts “in camera” if he agrees to protect the names of the four witnesses who were mentioned anonymously in the January 6 committee’s final report, the letter says. As part of the White House offer, Loudermilk will be allowed to review but not keep the transcripts.
CNN has reached out to Loudermilk for comment on the White House offer.
Loudermilk, who is spearheading the Republican-led investigation into the work of the former January 6 select committee, prompted the White House for the unredacted transcripts because he claimed the redacted versions he had access to excluded key details, according to a letter obtained by CNN.
The offer from the White House comes as House Republicans have sought to discredit the January 6 committee’s investigation and related criminal cases against Trump since taking over the majority.
Since starting his probe, Loudermilk has alleged he is missing certain transcripts, video tapes of depositions and information from the former January 6 panel, claims that have been repeated by former President Donald Trump and his allies in court.
Trump’s attorney in the Georgia election subversion case has accused prosecutors of withholding deposition videos from the January 6 committee’s interviews with former Justice Department officials, claiming footage was shown to the grand jury but not turned over to defense attorneys in discovery.
The allegation was ultimately determined to be baseless as prosecutors confirmed in court that no such footage exists, but the claim successfully added fuel to an ongoing narrative of collusion between the committee and criminal prosecutors who have charged Trump in various election-related cases.
The transcripts Republicans are seeking from the White House are of officials who worked during the Trump administration on January 6, 2021, serving in non partisan roles, including positions with national security responsibilities, Richard Sauber, special counsel to President Joe Biden, wrote to Loudermilk.
“We will make the unredacted transcripts available to you for review in camera, provided that you agree in writing to abide by the commitments made on a bipartisan basis by the Select Committee—to maintain the anonymity of the four witnesses consistent with the conditions under which the witnesses agreed to appear before the Select Committee, and to prevent the disclosure of ‘operational details and private information,’ ” Sauber added.
Loudermilk has made a similar ask to the Department of Homeland Security for unredacted, complete transcripts of Secret Service agents who testified to the former select committee that he does not have in his possession.
He has also accused the former chair of the January 6 committee, Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson, of improperly archiving work in a series of letters. Loudermilk raised questions about whether Thompson’s committee improperly coordinated with federal and state prosecutors who have charged Trump with crimes tied to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election because he says that correspondence was not properly archived, according to a letter obtained by CNN. Loudermilk also asked Thompson to provide the passwords to files that he said were uncovered in a “forensic analysis of the archived hard drives” and are password protected.
Thompson has repeatedly defended his panel’s archival process, and said in his most recent letter back to Loudermilk, “the many accusations in your letter are false.”
Thompson pointed to a direct page number in the January 6 select committee’s final report that mentions the sharing of materials with federal and Georgia prosecutors. In response Loudermilk’s accusation about password protected recovered files, Thompson stated, “I have absolutely no idea what you are talking about.”"

“We regret to announce that after a 10-day exhaustive search, our two missing U.S. Navy SEALs have not been located and their status has been changed to deceased,” Central Command said in a statement Sunday. “Out of respect for the families, no further information will be released at this time.”
CENTCOM added that teams from the US, Japan and Spain searched more than 21,000 square miles to try to locate the two missing SEALs. The two sailors were boarding a vessel in search of illicit Iranian weapons when one fell into the water due to eight-foot swells, and the second jumped in after them according to protocol, CNN previously reported.
“We mourn the loss of our two Naval Special Warfare warriors, and we will forever honor their sacrifice and example. Our prayers are with the SEALs’ families, friends, the U.S. Navy, and the entire Special Operations community during this time,” said Gen. Michael Erik Kurilla, US CENTCOM commander.
“We mourn the loss of our two brave Navy SEALs, and our hearts are with their families,” Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement Sunday. “The entire Department is united in sorrow today. We are grateful to all who worked tirelessly to try to find and rescue them.”
The US maintains a small military presence in Somalia that focuses on the threat of the al-Shabaab militant group, an extremist Islamist organization that has carried out attacks against the Somali government. The US recognizes al-Shabaab as a terrorist organization.
In addition to training Somali forces, the US has also coordinated with the Somali government to carry out strikes against al-Shabaab.
According to US Africa Command, “Al-Shabaab is the largest and most kinetically active al-Qaeda network in the world and has proved both its will and capability to attack U.S. forces and threaten U.S. security interests.”

7IAYVL49F8_7ARK937A6D972IF,Illinois election board hears objection to Trump candidacy based on January 6 insurrection,"By Marshall Cohen, CNN","3 minute read Published 3:14 PM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/26/politics/illinois-14th-amendment-trump-january-6/,"A retired judge hired by the Illinois State Board of Elections held a hearing Friday on whether the 14th Amendment’s “insurrectionist ban” applies to former President Donald Trump.
Several voters filed the challenge against Trump, arguing that Illinois should join Colorado and Maine in removing him from their 2024 presidential ballots based on his role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol. The decisions in those states were paused pending the outcome of Trump’s appeal of the Colorado case to the US Supreme Court.
Retired Illinois judge Clark Erickson presided over the roughly two-hour hearing in Chicago on Friday. His recommendation is expected to be announced on Tuesday when the full election board meets. The panel will then vote on the recommendation.
An attorney for the challengers, Matthew Piers, asserted that Trump filed “false” paperwork with Illinois election officials when he certified that he was “fully qualified to serve as president.” As a result, Piers argued, Trump “may not be placed on the ballot.”
Piers played harrowing video footage from the assault on the US Capitol, and pointed out that Trump has “repeatedly failed to denounce what happened on January 6 and has recently referred to persons convicted of criminal misconduct on that day as ‘hostages.’”
“What binds us all, in this profession, is the respect for the rule of law,” Piers told the judge at the end of his arguments. “If we lose that, we all might as well find something else to do, or maybe another country to live in. That is what is at the center of this case.”

Trump lawyer Scott Gessler, who defended him in the Colorado case, reiterated many of the defenses that were used to beat back similar cases across the country. Lawsuits have been dismissed on procedural grounds in Michigan, Minnesota and other states.
Gessler, a former Colorado secretary of state, argued that the insurrectionist ban doesn’t apply to the presidency, that “there was no engagement by President Trump in any violence” and that the deadly events of January 6 didn’t amount to an insurrection. He also raised due process concerns.
“We are a country of rule of law, and we are a country of democracy,” Gessler said, accusing the challengers of “using highly spurious legal theories … to drive home a political point and to prevent President Trump from being able to appear on the ballot.”
Erickson, the judge, is a Republican and served on the Kankakee County Circuit Court for 25 years, until his retirement in 2020. He was appointed in 1995, elected to a full term on the GOP ticket in 1996, and won retention elections in 2002, 2008, and 2014.
The Illinois State Board of Elections, which is expected to vote Tuesday on whether to accept Erickson’s recommendation in the Trump case, is a bipartisan panel with four Democrats and four Republicans. Their decision can be appealed in Illinois state courts.
Illinois’ Republican primary is on March 19. With Trump dominating the GOP nomination race, the Illinois contest may have little political impact. But the battle over his spot on the primary ballot is a proxy fight over his overall eligibility to return to the White House.
At its Tuesday meeting, the election board is also slated to vote on a 14th Amendment challenge lodged against President Joe Biden by a group of conservative activists.
They say Biden “provided aid or comfort to the enemies of the United States” by failing to secure the US-Mexico border. Legal experts have largely panned the idea of applying the “insurrectionist ban” against Biden as a meritless stunt, even as some Republicans have embraced the move as a way to retaliate against the Democratic incumbent."

Authorities say they arrested Michael Diggs for allegedly picking up Shane Pryor, 17, after Pryor ran from two Philadelphia Juvenile Justice Services Center counselors in the driveway of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.
Pryor, who is suspected of killing a woman in 2020, escaped just before noon Wednesday while he was being transported to the hospital in the University City neighborhood for a hand injury, police said.
Police said Diggs picked up Pryor in a “cream-colored Ford” shortly after his escape, and officers were able to find the car and Diggs the same day.
Diggs is being charged with hindering apprehension, escape, use of a communication facility and criminal conspiracy, according to authorities.
“The arrest marks a significant step forward in the ongoing efforts to bring all those involved in the incident to justice,” according to a news release from police.
CNN was unable to determine whether Diggs has an attorney.
Pryor remained on the loose, authorities said. The US Marshals Service announced a $5,000 reward Thursday for information leading to the capture of Pryor, who authorities have described as dangerous.
The US Marshals Service said it believes Pryor may be receiving other help as he continues to evade custody.
“One hundred percent, he’s being helped by someone out there on the street,” Supervisory Deputy Marshal Rob Clark said at a news conference Friday afternoon.
Clark said Pryor has been in jail since he was 14, so “he surely has help aiding his flight,” adding, “how much of the city does he really know?”
Clark emphasized that, like Diggs, “anyone (else) helping him, no questions asked, you’re going to be prosecuted.”
As Pryor was getting out of a vehicle in the driveway of the hospital, he escaped from detention center staff, Frank Vanore, deputy commissioner of investigations for Philadelphia police, said in a news conference Wednesday afternoon.
Five minutes after his escape, Pryor was seen on video in the lobby of the hospital’s Hub for Clinical Collaboration building asking an employee to use the phone, and he left the building after being denied, the US Marshals Service said in a statement Thursday.

Pryor ran from the hospital, and he was seen on surveillance video entering various buildings trying to get resources, police said.
When Pryor left the vehicle, he did not appear to have any handcuffs or restraints on him, Vanore said. Investigators believe he wasn’t restrained during the transport either, a law enforcement source close to the manhunt told CNN.
Philadelphia police are investigating if Pryor broke free of his restraints, or if restraints were not used in transporting the 17-year-old to hospital, according to Sgt. Eric Gripp, a spokesperson for the Philadelphia Police Department.
Gripp told CNN it is standard practice for suspects to be handcuffed and shackled when transported. There were two juvenile services counselors in the medical transport vehicle with Pryor, which also is standard practice, Gripp said.
On Friday, US Marshals shed light on the moments immediately after Pryor escaped and the pursuit that followed.
The two counselors who were in charge of escorting Pryor to the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia chased after him and were “extremely close,” according to Clark, but they “may have slipped,” allowing Pryor to get away.
“Wherever he’s going, we’re going to pursue him,” Clark said.
Investigators believe Pryor injured himself to prompt the trip to the hospital and are “highly confident” he has received help from an accomplice to evade police, a source said.
He weighs about 180 pounds, and he’s about 5 feet, 7 inches tall, Vanore said, adding that he was wearing a dark blue sweatsuit when he fled.
Pryor was being held on a murder charge in the 2020 killing, and has been in the juvenile detention center awaiting trial since he was 14, Vanore said.
CNN has contacted the Philadelphia Department of Human Services, which runs the juvenile justice center, for comment.

“We are looking in parking garages, which are very, very large – they’re multiple levels – just to see if he’s still in the area,” Vanore said. However, officials did not believe he was in the area of the hospital as of Wednesday afternoon, the deputy commissioner said.
No lockdown was in effect Wednesday in connection with the escape. But Pryor is considered dangerous, and the public should call 911 if he is seen, police said.
“Obviously we don’t want anyone to approach him,” Vanore said. “We’re hoping that if somebody sees an individual walking without a coat – because he doesn’t have one at this point – and a blue sweatsuit, they give us a call.”
In a phone interview Thursday afternoon, defense attorney Paul DiMaio told CNN his juvenile client has “always maintained his innocence” in the murder charges he’s facing.
“He said, ‘I didn’t do this,’ and he said it over and over again,” DiMaio said. “I have no idea why he ran.”
DiMaio told CNN neither he nor Pryor’s family have heard from Pryor since he escaped, but DiMaio said he thinks Pryor may have run because of a December court ruling that kept his murder case out of juvenile court.
“The only thing I can speculate is I know from talking to his mother and talking to him (that) he was really scared and really frustrated that the system kind of failed him (by trying him as an adult),” Pryor’s attorney said.
DiMaio said while he found Pryor to be “mild mannered” and not “dangerous,” he would still advise him to turn himself in. “It could be that this fear, this frustration might have driven him – with no one really watching him – to walk away,” he said.

7OHXQVCAQS_PTK6C8UZ5ZNGPWC,Belarus arrests families of political prisoners in fresh crackdown,"By Christian Edwards, Catherine Nicholls and Niamh Kennedy, CNN","2 minute read Published 7:57 AM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/25/europe/belarus-kgb-arrest-political-prisoner/,"Belarus has conducted mass raids, interrogations and arrests of dozens of friends and relatives of political prisoners, a Belarusian human rights group said, in the regime’s latest crackdown on dissent.
At least 159 people were persecuted across the country on Tuesday in a “massive security raid” carried out by the Belarusian State Security Committee, referred to as the Belarusian KGB, according to Viasna Human Rights Center.
The Belarusian KGB reportedly came to the homes and workplaces of the friends and family of political prisoners, interrogating around 100 people and arresting at least 26 others. Many said they were forced to sign non-disclosure agreements, Viasna said, adding some detainees’ phones were inspected before being returned with monitoring software installed.
Criminal proceedings have been opened for some of the individuals accused of “promoting extremist activities,” Viasna wrote on X Thursday.
Maryna Adamovich, the wife of political prisoner and former presidential candidate Mikalai Statkevich, was sentenced to 15 days in prison for “petty hooliganism,” the human rights group said.

Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya said she was “shocked” by the raids and called on the global community “to respond decisively to this atrocity.”
Tsikhanouskaya, who was forced into exile in 2020 after President Alexander Lukashenko won a presidential election deemed by observers to be fraudulent, called Adamovich’s arrest a “stark reminder of the regime’s ruthless tactics.”
“This latest wave of repression is the regime’s revenge on those who love our country & seek a real path out of the political crisis in Belarus created by the dictator,” Tsikhanouskaya wrote Thursday on X.
The Belarusian State Security Committee did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment.
Several European governments on Wednesday condemned the detentions. Norway’s Foreign Ministry said it was “deeply concerned by yesterday’s arrest of Maryna Adamovich, other human rights defenders and their family members.” It called for all political prisoners to be released immediately.
The Dutch Foreign Ministry called the raids “yet another escalation in a long row of human rights violations by the Belarusian authorities.”
In its annual report published earlier this month, Human Rights Watch said Belarusian authorities had carried out a “widespread and systematic crackdown on dissent” during 2023.
“Over the past year, Belarusian authorities doubled down to create an information vacuum around raging repressions by cutting political prisoners off from the outside world and bullying their lawyers and families into silence,” the group said."

Smith, who was sentenced to death for his role in a 1988 murder for hire, had survived the state’s initial attempt to execute him by lethal injection in 2022. Earlier Thursday, the US Supreme Court denied his last-minute appeal to halt the execution, after declining the same request on Wednesday.
Smith’s time of death was 8:25 p.m. local time, officials announced. In a news conference after the execution, Alabama Department of Corrections Commissioner John Hamm said nitrogen was running for about 15 minutes.
In a joint report, witnesses from the media said Smith made a lengthy statement before he died, saying, “Tonight Alabama caused humanity to take a step backward,” and adding, “I’m leaving with love, peace and light, thank you for supporting me, love all of you.”
Smith appeared conscious for “several minutes into the execution,” and for two minutes after that, he “shook and writhed on a gurney,” according to the media witness report. That was followed by several minutes of deep breathing before his breath began slowing “until it was no longer perceptible for media witnesses.”
When asked at the news conference about Smith shaking during the start of the execution, Hamm said Smith appeared to be holding his breath “for as long as he could” and may have also “struggled against his restraints.”
“There was some involuntary movement and some agonal breathing, so that was all expected and is in the side effects that we’ve seen and researched on nitrogen hypoxia,” Hamm added. “So nothing was out of the ordinary of what we were expecting.” Agonal breathing is usually described as a kind of gasping seen in people who are dying.
Another witness, Smith’s spiritual adviser who’d previously expressed concern that the method could be inhumane, described the death in more graphic terms, saying it was “the most horrible thing I’ve ever seen.”
Smith, wearing a mask through which the nitrogen was administered, convulsed when the gas was turned on, “popped up on the gurney” repeatedly, and gasped and heaved, the Rev. Jeff Hood said.
“An unbelievable evil was unleashed tonight,” Hood said.
One of the sons of the victim, Elizabeth Sennett, said Smith’s death got justice for his mother.
“Nothing happened here today that’s going to bring mom back. Nothing,” Mike Sennett said at the news conference. “We’re glad this day is over. All three of the people involved in this case years ago, we have forgiven them.”
“Kenneth Smith made some bad decisions 35 years ago, and his debt was paid tonight,” he said.
In a statement, Smith’s legal team said they were “deeply saddened” by his death, adding he had found and “sincerely practiced his faith,” had become sober and helped other inmates achieve sobriety, and had earned an associate’s degree.
“Nothing can undo the tragic consequences of the actions for which he was convicted, including the pain of the Sennett family and friends. Kenny’s life, however, should be considered in its full context,” the statement added.
Little is known about how the method of execution, known as nitrogen hypoxia, was carried out because the state’s published protocol bears redactions experts say shield key details from public scrutiny. The state, in court records, indicated the redactions were made to maintain security and it believes death by nitrogen gas to be “perhaps the most humane method of execution ever devised.”

But Smith and his team were skeptical. “The eyes of the world are on this impending moral apocalypse,” the inmate and his spiritual adviser, Hood﻿, said midday Thursday in a joint statement. “Our prayer is that people will not turn their heads. We simply cannot normalize the suffocation of each other.”
Elizabeth Sennett’s sons told CNN earlier Thursday they felt it was time for Smith’s sentence to be carried out, adding they believed their mother was forgotten because of the new execution method.
“It seems like a lot of the focus today is on Smith and his nitrogen, whatever, process,” Mike Sennett said. “And that’s kind of upset us a little bit.”
“What’s going on is overshadowing what’s actually happened,” his brother, Chuck Sennett, said. “He’s gotta pay the price for what he done to our mother,” who should be remembered “as a loving, caring woman.” The two brothers were in their 20s when their mother was killed.
Before his execution, Smith accepted a final meal of steak, hashbrowns and eggs, according to information released by the Alabama Department of Corrections.
The US Supreme Court first declined to intervene in Smith’s case on Wednesday after his attorneys tried to argue a second execution attempt would violate the US Constitution’s protection against cruel and unusual punishment.
A separate federal appeals court ruling on Wednesday evening also declined to halt the execution﻿. Smith’s team had again appealed Thursday morning to the Supreme Court.
State officials on Wednesday welcomed the high court’s rejection of Smith’s earlier request, framing it as an “attempt to bar the State from executing him by any method at all,” Attorney General Steve Marshall said in a statement.
Alabama “remains confident that the execution, and long-awaited justice, will proceed as planned,” he said.
Still, Smith’s advocates and critics of the state feared the nitrogen gas execution could go awry, pointing to its novel nature, questions around its shrouded protocol and Alabama’s recent struggles to carry out lethal injections.
In 2022 alone, the state carried out or attempted three executions in a row that critics deemed “botches,” meaning they deviated from the stated protocol. In two of the cases, the inmates – including Smith – survived as officials called off the executions because they could not set an intravenous line used to deliver the fatal drugs before the death warrants expired.
Alabama on Thursday used nitrogen hypoxia, a method it adopted in 2018. It is one of just three states, along with Oklahoma and Mississippi, that has approved the use of nitrogen for executions, though no other state has used it and only Alabama has a protocol.
﻿In theory, the method involves replacing the air breathed by an inmate with 100% nitrogen, depriving the body of oxygen. Its proponents contend the process will be painless, citing nitrogen’s role in deadly industrial accidents or suicides.
Others are skeptical, including a group of United Nations experts who this month voiced concern a nitrogen gas execution will “result in a painful and humiliating death,” with no scientific evidence to the contrary.
“It’s lunacy, absolute lunacy,” Smith’s spiritual adviser said before the execution.
“The process, obviously, is designed to execute Kenneth Smith,” Hood told CNN. “But the way that they’re constructing this, the way that they’re doing it, the way that they’re being silent, the way that they’re holding back information, yes, it’s incredibly concerning. And should be incredibly concerning for everybody in the room.”
Apart from the execution method, Smith’s life should be spared based on the previous, failed attempt to put him to death, said the founder and director of the Equal Justice Initiative, a non-profit opposed to excessive criminal punishment that advocates on behalf of death row inmates. The group has assisted Smith’s attorneys in the case.
“Since that time, we’ve been arguing that the state doesn’t have the competency to carry out these executions,” Bryan Stevenson told CNN on Thursday. “They switched the method, and now they’re saying they have the skill to carry out a method that’s untested and never been used before.”
Smith was convicted and sentenced to death for the murder of Sennett, whose husband, Charles, was having an affair and had taken out an insurance policy on his wife, according to court records.

Charles Sennett recruited a man who recruited two others, including Smith, and agreed to pay each $1,000 to kill his wife and make it look like she died in a burglary, the records show. The men carried out the killing as planned in March 1988, and Smith took from the Sennett home a VCR player that he stored in his own home.
Charles Sennett killed himself a week after the murder, records state, as the investigation’s focus turned to him. Smith was ultimately arrested after authorities, based on an anonymous tip, searched his home and found the VCR player.
Smith was convicted and sentenced to die, but an appeals court overturned the initial outcome and ordered a new trial. He was again convicted in the retrial, but this time his jury voted 11-1 for a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole.
The judge in Smith’s second trial, however, essentially vetoed the jury’s vote and sentenced the defendant to death – a practice known as judicial override that’s since been repealed in Alabama.

7R9AKNSKXP_Z1IOVDHWPZD5AWK,"Hoping to chip away at Biden’s Black vote, conservative group to test menthol cigarette message in South Carolina primary","By Rene Marsh, CNN","3 minute read Updated 12:23 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/24/politics/south-carolina-cigarettes-black-vote/,"In the lead-up to the South Carolina primary, a conservative group is eyeing the state as a valuable testing ground for messages opposing the US Food and Drug Administration’s proposed menthol cigarette ban, something they hope will chip away at President Joe Biden’s Black vote.
The Liberty Policy Foundation, a conservative advocacy group, plans on launching an aggressive ad campaign in S﻿outh Carolina to see whether it can sway some public opinion against Biden and Democrats, according to a Republican strategist working with the group.
The ads rolled out on digital platforms Wednesday morning.
The ad campaign is targeting three groups, the strategist said: African Americans who disapprove of Biden and think he has been ineffective as president, small business owners and young Americans who lean independent.
The Liberty Policy Foundation sees the ads as a “high priority because we can test how or if it moves voters for the primary,” the strategist told CNN.
Republicans and conservative groups are trying to determine whether leveraging this issue can influence voter behavior and reduce the president’s vote count. Republicans are seeking to capitalize on what polls show is a dip in Biden’s support and enthusiasm among Democratic voters by potentially turning the proposed ban into a wedge issue in the 2024 election.
The strategist said the group is launching a mid-six-figure ad campaign in South Carolina followed by four other states a week later: North Carolina, Virginia, Nevada and Michigan, which are seen as potential swing states in a general presidential election.
Biden has yet to decide on whether to approve the FDA’s proposed ban on menthol cigarettes, which health advocates say would save hundreds of thousands of Black lives, but which could also be unpopular with some Black voters.
Menthol cigarettes are the preferred cigarette among many Black smokers after the tobacco industry heavily marketed menthols in the Black community for decades. Menthol cigarettes continue to be widely available and priced cheaper in Black communities, according to the nonprofit advocacy group, The Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.
CNN viewed the ad that’s set to run in the South Carolina market, which features a woman in a voiceover. “President Biden keeps talking about uniting Americans, bringing us together, so why is he pushing policies that continue to divide us? Like his proposal to criminalize menthol cigarettes. Community leaders have warned Biden about the unintended consequences of banning menthol cigarettes.” The ad shows headlines related to Eric Garner, who died after police held him in a chokehold. Police initially confronted Garner for allegedly selling cigarettes illegally.
Some civil rights leaders with ties to the tobacco industry have raised concerns with the White House that a ban would criminalize menthol cigarettes and lead to an increase in deadly police interactions.
The proposed menthol ban explicitly states it would solely be aimed at cigarette manufacturers and retailers, not individuals.
Other groups, such as the NAACP and the Congressional Black Caucus, support the proposed menthol cigarette ban.
In a report issued on Wednesday, the American Lung Association called for the Biden administration to act “swiftly” on the proposed ban.
“Menthol cigarettes make it both easier to start and harder to quit by reducing the harshness of the smoke and cooling the throat,” notes the association’s annual State of Tobacco Control report. Researchers estimate that a regulation banning menthol cigarettes would save about 654,000 lives over the next 40 years, especially those of Black smokers, who are disproportionately more likely to smoke menthols."

Wolf, CNN","2 minute read Published 7:27 AM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/23/politics/haley-trump-new-hampshire-events-comparison-dg/,"Rather than sprint across New Hampshire, former President Donald Trump has split his time between the campaign trail and the courtroom in the week since he romped in the Iowa Republican caucuses.
He made the decision to attend multiple sessions of his civil defamation trial in New York, capitalizing on media exposure from that case even though it hinges on the fact that he has already been found liable for sexually abusing the former advice columnist E. Jean Carroll in a department store in the 1990s.
Trump’s lawyers say he plans to testify in the case, although they asked that it be delayed until after the New Hampshire primary. The illness of a juror means there will be no proceedings on January 23, the state’s primary day. The court appearances did not keep Trump away from New Hampshire; he still conducted rallies on most days, although he spent last Thursday out of court and off the campaign trail.
Trump’s chief rival, on the other hand, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who also served as US ambassador to the United Nations in Trump’s Cabinet, has conducted multiple New Hampshire campaign events each day, barnstorming the state with her chief backer, Gov. Chris Sununu. In the week since she placed third in the Iowa caucuses, Haley increased the intensity of her blitz over the weekend, according to CNN’s analysis.
Number of rallies may not be equal to number of voters reached. Haley held an event in a high school in Exeter Sunday night, for instance, while Trump addressed supporters at an opera house in Rochester."
7T6B0JDFBA_BUODCYVD1SHXA40,GOP senators seethe as Trump blows up delicate immigration compromise,"By Manu Raju, Melanie Zanona, Lauren Fox and Ted Barrett, CNN","7 minute read Updated 8:52 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/25/politics/gop-senators-angry-trump-immigration-deal/,"Senior Senate Republicans are furious that Donald Trump may have killed an emerging bipartisan deal over the southern border, depriving them of a key legislative achievement on a pressing national priority and offering a preview of what’s to come with Trump as their likely presidential nominee.
In recent weeks, Trump has been lobbying Republicans both in private conversations and in public statements on social media to oppose the border compromise being delicately hashed out in the Senate, according to GOP sources familiar with the conversations – in part because he wants to campaign on the issue this November and doesn’t want President Joe Biden to score a victory in an area where he is politically vulnerable.
Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell acknowledged in a private meeting on Wednesday that Trump’s animosity toward the yet-to-be-released border deal puts Republicans in a serious bind as they try to move forward on the already complex issue. For weeks, Republicans have been warning that Trump’s opposition could blow up the bipartisan proposal, but the admission from McConnell was particularly striking, given he has been a chief advocate for a border-Ukraine package.
Now, Republicans on Capitol Hill are grappling with the reality that most in the GOP are loathe to do anything that is seen as potentially undermining the former president. And the prospects of a deal being scuttled before it has even been finalized has sparked tensions and confusion in the Senate GOP as they try to figure out if, and how, to proceed – even as McConnell made clear during party lunches Thursday that he remains firmly behind the effort to strike a deal, according to attendees.
“I think the border is a very important issue for Donald Trump. And the fact that he would communicate to Republican senators and congresspeople that he doesn’t want us to solve the border problem because he wants to blame Biden for it is … really appalling,” said GOP Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, who has been an outspoken critic of Trump.
He added, “But the reality is that, that we have a crisis at the border, the American people are suffering as a result of what’s happening at the border. And someone running for president not to try and get the problem solved. as opposed to saying, ‘hey, save that problem. Don’t solve it. Let me take credit for solving it later.’”
GOP Sen. Todd Young of Indiana called any efforts to disrupt the ongoing negotiations “tragic” and said: “I hope no one is trying to take this away for campaign purposes.”
“I would encourage (chief Senate GOP negotiator) James Lankford and other conservatives to produce a work product with which they will shortly allow conservatives like myself to review it and take heart that there are a number of us who won’t be looking to third parties and assessing the propriety of passing this bipartisan proposal,” Young said.
It’s an all-too-familiar dynamic for the Republicans who served while Trump was in office, where he could easily derail legislative action on Capitol Hill with the blast of a single tweet or stir up a new controversy that Republicans were forced to respond to. And with Trump now marching toward the presidential nomination, Republicans are once again bracing for life with him as the nominee.
Underscoring just how damaging Trump’s comments and campaign to kill the border deal have been in the Senate, one GOP senator on condition of background told CNN that without Trump, this deal would have had overwhelming support within the conference.
“This proposal would have had almost unanimous Republican support if it weren’t for Donald Trump,” the Republican senator said.
GOP Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina – who has also been involved in the talks – said he didn’t know if anyone could convince Trump to not kill the deal. But he acknowledged that it would take some “courage” for members to be able to press ahead at this point in defiance of Trump – though Tillis argued it would ultimately be beneficial for Trump for them to pass a border security deal and help address the flow of migrants trying to enter the country.
“I think this is when members of the Senate have to show some courage and do something that at the end of the day will be very helpful for President Trump,” Tillis said.
Asked whether it was a mistake for Trump to be assailing this deal, Tillis said: “I’ll leave it to him to figure out how he needs to get into office. I hope you’ll leave it to some of us who would support that effort to give him the tools he needs to really manage the border and the abuse and the dangerous situation we have today.”
For his part, McConnell – who has had zero relationship with Trump since the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack – downplayed Trump’s opposition saying, “It’s not anything new,” and insisting they were not abandoning the talks.
“We’re still working,” McConnell said. “Trying to get an outcome.”
Sen. John Thune, the no. 2 Senate Republican, said the discussions have reached a critical moment but acknowledged they may need to turn to a “plan B.”
“If we can’t get there, then we’ll go to plan B,” Thune said. “But I think for now at least, there are still attempts being made to try and reach a conclusion that would satisfy a lot of Republicans.”
In the latest sign that the emerging border deal faces an uphill climb, a senior leadership aide to House GOP Leader Steve Scalise told a group of Senate Republican chiefs of staff on Thursday that it was dead on arrival in the House, according to a source familiar.
Senate Republicans on the fence about the proposal may be less inclined to back it, knowing it’s going nowhere in the House and knowing Trump wants a border deal killed.
Frustration reigned inside the Senate GOP on Thursday amid lingering confusion over the status of a deal.
While McConnell has said the talks are still proceeding, Young warned Republican leadership against pulling the plug before they’ve taken a thorough temperature check inside the conference, where a contingent of Republicans are still fighting for a deal.
“I think leadership needs to count noses before they make any impulsive decisions,” he said.
Pressed on whether it was realistic to pass a border deal with Trump opposing it, Young said: “It may be possible. Listen, I’m very much attuned to the political realities, but I think before you make these consequential decisions on behalf of this conference, you’ve got to consult with the conference.”
Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who has been openly critical of McConnell, said he was “puzzled” by the leader’s comments during the closed-door meeting on Wednesday, which was supposed to be focused on Ukraine.
“I mean, we were talking about funding for Ukraine and all of the sudden he brings up the border and then, again, lays out what I consider a pretty lame excuse, trying to shift blame to President Trump for, I would say, his failed negotiation, not James Lankford,” Johnson said. “James Lankford has worked his tail off. It’s McConnell that took away the leverage by not tying Ukraine funding to actually securing the border.”
Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who has made no secret of her frustration with Trump over the years, said members need to remember how big this moment is for the border and for Ukraine and put their own politics aside.
“I’m not giving up. This is not about Trump and this is not about me. This is about our country. This is about democracy around the world. This is about security for our own country and so let’s keep pushing to get this border deal,” she said. “Let’s stand by the commitments that we have made for our friends and our allies so that our word actually means something.”
This is the second time in six years Trump killed or was actively trying to kill a bipartisan immigration deal as it emerged. Back in 2018, Murkowski was part of bipartisan talks over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. The bill got 54 votes in the Senate, but not enough to get it over the finish line.
Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, one of the Democrats involved in the border talks, expressed frustration about Trump seeking to inject chaos into the situation.
“I think over the next 24 to 48 hours, they are going to make a decision as to whether they want to do this, or whether the forces surrounding Donald Trump – who want to keep chaos at the border – win,” Murphy said. “So they have a decision to make. I hope they make that decision very quickly. We have an agreement that is 95% written and is ready to get to the floor if Republicans decide that they actually want to solve the problem.”

7TFWUHHHVY_GS58ZNAE2BLNXSB,"Cornell donor demands president step down, citing ‘toxic’ diversity policies","By Matt Egan, CNN","3 minute read Published 11:32 AM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/25/business/cornell-president-step-down-dei/,"The growing battle between Ivy League institutions and frustrated alumni is now playing out at Cornell University.
A prominent alumnus and longtime donor is calling for the immediate resignations of Cornell President Martha Pollack and Provost Michael Kotlikoff, arguing the university’s diversity policies have created a “toxic” environment.
Jon Lindseth, an emeritus member of Cornell’s board of trustees, penned an open letter demanding university leaders clean house. Lindseth says he’s dismayed by Cornell’s response to antisemitism and its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies.
Citing investigations into Cornell from the federal government and lawmakers, Lindseth argued Cornell “desperately needs a culture shift.”
“No alumnus, student, or faculty member should accept Cornell’s being in this shameful position,” Lindseth wrote. “We need new leadership to correct these intolerable circumstances and to redeem Cornell’s legacy and honor as soon as possible.”
The Cornell backer expressed alarm at what he described as rising “antisemitism and general intolerance” on campus.
But Lindseth’s biggest gripe is over DEI, which has emerged as a flashpoint at universities and across corporate America.
Lindseth mentioned “DEI” 23 times in his open letter, demanding the university eliminate its DEI staffing and programming and the “toxic academic environment it creates.”
While universities and companies have for years championed their DEI programs as a way to address racial inequities in society, these policies are now under attack by conservatives and other critics who argue they go too far and are inherently unfair. Billionaire Bill Ackman, who led the campaign against ousted Harvard President Claudine Gay, has been a vocal opponent of DEI programs.
Lindseth’s criticism of Cornell’s DEI policies are supported by the Cornell Free Speech Alliance, an alumni group founded in August 2021 pushing to reform the university.
Cornell signaled Pollack continues to have the backing of her board.
“For nearly seven years, I have strongly supported President Pollack, and that support remains strong today,” Kraig Kayser, chair of the board of trustees at Cornell, said in a statement. “The board is working effectively with the administration to respond to various challenges facing higher education and opportunities to advance the university’s mission.”
In his letter, Lindseth demanded that his calls for resignation get added to the agenda for “our emergency board meeting” to be held on Friday.
While the website for Cornell’s board of trustees does indicate meetings are scheduled, university officials say these are not emergency meetings.
“Cornell’s trustees are gathering in New York this week as part of a regularly scheduled series of meetings to discuss university affairs,” Joel Malina, vice president for university relations at Cornell, said in a statement. “Board meetings are scheduled many years in advance.”
Cornell has been among the universities hit by rising tension amid the Israel-Hamas war. In November, a Cornell student was federally charged in connection with a series of online posts threatening to kill and harm Jewish students.
Last fall, the Department of Education launched an investigation into Cornell and other major universities after receiving complaints about incidents of antisemitism and Islamophobia.
Earlier this month, the Republican chair of the House Ways and Means Committee sent a letter to Cornell, Harvard, the University and Pennsylvania and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology threatening to reconsider their tax-exempt status due to concern about their responses to antisemitism."
7U7A28YSZ3_LEPUQVUS3NDR1MR,"Before part of an Alaska Airlines plane blew off, Boeing had removed and adjusted it, reports say","By David Goldman, CNN","5 minute read Published 8:24 AM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/25/business/boeing-737-max-door/,"Before the plane took its first flight, Boeing had removed and reinstalled the part that blew off of an Alaska Airlines flight on January 5, according to reports from the New York Times and the Seattle Times, both citing a person familiar with the matter.
Although federal investigators continue to probe the incident and have not reached any conclusions, the details could provide critical new insight into what may have caused a gaping hole to form in a 737 Max 9 mid-flight.
The reports said the door plug, a part of the plane used to seal the aircraft when no exit door is installed, was removed because Spirit AeroSystems, which makes the fuselage for 737 Max 9 planes, needed to make other repairs to the door plug’s rivets, used to connect various parts together. Boeing then reinstalled the door after Spirit AeroSystems made the repair.
Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems are under multiple investigations that probe their safety policies and procedures. The Federal Aviation Administration recently expanded its Boeing probe to include Spirit AeroSystems, the National Transportation Safety Board is also reviewing the incident, and Washington Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell, chair of the Senate Commerce Committee, announced Wednesday that she would hold a future hearing to investigate Boeing’s safety record.
Boeing said it couldn’t comment on the reports about what may have led to the door plug blowing off the plane, citing the ongoing investigation.
“As the air safety agency responsible for investigating this accident, only the US National Transportation Safety Board can release information about the investigation,” Boeing said in a statement.
Spirit did not respond to a request for comment.
Although details are sparse, there have been some clues about what went wrong over the past few weeks. Boeing CEO David Calhoun on January 9 acknowledged the company made a “mistake” at a staff-wide safety meeting, but he did not specify what that mistake was. NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy has demanded Boeing provide answers about any mistake it made as part of its safety investigation, which is separate from the FAA’s audit.
Alaska Airlines CEO Ben Minicucci on Tuesday revealed the carrier found “some loose bolts on many” Boeing 737 Max 9s in an interview for “NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt.”
The FAA has grounded the 737 Max 9 since the incident. But late Wednesday, it approved a set of inspection criteria for the 171 grounded planes that, if followed, could return the grounded aircraft to service.
But the agency also issued a stern warning to Boeing: “The January 5 Boeing 737-9 Max incident must never happen again.” And it said it would not grant any production expansion of the 737 Max lineup while its safety probe of Boeing continues.
Airlines, especially Alaska and United, had faced hundreds of cancellations a day because of the grounding.
“The exhaustive, enhanced review our team completed after several weeks of information gathering gives me and the FAA confidence to proceed to the inspection and maintenance phase,” FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said in a statement Wednesday.
Each of the 171 grounded aircraft must be inspected, including the bolts, fittings and guide tracks for the door plug. The process also includes tightening fasteners and performing “detailed inspections of…dozens of associated components.”
FAA on Sunday also required airlines to ensure older Boeing 737 planes with similar door plugs were secure. The FAA said airlines operating the Boeing 737-900ER model should visually inspect the planes but didn’t require them to be grounded. Alaska Airlines on Thursday said it has completed all of those inspections “with only one minor finding, which was immediately corrected.”
In a statement Wednesday, Boeing said it will “continue to cooperate fully and transparently with the FAA and follow their direction as we take action to strengthen safety and quality at Boeing.”
But Whitaker noted Boeing itself is not out of the woods.
“Let me be clear: This won’t be back to business as usual for Boeing,” he said. “We will not agree to any request from Boeing for an expansion in production or approve additional production lines for the 737 Max until we are satisfied that the quality control issues uncovered during this process are resolved.”
Boeing has faced repeated quality and safety issues with its aircraft for five years now, leading to the long-term grounding of some jets and the halt in deliveries of others.
The 737 Max’s design was found to be responsible for two fatal crashes: one in Indonesia in October 2018 and the other in Ethiopia in March 2019. Together, the crashes killed all 346 people aboard the two flights and led to a 20-month grounding of the company’s best-selling jets, which cost it more than $21 billion.
Internal communications released during the 737 Max grounding showed one employee describing the jet as “designed by clowns, who in turn are supervised by monkeys.”
Late last month, Boeing asked airlines to inspect all of their 737 Max jets for a potential loose bolt in the rudder system after an airline discovered a potential problem with a key part on two aircraft.
Its quality and engineering problems have extended beyond the 737. Boeing also had to twice halt deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner, for about a year starting in 2021 and again in 2023, due to quality concerns cited by the FAA. And the 777 jet also suffered a grounding after an engine failure on a United flight scattered debris onto homes and the ground below.
Two Max variants — the Max 7 and the Max 10 — are still awaiting approval to begin carrying passengers. This latest incident complicates that, Wells Fargo analysts noted."

Here’s why experts say it’s needed,"By Allison Chinchar, CNN","3 minute read Published 9:52 AM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/25/weather/hurricane-cone-change-risk-perception-climate/,"The iconic cone graphic used by the National Hurricane Center to depict the potential path of tropical systems will undergo a noticeable change for the upcoming hurricane season.
The cone will be deemphasized over land in the continental US, with more emphasis being placed on expected impacts by showing tropical storm and hurricane watches and warnings instead. This means you’ll see active tropical alerts instead of a cone where applicable over land.
Watches and warnings used to only be shown alongside the cone “in a line along the coastline of the affected area,” NHC director Michael Brennan told CNN. Now, the alerts are taking “precedence over the cone,” and “will be predominant on the graphic,” NHC spokesperson Maria Torres told CNN.
The hurricane cone is changing this upcoming hurricane season! Instead of a track forecast, the forecast will now include hazards. What you can expect where you live. This change was unveiled at #OSSTahoe. @EdgewoodTahoe Here is the info:https://t.co/LsZVZY5DaP pic.twitter.com/evMEvuyvmj
The changes aim to address shortcomings in how people perceive a storm’s threats based on the boundaries of the track forecast cone, which only depicts the potential track of the center of a storm and not the storm’s hazards.
A recent study found people perceive areas highlighted within the cone as “at risk” and areas that are outside of it as being “safe.” Researchers refer to this perceived notion as the “containment effect.”
A storm’s winds can be expansive and stretch well beyond the cone.
“This is most critical for strong hurricanes that can carry tropical storm and hurricane force winds well inland, but it will improve the risk communication for wind hazards for all tropical cyclones,” Brennan said.
Tropical storm and hurricane watches and warnings are used to indicate the impending risk of winds of tropical storm force (39 to 73 mph) or hurricane force (74 mph-plus) in a given area, independent of the cone.
Brennan said the decision was based in part on research that tested “alternative cone variations.”
“The inclusion of inland wind risk information on the cone graphic decreased focus on the storm track and increased focus on wind hazard information compared to the versions of the cone without inland watches and warnings,” Brennan said.
The track forecast cone is designed to show where the center of a storm could be over the next five days. Statistically speaking, the longer the forecast period, the greater the likelihood for track error. The cone is much wider five days out compared to 24 hours out to account for the increase in potential track errors.
Every storm’s forecast is different and can have more or less error, but the width of the cone represents the majority of track errors from past storms over a five year period. This means the center of a forecast storm remains within the cone on average 60% to 70% of the time, according to the hurricane center.
But given that the effects of tropical storms and hurricanes often extend much farther than this defined boundary, it can be confusing for the public which may be trying to make critical decisions about preparations or even evacuations.
Two different hurricane forecast examples from the past highlight the difficulty in forecasting and the risks of paying too much attention to the traditional cone.
The forecast track for Hurricane Elsa in 2021 five days before landfall in Florida was almost an exact match of where the storm actually tracked. The consistency made it much easier for people to prepare.
But in the case of Hurricane Marco in 2020, the center of the storm tracked outside of the cone originally issued five days before its approach to the Gulf Coast.
You may not have been ready for Marco if you based your hurricane preparedness plans solely off of its cone.
The cone graphic change will be experimental for the 2024 hurricane season in both the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific basins. Brennan said that feedback during this phase will be used to determine whether this change will be permanent or if any other changes are needed in the future."

Megalodons, the huge prehistoric sharks depicted in movies such as “The Meg,” had more slender bodies than was previously thought, according to a new study.
Many mysteries remain about the biology of megalodons, but until now, great white sharks had been used to model their appearance. But new research from a team led by Kenshu Shimada, a paleobiologist at DePaul University in Chicago, and Phillip Sternes, a doctoral candidate at the University of California at Riverside, suggests megalodons would have had skinnier bodies than great whites.
The Otodus megalodon lived more than 23 million years ago. Fossils of the extinct giant are hard to come by. While there are plenty of fossilized shark teeth, their bodies mainly consist of cartilage rather than bones, and are rarely preserved.
This new research is based on the reappraisal of an incomplete set of fossil vertebrae found in Belgium.
While previous research estimated that this particular megalodon would have measured 9.2 meters (30.2 feet) in length, Shimada and his coauthors say the individual would have in fact measured at least 11.1 meters (36.4 feet).
Shimada told CNN that the fossil vertebrae would not have been strong enough to support a shark of this length if it had the same body shape as a great white.
“If the body form of the great white shark is directly applied to the vertebral column, the diameter of the vertebrae would then be unrealistically small for the shark to be able to support its body,” he said.
Shimada explained that a vertebral column of this diameter would not provide sufficient support for the muscles of a body shape like that of a great white, and would also increase the risk of spinal cord injuries.

“This is particularly important considering that shark skeletons are not as strong as bones because they are cartilaginous (made of cartilage),” he added.
He did note, however, that some shark species, including megalodon, exhibit some strengthening of this cartilage through calcification, or a build-up of calcium that can then harden.
“The new study considers the size proportion between the vertebrae and body in a more biologically realistic manner, which would indicate a leaner body at least compared to the modern great white shark,” he said.
The research suggests that “the modern great white shark may not necessarily serve as a good modern analog for assessing at least certain aspects” of megalodon biology, said Shimada.
“There are still many misconceptions or unanswered questions about the biology of megalodon, and we would like to continue to scientifically correct or elucidate them based on the fossil record,” he said.
As things stand, there is only a partial fossil record for the megalodon, and Shimada hopes a complete skeleton will be discovered someday.
The study was published Sunday in the journal Palaeontologia Electronica.

Previous research published in August 2022 estimated the megalodon would have been able to devour prey the size of orca whales – which can be up to 26 feet long and weigh more than 8,000 pounds – in just five bites.
The megalodon went extinct around 3.6 million years ago, according to the United Kingdom’s Natural History Museum, for reasons scientists are still trying to understand.
One theory is that their demise was linked to the fact that they were warm-blooded.
Previous research by Shimada and others concluded that being warm-blooded may have been one of the key drivers fueling megalodons’ massive size and overall prowess as predators, but it also made them sensitive to environmental changes.
“The fact that megalodon disappeared suggests the likely vulnerability of being warm-blooded because warm-bloodedness requires constant food intake to sustain high metabolism,” Shimada told CNN in July last year.
“Possibly, there was a shift in the marine ecosystem due to the climatic cooling,” causing the sea level to drop, altering the habitats of the populations of the types of food megalodon fed on such as marine mammals and leading to its extinction.

7XDFOQPYCI_7SB2VF8V9LS1N1D,Australia marks national day that stokes patriotism and anger,"By Angus Watson, CNN","6 minute read Updated 9:50 PM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/26/australia/australia-day-national-rallies-2024-intl-hnk/,"“Australia Day is Dead!” Indigenous activist Gwenda Stanley chants into the loudspeaker, as a crowd of thousands breaks into applause.
It’s Australia’s national day, but the crowd in central Sydney seethes in anger and cheers in solidarity with Indigenous Australians, many of whom view January 26 as nothing but the anniversary of their colonial dispossession, 236 years ago this Friday.
“Australia is stolen land and we need to be united and firm in our resistance and sustain that resistance until justice is achieved under our terms,” protest organizer Lynda-June Coe, a Wiradjuri woman, told CNN.
The Sydney crowd is diverse, and it’s replicated in Australian cities nationwide.
Each year an increasing number of non-Indigenous Australians find it impossible to celebrate Australia Day, in the knowledge that many of their Indigenous fellow citizens treat it as a day of mourning.
“I think it’s important to show up for the First Nations people in this country,” says Grace, from the crowd on a hot, humid morning in Belmore Park near Sydney’s Central Station.
“I think that there are plenty of other times that you can party if you want to celebrate the lots of good things about this country,” she says.
Elise wears the black, red and yellow of the Aboriginal flag on her earrings, as her friends hold a sign saying said: “Put down ya beer, pick up a banner. This is not a day to celebrate.”
Nearby, Kevin Shaw-Taylor agrees January 26 is “absolutely not” an appropriate day for national celebrations.
On the other side of the city, the Australia Day party was in full swing. The public holiday gives Australians a three-day weekend in the height of summer just a month after Christmas. Millions took full advantage.
Nowhere are the celebrations more colorful than Sydney Harbor. The city’s iconic yellow and green ferries were decked out in Australia Day regalia to take part in the annual race across the very same water that British Royal Navy officer Arthur Phillip crossed in 1788, planting the British flag at Sydney Cove to proclaim the new colony on January 26.
Frank Bongiorno, a history professor at the Australian National University (ANU), says its “pretty creative” to connect that colonial date to the modern state of Australia – which was founded on January 1, 1901.
That’s why many of Australia’s Indigenous peoples, and an increasing number of the non-Indigenous or “settler” population, have long dubbed the national holiday “Invasion Day” or “Survival Day” – acknowledging British settlement as first and foremost an act of Indigenous dispossession.
This year, the often toxic argument over the colonial past and continued disadvantage for Indigenous people has taken on a new dimension – it’s the first Australia Day since voters rejected a proposal to acknowledge the nation’s first people in its constitution.
Last October, Australians were asked in a referendum whether the country’s constitution should be amended to recognize Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders through the creation of an Indigenous advisory body – the Voice to Parliament – to advise on matters directly impacting Indigenous people.
Supporters said the Voice to Parliament would give First Nations people a say in efforts to remedy issues such as the eight-to-nine year life expectancy gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians or disproportionately high Indigenous incarceration rates.
But more than 60% of voters said no.
A study by the ANU found that most voted against the proposal because they didn’t want division and were wary of giving some Australians rights not held by others – arguments promoted by the referendum’s most vocal critics.
Professor Chelsea Watego, executive director of Queensland University of Technology’s Curumba Institute for Indigenous research, says the result reflected the Australian public’s attitude toward Indigenous people, who make up just under 3% of the population.
“It was a test for the Australian people to finally come clean and maybe have an honest conversation about racism in this country. But they can’t and they won’t. They will never let go of it because it enables them to occupy stolen land and not feel guilty about it,” says Watego, a Munanjahli and South Sea Islander woman.

Instead of guilt on Australia Day, a vast number of Australians “associate it with summer fun,” says Bongiorno, from the ANU. “Its particular cultural and political implications for many people are rather muted.”
But that is changing, according to both professors, who see an increasing number of non-Indigenous Australians choosing to use the day to mourn Indigenous loss and advocate for better outcomes.
Bongiorno says one ramification of a bitterly fought debate over the Indigenous Voice to Parliament, which descended into a swirl of misinformation and ugly rhetoric, is a sense that political capital can be won by stoking the culture war.
“The main impact has been on the domestic politics,” he said.
“Clearly the (center-right) Coalition parties (led by) Peter Dutton believes they got an advantage from their opposition to the Voice and now they are attempting to squeeze further advantage out of controversies around Australia Day.”
Dutton, who serves as federal opposition leader, this month called on Australians to boycott the country’s largest supermarket chain, Woolworths, over its decision not to sell cheap Australia Day paraphernalia ahead of the holiday. Dutton labeled the firm’s decision an “outrage” and “against the national interest.”
A Woolworths store in Queensland was vandalized in the wake of Dutton’s comments – spray-painted with curses and the nationalistic sporting catchphrase: “Aussie Oi Oi Oi.”
Woolworths CEO Brad Banducci took out full-page advertisements in national newspapers explaining the decision was a commercial one and appealing for the company’s staff to be kept safe.
One prominent commercial television breakfast host goaded Banducci for serving up “wokeness on aisle 3.”
“They are proud, hardworking Australians,” Banducci said of the Woolworths workforce. “For them to be seen as anti-Australian or woke is fundamentally unfair. Fair to address it to me but not to them.”
As emotions run high, vandalism has gone both ways. A century-old statue of Captain Cook was found face down in the grass in Melbourne on Thursday, his severed feet still attached to the plinth that celebrates his charting of Australia’s east coast and his proclamation of the land as British in 1770, almost two decades before the colony was established. Red paint was also splashed over a monument to Queen Victoria.
With all the toxic rhetoric, the hurt feelings and damaged pride – there has been little room in the mainstream post-referendum debate for new initiatives to remedy the tangible problem of Indigenous disadvantage.
Instead, the notion of the Blak Sovereign Movement has gained traction among Indigenous people who do not want to have to ask the settler population for their rights, instead vowing to empower themselves to control their own affairs.

Many proponents of Blak Sovereignty voted no in the referendum for that reason.
“I’m always excited about the way in which Blakfullas clap back, often under the most oppressive circumstances,” said Watego, using a term by which many Indigenous Australians self identify.
“The 26th of January is when we come together each year, to remember not just what we’ve lost, but to make a powerful statement to settlers that we’re not going anywhere, we’re not a dying race and we’re not going to be absorbed into the general population.”"

In a filing in Fulton County Superior Court on Thursday, Trump’s attorneys joined an effort to dismiss the case brought by one of his co-defendants, who alleged in a previous court filing that Willis was engaged in a romantic relationship with the special prosecutor on the case and has benefitted financially when he took her on vacations.
The filing also points to public comments Willis recently made defending her choice to select the lead prosecutor, Nathan Wade, arguing that she violated Georgia rules for prosecutors.
“The motion filed today on behalf of President Trump seeks to hold District Attorney Willis legally accountable both for the misconduct alleged in a motion filed by Mr. Roman as well as her extrajudicial public statements falsely and intentionally injecting race into this case,” Trump’s attorney, Steve Sadow, wrote in a statement.
In comments Willis made at Atlanta’s Big Bethel A.M.E. Church earlier this month, the DA defended her team of prosecutors in the case, calling into question why only one of the three prosecutors was being attacked.
“Is it that some will never see a Black man as qualified – no matter his achievements? What more can one achieve? The other two have never been judges, but no one questions their credentials,” Willis remarked.
The district attorney’s office declined to comment on the latest filing.
Trump’s attorneys claim that Willis made a “calculated effort to foment racial bias” against the defendants with her comments, which run the risk of prejudicing the public and prospective jurors.
“The DA’s comments directly ran afoul of Georgia Rules of Professional Conduct,” Trump attorneys wrote in the filing, adding that the maximum penalty for the alleged violation is disbarment.
“Her attempt to foment racial animus and prejudice against the defendants in order to divert and deflect attention away from her alleged improprieties calls out for the sanctions of dismissal and disqualification,” Sadow said in his statement."

View more opinion on CNN.
Elon Musk, who spends much of his time on futuristic endeavors, took a step into history on Monday. With his son on his shoulders, Musk visited a somber monument to humanity’s darkest past, the remains of the Auschwitz death camp, where the Nazis killed 1.1 million people during World War II, almost 1 million of them Jews.
That put Musk, whom many have accused of promoting antisemitism on his social media platform X, formerly Twitter, at the paramount memorial to the victims of the Holocaust, itself the zenith of industrialized hatred, which killed 6 million Jews just eight decades ago.
Why did Musk go to Auschwitz?
Was the pilgrimage one of self-reflection and atonement? Despite rising antisemitism across the globe, Musk’s trip appears to have been more of a public relations move aimed at repairing his reputation and boosting a flagging business.
Assaults, vandalism, harassment and even physical attacks against Jews had been increasing for months even before the Hamas assault inside Israel on October 7 and Israel’s subsequent fierce counterattack inside Gaza.
Once the war started, Jews, regardless of their views or connections to Israel, have been targeted to a degree they had never experienced in the United States, a country that, on the surface, seemed to be mostly free of the antisemitic virus, perhaps a lasting refuge for a minority that has been persecuted elsewhere for thousands of years.
Related article Opinion: Elon Musk’s Israel tour was transparently transactional and insulting
But suddenly antisemitism started coming out of the shadows on the far right and on the left.
Like in other entities where an upsurge in antisemitic activity started making headlines, Musk was taking performative action at Auschwitz. It was an effort to appear to be taking action while doing nothing.
After his visit to the death camp, Musk appeared at a conference on antisemitism in nearby Krakow, Poland. There, he defended his social media platform. X, he said, has less antisemitic content than other platforms. He gave no evidence to back that assertion up. But that, it seemed, was irrelevant.
There was nothing in his statements to suggest he will do anything about the problem.
Nothing suggests he will change the guidelines or even enforce X’s existing ones. A recent experiment by the Center for Countering Digital Hate, an internet monitoring group, found 98% of reported posts with shocking antisemitic, Islamophobic or anti-Palestinian content were left untouched. (X has rejected the center’s work as an effort to drive away advertisers and filed a lawsuit against it. The center says the lawsuit is an attempt to silence the organization.)
The moment Musk bought Twitter, reinstated suspended accounts and fired the content moderation staff, the platform exploded with hate speech, as documented by independent internet monitoring organizations. The verbal invective converged with real-world attacks on Jews, as cataloged by the Anti-Defamation League.
Related article Opinion: Progressives should never tolerate antisemitism
Musk’s own words amplified the surge of anti-Jewish conspiracy theories. When someone posted “Hitler was right,” accusing Jews of “hatred against whites,” Musk posted, “You have said the actual truth.”
He later apologized, calling the comment his “dumbest” ever. But it was hardly his first incendiary moment. Earlier Musk postings included one in which he declared that the Jewish financier George Soros “hates humanity.” It was described by Ted Deutch, head of the American Jewish Committee, as “The Protocols of the Elders of Zion for the internet age.” The Protocols is one of history’s foremost texts of antisemitic incitement.
Despite Musk apologizing for his endorsement of the “Hitler was right” post, advertisers fled X. The stampede accelerated after Media Matters said ads on X were appearing next to pro-Nazi and white supremacist posts. When Apple, Disney and IBM stopped advertising, Musk accused them of trying to blackmail him. X sued Media Matters.
To advertisers who left because of his antisemitic content, he said, “go f—k yourself.”
X was going into a tailspin. Ad revenue has collapsed. It was time to take action.
Unfortunately, there’s no sign that anything will change at the former Twitter, which has become a stronghold for far-right antisemites and people such as Tucker Carlson, who recently declared on X that rich Jews are funding a “white genocide.”
It’s easier to show up at a conference or a concentration camp, or to create a committee than to make real changes.
Consider Harvard University.
Related article Opinion: This unpalatable reality about antisemitism at Harvard
The school made headlines after a politically charged chain of events. President Claudine Gay was asked in Congress if calls for genocide against Jews violate Harvard rules against bullying and harassment. She said it depended on the context and later apologized. But after plagiarism charges surfaced, the embattled administrator resigned her post.
Many Jewish students said they had not wanted her to lose her job. They wanted Harvard to focus on tackling antisemitism with the same conviction with which it rejects racism or other forms of prejudice. That doesn’t seem to be happening.
A number of students have already filed a lawsuit against the school, describing it as a bastion of rampant and anti-Jewish hatred and harassment. The evidence is hard to miss.
When Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, setting on fire entire families in their homes, massacring more than 1,200 people and kidnapping hundreds more in the worst attack against Jews since the Holocaust, 31 Harvard student groups responded on that very same day, saying they held Israel “entirely responsible” and blaming Israel for the pogrom even before Israel started its military response, while the flames set by Hamas were still smoldering.
Since then, Jewish staff and students have implored the university for help in enforcing its own rules as they endure relentless harassment. A Harvard rabbi said antisemitism is “thriving” there, and after 26 years at the university, he’s “never felt so alone.”
Related article Opinion: I thought I’d be safe from antisemitism at my college. I was wrong
The popular theory of “intersectionality” has been weaponized against Jews, incredibly claiming that the most persecuted minority in history is part of a white oppressor class. That view now seems to permeate university campuses.
Across the country, 73% of Jewish students say they have seen or experienced antisemitism since the start of the 2023-2024 school year. Nearly half say they don’t feel safe on campus.
Under pressure, Harvard’s interim president, Alan Garber, just announced the appointment of the man who will co-chair its new task force on antisemitism. (Another task force on Islamophobia is being created.)
It was a moment to find a leader without controversial baggage. One who would help soothe the rifts and make a genuine effort to address the problem. Instead, Garber named a man who only recently declared that the problem of antisemitism on campus has been blown out of proportion.
Derek Penslar heads Harvard’s Center for Jewish Studies. Whatever the scholarly qualifications, he is a terrible choice for this new position. The main problem is not that he has made some startling statements about “Jewish civilization,” or that as a fierce critic of Israel he has used the language of Israel’s enemies to attack the country.

The most serious problem with the appointment of Penslar, who describes himself as “left of center,” is that he does not seem to think the problem he has been tasked with solving is a terribly serious one. Outsiders, he said, have “exaggerated” the issue. And he worried that paying attention to antisemitism is obscuring the vulnerabilities of pro-Palestinian students.
Former Harvard President Larry Summers said the university made its credibility problem worse by naming Penslar. “I am unable to reassure Harvard community members,” he wrote on X, “… that Harvard is making progress in countering anti-Semitism.”
The ADL called Penslar’s appointment, “absolutely inexcusable.”
From Musk, on the far right, to Harvard, on the left, antisemitic forces are being given a pass. Much of what we’re seeing is PR, theater, a pretense of action with little real impetus to solve what is admittedly a difficult problem — but one for which useful steps, such as improved content moderation on social media and unbiased leaders in the effort to uproot antisemitism, are plain to see."

An ancient, interdependent relationship that contributes to food systems and ecosystem stability across the globe could be changing.
Many flowering plants can self-pollinate, or transfer pollen between their own blossoms for seed generation and propagation, but most of these plants have relied on pollinators such as butterflies and bees to reproduce.
Now — amid declines reported in many pollinator populations — a new study on the evolution of one flower species’ mating system has revealed a remarkable shift that  could exacerbate the challenges faced by the plants’ insect partners.
The flowers’ reproductive evolution may be linked to environmental changes such as habitat destruction and rapid ongoing decreases in pollinator biodiversity, according to Samson Acoca-Pidolle, who led the study published December 19 in the journal New Phytologist.
Related article What is a mass extinction, and why do scientists think we’re in the middle of one?
Comparing seeds of wild field pansies collected decades ago in France with the plants’ modern descendants, Acoca-Pidolle and his colleagues discovered that today’s flowers are smaller and produce less nectar as a result of increased self-pollination, which has direct impacts on pollinator behavior. The pansies of the past self-fertilized less and attracted far more pollinators than those of the present, according to the study.
“It seems that it’s only traits that are involved in plant-pollinator interaction that are evolving,” said Acoca-Pidolle, a doctoral researcher at the University of Montpellier. The changes could constrain the plants’ ability to adapt to future environmental changes and have implications for “all of floral biodiversity” — potentially diminishing flowering plants’ genetic, species and ecosystem variation.
“This may increase the pollinator decline and cause a vicious feedback cycle,” study coauthor Pierre-Olivier Cheptou told CNN. If plants produce less nectar, there will be less food available to pollinators, which will in turn accelerate the rate at which the animals’ numbers dwindle, he explained.
“The major message is that we are currently seeing the evolutionary breakdown of plant pollinators in the wild,” said Cheptou, an evolutionary ecologist at the French National Centre for Scientific Research and professor at the University of Montpellier.
Using a method called “resurrection ecology” to conduct the research, the study team germinated the seeds of four populations of wild field pansies, scientifically known as Viola arvensis, that were collected in the 1990s and early 2000s in the Paris region.
Some propagules, or parts of a plant that can be used to grow a new plant, can stay in a seed stage for a “very long time,” Acoca-Pidolle explained. They are living, but at a very low metabolic rate. “It’s like a long nap,” he said.

In 2021, the team sourced field pansies from the exact spot the ancestral seeds were collected 20 to 30 years earlier. The scientists then conducted a population genetic analysis that looked at self-pollinating rates and changes in heterozygosity, or genetic variability, as well as changes in floral traits that are associated with pollinator attraction.
In a sample of 4,000 flowers, rates of self-fertilization went from around 50% for the flowers collected two to three decades beforehand to roughly 80% for their naturally occurring descendants, the authors found. Meanwhile, the “resurrected” flowers’ surfaces were 10% bigger, produced 20% more nectar and were frequented by more bumblebees than their modern counterparts.
An increase in a flowering plant species self-pollinating, or “selfing,” isn’t always a bad thing, said Gretchen LeBuhn, a professor of biology at San Francisco State University who has studied interactions between pollinators and plants.
“The way to think of (selfing) is it’s sort of like a holding-on strategy,” said LeBuhn, who was not involved with the study. Although increasing selfing does often lead to a decline in genetic variation in a population, among several other negative consequences, it also can maintain the population, she added. “Like an insurance policy.”
Declining genetic variation within a plant population matters because those with a reservoir of genetic variation can better respond to major environmental changes, effectively reducing extinction risk.

But when reading the new paper, part of her “actually thought an increase in selfing means that the population is going to be preserved,” LeBuhn said. “If plants can persist through time, and pollinator populations increase again, it would say that this is a mechanism for preservation of species.”
It’s unclear whether that evolutionary shift can be reversed, however — although the new research suggests there is an expectation for a depletion in a plant population’s genetic diversity at term, according to Acoca-Pidolle.
“Some scientists believe there may be a tipping point after which a plant cannot go back,” he noted, adding that the evolutionary transition is classically considered to be “irreversible.” Investigating whether these wild pansies have the ability to recover from the impacts of selfing is the next big question, Acoca-Pidolle said.
In the meantime, it’s important to acknowledge that the authors don’t really have the data on what was happening with pollinators 20 to 30 years ago, LeBuhn said. “The one thing that they can’t document is the magnitude of difference in pollinators in these sites in that time and now,” she said — which stems from gaps in historic widespread pollinator monitoring.
“(The study) is a really important demonstration of the tight linkages between plant and pollinator communities,” LeBuhn said. “I think the next step in the research is understanding what the implications are for pollinators.”
Other recent studies have found that declining pollinator populations, an offshoot of harmful human activities, threaten the future of food crops and the survival of the many species that depend on them.
The growing body of research bolsters the case for urgent conservation measures — like developing and protecting flower-rich habitats that act as floral and nesting resources — to help stymie global pollinator declines, according to Acoca-Pidolle.
“Our impact is not only killing some individual plants … we are putting them on an evolutionary path that could be bad for them,” Acoca-Pidolle told CNN. “And even after we disappear, for a long time, we will have a footprint on this evolutionary trajectory of many species, of the biodiversity of the planet.”

The team at the BioRescue project successfully impregnated a southern white rhino via in vitro fertilization (IVF), according to a press release, creating a possible path for restoring the northern white rhino species.
Northern white rhinos are critically endangered and the only two remaining rhinos, Najin and Fatu, are infertile females that live under constant surveillance in Kenya.
However, there are living cells from 12 different northern white rhinos stored in liquid nitrogen in Italy and Germany.
The impregnation of the southern white rhino was an international effort to save the species.
The sperm was collected from a southern white rhinoceros named Athos, who lives at Zoo Salzburg in Austria. The egg cells were retrieved from Elenore, a southern white rhinoceros living in the Pairi Daiza Zoo in Belgium. The samples were then transferred to Italy and fertilized in vitro.
Two embryos were transferred to Kenya and implanted in a surrogate mother, named Curra, at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in September 2023. The process of implanting the embryos included using a male “teaser” bull, named Ouwan, to stimulate typical mating behaviours.
Thomas Hildebrandt, the project head of BioRescue, described the process as “uncharted territory,” with the procedures, protocols, methods and equipment developed from scratch.
Unfortunately for the rescue project, both Curra and Ouwan were found dead in November. It’s believed the pair fell ill due to a severe bacterial infection following extremely heavy and climate change-related rains, which flooded the surrogate enclosure.
However, it was revealed at the time that Curra was pregnant with a 70-day-old male fetus. Tissue taken from the fetus confirmed that the pregnancy was a result of the embryo transfer.
Scientists said the next steps of this research program will be to select a new southern white rhino surrogate mother and teaser bull. They will then develop a northern white rhino embryo to implant in the surrogate.
Hildebrandt said they hope the offspring would then be able to live with Najin and Fatu to learn the behaviors of the northern white rhino species.

857J1EMMQY_28OACR6TVO3RFG2,Chinese stocks are having their worst start to a year since 2016,"By Anna Cooban and Laura He, CNN","4 minute read Updated 1:23 PM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240122,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/22/business/china-stock-market-falls-2016-crash,"China’s stock market had a rough 2023 and the rout has accelerated in the first few weeks of the new year, after Beijing dashed hopes that it might do more to support the struggling economy.
Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index fell 2.3% Monday, closing at its lowest level since October 2022. The index has lost more than 12% so far this month, nearly as much as it lost in all of 2023.
Mainland China’s Shanghai Composite Index tumbled 2.7% in its biggest daily drop since April 2022. The Shenzhen Component Index, a tech-heavy benchmark, had its worst day in nearly two years, plunging 3.5%. The indexes have tanked 4.8% and 7.7% respectively in the first trading days of 2024.
It’s the worst start to a year for Chinese stocks since 2016, when investors were ditching their holdings following a market crash in 2015. A bubble popped as the economy showed signs of strain and share prices got way ahead of company profits.
In recent months, a real estate crisis, the slowest growth (outside the pandemic) in decades, and a crackdown on some businesses have all combined to undermine investor confidence.
Ken Cheung, chief Asian foreign exchange strategist for Mizuho Bank, said Monday that foreign investors were continuing to “reduce their risk exposure” to China and had “bearish expectations” for business conditions in the country.
“The Chinese government has not yet introduced effective measures to resolve the property turmoil and drive the economic recovery,” he wrote in a note.
Investors were left disappointed on Monday after China’s central bank decided to keep its benchmark lending rate steady. A cut to the rate would lower the cost of borrowing for people and businesses taking out loans or paying down interest, and therefore help stimulate economic activity.

The heavy market losses in 2024 come hot on the heels of a bruising run last year, when the CSI 300 index, comprising 300 major stocks listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen, fell more than 11%.
By contrast, the United States’ benchmark S&P 500 index climbed 24% in 2023, while Europe’s grew almost 13%. Japan’s Nikkei 225 soared 28% last year and is still going strong, notching gains of nearly 10% so far this month.
Demographic data released last Wednesday confirming that China’s population is getting older and smaller hasn’t helped quell investors’ anxieties. They were also perturbed that a speech delivered by Chinese Premier Li Qiang last week at the World Economic Forum failed to mention any new government stimulus measures to help juice the country’s ailing economy.
Brian Martin & Daniel Hynes, analysts at ANZ Research, wrote in a Friday research note that Li’s speech had “doused” expectations of further support measures. “(He) trumpeted the nations’ ability to hit its 5% growth target without flooding the economy with massive stimulus,” they wrote.
In recent months, Beijing has issued $137 billion worth of government bonds, the bulk of which will fund infrastructure projects, while China’s sovereign wealth fund has bought shares to support the country’s sagging stock market.
Li’s speech appears to have dealt another blow to investors already wearied by a raft of disappointing economic data coming out of Beijing, including the ongoing crisis in its real-estate sector and a rapidly shrinking population.
The country’s economy grew by 5.2% last year. That beat government projections but is still one of China’s worst economic performances in over three decades. The International Monetary Fund forecasts the country’s economic growth to slow to 4.2% this year.
In 2023, investors had eagerly anticipated a rebound in China’s economy following Beijing’s decision to scrap its strict zero-Covid policy at the end of the previous year. That robust recovery never came and investors voted with their feet. According to China’s Commerce Ministry, foreign direct investment into the country fell 8% in 2023 compared with the prior year.
Investors have also balked at Beijing’s sweeping crackdown on private enterprise, which began in late 2020 and has included fining foreign companies and detaining their employees in the name of national security.

In his January 16 speech, Li tried to reassure international investors that China presented “not a risk but an opportunity” and pledged to create a “world-class” environment for foreign companies to do business in the country.
He noted that the number of people classed as middle-income in China is expected to double to 800 million over the next decade. “The momentum for consumption … is very strong,” he said.
“Investors who willingly take on exposure to the precarious situation in China need to know the risks or may find themselves at the mercy of an unpredictable and authoritarian financial landscape,” Stephen Innes, managing﻿ partner of SPI Asset Management, wrote in a Friday note.
“Success is contingent on buying shares that avoid government scrutiny, making the entire investment process more akin to a game of chance than an informed decision-making process.”"
85NDCOW7WD_6YANTD3Z37920ZP,"EXCLUSIVE: Willis, Wade and others expected to be subpoenaed for hearing on Fulton County DA affair allegations","By Zachary Cohen, Nick Valencia and Jason Morris, CNN","6 minute read Updated 9:04 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/25/politics/fulton-county-subpoenas-willis-wade-election-subversion/,"A current and former law partner to Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor leading the 2020 election subversion case in Georgia, have been told to expect a subpoena to testify at a hearing next month on whether he and the district attorney who brought the case should be disqualified over their alleged affair and financial ties, sources familiar with the matter tell CNN.
The district attorney, Fani Willis, also is expected to be subpoenaed, sources say, and possibly others in her office.
The Fulton County judge overseeing the criminal case against former President Donald Trump and his allies called for the hearing to address claims from one of Trump’s co-defendants that Willis and Wade have a conflict of interest. Citing financial statements turned up in Wade’s current divorce proceeding, lawyers for Trump’s co-defendant, Mike Roman, argue that Willis financially benefited when Wade took her on lavish vacations after she hired him as special prosecutor.
“We’ve got a lot of information. We’ve got a lot of documents and a lot of witnesses,” Roman’s defense attorney Ashleigh Merchant told CNN when asked if she will issue subpoenas for witness testimony at the hearing, scheduled for February 15.
Roman has argued that the entire criminal case against him should be dismissed because of the alleged conflict of interest. While those familiar with the case say the allegations are not likely to derail the sprawling racketeering case Willis has built against Trump and his 14 remaining co-defendants, they have proven a significant distraction and given Trump and his allies ample fodder to claim the case is the result of a corrupt justice system out to get him.
Merchant said the evidence she presents at the hearing, including who she may call to the witness stand, will in part depend on what Willis says in response to the allegations. Judge Scott McAfee has ordered Willis to respond in writing by February 2.
Willis would likely fight any subpoenas for her or her staff. She is already trying to quash a subpoena to be deposed in Wade’s divorce proceeding.
Willis has asked to go to trial in August, but a trial date hasn’t been set.
Like all hearings in the Georgia 2020 election case, any witness testimony about the alleged romantic relationship between Willis and Wade – claims that have already prompted immense public scrutiny since coming to light in recent weeks – would be broadcast in real time via live stream.
Speaking to CNN’s Dana Bash on Thursday, Michael Moore, a former US Attorney in Georgia and a CNN legal analyst, said the allegations aren’t “necessarily the death blow to whether or not a case can move forward but it’s becoming a distraction and a circus.”
Moore said it wouldn’t surprise him if the judge takes control of the hearing to limit the distraction. “And that is to say, look we’re not going to turn this into an episode of Knots Landing here in the courtroom,” Moore said.
Willis and Wade have not directly addressed the affair allegations.
Willis told a church congregation on January 14 that Wade is qualified for the job and that her adversaries were targeting her and Wade because of race, asking, “Isn’t it them playing the race card?”
Despite having more experienced felony prosecutors on her staff, Willis appointed Wade to the post in 2021 when her investigation into the actions of Trump and his allies following the 2020 election was heating up.
Wade has earned more than $650,000 for his work on the election case, according to Roman’s court filing, which includes invoices from Wade’s firm. The filing alleges that Wade made more than other prosecutors in the DA’s office.
Willis and Wade now face the prospect of having to potentially confront explosive witness testimony in front of an audience that extends well beyond the courtroom.
Merchant told CNN Wednesday that she would prefer to focus on the issue of potential financial impropriety rather than the alleged romantic relationship itself, saying: “I’m hoping that we don’t have to go into that.”
“I think the real issue here is not this relationship. I think it’s more about the impropriety of having him on the team and having him present this to the grand jury and the conflict of interest in the appearance of impropriety,” Merchant said.
In the days since leveling the allegations of the affair in her motion to dismiss the case, Merchant told CNN that she and her team have uncovered more evidence to buttress the claims, including confirming the trips Willis and Wade took were personal vacations, and not work-related business trips.
“I think what’s relevant is to look at the personal nature of the trips. These are trips that neither Fani nor Nathan got reimbursement for. They didn’t get reimbursement through the county, they didn’t get reimbursement through her campaign,” Merchant said when asked about the nature of the trips.
Wade bought tickets for Willis to accompany him on at least two out-of-state trips, court records released last week show.
The records appeared in a motion filed in Cobb County Superior Court last week by Wade’s current wife, Joycelyn Wade, as part of her divorce case. They include copies of credit card statements that show Wade purchased airline tickets for himself and Willis, including trips to Miami in October 2022 and San Francisco in April 2023.
Joycelyn Wade’s lawyer also sought a deposition from what appears to be a travel agency that Nathan Wade paid, according to his credit card statement.
Those statements also show payments to cruise lines and hotels in Aruba and Napa Valley, California, though more details about those trips don’t appear in court records. Roman’s court filing suggests Wade and Willis traveled together on cruises and vacationed in Napa Valley and the Caribbean, citing “information obtained outside court filings.”
Trump and 18 co-defendants were charged as part of a conspiracy stemming from the former president’s efforts to overturn his 2020 electoral defeat in Georgia, including the use of “fake electors.” Four of the 19 have since pleaded guilty in negotiations spearheaded by Wade, and the remainder have maintained their not-guilty pleas.
Roman, a Trump 2020 campaign official, was indicted for his role in the fake elector plot in Georgia. As CNN has previously reported, Roman was closely involved in the effort to ensure fake elector ballots arrived at the US Capitol in Washington ahead of the January 6 certification of the 2020 election.

The resolution, which cleared the GOP-controlled state Senate 30-19, allows the special committee to subpoena people and evidence while putting witnesses under oath for their testimonies. At the end of its investigation, the committee will submit a report “that will recommend any changes to either legislation or appropriations,” according to state Sen. Greg Dolezal, who introduced the resolution.
“This resolution is about an officer of the state of Georgia, within a subdivision of the state of Georgia, and how they are using state funds,” Dolezal said on the Senate floor. “This falls squarely within what we should be talking about and what we should be addressing.”
The allegations against Willis and Nathan Wade first surfaced in a 127-page court filing earlier this month by former Trump 2020 campaign official Mike Roman, who was indicted over his role in the fake electors plot in Georgia.
Roman alleges that Wade is romantically involved with Willis and used money he billed the district attorney’s office for his work on the case to take her on lavish vacations.
Willis and Wade have not directly addressed the accusations, and the Fulton County district attorney’s office has not yet commented on the allegations specifically. The judge overseeing the case against Trump has given Willis until the end of next week to reply in writing to the allegations to the court.
In comments Willis made at Atlanta’s Big Bethel A.M.E. Church earlier this month, the DA defended her team of prosecutors in the case, calling into question why only one of the three prosecutors was being attacked.
“Is it that some will never see a Black man as qualified – no matter his achievements? What more can one achieve? The other two have never been judges, but no one questions their credentials,” Willis remarked.
The situation brings yet another twist in the multiyear effort to punish those involved in attempting to subvert the 2020 presidential election won by Joe Biden.
Legally, it is unlikely to kill the case, but this could be a big political gift to Trump, who is seeking to discredit the Georgia charges as illegitimate and politically motivated."

The first full moon of the new year, known as the wolf moon, will shine in the night sky Thursday.
January’s full moon reached peak illumination at 12:54 p.m. ET, but it will appear full through Friday evening, according to NASA.
Expect the bright orb to rise in the east around sunset Thursday and appear just about overhead around midnight, according to EarthSky.
Between Thursday evening and Friday morning, the full moon will be close to the bright star Pollux. The star will appear to rotate clockwise around the moon overnight, according to NASA.
January’s full moon is commonly called the wolf moon because wolves are active this time of year and can be heard howling on cold nights, according to the Old Farmer’s Almanac. The origin of the name stems from the Sioux language, which describes this moon as “wolves run together.”
But this wintry full moon also goes by many other monikers according to different Native American tribes: It’s known as the cold moon to the Cherokee people, the hard moon to the Lakota and the whirling wind moon to the Passamaquoddy tribe.
The full moon will be visible around the world, weather permitting, so bundle up to stay warm and enjoy the view. Here are other celestial events to look forward to this year.
Of the 12 full moons in 2024, September and October’s lunar events will be considered supermoons, according to EarthSky.
Definitions of a supermoon can vary, but the term generally denotes a full moon that is closer to Earth than normal and thus appears larger and brighter in the night sky. Some astronomers say the phenomenon occurs when the moon is within 90% of perigee — its closest approach to Earth in orbit.
Here are the remaining full moons of 2024:
February 24: Snow moon
March 25: Worm moon
April 23: Pink moon
May 23: Flower moon
June 21: Strawberry moon
July 21: Buck moon
August 19: Sturgeon moon
September 17: Harvest moon
October 17: Hunter’s moon
November 15: Beaver moon
December 15: Cold moon
Multiple eclipses will occur in 2024, including two types of lunar eclipses and two types of solar eclipses, according to the Old Farmer’s Almanac.
The most highly anticipated of these events is the total solar eclipse occurring on April 8, which will be visible to those in Mexico, the United States and Canada. A total solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between Earth and the sun, completely blocking the golden orb’s face.
Those within the path of totality, or locations where the moon’s shadow will completely cover the sun, will see a total solar eclipse.People outside the path of totality will still be able to see a partial solar eclipse, in which the moon only obscures part of the sun’s face.
A total solar eclipse won’t be visible across the contiguous US again until August 2044.
An annular solar eclipse will occur in the sky on October 2 over parts of South America. This type of eclipse is similar to a total solar eclipse, except the moon is at the farthest point in its orbit from Earth, so it can’t completely block the sun. Instead, annular solar eclipses create a “ring of fire” in the sky as the sun’s fiery light surrounds the moon’s shadow.
First image reveals spacecraft’s unexpected landing position on the moon
Meanwhile, a penumbral lunar eclipse will be visible to many across Europe, North and East Asia, Australia, Africa, North America, and South America between March 24 and 25.
A lunar eclipse, which causes the moon to look dark or dimmed, occurs when the sun, Earth and moon align so that the moon passes into Earth’s shadow. A penumbral lunar eclipse is more subtle and happens when the moon moves through the outer shadow, or penumbra, of Earth.
A partial lunar eclipse, in which Earth moves between the sun and the full moon without being perfectly aligned, will appear over Europe and much of Asia, Africa, North America and South America between September 17 and 18.
Check Time and Date’s website to see when each of these eclipses will appear.
Sky-gazers can look forward to a multitude of meteor showers this year, according to the American Meteor Society. Here are the dates when meteor events are expected to peak this year.

8B50ECNTVB_1DULS366HWIJ5NH,US and Iraqi governments expected to start talks on future of US military presence in the country,"By Natasha Bertrand and Oren Liebermann, CNN","6 minute read Updated 1:28 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/24/politics/us-military-iraq-talks-future/,"The US and Iraq are expected to soon begin talks on the future of the US military presence in the country, according to sources familiar with the matter, amid public calls from the Iraqi government for the US to withdraw its troops.
The US and Iraq agreed to form a higher military commission last summer, according to the Pentagon, as a vehicle for the talks. The discussions between US and Iraqi officials, akin to a working group, will focus on the next phase of the US-led anti-ISIS coalition, with the terror group now reduced to a shadow of its former self. US military officials and diplomats will be involved in the discussions, officials said.
The talks about the future of the US’ military presence have now taken on a greater urgency amid the wider regional instability, and amid growing public calls by the Iraqi government for the US to withdraw its troops from the country. Those calls have come in response to the US launching airstrikes inside Iraq targeting Iran-backed militants who have been attacking US personnel there.
Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin confirmed on Thursday that the military commission will launch “in the coming days.”
Military and defense officials will advise the commission “on the most effective evolution of the D-ISIS Coalition mission, ensuring that ISIS can never resurge, in consultation with Coalition partners at all stages of the process,” Austin said in a statement.
The US has roughly 2,500 troops currently in Iraq who have been operating there in an advise and assist capacity since December 2021, when the US military announced the end of its combat role in the country.
A senior military official told reporters on Thursday that the remaining contingency of ISIS fighters in Iraq and Syria is assessed to be “around the 1,000 or so,” including fighters, financiers, facilitators, and the “network that would support the Daesh fighters.”
“They’re disrupted, they’re suppressed … Daesh is not capable beyond small attacks, currently, in Iraq and Syria,” the military official said.
Part of the discussions will focus on whether and when it will be feasible to end the US military presence in Iraq. The US prefers a schedule that would be based on conditions in Iraq, including the ongoing defeat of ISIS and the stability of the government and the Iraqi security forces, US officials said.
But some elements within the Iraqi government prefer a schedule based on a timeline, setting the date for an American withdrawal regardless of the stability or the security situation within the country. On January 10th, the office of Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani said they would soon begin the process “to end the presence of the international coalition forces in Iraq permanently.”
A US official told CNN that “the US and Iraq are close to agreement on starting the Higher Military Commission dialogue that was announced back in August.”
“The HMC will be an opportunity to jointly evaluate the conditions required for the future of the D-ISIS fight in Iraq and shape the nature of the bilateral security relationship,” the official said. “We have been discussing this for months. The timing is not related to recent attacks. The US will maintain full right of self-defense during the talks.”
Jonathan Lord, the director of the Middle East security program at the Center for New American Security, told CNN that the US needs to transition its support for Iraq toward building “a lasting and sustainable military capacity in the [Iraqi Security Forces], to avoid another 2014. That hasn’t happened.”
“If we leave now, with no plan in place, we’re sending the patient back out on the street, with no plan to stay healthy,” he added, comparing the initial anti-ISIS intervention to an emergency room hospital stay. “Chances are, if things go bad, they’ll end up right back there. And it’s the most expensive, least efficient way to help them.”
On Tuesday, following the latest round of US strikes in Iraq, a spokesperson for the prime minister said in a statement that the strikes are “undermining agreements and various sectors of joint security cooperation” as the two countries are working to “reshape the future relationship.”
“There will be some cosmetic changes, but I don’t think the Iraqis want us to leave,” said a former senior US military official.
The former official pointed to a vote in the Iraqi parliament to remove US forces from the country shortly after the US assassinated a senior Iranian commander in Baghdad. Four years after that vote, the US military remains in Iraq at the invitation of the government.
“I think they recognize it will be difficult for them to survive without significant US assistance,” the former official said.
The US and Iraq agreed to start talks on the future of the US’ military presence last year, before the October 7 terror attack by Hamas on Israel sparked wider regional tensions and emboldened the Iran-backed groups, particularly Kataib Hezbollah, in Iraq and across the Middle East.
The Pentagon has maintained that the Iraqi government has not formally asked the US military to withdraw, emphasizing that the troops are still there at the invitation of the Iraqi government. And there is no set deadline for a conclusion to the higher military commission discussions, or their ultimate outcome.
Jon Alterman, the director of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the politics of the US military presence in Iraq have been “treacherous” for more than a decade, but it’s not a binary choice of staying or leaving. Nor is this a process that needs to move quickly, he said.
“This is a choice of where you want to be on a spectrum,” said Alterman. “Diplomats can manipulate both the timing and the direction of the talks and arrive at a wide variety of potential outcomes.”
Still, rumblings of a potential US change in its force posture in Iraq would be a victory for Iran, Alterman said. “Any sign that this is the beginning of the end would be widely celebrated in Iranian corridors.”
On Wednesday, Iraq’s foreign minister hinted at the coming discussions, saying in a statement that he met with the US Ambassador to Baghdad, Elena Romanowski, and “received from her an important message from the American government to the Iraqi government, which will be studied by the Prime Minister and the relevant concerned authorities. Next steps will be taken regarding it soon.”
The US also has a presence in Syria to fight ISIS, but administration officials told CNN that a withdrawal from that country is not under consideration.
“The Biden administration is not considering a withdrawal of forces from Syria,” a senior US official told CNN.

These two states — which have tended to take a more precautious approach to pandemic policies — are the first to break from federal guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which recommends at least five days of isolation for anyone with Covid-19. Oregon changed its isolation policy in May when the Covid-19 public health emergency lifted, and California followed suit earlier this month.
Officials in both states say the changes reflect policy that’s evolving along with the pandemic.
“We are now at a different point in time with reduced impacts from COVID-19 compared to prior years due to broad immunity from vaccination and/or natural infection, and readily available treatments available for infected people,” Dr. Tomás Aragón, director of the California Department of Public Health, wrote in the official order about the change. “Our policies and priorities for intervention are now focused on protecting those most at risk for serious illness, while reducing social disruption that is disproportionate to recommendations for prevention of other endemic respiratory viral infections.​”

The CDC recommends at least five days of isolation because people are likely to be most infectious during that time, and the science around that hasn’t changed. The recent order from the California health department notes that the potential infectious period spans from two days before through 10 days after symptoms or a positive test.
But experts broadly agree that easing isolation timeframes won’t significantly increase community transmission or severe outcomes — in part because the virus has been circulating at very high levels, even with more restrictive guidance in place.
“I don’t think this is reflecting updated science, but this is reflecting changing social norms and increasing workplace crunches,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiology professor and director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health.
Recent data from Oregon suggest the policy change has had minimal effect on virus trends. The state has seen a surge this winter, like the rest of the country, but Covid-19 hospitalization rates and emergency department visits have stayed below the national average, according to data from the CDC.
“We are not going to be able to completely stop transmission, and we’re not going to be able to get rid of this virus in the human population,” said Dr. Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. “Then, the decision of how to bring something into policy is really a summation of the medical risks as well as the risks to society as a whole.”
Instead, as the burden of severe disease has lessened, some experts say that stricter isolation policies may have unintended negative effects on public health.
“When we’re sick, we typically want to know what we have so that we can get treatment and possibly feel better,” said Dr. Sarita Shah, a clinical care provider and infectious disease epidemiologist at Emory University. “The ironic thing is, what I think has happened with Covid because of the isolation policies is that people kind of don’t want to find out because it leads to negative things.”

People with mild symptoms may not test because they can’t afford to miss a week of work and they might avoid wearing a mask because it could raise questions, she said. Less restrictive isolation policies could allow people to feel more comfortable with testing, which could prompt them to get treatment or feel more comfortable taking other protective measures.
Dr. Dean Sidelinger, Oregon’s state health officer, said that equity was a key factor considered in the decision to change isolation policy in the state.
“From a pragmatic standpoint, from an evidence-based and equity standpoint — trying to make sure that we weren’t unnecessarily burdening families, keeping kids out of school, or keeping people out of work who may have very limited sick leave — this made sense for us,” he said.
Public health policy decisions are rarely black-and-white, experts say, and weighing tradeoffs can be more of an art than a perfect science.
“There are different perspectives on the best way forward, even with everyone looking at the same data, everyone with the same good intentions in mind,” Barouch said.  “Well-meaning people could come to different conclusions.”
The CDC says that it will “continue to evaluate the latest data, including the continued decline in hospitalizations and COVID-related deaths compared to last year – likely the result of widespread vaccination and prior infection – as it considers its recommendations for how people can best protect themselves and their loved ones from the virus.”

But the agency notes that local jurisdictions have “shaped health guidelines to address situations on the ground” since the start of the pandemic.
In many ways, the changes California and Oregon made to their isolation policies for Covid-19 put it more in line with the way public health approaches other respiratory viruses, experts say. For example, if a child has a mild sore throat or fever, the decision about whether to go to school or not shouldn’t depend on the results of a Covid-19 test.
“It’s really challenging to have disease-by-disease policies in a respiratory season for which we don’t have ubiquitous testing,” Nuzzo said. People who are sick should take precautions, she said, and “we should be using tests as a tool, not as a penalty.”
While severe outcomes for Covid-19 have decreased over the years, it is still not just a cold, or even like the flu. The latest CDC data shows that Covid-19 hospitalization rates have consistently been at least twice as high as they’ve been for flu this respiratory virus season, and thousands of people have died from Covid-19 in the first two weeks of this year.
This ongoing burden of disease is why there is such strong debate about policy change, Shah said.
Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.
But the tools we have to manage Covid-19 have evolved rapidly and are much more in line with what’s available to manage other respiratory diseases, experts say — and isolation is just one strategy. Oregon and California, for example, still encourage people who test positive to wear a mask for at least 10 days.
Also, the policy changes in California and Oregon offer a broad, population-level approach to Covid-19 management. But individuals and places like hospitals may adjust based on their own risk tolerance.
“Health decisions generally are individual. At the end of the day, you’re always having that discussion with your doctor about what’s going to be best for you,” Shah said. The same internal analysis has now been happening around Covid-19 for years, and the risk-benefit balance may have shifted for many people, she said.
“I think it’s time to have that conversation and to have that debate.”"
8FV3PBGZ7J_B8WZJKRBHP5IMN1,What to know about the Fani Willis allegations and the election subversion case,"By Dan Berman, Paula Reid, Jason Morris, Nick Valencia and Zachary Cohen, CNN","5 minute read Updated 11:40 AM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/23/politics/fani-willis-allegations-election-subversion-case/,"The allegations of an improper relationship between the Fulton County district attorney and a prosecutor she hired has roiled one of the major cases against former President Donald Trump.
The situation is another twist in the multiyear effort to punish those involved in attempting to subvert the 2020 presidential election won by Joe Biden.
Legally, the situation is unlikely to kill the case, but this could be a big political gift to Trump, who is seeking to discredit the Georgia charges as illegitimate and politically motivated.
Here’s what to know:
Fani Willis, as the Fulton County district attorney, hired Nathan Wade as an outside consultant to work as a special prosecutor on the election subversion case.
The hiring occurred while Willis and Wade were allegedly having an extramarital relationship, and Wade has received over $650,000 for his work on the case, according to court filings.
According to credit card records included in Wade’s divorce proceedings, he paid for Willis to accompany him on trips to Miami and San Francisco.
The allegations have become public through two court cases: the divorce proceedings between Nathan and Joycelyn Wade and in a filing from election subversion defendant Mike Roman.
Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee, overseeing the election subversion case, has scheduled a hearing on Willis for February 15.
In a scenario in which Willis is disqualified (hypothetically) by McAfee from overseeing the Trump racketeering charges, the case would then go to the Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council of Georgia, which would decide what prosecutors the case could go on to next.
A Fulton County commissioner has launched an inquiry into whether Willis misused funds or accepted valuable gifts from a contractor in addition to their improper relationship. The commissioner has raised questions about Wade’s qualifications for this job.
Peter Skandalakis, executive director of the group, told CNN earlier there is no indication of investigation by other groups aimed toward removing Willis at the time. Skandalakis and Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp have both said this issue should be resolved in court first by McAfee.
House Republicans are also investigating the unsubstantiated allegations regarding Willis and Nathan Wade.
In addition to requesting a variety of financial documents, House Republicans are asking Wade to turn over any communications with federal investigators, the House January 6 committee and other executive branch agencies, including the White House.
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Jim Jordan has demanded that Nathan Wade turn over a series of documents and communications related to the election subversion case by Friday. If Wade fails to comply with the deadline, he could potentially face a subpoena, according to a source familiar with the matter who told CNN that “all options are on the table.”
Republicans on the Judiciary Committee have long sought to undermine the credibility of Willis’s case. The Fulton County district attorney’s office has rebuffed a number of Jordan’s earlier demands for documents.
Republican lawmakers at the state-level in Georgia have introduced legislation to establish a new committee for investigating Willis.
“The multitude of accusations surrounding Ms. Willis, spanning from allegations of prosecutorial misconduct to questions about the use of public funds and accusations of an unprofessional relationship, underscores the urgency for a thorough and impartial examination,” said state Sen. Greg Dolezal said in a statement.
Trump and 18 co-defendants were charged as part of a conspiracy stemming from the former president’s efforts to overturn his 2020 electoral defeat in the Peach State, including the use of “fake electors.” Four of the 19 have since pleaded guilty; the remainder have maintained their not-guilty plea.
The Georgia charges are key because as a state case, it’s not something that could be dismissed through a presidential pardon, which applies only to federal matters. Trump’s lawyers have long considered this case the most significant legal threat given the jury pool and the fact that it is beyond pardon powers.
It also includes alleged co-conspirators including former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, and Trump ally and attorney John Eastman, among others. Trump thus far is the only one charged in the election subversion efforts in the federal probe by special counsel Jack Smith.
While Trump has denied all of the charges and repeatedly attacked Willis, a Democrat, as partisan, he and allies have failed in efforts to throw the prosecution off track. As a state case, there is also no direct alleged nexus to Biden and the US Justice Department.
Meadows attempted to move his charges to federal court, where he might have a better opportunity to get them dismissed – as well as open up the future pardon lane – but failed (he is appealing that ruling).
Meanwhile, Trump is seeking to have the sweeping criminal conspiracy case against him in Georgia thrown out by arguing he is protected from prosecution under presidential immunity.
But the former president can now kick his attacks against Willis into overdrive, saying truthfully that she is facing allegations of adultery and corruption.
Willis and Nathan Wade have not directly addressed the accusations, but Willis told a church congregation on January 14 that her adversaries were targeting her and Wade because of race, asking, “Isn’t it them playing the race card?”
She also defended Wade’s credentials, saying, “The Black man I chose has been a judge more than 10 years, run a private practice more than 20, represented businesses in civil litigation, I ain’t done y’all … served as a prosecutor, a criminal defense lawyer, special assistant attorney general.”
The district attorney has until next week to respond to the allegations, McAfee ruled.
In the meantime, Willis is also fighting a subpoena to testify in the Wade divorce case.
Willis has suggested in court filings that Joycelyn Wade is using the divorce proceedings to harass the district attorney and damage her reputation and is “obstructing and interfering with an ongoing criminal prosecution.”

Wolf, CNN","2 minute read Published 7:27 AM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/23/politics/haley-trump-new-hampshire-events-comparison-dg/,"Rather than sprint across New Hampshire, former President Donald Trump has split his time between the campaign trail and the courtroom in the week since he romped in the Iowa Republican caucuses.
He made the decision to attend multiple sessions of his civil defamation trial in New York, capitalizing on media exposure from that case even though it hinges on the fact that he has already been found liable for sexually abusing the former advice columnist E. Jean Carroll in a department store in the 1990s.
Trump’s lawyers say he plans to testify in the case, although they asked that it be delayed until after the New Hampshire primary. The illness of a juror means there will be no proceedings on January 23, the state’s primary day. The court appearances did not keep Trump away from New Hampshire; he still conducted rallies on most days, although he spent last Thursday out of court and off the campaign trail.
Trump’s chief rival, on the other hand, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who also served as US ambassador to the United Nations in Trump’s Cabinet, has conducted multiple New Hampshire campaign events each day, barnstorming the state with her chief backer, Gov. Chris Sununu. In the week since she placed third in the Iowa caucuses, Haley increased the intensity of her blitz over the weekend, according to CNN’s analysis.
Number of rallies may not be equal to number of voters reached. Haley held an event in a high school in Exeter Sunday night, for instance, while Trump addressed supporters at an opera house in Rochester."

The front page of the weekly Ouray County Plaindealer on Thursday featured a story alleging a relative of the police chief was one of three individuals arrested in connection with a sexual assault last May that reportedly occurred in Wood’s home.
On Thursday morning, more than 200 copies of that paper were missing from vending racks around the town, according to the Plaindealer.
“I have no idea whether he intended to frame me or my department,” Wood told CNN regarding the theft suspect. “But the obvious result was the appearance of a police cover up. And an utterly incompetent one at that. The story had already appeared online, what could possibly be gained from stealing hard copies?”
The Plaindealer reported the suspect was cited on suspicion of petty theft by the Ouray County Sheriff’s Office. CNN has reached out to the suspect for comment.
The sheriff’s office said it was not associated with the defendants in the case.
Wood said he was made aware of the allegations of an attack at his home “approximately two months after the incident was alleged to have occurred.”
Wood declined to comment further on the allegations. “I anticipate being called as a witness at trial so I feel it is not appropriate to comment on the plausibility of the young lady’s allegations at this time,” he said.
CNN has reached out for a copy of the arrest affidavit. The Colorado Bureau of Investigation continues to investigate the sexual assault case.
Ouray County is in southwest Colorado, about 160 miles south of Aspen."
8NGM2FU3CO_WDKOHQ22GJIJEQC,A dayslong siege of rain is fueling a serious flash-flood threat in the South,"By Elizabeth Wolfe, Robert Shackelford and Mary Gilbert, CNN","5 minute read Updated 7:35 PM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/23/weather/rain-ice-storm-flooding-forecast-tuesday/,"A multi-day siege of heavy rain and thunderstorms is raising the risk of flash flooding across the South, while freezing rain creates potentially perilous travel conditions for parts of the central US on Tuesday. Here are the latest updates:
• Heavy rain brings flash flooding to South: More than 30 million people are under flood watches that stretch from eastern Texas to the Tennessee Valley. More than 5 inches of rainfall could inundate drought-stricken areas this week, overwhelming dry soil and triggering additional flooding. Heavy rainfall Monday unloaded flash flooding in Texas, including San Antonio.
• Wintry mix poses travel threat: Freezing rain and scattered snowfall could lead to ice-glazed roadways and some power outages through Tuesday night from parts of the Midwest to the interior Northeast. Air travel may be hampered by icy weather after similar conditions on Monday led to spikes in delays and cancellations at airports including Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport and St. Louis Lambert International Airport.
• Hundreds rescued in California flooding: Winter storms continue to pummel the West. Cleanup and recovery is underway Tuesday in San Diego, where the mayor has declared a state of emergency after heavy rain sent several feet of fast-moving water rushing through some streets and prompted hundreds of rescues on Monday, officials said. Damage assessments are underway in the region and temporary shelters have been established for the displaced and homeless. Gov. Gavin Newsom on Tuesday declared a state of emergency in San Diego and Ventura counties to support recovery from recent storms.
Daily waves of warm, moist air will fuel rounds of drenching storms for the South through midweek before wet and dreary conditions expand to a wider area of the eastern US by Friday and Saturday.
Moisture surging north from the Gulf of Mexico is increasing the flood threat across the South.
The heaviest rainfall and the greatest risk for flash flooding will be Tuesday and Wednesday over some of the most parched areas of the region, including Louisiana and Mississippi. Level 3 out of 4 risks of excessive rainfall are in place for both days.
Widespread rainfall totals of 4 to 6 inches are likely. Higher totals will focus on areas closer to the Gulf of Mexico where multiple rounds of heavy rain and a few thunderstorms unfold. Parts of Louisiana and Mississippi could end the week with rainfall bordering on double digits.
Rainfall of this nature can easily lead to flash flooding, especially in drought-stricken areas, because the ground is dry and hard, allowing less water to soak into the soil.
Drought conditions cover more than 80% of Mississippi and more than 90% of Louisiana, and over 10% of both states are in exceptional drought – the most severe level of US Drought Monitor scale.
While the rain will become less intense after Wednesday, steady rounds of rain will persist for the entire week across parts of the South.
By Friday and Saturday, rain and will expand tremendously in scope, bringing dreary, wet weather across much of the East.
Around 1 to 2 inches of rain is possible during this time from the central Appalachians through New England.
About 13 million people are under winter weather alerts across the Great Lakes and Northeast on Tuesday as a storm that wreaked icy chaos begins to wind down.
After slick roadways led to reports of cars losing control or spinning out on Monday, accumulating ice remains a threat Tuesday. Even small coatings of ice are enough to cause issues on untreated, paved surfaces like roads and sidewalks. Larger build-ups can also cause tree damage and cause power outages.
Several regional National Weather Service offices urged people to avoid driving in hazardous conditions or exercise extreme caution if travel is essential.
The weather service in Indianapolis, Indiana, cautioned that though air temperatures will be slightly above freezing, ice can still coat roads and sidewalks. “If traveling, drive slow and safe!” the agency said.
Winter weather alerts last into Wednesday for parts of New York and New England.
Monday’s rainfall and flooding in San Diego were “unprecedented,” Mayor Todd Gloria said Tuesday. He said he toured the communities in the southeast areas of the city most impacted by rain and flooding.
Monday was ranked as the fourth-wettest day on record in San Diego, with 2.73 inches of rain, according to the National Weather Service.
“The damage and the impact were absolutely devastating, in fact, it was heartbreaking,” Gloria said at a news conference.
“I saw homes that were destroyed by floodwaters, floodwaters that reached the ceilings in some cases. I saw cars that had been picked up and moved down the street, floated away from where they had been parked, got swamped with water and with mud.
“I saw entire lives changed in just a few minutes, and I want to let folks know my heart is with them, and I ask San Diegans to hold every one of your neighbors in your hearts who are having to deal with yesterday’s events.”
Gloria said those residents most affected by the storm will be in recovery mode for weeks, if not months.
He encouraged residents to assess damages, file claims with their insurance and report issues to the county.
Initial assessments indicated Monday’s rainstorm caused $6 million to $7 million in damage to the city’s infrastructure, said Chris Heiser, director of San Diego’s Office of Emergency Services.

8PXYM0O598_2Z43UON7IOFHN0H,Trump makes history again as he powers toward Republican nomination,"Analysis by Stephen Collinson, CNN","7 minute read Published 1:40 AM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/24/politics/trump-new-hampshire-gop-nomination/,"Nothing seems to be stopping Donald Trump as he surges toward his third consecutive Republican nomination.
The ex-president on Tuesday became the first modern-era non-incumbent Republican to win the first two presidential nominating contests, adding the New Hampshire primary to his Iowa caucuses landslide from last week, and reached the brink of a rematch with President Joe Biden.
Trump has all but cleared the GOP field at an astonishing clip. Despite a crush of criminal liability and the memory of his assault on democracy on January 6, 2021, he is consolidating his party around him at a rate unprecedented in modern primary elections.

And yet, Trump spent Tuesday night seething, sources told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, because his sole remaining GOP rival, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, isn’t dropping out. Despite failing to land a win against the ex-president in the state perhaps most suited to her candidacy, she insisted she would go on, resisting heavy pressure from Trump’s camp to bow out and promising to engage in what looks like an uphill battle in her home state – which holds the next big primary next month. Trump criticized Haley publicly and privately and urged his political aides to up their attacks on her, Collins reported.
While his reaction to his New Hampshire win was far less jubilant than his Iowa triumph, the twin victories represent a stunning act of political survival. Three years ago, Trump left Washington stung by his second impeachment after trying to overturn the result of an election that he lost. There’s also a possibility he could be a convicted felon by November’s election given that he’s facing 91 criminal charges and more trials — civil and criminal — than can be counted on one hand. His wins underscore his success in leveraging his legal problems to paint a narrative of political persecution that’s bolted his political base ever closer to his side. And exit polls on Tuesday showing that roughly 8 in 10 of Trump’s voters denied the legitimacy of Joe Biden’s election in in 2020 highlight how Trump has successfully used election denialism as an engine of his political comeback.
The former president is in a unique political position. In some senses, he’s effectively an incumbent since he never relinquished his hold on the GOP even after losing — a fate that normally sends ex-presidents into ignominious retirement. But even while in office, Trump never lost sight of his core political formula — his reputation as an insurgent outsider.
So while Haley is trying to portray him — and his stack of endorsements — as a figure of the “establishment,” it’s a tactic that works more in theory than practice. In fact, Haley, who is pushing hawkish foreign policies and deficit reduction, is trying to revive the establishment policies of the pre-Trump Republican Party. Trump, who is vowing a second term of “retribution,” is sending every signal he wants to go back to Washington to tear it all down.
There is also no sign in the first two contests that Republican voters are worried that Trump can’t beat Biden, which is the core argument of the Haley campaign and of her erstwhile rival, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who folded his White House bid after finishing second in Iowa. The former president has probably been helped in this regard by Biden’s own low approval ratings and a blizzard of conservative media coverage of the 81-year-old president’s age and perceived mental frailty, which may have convinced many voters he’ll be a pushover in November.
“We had one hell of a night tonight,” Trump said in his victory speech in Nashua at an election night party that saw his supporters in red “Make America Great Again” hats cheering as networks called his win.

But Haley’s decision not to pull out of the race irked the former president after he said at his closing rally on Tuesday night that he expected she would be knocked out.
“Ron came in second and he left. She came in third and she’s still hanging around,” Trump said of DeSantis’ and Haley’s performances in Iowa. “She had a very bad night.”
Trump was joined on stage Tuesday by his other one-time rivals for the nomination, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, whom he described as “the only person more angry than, let’s say me, but I don’t get too angry, I get even.”
The ex-president’s victory party also welcomed another guest – disgraced ex-congressman George Santos, who became one of the few people ever expelled from the House of Representatives over ethics allegations.
At her own election night event, Haley congratulated Trump on his win, but said that the race was far from over – even though it’s hard to pick a primary state where she might win if she couldn’t win New Hampshire.
“In the next two months, millions of voters in over 20 states will have their say. We should honor them and allow them to vote,” Haley told her crowd at the election watch party, as several supporters chanted, “Trump is a loser.” The former US ambassador to the UN advised her old boss to take a mental competency test and suggested he was afraid to climb on a debate stage alongside her.
Had the former president chosen to be magnanimous, he might have ended the primary race in all but name. But instead, he gave the Haley team a new seam to mine. Her campaign issued a quick response to his speech, which it termed a “furious and rambling rant” against her, asking, “If Trump is in such good shape, why is he so angry?”
His bitter demeanor may have reminded suburban and women voters whom he alienated in past elections why they soured on him. And his outbursts will have delighted Biden’s campaign, which declared Trump all but clinched the GOP nomination on Tuesday night and fired up their general election attack machine against him. In another sign of urgency, two of his top White House aides are moving to Wilmington, Delaware, soon to take the reins of his reelection.
Unfortunately for Haley, New Hampshire did not, as she told its voters it would, “correct” the result of last week’s Iowa caucuses, where she came a distant third to Trump. Whether she got “smoked” in the Granite State — as her former opponent Chris Christie predicted she would on a hot mic — depends on whose spin you accept.
With 88% of the vote in from the primary, Haley trailed Trump by about 11 points. That’s short of the huge win some of the ex-president’s supporters had expected but still a handsome victory margin for Trump, even if his problems with suburban voters were reflected in his rival’s strong performance in large population areas in southern New Hampshire – a potential alarm bell for his prospects in a general election.
The problem for Haley is that as the race now turns toward her home state, and big southern state primaries on Super Tuesday in March, she’ll be up against Trump in his strongholds and her chances to pick off wins and convention delegates seem slim.
Still, her campaign is arguing that every time she takes on Trump she is improving. And her supporters insisted that her difficult road ahead did not mean she should be forced out of the race.
And there’s no reason why Haley shouldn’t stay in if she has the money. After all, it’s a democratic process and voters – not rival candidates – get to decide the result. Trump’s rush to declare victory in the primary race may even be a sign of political malpractice since he’s only leaving Haley and her supporters more determined not to be pushed out.
“The more she runs, the more support she’s getting,” said Lisa Kent, a Haley supporter from Connecticut who attended the election watch night party in Concord. “It’s like an avalanche.”
But unless the former South Carolina governor can pull off a miracle next month in a state where she was elected governor twice – but that is now a Trump bastion – her shaky rationale for continuing her campaign may face a terminal reality.

8Q6Z7C0BVL_5ZJOAALE0WVN3E4,US secretly warned Iran before ISIS terror attack,"By Natasha Bertrand, CNN","2 minute read Updated 10:27 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/25/politics/us-warned-iran-isis-terror-attack/,"The US secretly warned Iran that ISIS was planning a potential terror attack inside Iran’s borders before the group carried out a deadly attack near the burial site of slain military commander Qasem Soleimani on January 3, according to a US official.
The private warning was based on intelligence the US had obtained about ISIS’ plans and was given to Iran based on the US government’s “duty to warn” policy, the official said. That policy applies even to US adversaries.
The private warning, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, is notable not only because Iran is not a US partner or ally, but also because officials say Iran is behind a recent uptick in attacks by its proxy militias against US personnel in the Middle East. It is not clear through what channels the US delivered the message to Iran given that the countries have no formal diplomatic relations.
“Prior to ISIS’ terrorist attack on January 3, 2024, in Kerman, Iran, the US government provided Iran with a private warning that there was a terrorist threat within Iranian borders,” the official said. “The US government followed a longstanding ‘duty to warn’ policy that has been implemented across administrations to warn governments against potential lethal threats. We provide these warnings in part because we do not want to see innocent lives lost in terror attacks.”
The Iranian government was ultimately unable to stop the ISIS attack, which was the deadliest in Iran since its 1979 revolution. At least 84 people were killed and 284 injured in the blasts on January 3, which hit near Soleimani’s burial site in southern Iran. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack one day later.
CNN has reached out to the Iranian mission to the UN for comment.
According to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, any intelligence community entity that collects or acquires “credible and specific information indicating an impending threat of intentional killing, serious bodily injury, or kidnapping directed at a person or group of people…shall have a duty to warn the intended victim or those responsible for protecting the intended victim, as appropriate.” An intended victim includes both US persons and non-US persons, the policy says."
8VN13FW785_RHO3TBR8EBLFJGO,Senate GOP offers cautious embrace of Trump amid fears over his electability,"By Manu Raju and Melanie Zanona, CNN","6 minute read Updated 5:32 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/24/politics/senate-gop-trump-new-hampshire-reaction/,"Sen. John Cornyn has long been skeptical about Donald Trump’s 2024 chances, telling reporters last June that the former president’s “basic problem” is that he “hasn’t yet figured out how to expand his appeal beyond his base” – something he said is a recipe for a general election loss.
On Tuesday night, the Texas Republican endorsed Trump and called for GOP unity after the New Hampshire primary. But on Wednesday morning, Cornyn’s concern about Trump’s electability remained unchanged.
“After a primary there needs to be a broader appeal than just to primary voters,” Cornyn told CNN. “You can’t win with just your own base.”
As Republicans steadily fall in line behind Trump as their party’s likely standard bearer, there are deep-seated reservations about his polarizing candidacy – particularly within the Senate GOP. Many still have fresh memories of the 2021 Capitol attack and had hoped he wouldn’t return to the national scene. Others blame him for their 2022 failure to take back the majority in the midterms and had stayed quiet as the 2024 presidential primary unfolded.
Yet now Trump is on a glide path to the nomination and remains the most dominant force in GOP politics – something they’re trying to reconcile as they fear that his penchant for controversy and four criminal indictments will sink their chances at keeping the House and taking back the Senate.
“For him to win the general election, he’s got to start running a general election campaign, which will mean his message is going to have to appeal to those independent voters and moderate Republicans,” said Senate GOP Whip John Thune, the No. 2 Republican who has yet to endorse Trump but said he would back the eventual nominee.
CNN’s exit poll of New Hampshire’s GOP primary underscores much of that concern. While Trump dominated with GOP voters, winning about three-quarters of them, he struggled with independents and more moderate Granite Staters who voted in the primary – with 64% of undeclared voters backing former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, compared to just 35% for Trump. Nearly 9 in 10 Haley voters in the state said they would not be satisfied if Trump were the nominee.

Trump’s performance with that swing voting bloc was a far cry from 2016 when he first burst into presidential politics — something not lost on many in his party.
Republicans now fear that Trump would put off those types of independent voters who will be essential to winning battleground House and Senate seats – and that could cost them control of Congress.
“Yes,” one swing-district House Republican said, when asked if he believes Trump will cost their party the House.
“Twenty percent of GOP voters will not vote for him,” the Republican member said. “Independent voters think Biden is weak, but they hate Trump. And Dems — he motivates them to vote.”
The concerns come as numerous Republican holdouts have jumped on board with Trump’s candidacy following his back-to-back victories in Iowa and New Hampshire, with more expected to soon follow suit. On Tuesday night, Trump picked up endorsements from GOP Sen. Deb Fischer of Nebraska and Rep. Brandon Williams of New York, who represents a swing district carried by President Joe Biden.
Despite Trump’s lackluster showing with more moderate voters, a number of Republicans believe that will change in the general election – especially given Biden’s poor approval ratings and dissatisfaction with his presidency.
“If you look at the battleground states, people would have to be incompetent not to go after and try and go after the right of center, in our state unaffiliated voters, that’s obviously where you would go for it. And that’s exactly what Trump’s going to do,” Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, told CNN. “The races are not won by the parties. They’re won in the middle and I think both campaigns are going to target that.”
Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a staunch Trump supporter, added: “I think when you look at the structural problems of President Biden with the electorate versus that of Trump, I think Trump has a better hand. But there’s a long way to go.”
Sen. Mike Rounds, a South Dakota Republican who has yet to endorse Trump, said that “other candidates have shown in polls that they would have had a higher percentage of support than the former president.  It doesn’t mean that he can’t win in the next election.”
And Fischer, who endorsed Trump on Tuesday night, said: “I think people will pay attention to President Trump and the policies he’s going to offer, and they’re going to support him for those polices.”
Asked if he should moderate, the Nebraska Republican said: “President Trump needs to be who he is.”
Yet there are some key Republicans who are keenly aware of who Trump is. That includes Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell, whose relationship with Trump soured after he blamed the former president for being responsible for the January 6, 2021, attack.
Asked Tuesday if he will need to endorse Trump if he continues to do well in primaries, McConnell once again refused to take a stand.
“I don’t have any announcement to make on the presidential election,” McConnell said. “In fact, you all may recall, I’ve stayed essentially out of it. And when I change my mind about that, I’ll let you know.”
Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who was one of the seven Senate Republicans who voted to convict Trump in his impeachment trial on a charge of inciting the January 6 insurrection, went even further, saying she doesn’t see herself endorsing Trump – even if he becomes the eventual Republican nominee.
“I do not at this point, no,” Collins said Wednesday when asked if she’d eventually offer her endorsement.
Collins also said she supports Haley staying in the race, a position that puts her at odds with Trump allies.
“I’m glad to hear last night that Nikki Haley is determined to stay in. And I think the more people see her for her, particularly since she appears to be the only alternative to Donald Trump right now, the more impressed that they will be,” Collins said.
Yet Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio, a top Trump ally, said that Haley’s continued candidacy will only hurt Trump’s chances – and the party at large.
“What’s going to happen here is that we’re going to spend another 30, 50, maybe 100 million dollars attacking Donald Trump, who will be our nominee, weakening him in the process,” Vance told CNN. “I think it’s a huge mistake, and it will siphon money away from needed things on a failing presidential campaign.”
But even those who have been most resistant to Trump are coming to grips with the fact that the movement inside the GOP to stop the former president might be over.
“I think my wing has been wounded for a long time, and I don’t know that it’s going to be coming back anytime soon,” said retiring Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, who voted to convict Trump in both of his impeachment trials.
Many senators are still grappling with Trump’s resurgence within the party after he left Washington in disgrace in 2021. Asked to explain Trump’s comeback within the GOP, multiple Republicans pointed to the weakness of Biden and the belief among the GOP base that he is a needed force to “disrupt” Washington.
“You think the grass is greener on the other side, and all of the sudden you get over there, you realize that pasture isn’t better, you want to go back to the pasture you were in,” said Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma.
For Cornyn, he said that he “underestimated the anger voters have in both parties” towards Washington.
“And I think President Trump, in many people’s minds, is the answer to that status quo,” he said.

8VW0T5UEYC_82E99E0SUBUC59N,Pro-war Putin critic Igor Girkin sentenced to four years in Russian prison on extremism charges,"By Rob Picheta, Sebastian Shukla and Anna Chernova, CNN","4 minute read Updated 10:30 AM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/25/europe/igor-girkin-russia-trial-verdict-intl/,"Igor Girkin, a prominent Russian pro-war blogger who criticized President Vladimir Putin’s handling of the war on Ukraine, has been found guilty on extremism charges and sentenced to four years in prison by a Moscow court.
Moscow City Court convicted Girkin, also known under his pseudonym, Strelkov, of inciting extremism – a charge he denied.
A former officer of Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) and an ex-military commander, Girkin played a crucial role in Russia’s annexation of Crimea and the early stages of invading Donbas, before becoming a prominent Russian military blogger with over half a million followers on Telegram.

Girkin was also closely linked to the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 in July 2014 and was convicted in absentia of mass murder for his role in the tragedy.
As part of his Thursday sentence he was also barred from accessing the internet, a move that essentially shuts off his ability to publicly lambast Putin’s leadership.
Girkin was arrested in July and charged with calling for extremist activities after he became increasingly critical of Putin and his military’s mishaps in Ukraine.
His detention came weeks after the failed rebellion by Wagner mercenaries in Russia, a period in which Putin’s grasp on power appeared to be more fragile than ever.
A group of around 100 of his supporters gathered outside the Moscow court on Thursday to show opposition to his sentencing.
Girkin’s wife told CNN on Thursday she had been unable to see her husband for six months. “Today I am very worried now. To be honest, I have a storm of negative emotions,” she said.
“It seems to me that now this is a demonstrative flogging for everyone and thus all the heroes of Russian,” she said. “They are simply not wanted now and are being removed. We hope that we still have justice and that my husband will be released sooner or later, and I hope that this will happen after the elections, because now a purge is underway.”
Girkin is among the best-known of Russia’s “milbloggers,” a group of war correspondents who support the invasion but have grown increasingly critical of the military’s faltering operations in Ukraine, and pushed for a harsher approach.
He co-founded an ultra-nationalist political group called the Angry Patriots Club last spring, and told Reuters that Russia was “on the cusp of very grave internal political changes of a catastrophic character.”
But just days before his arrest Girkin intensified his criticisms of Putin, calling the president a “lowlife” and a “cowardly bum” in a blistering post on his Telegram channel.
“For 23 years, the country was led by a lowlife who managed to ‘blow dust in the eyes’ of a significant part of the population. Now he is the last island of legitimacy and stability of the state,” the post read. “But the country will not be able to withstand another six years of this cowardly bum in power.”
Thursday’s verdict highlights the increasing paranoia emanating from the Kremlin about how the war on Ukraine is being conducted.
Both Girkin and another famous war critic, Yevgeny Prigozhin, have now paid a heavy price for overstepping the mark in their criticism of Putin.
Girkin faces a prison sentence in a Russian penal colony with his access to the internet cut – effectively severing his sharp tongue from his 500,000 Telegram followers.
Prigozhin, who ultimately died in a plane crash, was marginalized, had business operations clipped and was publicly rebuked by Putin for stoking a rebellion just weeks before Girkin’s arrest.
Both Girkin and Prigozhin had constantly called for more military support and ammunition for units in Ukraine and personally attacked the top brass of the Russian Defense Ministry, Sergei Shoigu and Valery Gerasimov.
Girkin is a former colonel in Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) and served as defense minister in the separatist so-called Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) in eastern Ukraine, territory captured by pro-Russian forces in 2014.
It was during his time in the DPR that he contributed to the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over eastern Ukraine in 2014, a court in the Netherlands found. All 298 people onboard were killed. The court in 2022 found Girkin guilty of mass murder for his role in the incident and he was sentenced in absentia to life in prison.
According to the court, Girkin participated in the conflicts in Chechnya, Transnistria and Bosnia.

8Y1J9M9E6B_YJF0Z14XZWXZ66C,"Hungary’s Orban backs Sweden’s NATO bid, potentially removing last hurdle to accession","By Christian Edwards, Catherine Nicholls and James Frater, CNN","2 minute read Published 11:38 AM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/24/europe/hungary-supports-sweden-nato-bid-intl/,"Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban told NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg that his government supports Sweden’s membership bid, potentially removing the final hurdle to accession after months of fraught negotiations.
“I reaffirmed that the Hungarian government supports the NATO membership of Sweden,” Orban wrote Wednesday on X.
Orban said he told Stoltenberg in a phone call he would urge Hungary’s National Assembly to vote in favor of Sweden’s bid to join the bloc at the first possible opportunity. The NATO chief said he welcomed Orban’s “clear support” for Sweden’s bid.
Hungary was until this week one of two countries that objected to and obstructed Sweden’s accession to NATO. The Turkish parliament voted Tuesday to approve Sweden’s bid, allowing President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to sign the protocol into law.
Sweden and Finland applied for NATO membership in May 2022, swiftly after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine earlier that year. Finland joined NATO in April 2023 – doubling the alliance’s border with Russia – but Sweden’s bid was mired in challenges.

Erdogan objected to Sweden’s accession, accusing Swedish officials of being too lenient on militant groups, including the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK). Sweden has since tightened its anti-terror legislation and pledged closer cooperation with Turkey on security concerns.
Another obstacle was Sweden’s approval of a small Quran-burning demonstration outside a mosque in its capital, Stockholm, which coincided with the Muslim holiday of Eid-al-Adha, one of the most significant in the Islamic calendar. Turkey’s Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan condemned the decision, saying “to turn a blind eye to such heinous acts is to be complicit in them.”
Erdogan’s eventual approval was won in part by a commitment from the United States, with the Turkish president signaling that he won’t sign the protocol into law unless Washington approves the sales of F-16 fighter jets to Ankara. US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chair Ben Cardin said Tuesday that Congress is waiting for the completion of accession documents before moving forward on the matter.
Orban, considered to be the European Union leader closest to Russian President Vladimir Putin, initially indicated he was not opposed to Sweden joining the bloc, before working to stall it. Katalin Cseh, a Hungarian Member of the European Parliament, said last year that Orban’s blocking of Sweden’s bid was “quite simply, another favor to Vladimir Putin.”
But, following the Turkish parliament’s decision, Orban on Tuesday said he had invited his Swedish counterpart Ulf Kristersson to visit Hungary to negotiate the terms of Sweden’s accession.
Stoltenberg said he had a “good call” with Orban on Wednesday, adding “I look forward to the ratification as soon as parliament reconvenes.”"
90KK2HB4DZ_X1R7D6MNV065JC2,Fire kills at least 39 in southeast China in second deadly blaze involving students in a week,"By Nectar Gan, CNN","2 minute read Updated 10:16 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/24/china/china-fire-xinyu-jiangxi-intl/,"A fire broke out at a mixed-use building in southeastern China Wednesday, killing at least 39 people and injuring nine others in the second deadly blaze involving students in a week, state media reported.
The fire started in the basement of the street-front building in Xinyu city, Jiangxi province, and quickly spread to stores on the ground floor and a tutoring center and guesthouse on the second floor.
Most of the victims trapped by flames and thick billowing smoke were college students taking classes at the center and people staying at the guesthouse, Xinhua said.
A preliminary investigation found the blaze was caused during an improper renovation of a cold storage facility in the basement, state-run news agency Xinhua reported. Twelve people have been detained, the agency said.
The tragedy came days after another fire broke out in the dormitory of a boarding school in the central province of Henan late on Friday night, killing 13 children in third grade. Authorities have not disclosed the cause of that blaze.
Footage of the latest fire circulating on Chinese social media shows people jumping out of the second-floor window and landing on a mattress laid on the street with the help of police.
Others are seen climbing down a ladder around the corner of the building as thick black smoke billows out from the building and engulfs the sky above the street.
“There was too much smoke, and people (on the second floor) might not know where the fire was burning. They might have thought the staircase was in flames and didn’t dare to run there,” a man who escaped from an internet cafe on the ground floor told the state-run Beijing Daily.
Another witness told Cover News, a state-owned media outlet, that many students were at the tutoring center when the fire broke out.
“I saw most of those who made it out were students, about 19 or 20 years old. Some escaped on their own, and some were rescued by firefighters,” the witness was quoted as saying.
Chinese leader Xi Jinping issued a statement about the fire, noting it was yet another major safety tragedy to have occurred recently and calling for “deep reflections.”
Xi urged all government authorities to “learn lessons deeply,” “carefully investigate hidden risks and dangers” in production safety and “resolutely curb the frequent occurrence of various safety accidents to ensure the safety of people’s lives and property and overall social stability,” according to Xinhua.

92KT6N08V7_A2S9JN4R530ET9C,"The NSA buys Americans’ internet data, newly released documents show","By Brian Fung, CNN","4 minute read Updated 10:59 AM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/26/tech/the-nsa-buys-americans-internet-data-newly-released-documents-show/,"The National Security Agency has been buying Americans’ web browsing data from commercial data brokers without warrants, intelligence officials disclosed in documents made public by a US senator Thursday.
The purchases include information about the websites Americans visit and the apps that they use, said Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden, releasing newly unclassified letters he received from the Pentagon in recent weeks confirming the sales.
The disclosures are the latest evidence that government agencies routinely buy sensitive information about Americans from commercial marketplaces that they would otherwise be required to obtain via court order.
And it comes amid rising concerns that foreign governments are doing the same; CNN reported earlier this week that the Biden administration is preparing an executive order meant to curb foreign purchases of US citizens’ personal data.
Wyden’s disclosure was earlier reported by The New York Times.
The NSA’s purchases include “information associated with electronic devices being used outside—and, in certain cases, inside—the United States,” wrote Paul Nakasone, the NSA’s director, in a letter to Wyden dated Dec. 11.
The purchases involve what Nakasone described as netflow data, or the technical information generated by devices as they use the internet.
While the data purchased from data brokers does not involve the content of Americans’ communications, Nakasone wrote, the data is “related to wholly domestic internet communications and internet communications where one side of the communication” is located inside the United States and the other side is located abroad.
Nakasone added that the NSA does not purchase cellphone location data of Americans or location data generated by automotive infotainment systems in the United States.
In a statement to CNN, the NSA affirmed that it buys the data from private vendors.
“NSA purchases commercially available Netflow data for its cybersecurity mission, to include but not limited to inform the Agency’s collection, analysis, and dissemination of cyber threat intelligence,” an NSA official said. “At all stages, NSA takes steps to minimize the collection of U.S. person information, to include application of technical filters.”
The NSA uses the commercially purchased data to support its cybersecurity and foreign intelligence missions, according to Nakasone’s letter and the NSA official. The NSA’s mission includes defending US military networks from foreign hacking.
In response to Wyden’s further questions, a top Defense Department intelligence official, Ronald Moultrie, wrote that agencies that purchase the data are responsible for complying “with existing law, regulation and policy, including the Fourth Amendment.”
And Allison Nixon, chief research officer at cybersecurity firm Unit 221B, said there were plenty of legitimate uses for netflow data that can help protect organizations against cyberattacks and do not involve spying on people.
“Netflow is useful for tracking malware and [distributed denial of service] attacks,” Nixon told CNN. “It’s not useful for finding who’s having abortions and calling the suicide hotline.”
“Netflow is one of the reasons your antivirus can catch malware, and it’s one of the reasons your bank can detect credit card fraud before you do,” Nixon said.
Wyden, one of Congress’ most vocal privacy advocates, said he spent nearly three years pushing to be able to disclose the NSA practice and only succeeded when he placed a hold on the nomination of Nakasone’s successor for NSA director, Lt. Gen. Timothy Haugh. In a similar disclosure in 2021, Wyden revealed that the Defense Intelligence Agency had purchased commercially available smartphone location data without a warrant.
As part of Thursday’s announcement, Wyden wrote a letter to the Biden administration urging it to stop the warrantless surveillance of Americans through the purchases of internet data.
“The U.S. government should not be funding and legitimizing a shady industry whose flagrant violations of Americans’ privacy are not just unethical, but illegal,” Wyden wrote to Avril Haines, the director of national intelligence.
“Although the intelligence agencies’ warrantless purchase of Americans’ personal data is now a matter of public record, recent actions by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the primary federal privacy regulator, raise serious questions about the legality of this practice,” Wyden added.
In a report that was declassified last year, Haines’ office acknowledged the risks posed by the easy availability of Americans’ personal data and recommended that US spy agencies catalog and develop procedures for protecting data they acquire by commercial means.
Wyden’s reference to the FTC reflects recent moves by privacy regulators to crack down on data brokers, including bans on the sale of certain personal information by two companies, InMarket Media and Outlogic, formerly known as X-Mode.
The FTC launched a separate process in 2022 that could lead to new regulations targeting what agency chair Lina Khan has called a “commercial surveillance” industry that profits from lax cybersecurity practices and weak restrictions on how consumer data can be collected, shared and analyzed.
In his letter Thursday, Wyden also called for intelligence agencies to delete any commercially acquired data that does not align with the FTC’s recent crackdowns.
CNN’s Sean Lyngaas contributed to this report."

The town of Chatham announced Thursday that Gov. Maura Healey ordered the American flag and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts flag to fly at half-staff from sunrise to sunset in honor of Petty Officer Second Class Merle Chester Joseph Hillman, who was 25 at the time of the attack.
Hillman was onboard the USS California on December 7, 1941, when two torpedoes and a bomb struck the ship during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, according to the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, which is part of the US Department of Defense.

The ship slowly sank over the next three days, claiming the lives of over 100 sailors and Marines.
According to the agency, Hillman’s remains, although unidentified, were recovered after the attack, and he was given an anonymous burial at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu.
In 2018, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency exhumed 25 unknown remains associated with the ship, according to a news release.
Officials said scientists from the agency and the Armed Forces Medical Examiner System used techniques, including anthropological and mitochondrial DNA analysis, to identify Hillman’s remains.
Hillman, a pharmacist, had served in the US Navy for six years at the time of his death, according to an article included in the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency’s news release.
Hillman was identified on October 20, 2023, and will be buried on Saturday."
9BM2DC6PHJ_YCHM9YFVK9E0FEU,Gaza endgame: Inching toward a deal to end the war,"Analysis by Elliott Gotkine, CNN","5 minute read Published 1:55 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/25/middleeast/gaza-endgame-analysis-intl/,"As the Gaza war nears its fifth month, with more than 25,000 Palestinians - civilians and combatants - dead and Israel nowhere close to achieving its objective of destroying Hamas, no one seems to have come up with a concrete proposal that’s palatable to both parties to pause the conflict, let alone end it. But there are suggestions, however half-baked, from both sides, that show a willingness to talk.
Indeed, Qatar - the main go-between - says there are “serious discussions” with Israel and Hamas, and is receiving “constant replies” from both sides. They’re not “negotiations” yet, says the White House. But with indirect talks ongoing, we seem to be inching towards what Ofer Shelah, Senior Researcher with Israel’s Institute for National Security Studies (INSS), describes as a “Zopa” - a zone of possible agreement.
On Monday Axios reported Israel had proposed a two-month truce in exchange for the release of all the 100-plus hostages still held in Gaza. Later that day CNN learned that Mossad chief David Barnea had suggested allowing Hamas leaders to go into exile as part of a broader ceasefire. On Tuesday, The Wall Street Journal said Hamas was now open to releasing some of the hostages in exchange for a pause in the fighting. And Reuters reported that Israel and Hamas had agreed in principle to a one-month truce, during which abductees would be freed and Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails released.
The sticking point there appears to be that Hamas wants a “package deal” which would include a second-phase agreement to end the war. But even if Israel were to okay this, it’s unlikely to feel compelled to keep its word. “I don’t think even [Hamas leader Yahya] Sinwar is under the impression that any hostage deal would in fact end the Israel-Hamas conflict,” Shelah tells CNN. “Either they don’t want to do a deal,” he says, or it’s just posturing for domestic consumption.
So how about exile? For now, at least, that seems a non-starter. Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani reportedly told US Secretary of State Antony Blinken that it “would never work.” Hamas leaders, it’s understood, would rather go down fighting in Gaza. They know living abroad wouldn’t stop them being knocked off by the Mossad. Unlike PLO founder Yasser Arafat, who went from exile in Beirut to exile in Tunis, Gaza is home to Hamas’ senior leadership. Moreover, even Israel doesn’t seem overly keen. “The exile of Sinwar is not Israel’s position and has not been offered by Israel,” a senior Israeli government official told me.
Related article Exclusive: Israel’s spy chief proposed  Hamas leaders leave Gaza as part of broader ceasefire talks
And while emissaries are talking, and the IDF and Hamas are fighting, pressure on the Israeli government to bring the hostages home is growing. Over the weekend, protesters camped outside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s home to demand a deal to bring them home. “Right now someone is being raped in a tunnel,” former hostage Aviva Siegel told the Knesset on Tuesday. On Wednesday, they held a day of action, blocking roads. On Thursday, they blocked humanitarian aid deliveries to Gaza. It also emerged that Netanyahu had taken to blaming Qatar for slow progress in getting the hostages freed - prompting a rebuke from the emirate’s foreign ministry.
An all-for-all deal is another option that’s been mooted since October 7. In other words, freeing all Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails - including those whom Israel says have blood on their hands - in exchange for freeing all the hostages. But even if such a scenario were on the table, a survey published by the Israel Democracy Institute on Wednesday found more than half of Israelis would be against it.
For now, though, such talk remains moot, with an Israeli official telling CNN there’s no concrete deal on the table. Pummeling Hamas, says former IDF General Israel Ziv, ought to help. “There is no doubt there’s not a single Israeli who doesn’t want the hostages home,” he tells CNN. “But at the same time we can’t gamble on the future of Israel [by leaving Hamas in control of Gaza]. And to have both we need to apply the most military pressure in order to get the maximum position in negotiations.”
Ziv reckons it will take up to a month longer for the IDF to crush Hamas brigades in Khan Younis, in southern Gaza, where intense fighting has been taking place; an UNRWA shelter there was struck on Wednesday, killing at least a dozen displaced Palestinians. Any deal Israel is looking to seal, says Ziv, would be more likely to come into effect once the Khan Younis operation is complete.
Of course, the endgame in Gaza isn’t only subject to military considerations, hostage families demanding a deal, or even pressure from the United States to wind things down. There’s also politics. The latest polls spell disaster for the career of Israel’s longest-serving leader. One recent survey found more than half of all Israelis believe Netanyahu’s war policies are born of self-interest. Gadi Eisenkot, a former chief of staff who sits in the war cabinet and whose own son was recently killed in Gaza, says he doesn’t believe that’s the case, but he does say that destroying Hamas is unrealistic.
With that in mind, this round of the Israel-Hamas war probably won’t be the last. “Israel should agree to almost any kind of deal that brings the hostages home,” says the INSS’s Shelah. “Because it won’t be the end of the war anyway.”"

The panel rejected the case on procedural grounds Monday, finding that the commission didn’t have jurisdiction to address the matter. The outcome is a victory for the former president, but the panel avoided grappling with questions around his culpability for the deadly attack on the US Capitol.
Massachusetts is one of several states where Trump’s eligibility to run for president is being tested, based on the “insurrectionist ban” enshrined in the Constitution’s 14th Amendment. He has been removed from the ballot in Colorado and Maine, but those decisions are paused while the US Supreme Court considers Trump’s appeal in the Colorado case.
The Massachusetts commissioners met briefly last week in Boston and heard arguments on procedural questions.

“We believe that Mr. Trump’s candidacy for this office and placement on the Massachusetts ballot violates the Constitution, so we are challenging the constitutionality,” said Shannon Liss-Riordan, an attorney for the challengers. “It is the job of this commission to hear objections to the legality of placement of candidates on the ballot.”
Trump’s lawyers urged the panel to dismiss the objection. His legal team has previously convinced judges in Michigan, Minnesota and other key states to throw out similar challenges based on procedural grounds.
“There is nothing in the case law or the statutes that the commission is required to follow that says qualification to be on a ballot is a pre-condition to appear on the ballot,” Trump lawyer Marc Salinas said.
The Massachusetts commission is an independent and bipartisan panel, whose members are appointed by the state’s governor. The chairman is a Republican appointee, and the other two members are Democratic appointees.
Decisions made by the commission can be appealed in Massachusetts courts."
9HKD9S6LS6_SE614AEVKSSX71Q,UK pulls out of post-Brexit trade talks with Canada,"By Anna Cooban, CNN","3 minute read Published 10:15 AM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/26/business/uk-pauses-canada-trade-negotiations/,"Britain is finding out just how hard it can be to negotiate free trade deals, even with close allies and friends.
Nearly eight years after Brexit campaigners persuaded a slim majority to vote to leave the European Union, on a platform that included promises of a brighter future as a global trading nation, the UK government has walked away from talks to replace its legacy EU trade deal with Canada over disputes involving beef, cars and cheese.
The talks between the United Kingdom and Canada — which share a head of state (King Charles) and are both members of NATO and the Group of Seven forum of leading advanced economies — began in March 2022, two years after Britain officially left the EU. Goods and services have continued flowing between the two countries under the terms of the EU-Canada free trade deal.
But Britain had sought to negotiate a new trade deal with Canada that would improve upon the terms of the existing agreement. Parts of the current deal are also due to expire, or have already done so, with no new rules to replace them.
UK carmakers, which currently pay low or no import taxes when exporting to Canada, could face much higher taxes from April.
Meanwhile, rules governing the export of British cheese to Canada expired in December. Now, UK producers selling to Canada face paying tariffs of up to 245% of the value of their cheese.

A key sticking point in the negotiations has been Britain’s refusal to relax a ban on hormone-treated beef, which at the moment effectively bars Canadian farmers from selling to British consumers.
“Trade negotiations are complex, but sometimes it is right to pause if progress is not being made. We remain open to restarting talks with Canada in the future,” a UK government spokesperson said in a statement.
A spokesperson for Canadian trade minister Mary Ng said Friday: “I am confident that we can negotiate an agreement that is win win for Canada and for the UK.”
“But let me be clear: we will not negotiate an agreement that is not good for Canadians, and not good for our Canadian businesses, farmers and workers,” the spokesperson said in a statement.
According to the UK government, total trade in goods and services with Canada was worth nearly £26 billion ($33 billion) in the year to the end of June and Canada is the UK’s 13th-biggest export market.
The stalled talks represent a “blow” to the UK’s ambitions to strike better trade deals now that it is outside of the EU, according to David Henig, a director of UK trade policy at the Brussels-based European Centre for International Political Economy.
“We won’t get an improved deal, we’ll actually have worse trading conditions than we did as EU members,” he told CNN.
An unnamed Canadian government official, speaking to Reuters, suggested the UK had only itself to blame for what is the first failed attempt to replace EU trading arrangements with a third country after Brexit.
“Britain did not act as fast as it should have in negotiations, and expects Canada to just give (it) these things,” the official told Reuters.
But Minette Batters, president of the National Farmers’ Union, which represents farmers in England and Wales, took a different view. “The prime minister put it in writing last year that he would not be importing hormone-treated beef or chlorine-washed chicken,” she told the BBC Friday.
“Canada has played hardball for a long time. It was always going to come to a crunch point as to who was going to capitulate.”"

Thailand’s Constitutional Court on Wednesday dismissed a case against Pita Limjaroenrat, 43, that alleged he violated election rules by running for office while holding shares in a media company – the long-defunct broadcaster iTV.
Thai law bans members of parliament from owning or holding shares in media companies.
Eight of the nine-member panel of judges ruled in favor of Pita, saying that since iTV had not operated since 2007 — before he applied for the party-list candidacy — he had not violated the constitution.
The ruling is one of two highly-anticipated verdicts against Pita and the progressive Move Forward Party that could ultimately see Thailand’s most successful party at the last election dissolved, and bans and criminal charges levied at its leaders.
Following Wednesday’s verdict, Pita told reporters outside court that he will continue to work for the people and that he would like to get back to his duties in parliament “as soon as possible.”
“Whenever I’m allowed in, I’ll be there,” he said.
Supporters who had gathered outside the court began chanting “PM Pita,” referring to his bid to become prime minister, and said justice had been done. Some held placards reading, “We will always support the party” while others mocked the Election Commission that brought the case to court.
Supravee Sansuk, 63, from Bangkok said the outcome has restored her faith in the Thai justice system.
“I was worried about the verdict that it would turn the other way. So I was overwhelmed to receive the good news. Because Pita was not guilty since the beginning and this case shouldn’t have been forwarded to the court,” she told CNN.
Lee Saetung, 69, said he traveled three hours from his hometown of Rayong to attend the verdict.
“I am growing older, I need the country to move forward and we need young people to cultivate the future of my grandchildren. So when the verdict was released, I was very much relieved to see a future ahead for my descendants,” he said.
Besides being defunct for nearly two decades, iTV did not have a media license nor a frequency band to broadcast, and had no income, Pita said in a Facebook post last year.
Pita said he inherited shares owned by his late father but they held “no economic value” and the company was delisted from the Thai Stock Exchange in 2014. The shares were later transferred, he said.
The former prime ministerial hopeful was suspended from his duties as a lawmaker and member of Thailand’s parliament in July while the case was being investigated.
Speaking to CNN in May, Pita said “there are professional and personal attacks against me” but that he has prepared and has “a strong legal basis for anything that comes my way.”
His Move Forward party gained a huge following among young Thais during the 2023 general election for its reformist platform, which included deep structural reforms to how Thailand is run, including to the military and radical plans to amend the country’s strict lese majeste laws despite the taboo surrounding any discussion of the royal family in Thailand.
Move Forward won the most seats and the largest share of the popular vote in the May election.
The result was a decisive victory for progressive parties and delivered a crushing blow to the conservative, military-backed establishment that has ruled on and off for decades, often by turfing out popularly elected governments in coups.

The party was prevented from forming a government, however, as it failed to win support from a big enough majority of parliamentarians over its royal reform agenda and Pita resigned as leader of the party, which is now in opposition.
Move Forward and its former leader Pita remain popular, especially among younger Thais who have hit the streets in huge numbers in recent years calling for political and royal reform.
A January opinion poll by the National Institute of Development Administration showed Pita as being Thailand’s most popular politician for 39% of respondents, with Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin at 22%, Reuters reported.
But its fate hangs in the balance until the Constitutional Court delivers another ruling on January 31 over whether Pita and the party sought to overthrow the monarchy through his election campaign to amend the kingdom’s notoriously strict lese majeste law.
Munin Pongsapan, associate professor at Thammasat University’s Faculty of Law, said Wednesday was “a good day for Thailand’s justice system” and the ruling “was a good sign for the next case.”
“If the court follows this standard in deciding the next case, there will be an even higher chance for the Move Forward Party to survive as the accusations against it are really groundless,” he said.
Thailand’s turbulent political history has previously seen parties that have pushed for change run afoul of the powerful conservative establishment – a nexus of the military, monarchy and influential elites.
Lawmakers have faced bans, parties have been dissolved, and governments have been overthrown. Thailand has witnessed a dozen successful coups since 1932, including two in the past 17 years.
And the purportedly independent election commission, anti-corruption commission and the Constitutional Court are all dominated by members in favor of the establishment.

In 2008, the Constitutional Court ruled that then-prime minister Samak Sundaravej violated the constitution by taking part in a cooking show on TV while in office for which he received a nominal fee, and was ordered to resign.
Three parties linked to billionaire political scion Thaksin Shinawatra – the populist former prime minister who was ousted in a coup in 2006 – have been disbanded in the last decade.
And most recently, Move Forward’s predecessor, the Future Forward Party, won the third most seats in the 2019 election. Shortly afterward, several of the party’s leaders were banned from politics and the party was later dissolved after a court ruled it had violated electoral finance rules.
The decision to dissolve the popular party ignited youth-led protests that swept across Thailand in 2020, politicizing a whole new generation of activists and political leaders – some of whom contested last year’s election with the Move Forward Party."
9N3VZQ5U0Q_F3THLQFDKMAGRN0,Ancient DNA offers new evidence in long-standing syphilis theory,"By Katie Hunt, CNN","6 minute read Updated 5:25 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/24/world/syphilis-bacteria-origins-scn/,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.
The English, Germans and Italians called it the French disease. Polish people dubbed it the German disease, while Russians blamed it on Poles. In France, it was named the “Neapolitan disease” after the French army got infected during its invasion of Naples, Italy, in the first documented syphilis epidemic.
The origins of syphilis — a sexually transmitted infection that devastated 15th century Europe and is still prevalent today — have remained murky, difficult to study and the subject of some debate.
One long-standing theory is that the disease emerged in the Americas and migrated to Europe after the expeditions led by Christopher Columbus returned from the New World, but a new study suggests the true story is more complicated.
Genetic information about ancient pathogens can be preserved in bones, dental plaque, mummified bodies and historical medical specimens, extracted and studied — a field known as paleopathology.
Research published Wednesday in the journal Nature used paleopathology techniques on 2,000-year-old bones unearthed in Brazil in an attempt to shed more light on when and where syphilis originated. The study resulted in scientists recovering the earliest known genomic evidence of Treponema pallidum, the bacterium that causes syphilis and two other related diseases, which is reliably dated to long before the first trans-Atlantic contacts.
“This study is incredibly exciting because it is the first truly ancient treponemal DNA that has been recovered from archaeological human remains that are more than a few hundred years old,” said Brenda J. Baker, a professor of anthropology at Arizona State University, who wasn’t involved with the study.
Without treatment, syphilis can cause physical disfigurement, blindness and mental impairment. As a sexually transmitted disease, it has long carried a stigma — hence the past attempts by different populations to blame outbreaks on neighboring groups or countries.
It’s particularly complex to study both the disease and the pathogen responsible for it, said Molly Zuckerman, a professor and codirector of the Bioarchaeology Laboratories, New and Old World, at Mississippi State University, who wasn’t involved in the research.
“It was only in 2017 that researchers were able to culture T. p pallidum for the first time, even though we’ve known it’s the cause of syphilis for over one hundred years,” Zuckerman said in an email. “It’s still costly and cumbersome to study in the lab. There are many reasons that, despite our best efforts, it’s one of the least well understood common bacterial infections.”
The timing and sudden onset of the first documented syphilis epidemic in the late 15th century is what led many historians to conclude that it arrived in Europe after the Columbus expeditions. Others believe T. pallidum bacteria always had a global distribution but perhaps grew in virulence after initially manifesting as a mild disease.
“It is very clear that Europeans took a number of diseases (including smallpox) to the New World, decimating the native populations, so the hypothesis that the New World ‘gave syphilis to Europe’ was attractive to some,” noted Sheila A. Lukehart, professor emeritus in the department of medicine, infectious disease and global health at the University of Washington, who didn’t take part in the study.
Gene that protected humans 5,000 years ago may be linked to debilitating modern disease
Syphilis is closely related but distinct from two other subspecies or lineages of treponemal disease, nonsexually transmitted illnesses that have similar symptoms that are known as bejel and yaws and were also a focus of the new research.
The team behind the new study examined 99 bones from the archaeological site known as Jabuticabeira II from the Laguna region of Santa Catarina on the Brazilian coast. Some bones had marks characteristic of infection with T. pallidum — the bacteria effectively eat away at bones, leaving concave lesions.
Bone samples from four people yielded sufficient genetic data for the team to analyze, with one producing what study author Verena Schünemann, an assistant professor at the University of Zurich’s Institute of Evolutionary Medicine, described as a high-coverage genome, detailed enough for fine-grained analysis.
The analysis revealed that the pathogen responsible for the lesions was most closely related to the modern subspecies of T. pallidium that causes bejel, a disease found today in arid regions of Africa and the Middle East that has similar symptoms to syphilis.
The finding adds strength to previous suggestions that civilizations in the Americas experienced treponemal infections in pre-Columbian times, and that treponemal disease was already present in the New World at least 500 years before Columbus set sail.
Schünemann said the new findings do not mean the venereal syphilis that caused the 15th century epidemic came to Europe from the Americas at the time of Columbus. A similar study conducted previously by her team found T. pallidum bacteria in human remains in Finland, Estonia and the Netherlands from the early modern period (early 1400s onward), suggesting that some forms of treponemal disease, if not syphilis, were already in circulation on the continent at the time of Columbus’ expeditions to the New World.
What’s more, the genome recovered from the Brazilian sample provided a bacterial family tree going back thousands of years, suggesting that T. pallidum bacteria first evolved to infect humans as far back as 12,000 years ago. It was possible, Schünemann said, that the bacteria could have been brought to the Americas by its first inhabitants who crossed into the continent from Asia.
“I think that the story is way more complex than the Columbian hypothesis could have ever imagined,” she said.
Superbug crisis threatens to kill 10 million per year by 2050. Scientists may have a solution
Mathew Beale, a senior scientist in bacterial evolutionary genomics at the Wellcome Sanger Institute near Cambridge, England, agreed with Schünemann’s assessment, saying in an email that the study did not “prove or disprove the central tenet of the Columbian hypothesis itself — that Columbus’s voyage led to the importation of Treponema and led to the outbreaks of the 1500s and then to modern day syphilis.”
“This is mainly because the bacteria sequenced is not a direct ancestor of the strain that causes modern syphilis. … (I)t is a sister species. This could mean the various treponematoses were already very widely spread around the world, and could even predate the ancient migration and population of the Americas,” said Beale, who wasn’t involved in the research.
“It could alternatively mean that lots of different treponematoses were present in the New World, and one of those, only distantly related to the ancient genomes from this paper, was indeed imported by Columbus and his peers,” he added.
Further research on ancient genomes from across the world might be able to solve the mystery, illuminating which subspecies of the bacteria were present in Europe and the New World before the voyages of Columbus, according to Lukehart.
“The bigger scientific question now is not about syphilis, but is about the distribution of the three subspecies around the globe, particularly in pre-Columbian samples,” Lukehart said.
“The modern tools available for extracting DNA from ancient samples, for enriching the treponemal DNA, and obtaining deep sequencing from samples has rapidly increased our understanding of the Treponema.”"

State broadcaster CCTV reported that a further five people were injured and 12,426 evacuated from affected areas.
The quake struck Wushi county, also known as Uqturpan county, in Aksu prefecture near the Kyrgyzstan border shortly after 2 a.m. local time, state-run news agency Xinhua reported.
Strong tremors caused two houses to collapse and downed two major power lines near the epicenter, though electricity was quickly restored, according to Xinhua, and tremors were felt in Central Asian countries hundreds of miles away.
Rescue missions are taking place in cold weather with temperatures expected to reach minus 23 degrees Celsius (minus 9.4 degrees Fahrenheit) in Wushi county in the next three days, China’s Meteorological Agency said Tuesday.
The Xinjiang railway authority immediately sealed off routes in areas affected by the quake and suspended 27 trains, Xinhua reported.
Three people were hospitalized in a township 26 kilometers (16 miles) from the epicenter, state broadcaster CCTV reported. A child was rescued from the rubble of their house in that township, the broadcaster said.
Nearly 200 rescue workers have been dispatched to the quake zone, and hundreds more are being assembled, Xinhua reported.
More than 50 aftershocks above magnitude 3 were reported as of 11 a.m. Tuesday, according to the state-run China Earthquake Networks Center.
The quake’s epicenter is a remote, mountainous and sparsely populated area at an altitude above 3,000 meters (9,842 feet), CCTV said.
Five villages are located within a radius of 20 kilometers from the epicenter, which is about 50 kilometers from Wushi county’s main urban area, Xinhua reported.
Wushi county has a population of 205,000 people, according to China’s latest census in 2020.
Heavy tremors were felt in cities hundreds of miles away, including the Silk Road oasis of Kashgar and Hotan in southern Xinjiang.
Videos posted by Xinjiang residents on Chinese social media show lights swinging and crashing onto the floor, and crowds taking shelter outside in the streets, wrapped in winter jackets and blankets as overnight temperatures dropped as low as -10 degrees Celsius (14 degrees Fahrenheit).
The tremors were also felt across the border in Kyrgyzstan, according to the United States Geological Survey.
In nearby Kazakhstan, at least 44 people were injured in the country’s largest city Almaty following the quake, authorities said Tuesday. The quake was also felt as far away as Uzbekistan, Reuters reported.

Residents in the rural areas of southern and western Xinjiang are mostly Uyghurs, a predominantly Muslim ethnic minority that has been targeted by a sweeping Chinese government crackdown in recent years, from mass detention to strict restrictions on religious and cultural life.
A United Nations report said China committed “serious human rights violations” against Uyghurs that may amount to “crimes against humanity” – accusations that Beijing has vehemently denied.
In December, a powerful earthquake killed 151 people in the provinces of Gansu and Qinghai in northwest China, the deadliest quake to hit the country in nine years.

9O14CKC2GB_QJDYA80V6R1E9MB,Exclusive: Israel’s spy chief proposed Hamas leaders leave Gaza as part of broader ceasefire talks,"By Alex Marquardt, CNN","5 minute read Updated 11:04 PM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/22/politics/israel-proposal-hamas-leaders-leave-gaza/,"Israel has proposed that Hamas senior leaders could leave Gaza as part of a broader ceasefire agreement, two officials familiar with the ongoing international discussions told CNN.
The extraordinary proposal, which has not been previously reported, comes as Israel has struggled to achieve its stated goal of completely destroying Hamas. Despite its nearly four-month war in Gaza, Israel has failed to capture or kill any of Hamas’s most senior leaders in Gaza and left around 70% of Hamas’ fighting force intact, according to Israel’s own estimates.
Though it would give safe passage out of Gaza for top Hamas leaders who orchestrated the October 7 attack, draining Gaza of its leaders could weaken Hamas’ grip on the war-torn area while also allowing Israel to continue tracking down high-value targets abroad.
Senior Hamas officials are known to live in Doha, Qatar, and the Lebanese capital Beirut, among other places outside the Palestinian territories. An Israeli airstrike earlier this month killed a top Hamas commander in Beirut.
Israel’s suggestion that Hamas leaders could leave Gaza, though unlikely to be accepted by Hamas, has been discussed as part of broader ceasefire negotiations at least twice in recent weeks — once last month in Warsaw by Israel’s intelligence chief, Mossad Director David Barnea, and then again this month in Doha with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, according to one official familiar with the discussions.
It also comes amid a flurry of diplomatic activity to try to achieve an extended break in the fighting and free hostages believed to still be alive in Gaza. The White House’s top official for the Middle East, Brett McGurk, is traveling to Egypt and Qatar this week for further talks.
American and international officials familiar with the negotiations have said that Israel and Hamas’ recent engagement in talks is encouraging but that a deal doesn’t appear imminent.
Pressure is building on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to deliver some kind of resolution. The “complete victory” over Hamas that he has called for is a long way off, by his own admission. Meanwhile, anger among Israelis has grown over the inability of the government to bring home the more than 100 hostages being held in Gaza.
Israel is “not achieving their military objectives,” says Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. That, combined with the “enormous pressure” on Netanyahu and his government to bring hostages home, Miller said, has created a situation where Israel would be willing to propose having Hamas leaders leave Gaza.
“I think they’re simply bumping up against against reality,” said Miller. “And hostage families are beginning to exert tremendous influence.”
In addition, international sentiment toward Israel has soured over its continued bombardment of Gaza, which has killed more than 25,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry.
For the past two months, the Biden administration has been openly calling on Israel to transition to a lower-intensity phase of the conflict, which US officials argue has started happening, though intense operations continue in southern Gaza.
The proposal for Hamas leaders to leave Gaza was raised in Warsaw in December by Barnea, Israel’s top intelligence official when he met with US CIA Director Bill Burns and Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al Thani, who has acted as an intermediary with Hamas. The official familiar with the discussions in the meetings said it was then brought up again when Blinken was in the Qatari capital earlier this month.
In that meeting Blinken was told by al Thani that the Israeli idea “would never work,” the official said. In part because of distrust by Hamas that Israel would in fact end its operations against Hamas in Gaza even after its leadership left.
A second official, from the Middle East, was told about Israel’s proposal by the US.
The US State Department, CIA and the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office all declined to comment.
While it’s unclear whether in private discussions Israel has named which Hamas leaders they would hope to leave Gaza, there is no bigger target than Yahya Sinwar, Hamas’ top official in Gaza. Sinwar is a “dead man walking,” Netanyahu and others have said.
Sinwar spent two decades in Israeli prisons and is originally from Khan Younis in southern Gaza, where the bulk of Israel’s operations in Gaza are currently focused. Israeli and US officials have said they believe Sinwar could be hiding out in the vast, deep network of tunnels under the city, Gaza’s second biggest.
His closest confidantes and aides are Mohammed Deif, the leader of Hamas’ armed wing, along with Deif’s deputy Marwan Issa. Sinwar’s brother Mohammed is also a senior Hamas commander. None are believed to have been found or killed by Israel.
Last month Israel dropped leaflets on Gaza offering rewards of hundreds of thousands of dollars for information on the Hamas leaders, including a $400,000 reward for information on Sinwar.
“The goal is bringing down Hamas as the ruler in the Gaza Strip,” said Ofer Shelah, a senior researcher at Israel’s Institute for National Security Studies.
“There is no difference if [Sinwar] dies, or if he leaves,” Shelah said. “If he dies, then somebody could take over much in the same way. If we bring all the hostages back and Sinwar leaves, definitely that would make most people in Israel feel that we’ve won the war.”
American officials believe it is highly unlikely Sinwar and those around him would agree to leave Gaza, preferring instead to die fighting their sworn enemy.
Israel has made no secret of its intention to continue hunting Hamas leaders long after the war is over.
Netanyahu said in November he had “instructed the Mossad to act against the heads of Hamas wherever they are.” Ronen Bar, the director of Israel’s domestic security agency Shin Bet, has vowed to “eliminate Hamas” around the world, even if it takes years.
“Everywhere: in Gaza, Israel, Lebanon, Turkey, Qatar, everywhere,” Bar said in a recording aired in early December by Israel’s public broadcaster, Kan.
Sinwar could perhaps be convinced to leave, Miller argued, if Israel were to agree to an “asymmetrical” trade of many times more Palestinian prisoners held by Israel than Israeli hostages.
“I think he would only consider it in the event the Israelis also agreed to free all of the Palestinian prisoners,” Miller said.
“Whatever the Israelis agree to, Sinwar must know that they’re going to try to kill him,” he added. “Weeks, months years.”"

Chunli Zhao, the accused gunman, was indicted by a grand jury on Friday on the charges, prosecutors announced. He was also charged with the special circumstance allegation of multiple murder, according to a news release from the San Mateo County District Attorney’s Office.
Authorities have said Zhao, a Chinese citizen, shot five people at a mushroom farm in Half Moon Bay where he worked – killing four – and fatally shot three more at a farm about 2 miles away on January 23, 2023. Five of the seven killed were Chinese citizens, China’s consulate in San Francisco said.

After the killings, Zhao was charged with seven counts of murder and one count of attempted murder and pleaded not guilty in February. That case was set for a preliminary hearing in March, but this month’s grand jury indictment supersedes the initial felony complaint against Zhao and the preliminary hearing will no longer be necessary, the district attorney’s office said.
In court Tuesday, Zhao was appointed an attorney. He is expected to enter a plea at his next court date, set for February 29.
Zhao’s attorney Jonathan McDougal did not comment on the indictment following the hearing, saying only, “We look forward to coming back in February.”
Tuesday’s hearing came exactly one year from the date of the shooting. District Attorney Stephen Wagstaffe called the timing a symbolic coincidence.
“It’s a coincidence that I think serves a good purpose of reminding everybody the horror of what occurred,” Wagstaffe said.
The mass shooting became the deadliest attack in the county’s history, the district attorney said last year.
Zhao was a coworker or former coworker of the victims at each shooting site, and evidence indicated the attack was an instance of workplace violence in which specific people were targeted, San Mateo County Sheriff Christina Corpus said at the time.
Zhao admitted to the killings and said he wasn’t in his right mind and didn’t know “what was happening mentally” when the shootings occurred, according to NBC Bay Area News. He also expressed remorse and said he regrets the attacks, according to the outlet.
Zhao had legal possession of a semi-automatic weapon that was registered to him, Corpus told CNN."
9SM47NDSMQ_7M7M13B43YILFY2,Why are measles cases popping up across the United States? Here’s what to know about the highly contagious virus,"By Amanda Musa and Carma Hassan, CNN","7 minute read Updated 3:13 PM EST, Mon January 29, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/23/health/measles-cases-xpn-wellness/,"Nearly two dozen cases of measles have been reported since December 1, according to an alert from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. International travel, coupled with declining global vaccination rates, is probably behind this spate of cases, experts say.
The Philadelphia Department of Public Health has confirmed at least nine cases of measles over the past month after a person contracted the highly contagious virus outside the United States and exposed a parent and child at a children’s hospital, according to health department spokesperson James Garrow. That exposure then led to a Philadelphia day care outbreak that includes at least five children.

Health officials in Virginia are also warning people who recently traveled out of two D.C.-area airports – Dulles International Airport on January 3 and Reagan Washington National Airport on January 4 – of potential exposure to the virus after someone returning to the US from abroad traveled through Northern Virginia.
Additionally, a single case of measles has been confirmed in “an unvaccinated resident of the metro Atlanta area,” the Georgia Department of Public Health announced this month.
“The individual was exposed to measles while traveling out of the country,” a news release said. “DPH is working to identify anyone who may have had contact with the individual while they were infectious.”
It’s not only the United States. In the UK, a measles outbreak continues to widen: As of January 18, there have been 216 confirmed cases and 103 probable cases reported since October. The UK Health Security Agency has declared a national incident to signal the growing public health risk.
“It’s always concerning when we have a case of measles because of the probability that it’s going to spread to other individuals,” said Dr. Thomas Murray, a professor of pediatrics at the Yale School of Medicine who focuses on infectious diseases and global health.
“About 90% of susceptible people who are exposed will come down with signs and symptoms of the disease, so it’s very contagious.”
Measles was eliminated in the United States in 2000, after zero virus spread for more than a year, largely due to a “highly effective vaccination campaign,” according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

However, clusters in the US are still possible because the virus is not eliminated worldwide. There are several countries with active outbreaks.
“Many of the diseases for which we have vaccines have virtually disappeared from the United States but certainly not in other places around the world,” Murray said.
If an unvaccinated person goes to a country where a disease is still common, becomes infected and brings it back to the US, Murray notes, they can spread the virus to other unvaccinated people.
“There’s a lot of travel back and forth,” he said. “If there are pockets of unvaccinated individuals that are congregating closely together and that disease gets introduced into that population, you can have large clusters of cases.”
Vaccination rates in the US also remain low, particularly among children, according to American Academy of Pediatrics spokesperson Dr. Christina Johns, a Maryland-based pediatric emergency physician at a PM Pediatric Care urgent care.
The CDC noted in its alert that the majority of the measles cases “were among children and adolescents who had not received a measles-containing vaccine (MMR or MMRV), even if age eligible.”
About 92% of US children have been vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella (called the MMR vaccine) by age 2, according to a 2023 report from the CDC – below the federal target of 95%.

The percentage of kindergartners who got their state-required vaccines for measles also remained below the federal target for the 2022-23 school year, according to CDC data. And the rate of vaccine exemptions for children has reached the highest level ever reported in the US.
Children should get two doses of the MMR vaccine, according to the CDC: the first dose at 12 to 15 months of age and the second at 4 to 6 years of age.
Before the nation’s measles vaccination program, about 3 million to 4 million people got the virus every year, and about 400 to 500 died.
The last significant measles outbreak in the US was in 2018-19 in Rockland County, New York, focused among unvaccinated children in Orthodox Jewish communities.
Although the CDC reported only 56 measles cases in 2023, Johns says that is too many when a highly effective vaccine exists.
“Most people haven’t seen a case of measles,” she stressed. “They don’t really have an appreciation for the severity of the illness.”
The measles virus can spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes, lingering in the air for up to two hours after they leave a room, according to Murray. The virus can also live on surfaces such as doorknobs for about the same amount of time.

When symptoms begin, they’re similar to those of many respiratory illnesses – high fever, cough, red eyes, runny nose and congestion – followed by a “fairly characteristic” rash, Murray said.
“You get flat red lesions, flat red spots that typically start on your face and move down across the body across the chest and trunk and extremities,” he said. “It can be a total body rash, and it’s pretty severe.”
The incubation period for measles is very long, Murray adds. It takes about 10 to 12 days for initial symptoms to appear after exposure.
Because of this, most infected people assume their respiratory symptoms are nothing but a cold until the rash appears three to five days after the initial illness begins, according to Murray. Even then, most people – including some doctors – will not recognize a measles rash.
“Infected people are contagious from 4 days before the rash starts through 4 days afterwards,” the CDC says.
“The younger the health care provider, the less likely they are to have seen a case,” Murray said. “But certainly, when it’s circulating, we do everything we can to get the word out on what to look for.”
The CDC advises health-care workers to isolate patients who may have measles in specific isolation rooms or private rooms instead of having them waiting in common areas; to test patients with suspected cases; and promptly alert state and local health departments.
Lower MMR vaccination rates can put unvaccinated and undervaccinated individuals at risk, Johns says, especially children and those with immune system problems.
Measles can lead to serious complications, especially in children under 2, such as blindness, encephalitis or inflammation of the brain, and severe pneumonia, according to Murray.
“Measles is also a virus that knocks down parts of the immune system,” he said. “There’s recent evidence that having measles increases your susceptibility to other infections.”
A rare complication called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis can also happen seven to 10 years after infection and may result in seizures as well as behavioral and mental deterioration.
Additionally, someone who doesn’t get the MMR vaccine is at risk of contracting mumps and rubella, which are rare but still in circulation in the US due to international travel.
In 2023, 436 mumps cases were reported by 42 jurisdictions, according to CDC data. Rubella is less common, with fewer than 10 people in the US getting the virus each year.
If you’re fully vaccinated against measles, your chance of infection after exposure is very low because the two childhood doses typically confer lifelong immunity, experts say.

“It’s not impossible, but it’s very, very low,” Murray notes.
But for people who aren’t unvaccinated or who have weak immune systems, the risk increases – “especially if they know they’re in an area where measles has been circulating,” he said. “In that case, what you would do is, you would call your health care provider and work with [them] to determine next steps.”
If you think you might have been exposed to measles, stay home until a plan is in place, Murray advises.
“Call ahead before you go to any health care facility, because that health care facility can anticipate your arrival and make sure you are placed in the appropriate isolation rooms,” Murray said. “The last thing we want to do is have someone with measles sitting in the emergency room waiting room.”
Unvaccinated people who know when they were exposed can get the MMR vaccine within 72 hours of exposure to prevent the disease altogether or lessen the severity of the illness, Murray adds.
As for treatment, the virus simply has to run its course, he says. There is no specific antiviral treatment, and medical care is mainly supportive: staying home from school or work to rest and drink plenty of fluids.
If a person infected with measles is showing symptoms of encephalitis, such as a headache, high fever or seizures, they should be taken to a hospital immediately.
“Typically, hospitalization for measles occurs when children are in respiratory distress from lung involvement like pneumonia or are dehydrated and need IV fluids,” Johns said.
Severe measles cases among children can also be treated with vitamin A, according to the CDC, to support the immune system.
“Vitamin A should be administered immediately on diagnosis and repeated the next day,” the agency said.

Accidents that involved unmanned spacecraft are not included.
October 24, 1960 - The first space-related fatalities occur when a rocket explodes at the Soviet Union’s Baikonur Space Center in Kazakhstan, killing 165 people, including Air Marshal Mitrofan I. Nedelin, the head of Soviet rocket forces. The accident is officially denied until 1990.
March 23, 1961 - Russian cosmonaut Valentin Bondarenko is killed during a routine training exercise. Bondarenko is in a pressure chamber for an eight-day routine isolation test when he discards a cotton ball used to swab a sensor on his body. The cotton ball hits a hot plate used for cooking and catches fire in the oxygen-rich atmosphere. The fire isn’t revealed to the public until 25 years later.
July 21, 1961 - USAF Captain Virgil I. “Gus” Grissom’s Mercury capsule sinks in an ocean landing after an explosion blows the escape hatch off prematurely. He swims from the capsule safely.
January 27, 1967 - Three US astronauts are killed by a fire during a rehearsal launch for the US’s Apollo 1 – USAF Lt. Col. Gus Grissom, USAF Lt. Col. Edward Higgins White and USAF Lt. Commander Roger B. Chaffee. The fire causes a 20-month delay in the first manned Apollo flight. It is believed to have been triggered by a spark from faulty electrical wiring.
April 1967 - Soviet cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov is killed while returning to the ground from a successful Soyuz 1 orbit of Earth when the main parachute fails to open.
February 1969 - The Soviet Union’s N1 Moon booster explodes during its first test flight, killing 91 people on the ground. The accident is not made public until 1995.
April 13, 1970 - The US lunar mission Apollo 13 loses the use of an oxygen tank necessary to supply air and power. The three-man crew successfully uses the lunar module as a lifeboat, circling the Moon and then returning safely to Earth. It is the first in-flight failure in the US space program.
June 1971 - Soviet cosmonauts Georgi Dobrovolsky, Victor Patsayev and Vladislav Volkov are found dead in their Soyuz 11 spacecraft after an apparently normal landing. It is later determined that a depressurization caused the cosmonauts to suffocate.
March 1980 - Fifty-one engineers are killed when a Vostok rocket explodes on the launch pad in the Soviet Union.
March 1981 - Two workers are killed in a nitrogen-filled compartment of the Space Shuttle Columbia during a launch rehearsal.
April 1981 - The Columbia’s first test launch, in April 1981, is halted in the final seconds of countdown and is delayed for two days because of a software problem. Once it lifts off, everything works but the toilet, which becomes a chronic problem.
September 27, 1983 - A Soviet Soyuz T-10 booster rocket explodes shortly after liftoff. The crew members evacuate using an emergency rocket that parachutes back to Earth.
January 28, 1986 - Seven crew members aboard the Space Shuttle Challenger are killed when the spacecraft explodes shortly after take-off. Christa McAuliffe, Gregory Jarvis, Ronald McNair, Ellison Onizuka, Judith Resnik, Dick Scobee and Michael Smith are killed in the explosion, caused by the failure of O-rings in the shuttle’s right solid rocket booster.
January 26, 1995 - A Chinese Long March rocket explodes above its launching pad, killing six people and injuring 23 others. The accident is later determined to have been caused by wind shear.
April 8, 1997 - The Space Shuttle Columbia cuts short its mission 12 days ahead of schedule due to equipment problems. One of the shuttle’s fuel cells showed signs of malfunctioning.
June 25, 1997 - During a docking exercise, an unmanned cargo vessel crashes into Mir, disrupting the station’s power supply and partially depressurizing the living quarters. The three crew members, two Russians and an American, are not injured.
February 1, 2003 - The Space Shuttle Columbia breaks up about 38 miles over East Texas on its return to Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Seven astronauts are killed. The Columbia Accident Investigation Board determines that the cause of the accident was a piece of insulating foam that broke off and struck a hole in the leading edge of the left wing less than two minutes into the flight.
July 25, 2007 - Three employees of Scaled Composites, LLC, are killed in an explosion during a routine test for Virgin Galactic’s SpaceShipTwo, a commercial spacecraft. Virgin Galactic is the space tourism start-up founded by Richard Branson.
July 16, 2013 - During a spacewalk outside the International Space Station, Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano reports a carbon dioxide censor failure in his suit. Between 1 and 1.5 liters of water pool inside the suit and helmet, particularly near his eyes and ears. He is able to make it back to the airlock and is unharmed.
October 31, 2014 - Virgin Galactic’s SpaceShipTwo crashes during a flight test in the Mojave Desert, killing co-pilot Michael Tyner Alsbury and injuring co-pilot Peter Siebold, employees of Scaled Composites, LLC.
October 11, 2018 - A Soyuz rocket carrying NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Alexey Ovchinin to the International Space Station experiences an emergency landing following a booster failure. Investigations later reveal that damage to a sensor during the rocket’s assembly led to the malfunction that forced the spacecraft to make a ballistic landing."
A164P0T6WY_BHQRXBZ3PFTA7RO,The US and Iran are dangerously close to confrontation in the Middle East. Here’s where they both operate,"By Nadeen Ebrahim and Abbas Al Lawati, CNN","9 minute read Updated 7:16 AM EST, Mon January 29, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/24/middleeast/us-iran-middle-east-war-mime-intl/,"Editor’s Note: A version of this story appears in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here.
The war between Israel and Hamas has already spilled over to the wider Middle East, with prospects of a confrontation between regional and world powers becoming ever more likely.
Over the weekend, three US service members were killed and more than 30 were injured in a drone attack on a small US outpost in Jordan, according to US officials. It was the first time US troops were killed by enemy fire in the Middle East since the beginning of the Gaza war. US President Joe Biden cast the blame on Iran-backed groups, promising retribution. An umbrella group of Iranian-backed militias in Iraq said it had attacked US positions along the Jordan-Syria border, but Iran denied any direct involvement in the strikes.
Across the region, the fighting has largely been confined to tit-for-tat attacks between Iran-backed militias on one side and the US, Israel and its allies on the other. But the direct intervention of both Iran and the US in recent weeks, as well as the death of US troops, has heightened fears that the proxy conflict between the two could turn into a direct one.
US officials have repeatedly said they do not want to see the increasingly high tensions across the Middle East broaden into a regional war. So far, the US and Iran have avoided directly confronting each other. The US has attacked Iranian-backed groups in Yemen, Syria and Iraq, while Iran-linked groups have targeted American personnel in Iraq and Syria. Tehran has also struck what it said were anti-Iran groups in Iraq, Syria and Pakistan. Pakistan responded with retaliatory strikes.

The Islamic Republic, which has long opposed the presence of US forces in what it considers to be its backyard, has spent the past few decades building a network of Islamist, anti-Western and anti-Israel militias that it trains, funds and arms. Those groups have become more belligerent of late, especially Yemen’s Houthi rebels, who have disrupted a vital international waterway, wreaking havoc on global trade and prompting Western states to intervene. And it has built ties with and helped fund Hamas, which launched its war on Israel on October 7.
The US, having been trying to pivot away from the Middle East for years, finds itself drawn back into the region. It already had a sizeable military footprint in the region before the war, with over 30,000 troops.
Since the war began, however, Washington has significantly strengthened its military posture in the region, having moved roughly 1,200 US service members, alongside thousands of others aboard Navy carrier strike groups and a Marine Expeditionary Unit roughly 2,000 people strong.
And in some places, including Iraq and Syria, the US military presence overlaps that of Iran and its allies.
As tensions across the region rise, here is where Iran or its allies are present, where US forces are stationed and where both sides have conducted military operations since the start of the Israel-Hamas war:
Tehran wields significant influence on several Shiite militias closely tied to the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). These include Kataib Hezbollah, Harakat al-Nujaba, and Kata’ib Sayyid al-Shuhada.
Since the Israel-Hamas war started, a new group emerged calling itself the Islamic Resistance in Iraq (IRI). That was the group that took responsibility for the attack on Tower 22 in Jordan. According to the Washington Institute for Near East Policy (WINEP), a think tank, the IRI is an umbrella term used to describe the operations of all Iran-backed militias in Iraq. Its objective is to allow various Iraqi militias to attack US troops in Iraq and Syria under one umbrella term while obscuring the actual perpetrator, according to WINEP.
Experts say that some of the groups, like Kataib Hezbollah, are more answerable to the authorities in Tehran than to the government in Baghdad. The US Office of the Director of National Intelligence believes it has up to 10,000 members. Iraq is also home to the IRGC-founded Badr Organization as well as Asaib Ahl Al-Haq.
Iran-backed groups have carried out dozens of attacks against US forces in Iraq since the Gaza war started, to which the US has retaliated with airstrikes. Over the weekend, US personnel were injured in a ballistic missile attack on Al-Asad Air Base in Iraq. It appeared to be the second time ballistic missiles were used to target US and coalition forces in the country since October 7.
Until 2008, at the height of the Iraq war, the US had up to 160,000 troops in the country. Today, some 2,500 forces are deployed at several bases, including Erbil AB, Al-Asad AB, and the JOC-I (Union III) base in Baghdad.
Wary of his country becoming a staging ground for a regional war, Iraq’s prime minister this month said that Baghdad is seeking an exit of the US-led coalition. The US has stressed that its military is present in the country at the invitation of the government.
Iran has a direct presence in Syria, where its Quds Force, an elite unit of the IRGC that handles overseas operations, deployed after the 2011 uprising to back the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Its personnel served as military advisers and fought on the frontlines for Assad, alongside Iranian-backed militias.
Syria also hosts the Zainabiyoun and Fatemiyoun Brigades, Shiite militias linked to the IRGC who are believed to recruit Afghan and Pakistani fighters.
The US has 800 forces in Syria as part of an ongoing mission to defeat ISIS. Most US forces are stationed in what military officials call “the Eastern Syria Security Area,” where the US supports the anti-regime Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in the country’s northeast. There is also some US troop presence in Syria’s southeast, where the US supports the Syrian Free Army, which also opposes the Syrian regime. The regime considers the US to be an invader.
US troops in Syria have increasingly come under attack by Iran-backed groups in recent weeks, to which the US has responded with airstrikes.
The American troops were killed at Tower 22, a US base in northeastern Jordan near the border with Syria. US forces at the outpost are there as part of an advise-and-assist mission with Jordan. US officials said the drone was fired by Iran-backed militants and appeared to come from Syria.
The Islamic Resistance in Iraq said in a statement on Telegram that it had attacked four bases along the Jordanian border, including three in Syria.
Jordan hosts around 3,000 US troops. A longtime US ally and a major recipient of US military aid, Jordan’s airbases such as the Muwaffaq Salti Air Base in Azraq, have been key to US intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance missions in Syria and Iraq, where Washington has been fighting ISIS.
Lebanon is home to the most powerful paramilitary force in the Middle East: Iran-backed Hezbollah, one of the Islamic Republic’s most effective regional proxies.
The group has its main base on the Israel-Lebanon border and has been exchanging fire with Israel since the Gaza war began. The movement is close to Hamas in Gaza.
While the exact size of the Shiite Islamist group’s arsenal is unknown, experts have estimated it has between 150,000 and 200,000 missiles, as well as rockets and mortars. Hundreds of those missiles “are of high precision and highly destructive,” according to the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv.
Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah claims the group has 100,000 fighters, including active soldiers and reservists. Iran is believed to be Hezbollah’s main arms supplier.
At the heart of today’s proxy conflict between Iran and the US are Yemen’s Houthi rebels, who have been stepping up their strikes on ships in the Red Sea, saying they are revenge against Israel for its war in Gaza.
The group is currently in control of northern Yemen, and was engaged in nearly eight years of fighting with a US-backed and Saudi-led coalition before a halt in fighting last year.
Home-grown Houthi weapons were largely assembled with Iranian components smuggled into Yemen in pieces. But the group later made progressive modifications that have added up to big overall improvements, an official familiar with US intelligence told CNN previously.
The US military stations warships in the Red Sea, off Yemen’s coast, from which it has been striking Houthi targets. In December, the US assembled a coalition of more than 20 countries to safeguard commercial traffic against Houthi attacks in the Red Sea.
The besieged Gaza Strip is home to the Hamas militant group, which Israel believes to have had around 30,000 fighters before the war. An Islamist organization with a military wing, Hamas was established in 1987, and on October 7 launched an attack on Israel that killed around 1,200 people and took 253 others hostage, according to Israeli authorities.
Iran has built closer ties with the group in recent years; unlike all of Tehran’s other allies in the region, Hamas is a Sunni Muslim organization, rather than a Shiite one.
There is no evidence that Iran knew in advance about the October 7 attacks and Iran is not believed to have as much influence on Hamas as its other allies in the region. But the US believes that Iran has historically provided up to $100 million annually in combined support to Palestinian militant groups, including Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), another Gaza-based militant group.
On the other side of the border, Israel is the largest recipient of US military aid, with Washington having contributed  more than $130 billion in assistance since the Jewish state’s founding in 1948.
While the Israel-Hamas war has not yet spilled into the Gulf Arab states, some of those nations feel vulnerable as they have been targeted by Iran-linked groups before. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were attacked by the Houthis in 2019 and 2022, respectively.
The US-allied Gulf states are also home to some of the biggest deployments of US troops in the world.
The US has around 13,500 US forces in Kuwait, the largest American military presence in the region. Only Germany, Japan, and South Korea host more US forces than Kuwait.
The US’ second-largest military presence in the region is in Qatar, which hosts around 10,000 US forces at Al-Udeid Air Base, the largest US military base in the Middle East that is also home to the US Central Command’s Forward Headquarters and the Combined Air Operations Centre. The US this month quietly reached an agreement that extends its military presence for another 10 years at the base.
Qatar maintains relations with Hamas, having hosted its political office in the capital Doha since 2012.
More than 2,700 US forces are stationed at the Prince Sultan Air Base in Saudi Arabia, while the UAE hosts 3,500 US military personnel at Al Dhafra Air Base, which is home to the Gulf Air Warfare Center.
Other hubs for US military presence include Bahrain, which hosts the US Naval Forces Central Command and is home to the Navy’s Fifth Fleet. Turkey hosts 1,465 military members at Incirlik airbase."
A1OQ1H7JJH_N99NA2SYIPZDFCN,These Trump supporters show why the former president is dominating the race,"By Arit John, CNN","5 minute read Published 7:00 AM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/24/politics/new-hampshire-trump-voter-voices/,"Bonnie Cote never considered voting for anyone other than former President Donald Trump.
As she stood outside her hometown’s opera house, where Trump held one of his final Granite State campaign rallies earlier this week, the 33-year-old said she was “relieved” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis dropped out and that she didn’t know former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley existed until that evening. Though Trump wasn’t necessarily “presidential material,” she said he was braver than anyone else running and felt he was robbed of a second term in 2020.
“I voted for Trump the last time and I’ll keep voting for him, unless there’s somebody that is right there and has the same morals and values of Trump, trying to make America great again,” she said.
With the help of voters like Cote, Trump won the New Hampshire primary Tuesday, reinforcing what months of polls, political endorsements, focus groups and the results of the Iowa caucuses have shown: Many GOP voters aren’t interested in an alternative to the former president.
His win, and the thoughts and feelings that motivated the voters that gave it to him, offer sobering lessons to his last remaining major GOP rival.
Related article Five takeaways from the New Hampshire primary
In more than a dozen interviews, Trump’s backers here described his first term in office as a time of economic prosperity and global peace, dismissed the four criminal indictments against him as attacks from Democrats and, at times, expressed the unfounded view that the 2020 presidential election was stolen due to widespread voter fraud. Many acknowledged his behavior wasn’t what they would like, but he was a known and proven entity, unlike his rivals, they said.
Despite months of campaigning and millions spent on ads, mailers and door knocking in the Granite State, some Trump supporters said they were unfamiliar with Haley. Some were turned off by the little they had heard. And many never even considered voting for anyone else.
Adrienne Kirwin, a 74-year-old from Derry, said most of her exposure to Haley came from items stuffed into her mailbox. First, she backed South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, but then he dropped out and backed Trump. Then she liked DeSantis, until he did the same.
“I was thinking of Nikki Haley but then when everybody, like I said, started endorsing Trump,” she said outside her polling place, where she voted for the former president. “Everybody came out for Trump, Trump, Trump… so, why not go for Trump?”
Kirwin said she thought Trump was “a little crazy” and his found his personality “awful,” but she also recalled watching him in the first 2016 general election debate against Hillary Clinton.
“Everything he said, it was like he was saying it to me,” she recalled during an interview in the parking lot of her polling place Tuesday afternoon. “And I said, ‘This man loves the country.’”
Her husband, 85-year-old Raymond Kirwin, was less conflicted.
“I didn’t consider anyone else,” he said. “He did more than any president in my life, and I was gonna come back and hope he’d do the same thing again.”
Christy Piper, a 38-year-old from Dover, said that while she was open to other candidates, the former president was always her top choice. “It’s always been Trump,” she said outside the Trump rally in Rochester Sunday. “Trump’s messaging resonates the most, and I feel like he can just make the most difference out of any viable candidate running.”
Piper predicted Trump would win and said she believed he had a large pool of quiet support.
“It’s not really politically correct or safe to say that you’re a Trump supporter. So most people just keep their mouth shut,” she said. “His messaging resonates with so many people who are sick and tired of what’s going on in this country.”
Both Trump and Haley ratcheted up their attacks on each other heading out of New Hampshire. Flanked by former rivals, including Scott and biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, Trump railed against Haley for remaining in the race despite his two first place finishes.
“I don’t get too angry, I get even,” he told supporters in Nashua.
Haley highlighted his legal troubles and a recent a moment in which he confused her for former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
“With Donald Trump, you have one round of chaos after another,” she said Tuesday night during a post-primary speech in Concord. “This court case, that controversy, this tweet, that senior moment. You can’t fix Joe Biden’s chaos with Republican chaos.”
She has also tried to make the argument for electability. She has pointed to national and swing state general election polls that show her beating Biden by wider margins than Trump. On the trail and in fundraising emails, she told supporters there would be “no recounts, no lawsuits, and no doubts” about the election results if she took on Biden, and Republican ranks would swell in the House and Senate.
“We’ll rebuild our economy and secure our border,” her campaign said in a fundraising pitch the day before the election. “And make no mistake, we will restore our national pride.”
It’s an argument that has worked on some former Trump voters. Mike Condor, a 59-year-old from Derry, said he voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020. In the last election, he saw Trump as the lesser of two evils. This time, he said he would hope for a viable third party candidate if there is another Trump vs. Biden rematch, and backed Haley in the primary.
“I don’t want any chaos,” he said as he left his polling place with his wife Laura, 49, and daughter Mira, 18, both of whom also voted for Haley.
Laura, who voted for Republicans like John McCain and Mitt Romney before backing Democrats over Trump, said she hoped Haley would stay in even if she lost Tuesday’s election. Even if she trailed Trump with delegates, she thought the party needed a viable alternative to Trump.
“When we’re talking about people of this age and cognitive awareness, health things could happen,” she said. “So, I think that she makes a stronger case by having as many delegates as she can get.”
While Haley’s supporters are itching for a contest, the former president’s backers are hoping for a coronation.
Robert Stacy, a 26-year-old from Rochester said he hoped the nomination process would wrap up soon in Trump’s favor – and noted that he didn’t want the race to drag out, as it had in 2016.
“I think it would be a mistake for Nikki Haley to pull a Ted Cruz,” Stacy said."
A4VYZT8AL7_Q9QJMJDTRBM4OKK,"Suspect in killings of 8 people in Chicago area has died in Texas, police say","By Joe Sutton, Melissa Alonso and Jennifer Feldman, CNN","3 minute read Updated 4:49 PM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/22/us/joliet-chicago-house-killings-suspect-manhunt/,"A man suspected of killing eight people, most of whom were his relatives, in Chicago-area shootings died after turning a gun on himself following a confrontation with federal law enforcement, police say.
Romeo Nance, 23, was found Monday by US Marshals near Natalia, Texas – more than 1,000 miles from where seven victims were found shot to death Sunday in two homes in the south Chicago suburb of Joliet, according to the Joliet Police Department. Authorities believe Nance is also linked to a Sunday shooting in Will County, Illinois, that left a 28-year-old dead, Joliet Police Chief Bill Evans said Monday.
Nance shot himself with a handgun after being confronted by officials, police said.
Investigators have yet to determine Nance’s motive, but Nance was related to “if not all, a vast majority of the people” found dead in the homes, Evans said during a Tuesday news conference.
The victims have not been publicly identified. They range in age from 14 to 47 years old, Evans said.
In one residence, authorities found the bodies of two girls, aged 14 and 16, two women, aged 20 and 38, and a 38-year-old man, according to Evans. In the other residence, a 47-year-old woman and a 35-year-old man were found dead.
At a separate scene in Will County, deputies found a person “with blood coming out of his head, and upon deputy’s arrival, they located a gunshot wound,” Will County Sheriff’s Office Deputy Chief of Operations Dan Jungles said.
Jungles said the eighth victim, 28-year-old Toyosi Bakare, was taken to a hospital and died of his injuries. Bakare was from Nigeria and had been living in Will County, which includes Joliet, for three years, Jungles said.
“It is believed that the weapon used in this incident was a 9-millimeter handgun,” Jungles said in Tuesday’s news conference. He added robbery was not a motive as money was found in the area near where Bakare was located.
Nance’s car – a red Toyota Camry – was seen at the scene and the sheriff’s department began to surveil Nance’s last-known address, hoping to find the vehicle, Jungles said.
After no sign of Nance or his car, deputies knocked on the door of a home, but received no response, Jungle said at a news conference.
“When they received no response, they knew the house across the street was related to the individuals that resided at that house and they walked over there,” Jungle said.
At the second home, deputies saw blood on the door and entered to find two dead victims, he said. Five more victims were found in the first home, though it is unclear how long they had been dead, he said.
“I’ve been a policeman 29 years. This is probably the worst crime scene I’ve ever been associated with,” Evans said at the news conference.
Nance is also believed to be connected to another shooting on Sunday, according to authorities.

A5DJUGYGXD_ETG3OIHHOE45QFQ,US Navy shoots down Houthi missiles targeting US-flagged commercial ship,"By Natasha Bertrand, CNN","2 minute read Published 12:39 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/24/politics/us-navy-shoots-down-houthi-missiles-targeting-us-flagged-commercial-ship/,"The US Navy shot down two missiles that the Iran-backed Houthis fired on Wednesday at the US-flagged, owned and operated M/V Maersk Detroit container ship, which was operating in the Gulf of Aden at the time, according to two US defense officials and US Central Command.
The USS Gravely, which was nearby at the time, shot down two of the missiles and one landed in the water, the officials said. There were no injuries or damage to the ship, CENTCOM said in a statement.
The missile attack is the Houthis’ first successful launch since January 18, and comes just days after the US and the UK launched strikes against eight Houthi targets in Yemen. The US has also been trying to destroy Houthi missiles on the ground in Yemen as they see the Iran-backed militant group preparing to launch them and has successfully targeted several in recent weeks.
The M/V Maersk Detroit was traveling along with the Maersk Chesapeake at the time of the missile attacks on Wednesday, according to a statement from Maersk. The ships turned back from their planned voyage after seeing “explosions” on their way toward the Red Sea on Wednesday, according to the company.
The vessels are enrolled in the US Maritime Security Program and VISA (Voluntary Intermodal Sealift) and were set to transit the Bab el-Mandeb strait as part of a scheduled US Navy accompaniment.
“While en route, both ships reported seeing explosions close by and the US Navy accompaniment also intercepted multiple projectiles,” Maersk said in a statement shared with CNN. “The crew, ship, and cargo are safe and unharmed.”
Following the explosions, the US Navy turned both ships around and is escorting them back to the Gulf of Aden, according to Maersk.
Maersk Line, Limited (MLL), a US subsidiary of Maersk that operates the two vessels, is suspending its transits in the region until further notice.

A87Q26XT8W_7UI1DODG2WAK19D,Supreme Court allows Biden administration to remove razor wire on US-Mexico border in 5-4 vote,"By Devan Cole, CNN","5 minute read Updated 8:40 PM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240122,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/22/politics/supreme-court-texas-razor-wire/,"The Supreme Court is allowing US Border Patrol agents to remove razor wire deployed by Texas GOP Gov. Greg Abbott’s security initiative at the US-Mexico border while the state’s legal challenge to the practice plays out.
The vote was 5-4.
The justices’ order is a major victory for President Joe Biden in his ongoing dispute with Abbott over border policy, which had become especially fraught in recent days after three migrants drowned in a section of the Rio Grande that state officials have blocked agents’ access to, prompting the administration to further press for the high court’s intervention.
A federal appeals court last month ordered the Border Patrol agents to stop removing razor wire along a small stretch of the Rio Grande while court proceedings continue, and the Justice Department asked the justices earlier this month to step in on an emergency basis to wipe away that order, which they did on Monday.
Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh said they would have denied the federal request.
Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law, said that while the order is a victory for the Biden administration, the delay in issuing it raises future questions.
“Whatever one thinks of current immigration policy, it ought not to be that controversial that states cannot prevent the federal government from enforcing federal law – lest we set the stage for Democratic-led states to similarly attempt to frustrate the enforcement of federal policies by Republican presidents,” Vladeck said. “That four justices would still have left the lower-court injunction in place will be taken, rightly or wrongly, as a sign that some of those longstanding principles of constitutional federalism might be in a degree of flux.”
White House spokesman Angelo Fernández Hernández told CNN on Monday that the White House was pleased the Supreme Court “vacated the injunction that prevented frontline personnel from performing vital federal functions and interfered with their ability to address urgent humanitarian situations and enforce our laws.”
Andrew Mahaleris, a spokesman for Abbott, said in a statement that the “absence of razor wire and other deterrence strategies encourages migrants to make unsafe and illegal crossings between ports of entry.” He added that the governor “will continue fighting to defend Texas’ property and its constitutional authority to secure the border.”
A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that the agency welcomed the high court’s order.
“Enforcement of immigration law is a federal responsibility,” the spokesperson said. “Rather than helping to reduce irregular migration, the State of Texas has only made it harder for frontline personnel to do their jobs and to apply consequences under the law. We can enforce our laws and administer them safely, humanely, and in an orderly way.”
Lawyers for the Biden administration had argued to the Supreme Court that the appeals court ruling “turns … on its head” the Constitution’s Supremacy Clause, which states that federal laws take precedence over state laws.
“The result of Texas’s position would be that States across the country could invoke their laws to impede the federal government’s exercise of its authority,” Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar wrote in court papers.
“If that injunction is left in place,” Prelogar stressed, “it will impede Border Patrol agents from carrying out their responsibilities to enforce the immigration laws and guard against the risk of injury and death, matters for which the federal government, not Texas, is held politically accountable.”
In subsequent filings to the high court, Prelogar said that new barriers recently erected by Texas – including new fencing, gates and military Humvees – “demonstrate an escalation” of the state’s efforts to hamstring the government’s border patrol duties and “reinforce” a need for swift intervention in the matter.
She also told the court that Texas was violating a critical part of the injunction that allows federal agents to cut wire to address medical emergencies, arguing that the drownings of two children and a woman earlier this month, as well as the rescue by Mexican officials of two other migrants on the US side of the Rio Grande, “underscore that Texas is firm in its continued efforts … to block Border Patrol’s access to the border even in emergency circumstances.”
The state sued last year to stop Border Patrol agents from cutting the concertina wire, saying it illegally destroyed state property and undermined security in order to assist migrants in crossing the border.
The 5th Circuit is currently weighing the legal questions around whether the federal government has the authority to cut the wire that Texas had installed on the banks of the Rio Grande. It’s set to hear oral arguments in the case February 7.
Texas had urged the Supreme Court to deny the Biden administration’s request, telling the justices in court papers that “there is no basis for this Court’s intervention, much less now.”
Attorneys for the state noted that after the Biden administration filed its emergency request to the justices, the appeals court said it would expedite its review of the case – a decision the state had argued undermined a need for quick action by the nation’s high court.
“In any case, cutting Texas’s fencing to wave thousands of people into Texas has nothing to do with inspection, apprehension, or removal,” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and other lawyers for the state wrote in court papers.
“The district court’s findings demonstrate more that (the administration’s) actions are so far removed from what Congress authorized that they have nothing to do with Defendants’ statutory authority,” they told the court.
The White House has repeatedly called on Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform to address urgent needs at the US-Mexico border. Biden acknowledged to reporters on Friday that the border “is not” secure, calling on lawmakers to “Give me the money!” to fund additional resources.
In Monday’s statement, Fernández Hernández said the president will continue “working to find a bipartisan agreement with Congress that includes additional resources and meaningful policy reforms.”

A8AXH2JJBR_QXC1BJ03I0ICDLW,Former NRA President Oliver North says he was ousted after he raised concerns about corruption within the organization,"By Sabrina Souza, CNN","4 minute read Updated 11:51 AM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/24/us/oliver-north-ousted-nra-corruption-trial/,"Former National Rifle Association President Oliver North was ousted after he raised concerns about corruption within the gun-lobbying group, he testified Tuesday at a civil corruption trial in New York.
Prosecutors allege that top NRA members used the non-profit organization as their “personal piggy bank,” through years of illegal self-dealing and financial misconduct.
North, who gained national attention as a central figure in the Iran-Contra scandal in the 1980s, served as NRA president for less than a year, between 2018 and 2019.
He grew concerned about financial improprieties within the organization after an NRA attorney was fired and replaced by an outside law firm, the Brewer firm, he said.
After many rejected attempts to uncover details on legal spending and rebuffs by NRA Executive Vice President and CEO Wayne LaPierre, North recommended an independent review be conducted of the NRA, specifically of the Brewer firm, North testified.

LaPierre, a defendant in the trial who became the face of the gun rights movement over three decades, stepped down earlier this month, effective January 31.
In February 2019, North said, he asked NRA general counsel John Frazer, another defendant, for legal invoices. Frazer said no, telling him it was at LaPierre’s direction, North testified.
“We want to bring in a reputable outside firm to do an audit of not just the Brewer bills but of the whole mess,” North said, raising his arms in the air. “What we were trying to do was throw you a lifeline,” he said.
“What was your reaction to LaPierre’s personal expenses?” Monica Connell, special counsel with New York Attorney General Letitia James’ office, asked North.
“I was stunned … this was corruption,” he said.
“I was still trying to save Wayne LaPierre, a friend’s, job – that’s why I was throwing him a lifeline,” North added.
One of those lifelines was a letter to LaPierre in February 2019, in which North said he addressed the legal spending and the Brewer firms’ invoices of more than $100,000 in expenses. LaPierre replied with a cease and desist letter and again refused to make the Brewer bills available, North said.
LaPierre told him, “Brewer is the reason why I am not going to spend the rest of my life in an orange jumpsuit,” North testified.
“He’s now in a situation I never wanted to see him in,” North said glancing at LaPierre in the courtroom.
In a response to request for comment, the Brewer firm on Wednesday provided CNN with a statement from the NRA’s Andrew Arulanandam. “The firm’s bills have always been reviewed, vetted and approved at the highest levels of the organization, period,” he said.
Arulanandam will replace LaPierre as interim CEO and executive vice president, NRA announced this month.
North testified his goal as president was “to try and stop this circular firing squad” that the parties involved were in at the time, calling for a “ceasefire.”
According to North, LaPierre also helped draft his employment contract with Ackerman McQueen, the NRA’s former advertising firm, saying, “I’ll take care of it,” referring to both North’s employment and his nomination as president.
LaPierre didn’t follow procedure when he hired him, North suggested, ignoring the NRA’s audit committee which was supposed to supervise hires. It wasn’t solely North’s employment LaPierre pushed for but his nomination for NRA president as well, North testified.
“Of course, it should have (been approved), that’s the rules,” North said. “They retroactively approved my contract.”
When asked by Connell about allegations that he attempted a coup, North replied, “It never happened, all a big-faced lie. This whole thing was concocted along the lines of being a coup participant and spreading nasty rumors about Mr. LaPierre, which is the last thing I’d done,” he said.
In the spring of 2019, North wrote a detailed memorandum titled, “The NRA Faces a Crisis,” where he asked for a formation of a crisis committee, he testified.
“I knew by the time I wrote this … I knew that I was finished,” he said, adding he knew LaPierre wouldn’t support his renomination. “This is my last act.”
He resigned but is still an NRA member, he said.
“Did you consider yourself a whistleblower?” Connell asked.
“I certainly became one,” North said."
A8MJM23AM9_DJ5LAP5VZE5A9KC,Nose wheel comes off Delta Boeing 757 shortly before takeoff,"By Jamiel Lynch and Gregory Wallace, CNN","1 minute read Updated 7:49 AM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/travel/boeing-757-nose-wheel/,"A Boeing 757 plane lost its nose wheel shortly before taking off at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, according to US aviation officials.
The Delta Air Lines plane had been preparing to fly to Bogotá, Colombia, on January 20 when the “nose wheel came off and rolled down the hill,” according to a preliminary report from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
Passengers were able to disembark the plane after the incident, which occurred at around 11:15 a.m., and were bused back to the terminal, the FAA has confirmed. No injuries were reported.
In LiveATC.net audio posted by VASAviation on Tuesday, an unidentified pilot can be heard alerting the pilot of the lost wheel via air traffic control.
“Delta 982 this is the aircraft looking at you. One of your nose tires just came off, it just rolled off the runway behind you,” the pilot says.
The Delta pilot then explains that they are working to get the plane tugged in.
Delta Air Lines has released a statement confirming the incident.
“Delta Flight 982 ATL/BOG was taxiing for departure when a nose gear tire came loose from the landing gear,” reads the statement.
“All customers and their bags were removed from the aircraft, transferred to the gate and onto a replacement aircraft.
“We apologize to our customers for the inconvenience.”"
A8XHC9YIUM_T2MC6E58FW5ZSYQ,Netanyahu touts ‘initiative’ to free hostages in Gaza as pressure mounts,"By Amir Tal, Mitchell McCluskey, Hagi Cohen-Boland and Nadeen Ebrahim, CNN","5 minute read Updated 5:56 PM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240122,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/22/middleeast/netanyahu-rejects-hamas-hostage-offer-mime-intl/,"Editor’s Note: A version of this story appears in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here.
Israel has offered a two-month ceasefire to Hamas as part of a prospective hostage deal, Axios reported Monday, citing two unnamed Israeli officials.
It would be “the longest period of ceasefire that Israel has offered Hamas since the start of the war,” wrote Axios reporter Barak Ravid, who is also a CNN analyst.
The proposal comes after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected Hamas’ call for an end to the Gaza war in exchange for the release of hostages held there, as he faces increasing public pressure to bring the captives home.
In order to release the remaining hostages, Netanyahu said Hamas was demanding an end to the war, the release of Palestinian prisoners and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. “I work on this around the clock. But to be clear: I reject outright the terms of surrender of the monsters of Hamas,” he said in a statement on Sunday, adding that agreeing to the terms goes against Israel’s security.
“If we agree to this, our soldiers fell in vain. If we agree to this, we will not be able to guarantee the security of our citizens,” the Prime Minister said.
Netanyahu has since told families of the remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza that Israel has an “initiative” to secure the release of those abducted – but that there is “no real proposal” from Hamas that would advance their freedom, according to the prime minister’s office.
According to the Axios report, Israel’s latest proposal envisions the release of all remaining hostages and hostage bodies in multiple phases, in exchange for Palestinian detainees imprisoned in Israel.
It would also see Israel move its forces out of main population centers and allow “a gradual return of Palestinian civilians to Gaza city and the northern Gaza strip.”
Out of the 253 hostages Israel says Hamas seized on October 7, Israel believes that 132 are still in Gaza, of whom 104 are thought to be alive.
The Wall Street Journal report has reported that the US, Egypt and Qatar want Israel to join a new phase of talks with Hamas that would start with the release of hostages and lead to the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.
These developments come amid deepening divisions within Israel’s war cabinet about whether to prioritize bringing hostages home over defeating Hamas, and as thousands protested over the weekend in Tel Aviv against Netanyahu’s handling of the war.
War cabinet minister Gadi Eisenkot last week suggested that the key war aim of defeating Hamas is unrealistic and called for elections within months. Eisenkot also said the government had failed to achieve what he says should be its highest priority: securing the release of the hostages.
Netanyahu is under mounting pressure from the Israeli public to secure the release of captives in Gaza. On Monday, more than a dozen people, including families of the hostages, forced their way into a meeting held by the Israeli parliament’s finance committee. The protesters held placards that read: “You will not sit here while they die there.”
Video of the scene showed security officers trying to remove the protesters amid shouting and jostling.

“It can’t go on like this. You’d better know. It can’t go on like this. You will not sit here while our children die there,” shouted one protester. There were no reports of arrests inside the parliament, known as the Knesset.
Israeli police said that in a separate demonstration dozens of protesters had blocked the entrance to the Knesset, “violating public order.” That protest called for an immediate election, and included some of the families of those killed on October 7.
After some refused to leave, a police officer announced a dispersal order, according to an Israeli police statement.
A poll released on Monday by CNN’s Israeli affiliate Channel 13 found that 35% of Israelis would support a deal involving the release of all hostages from Gaza in exchange for stopping the war and freeing all Hamas detainees in Israel. Nearly half (46%) said they would oppose such a deal.
A slim majority (53%) said Netanyahu’s personal interests were the main consideration driving his conduct of the war and a third (33%) said the national interest was his main consideration.
It has been more than three months since Israel launched its war against Hamas, which came in response to the group’s brutal October 7 attack that killed 1,200 people, according to Israeli authorities.
Meanwhile, the death toll in Gaza on Sunday surpassed 25,000, according to the Hamas-controlled health ministry in the enclave.
CNN cannot independently verify the figures.
Netanyahu reiterated his rejection of future Palestinian sovereignty over the occupied territories on Saturday after talks with US President Joe Biden about Gaza’s future. The White House has been pushing Israel to recognize the need for the Palestinians to establish an independent state in areas Israel captured in the 1967 war.
“I will not compromise on full Israeli security control over all the territory west of Jordan - and this is contrary to a Palestinian state,” Netanyahu said in a post Saturday on X.
The Prime Minister’s public rejection of a Palestinian state has placed him at odds with Israel’s staunchest ally, which has long advocated for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Several European foreign ministers have also joined the chorus of criticism directed at Netanyahu over Israel’s opposition to a two-state solution. Josep Borrell, the European Union’s foreign policy chief said on Monday that Israel’s opposition to a two-state solution is “unacceptable” and Israel cannot expect countries to drop the issue.

A9V6KY0XX3_KVYJ5CLMIAHDBJ4,Justice Department settlement concludes Andrew Cuomo sexually harassed state employees,"By Holmes Lybrand and Devan Cole, CNN","3 minute read Updated 4:05 PM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/26/politics/doj-cuomo-sexual-harassment-new-york/,"The Justice Department concluded Friday that former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo sexually harassed state employees, supporting the findings of a previous state civil review of allegations against the former governor.
The department reached an agreement with the New York State Executive Chamber resolving the claims of sexual harassment and retaliation against the Democratic former governor, according to a release from the Justice Department on Friday.
The Justice Department found that during his time as governor, Cuomo subjected over a dozen women to a sexually hostile work environment, the department said Friday, reiterating many of the findings of New York Attorney General Letitia James’ 2021 report into the former governor.
“Governor Cuomo repeatedly subjected these female employees to unwelcome, non-consensual sexual contact; ogling; unwelcome sexual comments; gender-based nicknames; comments on their physical appearances; and/or preferential treatment based on their physical appearances,” the Justice Department found.
In August 2021, the New York attorney general’s office found that Cuomo had sexually harassed 11 women and created a “hostile” work environment for women. Cuomo resigned a week after the state’s report was released.
According to the findings from the Justice Department, Cuomo’s senior staff were told about the harassment but failed to report the incidents “to the appropriate investigative body.”
The Justice Department also noted that “Cuomo’s senior staff were aware of his conduct and retaliated against four of the women he harassed.”
Additionally, during his time as governor, Cuomo’s office did not have an HR department, according to the Justice Department.
An attorney for Cuomo, Rita Glavin, said in a statement Friday that Cuomo “did not sexually harass anyone” and that the Justice Department’s investigation “was based entirely on the NYS Attorney General’s deeply flawed, inaccurate, biased, and misleading report.”
Rich Azzopardi, a spokesperson for Cuomo, said in a separate statement Friday that the Justice Department’s work “isn’t worth the paper it’s printed on.”
Meanwhile, Mariann Wang, an attorney for two women who alleged Cuomo harassed them, said in a statement Friday, “We are pleased the US Attorney’s office and the Executive Chamber have taken serious steps to ensure nothing like the abuse Cuomo engaged in will happen again.”
“We hope these measures have real impact and prevent the kind of repeated abuse of power that resulted in so much harm to so many women,” Wang added.
Debra Katz, an attorney for Charlotte Bennett, one of the first women to accuse Cuomo of sexual harassment, similarly said Friday, “We are hopeful that this settlement with the DOJ will lead to lasting change that prevents any other woman from having to endure what our client has endured.”
The department said the agreement “memorializes” many of the reforms enacted by Cuomo’s successor, Gov. Kathy Hochul, “as well as additional reforms aimed at preventing sexual harassment and retaliation in the Executive Chamber.”
The reforms include the governor’s office creating a new “process for complaints against senior officials” so that individuals lodging complaints can have “confidence that their complaints will be handled as independently as possible,” the Justice Department said. The governor’s office will also have to build an “anti-retaliation monitoring policy” to help shield complainants from reprisal.
“With this settlement agreement, the Executive Chamber under Governor Hochul is undertaking additional actions that will address system failures of the past while helping prevent the recurrence of systemic sexual harassment and retaliation in the future,” Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke said in a statement.

ADIMNT8SD0_YTR3VLLKVCUNU1B,The crisis at Kyte Baby might not have happened if the US had a mandated paid leave policy for new parents,"By Jeanne Sahadi, CNN","5 minute read Updated 11:50 AM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/23/success/paid-parental-leave-policies-kyte-baby/,"The crisis that has enveloped clothing company Kyte Baby this week might not have happened if the United States had a national paid parental leave policy in place.
Company founder and CEO Ying Liu was forced to offer two public apologies after making, in her words, a “terrible decision” to deny an employee more work flexibility after her adopted newborn landed in neonatal intensive care.
The United States is the only developed economy among the 38 members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development not to provide national paid maternal leave and job protection, never mind paid paternal or parental leave.
Related article Kyte Baby under scrutiny for denying mom’s remote work request while newborn was in NICU, CEO walks back ‘terrible decision’
“Across the OECD, statutory rights to paid maternity leave are provided with an average length of 18.5 weeks as of April 2022, ranging from 43 weeks in Greece (the longest entitlement) to none in the United States — the only OECD member with no national provision of paid maternity leave,” the OECD states on its site.
What’s more, almost all OECD countries have paid leave programs around childbirth for mothers and fathers, whether they are birth parents, adoptive parents or same sex parents. Besides pay, the programs offer to protect one’s job while on leave around the time of childbirth and the first few months after, according to the OECD.
Looking more globally, “approximately 83% of countries guarantee at least 12 weeks of paid leave to parents who give birth,” according to the paid leave advocacy group FamilyValues@Work.
US-based employees, by contrast, have to figure out which, if any, options might be available to them from a complex, confusing patchwork of programs.
“Nobody knows what they have access to,” said paid leave expert Vicki Shabo, a fellow at the policy research think tank New America.
Nine US states and the District of Columbia currently have paid family leave laws on the books, and four more states have similar laws that will go into effect in the next couple of years, according to a New America report.

At the employer level, only 27% of US workers in the private sector have access to paid family leave through their job, up from 12% a decade ago, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. (Among state and local government workers, 28% have access to paid family leave today.)
In recent years, in a bid to boost talent attraction and retention, mostly larger employers have been expanding their paid family leave programs, not just for birth mothers but also fathers, working parents in same sex couples, and employees who adopt or foster a child.
Among companies with more than 500 employees, 75% now offer or plan to offer paid parental leave in 2024, up from 70% last year and from 46% in 2018, according to HR consulting firm Mercer. The median amount of paid time off is seven weeks, up from six in prior surveys Mercer has conducted.
And, according to a recent survey by HR consulting firm WTW, nearly 20% of the employers that currently offer paid leave for parents plan to make those leave policies more generous in the next two years.
At the national level, however, there is still not a federal program for paid leave, despite legislative efforts in recent years to pass one in Congress.
At present, the only federal mandate on the books is the three-decades-old Family and Medical Leave Act, which allows employees to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid but job-protected leave a year — not just for childbirth but for a range of needs, including dealing with one’s own or a family member’s illness or with caregiving needs when a family member is in the military and gets deployed.
Most people, of course, can’t afford to take much unpaid leave. But even if they could, due to its eligibility rules, the FMLA doesn’t cover a large swath of the workforce. In 2020, 44% of workers weren’t eligible for FMLA leave because they didn’t have sufficient tenure on the job, didn’t work enough hours and/or their work site was too small, according to the US Department of Labor. Given that the Kyte Baby employee in question had only worked at the company for “a little over 7 months,” the company wrote in an email to CNN, she likely would not have qualified for FMLA coverage.
In the wake of its troubles this weekend, Kyte Baby’s CEO told CNN the company will now expand its maternity leave policy, which currently only offers two to four weeks with pay depending on tenure.

And perhaps it may also follow in the footsteps of other employers when it comes workplace flexibility.
The initial video on TikTok that alerted the world to the Kyte Baby situation alleged that the new mother was “fired” after proposing she be allowed to work remotely. But the company told CNN that “[s]he did propose a remote option for her job, but given that her role was largely on-site, at that time, we did not feel that the proposed plan would fulfill the responsibilities of her current position. We told her we understood her situation and informed her that her job would be here if and when she opted to return. However, upon reflection, we should have taken more steps to accommodate her situation.”
One trend that workplace experts expect to see in 2024 is more employers coming up with different ways to provide equity in their workplace policies so employees whose jobs are not remote friendly can enjoy more flexibility on par with that of their desk-based colleagues — for instance, by providing them with four-day workweeks or more flexibility in scheduling their hours.
But as executives at Kyte Baby are no doubt learning the hard way, it is always better to proactively offer these types of new or expanded benefits before a very public crisis forces their hand and potentially threatens their brand.

AGQJNJG2AH_KZLX19VE7YAY8GL,US and UK carry out additional strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen,"By Natasha Bertrand and Oren Liebermann, CNN","6 minute read Updated 5:44 AM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240122,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/22/politics/us-uk-strikes-yemen-iraq/,"The US and UK carried out additional strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen on Monday, marking the eighth round of attacks by the US military on the rebels’ infrastructure in just over 10 days, according to a joint statement.
They struck eight sites, according to the statement from the US and UK, which conducted the strikes, and Canada, the Netherlands, Bahrain, and Australia, which supported the attacks.
The latest strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen were “successful” and destroyed missiles, weapons storage sites and drone systems, according to a senior military official and a senior defense official.
The officials, who briefed reporters following the Monday afternoon operation, said the strikes “achieved the desired effect.”
It was a smaller number than the first joint operation on January 11 that struck over 30 Houthi targets. Monday’s strikes targeted a Houthi underground storage site and sites associates with Houthi missile and air surveillance, the statement added.
The US used fighter jets from the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, as well as surface vessels and a submarine to strike eight locations, the senior military official said. In all, the official said approximately 25-30 precision guided munitions were fired at the targets, including Tomahawk cruise missiles.
President Joe Biden spoke to his British counterpart UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Monday, the White House said earlier in the day, about a range of topics including security in the Red Sea.
“Our aim remains to de-escalate tensions and restore stability in the Red Sea, but let us reiterate our warning to Houthi leadership: we will not hesitate to defend lives and the free flow of commerce in one of the world’s most critical waterways in the face of continued threats,” the countries said in their statement.
For the first time, the US also struck an underground storage facility used by the Houthis, the official said. The storage site was assessed to have “more advanced conventional weaponry,” including missiles and one-way attack drones.
Grant Shapps, the UK’s secretary of state for defense, said four British Typhoon fighter jets took part in the strikes on Houthi targets. He warned that the ongoing Houthi launches against commercial vessels “threaten the lives of sailors and disrupt shipping at an intolerable cost to the global economy.”
Following the latest round of US and UK airstrikes in Yemen on Monday, Houthi leader Mohamed Ali al-Houthi said the strikes would only strengthen the Yemeni people.
“Your strikes will only make the Yemeni people stronger and more determined to confront you, as you are the aggressors against our country,” he said in a statement posted on X.
The rebel group said the US and the UK launched 18 airstrikes on four governorates Monday night.
CNN reported on Monday that the US has named the ongoing operation to target Houthi assets in Yemen “Operation Poseidon Archer,” suggesting a more organized and potentially long-term approach to the operations in Yemen that have been aimed at deterring the Iranian-backed group from attacking commercial vessels in the Red Sea.
The US has now struck Houthi targets in Yemen eight times since January 11, the majority of which the US military has carried out unilaterally. The first wave of strikes, in which the US and UK hit approximately 30 sites across Houthi-controlled Yemen, marked the beginning of Operation Poseidon Archer, one official said.
The attacks have targeted the Houthis’ one-way attack drones, anti-ship ballistic missiles, anti-ship cruise missiles and more as the US has tried to disrupt the group’s ability to fire on international shipping lanes.
In an attempt to avoid escalation, the officials said the latest strikes were specifically intended to target the Houthi weapons and supporting capabilities used to target international shipping lanes, describing them as similar in nature to the first round of coalition strikes against Houthi targets on January 11.
“We are not at this time expanding beyond that target set,” the senior military official said.
Deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh said on Monday that the Houthis had not launched a new attack on commercial shipping since January 18. The Houthis claimed on Monday to have attacked a US-owned cargo ship, the M/V Ocean Jazz, but a defense official told CNN that claim was not true.
Iran has been quietly fueling the attacks, US officials have said, enabling and supporting its proxy groups across the region. Tehran has been supplying the Houthis with tactical intelligence and weapons to help them target ships in the Red Sea, CNN previously reported. Iran has also continued to supply its proxy groups in Iraq and Syria, where US and coalition forces have come under attack over 150 times since October 17.
On Saturday, Iranian proxy militias launched one of their largest ballistic missile attacks since October on al-Asad airbase in Iraq, leaving two US service members with traumatic brain injuries, Singh said on Monday.
Biden acknowledged on Thursday that the US strikes were not stopping the Houthis, who have continued to target, and in some cases hit, US-owned commercial vessels operating off the coast of Yemen.
But Biden said the US airstrikes would continue, anyway. And Singh said on Monday that it would ultimately be up to the Houthis and the Iranian proxy groups when to end their attacks.
Singh said last week that the Pentagon’s initial assessments are that the strikes against the Houthis have been “very successful” in destroying “pretty much all of the targets that we hit,” leaving one less missile or capability that the Houthis can then deploy in the Red Sea.
The Houthis have said that they won’t stop their attacks until the war between Israel and Hamas inside Gaza comes to an end. Houthi leader Abdul Malek al-Houthi said in a speech on Thursday that it is “a great honor and blessing to be confronting America directly.”
Last week, the US Navy intercepted a vessel off the coast of Somalia destined for Houthi-controlled parts of Yemen that was carrying Iranian-made missile components, Central Command announced in a statement. That operation resulted in the deaths of two Navy SEALs who fell overboard while attempting to board the boat, CENTCOM said.
The US also carried out all of its strikes on Houthi targets last week unilaterally, in contrast to the coalition of countries that supported the first round of joint US and UK strikes on the Houthis on January 11.
Singh said on Thursday that future joint action wasn’t off the table, but that CENTCOM Commander Gen. Erik Kurilla had the authority to order strikes when he deemed it necessary to protect ships in the region, including US Naval assets stationed in the Red Sea. After each of the strikes the US conducted against the Houthis last week, CENTCOM said that the missiles the US destroyed were being prepared for imminent launch by the Houthis.
National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby told reporters on Thursday that the administration is “making it harder” for the Houthis to continue their attacks with each strike on their infrastructure. And he noted that the administration has “additional options” available to it if the Houthis don’t stop. But he declined to preview what those options might look like.
“I’m not going to telegraph punches one way or another, except to say what the president said this morning– that if the Houthis continue to go down this path, we will continue to do what we can to disrupt and degrade their ability to make those choices,” he said.
“We’re not looking for a conflict with the Houthis, we’re not looking for a conflict in the region,” he added. “But we have to be able to act in our own self-defense, not just for our ships and our sailors, but for merchant ships and merchant sailors and international shipping in the Red Sea.”

AIQNHOQEKT_MOD1Z7X76XMC81D,"Despite no money left for Ukraine aid, Defense Department keeps training pipeline going","By Oren Liebermann and Haley Britzky, CNN","2 minute read Published 10:31 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/25/politics/pentagon-aid-ukraine-training/,"Despite there being no money left for Ukraine aid, the Defense Department is keeping the training pipeline going, with nearly 1,600 Ukrainian troops currently in US training programs in Europe and the US.
At Grafenwoehr Training Area in Germany — the US military’s largest training base in Europe — approximately 1,500 Ukrainian troops are taking part in weapons training, leadership courses, and reconstitution training, according to Col. Martin O’Donnell, a spokesman for US Army Europe and Africa.
Another 80 Ukrainian troops are undergoing training at the US base in Rheinland-Pfalz in Germany, O’Donnell said. A small number of Ukrainian pilots are also undergoing pilot training in Tucson, Arizona, to fly F-16 fighter jets.
Celeste Wallander, the assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs, said earlier this week that the goal is to have Ukraine operating F-16s this year, “which would entail trained pilots, the platforms, but in addition, trained maintainers and sustainers, infrastructure, and spare parts, [and] ammunition.”
To date, the United States has trained approximately 18,000 Ukrainian troops in different programs like combined arms training, leadership training, and learning to use specific weapons and systems, O’Donnell said. The coalition of countries that are providing training to Ukrainian forces have trained more than 118,000 troops in 80 different training areas.
The training program for Ukrainian forces has continued, even as the US has run out of money to provide Ukraine with any more security packages. The Biden administration is pushing for $61.4 billion dollars for Ukraine aid in a supplemental national security package, but its future prospects remain unclear amid ongoing congressional negotiations over the southern border and immigration policies.
The last Ukraine security package, worth up to $250 million, was announced on December 27. Some weapons and equipment from previous drawdown packages and Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) packages are still flowing into Ukraine, but the US has not been able to announce new packages.
Wallander warned that Ukraine has concerns about how equipped their units are and whether they have enough ammunition to stay in the fight against Russia.
“We have heard reports from the Ukrainian government that they have concerns … that they believe that units do not have the stocks and the stores of ammunition that they require, and that is one of the reasons we have been focusing on the need to answer Congress’ questions so that they are able to move forward on a decision to pass the supplemental,” Wallander told reporters Tuesday."

Authorities learned Noah Roush and Jatonia Bryant were missing Monday around 10:30 a.m. from the Dub Brassell Adult Detention Center in Pine Bluff, about 40 miles south of Little Rock.
Roush, 22, was apprehended Thursday after authorities got a 911 call from a “citizen” who reported seeing someone matching the inmate’s description at an abandoned residence in Pine Bluff about 2 miles away from the detention center, the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office said in a news release.
When an officer arrived at the residence, Roush tried to flee on foot before he was captured and returned to custody at the detention center, the sheriff’s office said.
Roush was being held on suspicion of residential burglary and theft, according to inmate records. The sheriff’s office said Roush is “also a suspect in a homicide,” but did not provide additional details on the case.
Bryant, 23, was being held on suspicion of capital murder, among other offenses, inmate records show. He was still at large as of Thursday, the sheriff’s office said.
Bryant is 5 feet 11 inches tall, Black and weighs about 145 pounds, authorities previously said. The sheriff’s office announced a $2,500 reward for information that would lead to his capture.
“We are relieved to have Roush in custody, but we also remain vigilant in capturing Jatonia Bryant who remains at large,” the sheriff’s office said.
It’s unclear how Roush and Bryant managed to escape from the detention facility, or exactly when they got out. Authorities said Monday the pair was believed to have escaped in the previous 48 hours."
ANUKOCK6Q7_ICJPURF5HM38GHO,Opinion: The absurdity of the return-to-office movement,Opinion by Peter Bergen,"4 minute read Updated 12:27 PM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240122,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/22/opinions/remote-work-jobs-bergen/,"Editor’s Note: Peter Bergen is CNN’s national security analyst, a vice president at New America, a professor of practice at Arizona State University, the host of the Audible podcast “In the Room” also on Apple and Spotify and was the founding editor of the Coronavirus Daily Brief. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.
I host a podcast, “In the Room with Peter Bergen,” which focuses on national security issues. Every day, I see the merits of being part of an entirely remote workforce.
We have a production team, around half of whom live in Brooklyn and Manhattan, and the others live in places like Chicago, Mexico City and San Francisco. We have met in person only twice in the year that the production has been up and running, and we have put out dozens of highly produced episodes, often featuring multiple guests, which go through many rounds of edits.
In my four decades of working in media, I have never worked somewhere with a better esprit de corps, creative energy and a collective willingness to help everyone else out.
And yet, some corporate titans are still pushing for their employees to return to their offices. Banks like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase and tech giants like Meta are demanding that their staff be back at the office several days a week.
Those return-to-office demands are often couched in non-falsifiable claims about the necessity of having chance encounters at the office where folks bounce creative, productive ideas off of each other.
Typical of this view is JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who claimed in 2021 that working from home “doesn’t work for spontaneous idea generation.” There is no empirical evidence for this claim, and the desire for employers to see their employees working in their offices seems to be more about the need for control and an attachment to the old ways of doing things.
The return-to-office demands also make little sense from an overall economic perspective at a time when a third of Americans who can do their job remotely now only work from home, up from only 7% before Covid, according to the Pew Research Center, yet the economy is very strong in terms of low unemployment and GDP growth. If working from home suppressed innovation, productivity and creativity, you would expect quite different economic results.
Further, working from home saves Americans an average daily commute of 72 minutes a day, to say nothing about the reduced pollution and energy consumption that comes from fewer commuters, according to a 2023 University of Chicago study.
Related article Opinion: Are you better off than you were three years ago?
Working parents, in particular, benefit from not having to waste time, money and flexibility commuting to an office. A 2023 Bankrate survey found that 74% of working women with children are in favor of remote work, while 64% of all working Americans support it.
I have some insight into this as a parent who now works mostly from home. This arrangement gives me a lot more time to spend with my kids, and if there is any kind of unforeseen emergency, I can be there for them in a way that, during the era of the office, I couldn’t be.
The internet and cell phones obviate so much of what was once done at the office, which is, after all, largely an artifact of the 20th century thanks to the rise of mass transportation, the ability to build tall office buildings and the previous immovability of the “work” telephone, which was stuck to a desk. All this, thankfully, is going the way of the dodo.
During the office era, so many workers spent so much time at their desks that workplaces often tried to present themselves as some kind of alternative family. You had your “work husbands” and mandatory “team building” events. Of course, this all came at the expense of your loved ones at home, as you had to spend time away from them while doing all your office-based events and tasks.
I am writing this column in Washington, DC, but work with editors in New York, London or Atlanta. In fact, I have written several hundred of these columns over the past dozen years and I have never met most of the editors I work with, and yet I still have a warm, productive relationship with them.

To be sure, a Starbucks cappuccino is not going to make itself, and certain kinds of work environments — such as hospitals, restaurants, film sets or government offices where classified material is handled in a secure environment — require employees to be in person.
But for much of the economy where work doesn’t need to be in person, the demand to “return to office” is not rooted in any concern for employees, a large majority of whom want to work from home — not because they are lazy or don’t want to be productive, but because it gives them more freedom and control over their own lives.
So why do some bosses still feel it necessary to prolong the slow and necessary death of The Office? Beats me."

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis ended his campaign on Sunday and endorsed Trump; Vivek Ramaswamy and Asa Hutchinson ended theirs after disappointing finishes in last week’s Iowa caucuses.
Crowded candidate fields often narrow rapidly following Iowa and New Hampshire, which have long been the first two contests on the presidential nominating calendar.
Out of the 11 major Republican candidates who competed in Iowa in 2016, it was just over 90 days before Trump was the only one left standing. (This analysis is defining major candidates as those receiving more than 1% of the vote in the Iowa caucuses.)
This year, just a week after Iowa, only Haley remains, setting up 2024 to be one of the shortest competitive primary seasons in recent history.
In 2016, the Democratic field narrowed to  Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders after the Iowa caucuses, but then the race to the nomination remained competitive through the entire primary season.
Trump won 98 of 99 Iowa counties in last week’s Iowa caucuses and outperformed his 2016 results. He claimed more than 50% of the vote, the biggest win in the history of the Iowa caucuses. Haley came in third, with 19.1% of the vote.
As for New Hampshire, Trump held 50% support among likely Republican primary voters in the Granite State, with Haley at 39% and DeSantis at 6%, according to a new CNN poll conducted by the University of New Hampshire that was released Sunday before DeSantis’ exit.
When DeSantis’ supporters are reallocated to their second-choice candidates, Trump leads Haley by a wider 54% to 41% margin. Another 3% of likely GOP primary voters say they’d vote for someone else."

Fritzl is currently being held at Stein prison but will be moved as long as the public prosecutor’s office does not file an appeal against the decision in the next 14 days.
His eventual release would stipulate that he attends psychotherapy sessions every three months, and he will be on probation in regular prison for 10 years, court documents said.
“Any future application for conditional release from the normal prison can only be submitted if there is a significant change in the relevant circumstances,” said Judge Ferdinand Schuster.

Fritzl’s lawyer, Astrid Wagner, told CNN that “he is very happy about how it turned out and that a first step in the right direction has been taken.”
“I am confident and absolutely convinced that my client will be granted a permanent release in the foreseeable future,” added Wagner.
Last week it was announced that a psychiatric examination had found that Fritzl is suffering from dementia, and that Wagner was trying to get the 88-year-old moved to a nursing home to receive adequate care.
In 2009, a jury in Austria found Fritzl guilty of raping and imprisoning his daughter for over two decades, sentencing him to life in prison.
The trial shocked the world with details of how he had confined his daughter in a specially designed cellar in 1984, when she was 18, and kept her there for 24 years while repeatedly sexually assaulting her and fathering her seven children.
Fritzl kept four of those children captive in the cellar with his daughter, while allowing the others to live upstairs with his wife.
Meanwhile, he told his family that his daughter had run away to join a cult and explained the sudden appearance of the three children by claiming she had returned and dropped them off.
The case only came to light in April 2008, when one of the children became seriously ill and ended up in hospital."

The French Data Protection Authority, or the CNIL, said in a statement Tuesday that Amazon France Logistique gave warehouse staff scanners that recorded their periods of inactivity and how quickly they performed certain tasks, such as removing an item from shelves or putting an item away.
The CNIL ruled the scanner system to be “excessive” partly because it measured “work interruptions with such accuracy, potentially requiring employees to justify every break or interruption.”
Amazon (AMZN) said in a statement posted on its European Union site: “We strongly disagree with the CNIL’s conclusions … and we reserve the right to file an appeal.
“Warehouse management systems are industry standard and are necessary for ensuring the safety, quality, and efficiency of operations and to track the storage of inventory and processing of packages on time and in line with customer expectations.”

The scanners used in France measure whether a worker scanned an item less than 1.25 seconds after scanning the previous item, based on the assumption that scanning too quickly increases the risk of error, the regulator said.
Amazon said this indicator was important to ensure that “employees take enough time to store the products so they can follow our safety guidelines” and to properly inspect each parcel before it is stored. But the company has decided to deactivate the collection of this data following the CNIL’s questions, it added.
Secondly, staff were judged to be “idle” if their scanners had been inactive for at least 10 minutes, the regulator found. Amazon said the data allowed its teams to “spot problems” that posed a risk to the firm’s operations or the safety of its employees. The company will now raise the threshold for logging “idle time” to 30 minutes, it noted.
A third indicator used by Amazon signaled when a worker’s scanner was interrupted anywhere between one and 10 minutes, according to the CNIL.
“Such systems kept employees under close surveillance for all tasks carried out with scanners and thus put them under continuous pressure,” the CNIL said, adding that the monitoring gave the company “a competitive advantage” over other companies in the online sales market.
The regulator fined Amazon France Logistique in late December following several investigations into the firm’s practices in its warehouses and complaints from employees. The CNIL found that the warehouse operator had kept data on the performance of its staff for 31 days — a length of time it also deemed “excessive.”
The regulator ruled that the firm had breached several elements of EU data protection law.
In the United States, Amazon has long faced scrutiny for the working conditions inside its warehouses, with employees complaining of punishing hours and close surveillance by bosses."

Gauteng police spokesperson Dimakatso Nevhuhlwi said the suspect was arrested after he confessed before the Commission of Inquiry into the building fire, and that the 29-year-old man will appear in court soon on charges of arson, 76 counts of murder and 120 counts of attempted murder, according to SABC.
The exact cause of the fire is “yet to be determined,” it added.
At least 12 children were among those killed in the blaze last year. More than 50 people were injured.
The fire affected some of the country’s most vulnerable people while also highlighting a long-standing problem regarding abandoned buildings in South Africa.
The blaze took place in what is known locally as a “hijacked building” – a property abandoned by landlords and taken over by gangs or other groups and leased out mostly to migrants and South Africans lacking the means to afford other forms of housing.
Hijacked buildings often fail to meet basic safety regulations. CNN reported at the time that local authorities said the apartments in the building, intended to house only two or three people, were partitioned into sleeping areas to accommodate multiple inhabitants.
While South Africa has seen fires devastate informal settlements before, the Johannesburg fire is widely seen as the worst in recent memory.

AUSBQMV7M4_0FQN3X299JG956Z,Opinion: It’s frightening to imagine what Donald Trump could do with the CIA in a second term,Opinion by Douglas London,"7 minute read Published 4:34 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/24/opinions/donald-trump-second-term-cia-london/,"Editor’s Note: Douglas London is the author of “The Recruiter: Spying and the Lost Art of American Intelligence.” He teaches at Georgetown University’s School of Foreign Service and is a nonresident scholar at the Middle East Institute. London served in the CIA’s clandestine service as a Russian-speaking senior operations officer for more than 30 years, mostly in the Middle East, South and Central Asia and Africa, including three assignments as a chief of station and as the CIA’s counterterrorism chief for South and Southwest Asia. The views expressed here are his own. He tweets @douglaslondon5. Read more opinion at CNN.
Could a reelected former President Donald J. Trump use the CIA’s unique authorities, capabilities and insulation from public scrutiny to take action against his political enemies?
The answer was “yes” well before Trump’s lawyer argued that he would be immune from prosecution for directing SEAL Team 6 to assassinate a political rival — unless first impeached and convicted by Congress. In fact, it would be even easier for Trump to turn the CIA into his own Praetorian Guard.
Last March, the former president told supporters at a political rally, “I am your warrior. I am your justice. And for those who have been wronged and betrayed: I am your retribution.” What could be better than a powerful and elite secret organization insulated from public scrutiny, whose rules he can rewrite with near impunity to defile the Constitution?
The CIA’s operating guidelines have been primarily set by executive orders which can be changed with the stroke of a pen — and for good reason. As the nation’s first line of defense and collector of last resort, its size and flexibility facilitates innovation and the authority to quickly realign resources.
This structure enabled the CIA to deploy personnel to Afghanistan well ahead of the military after 9/11 and to respond to the 2014 threat posed by the Islamic State. Albeit with less public notoriety, the CIA has been at the forefront of US national efforts to support Ukraine and deter China’s possible invasion of Taiwan.
While the CIA is subject to oversight, neither the Senate nor House can approve or disapprove their activities and at most, can deny funding. Moreover, the president’s communications with the CIA are classified and protected by executive privilege. Although appropriately cleared members of Congress are apprised of presidential findings through a Memorandum of Notification, they are not at liberty to publicly debate or countermand such sensitive covert action programs.
There’s also little likelihood Trump’s fellow GOP leaders would push back. Despite the indictments Trump faces for inciting violence on January 6, mishandling classified documents and fraud, his 2024 candidacy has been endorsed by 19 Republican senators as well as the House leadership and 7 governors. (Trump denies wrongdoing.)
Frankly, no foreign threat I ever encountered across four decades as a CIA operations officer frightened me as much as GOP Representative Elise Stefanik, the fourth-ranking member of the House leadership, parroting Trump’s reference to those being prosecuted for beating police officers with fire hydrants and American flags on January 6th — after dragging them down the Capitol steps — as “hostages.”
The CIA offers a wide array of collection, investigative, surveillance, technical and kinetic capabilities that mirror those of the country’s larger defense, diplomatic, security and law enforcement agencies but with flatter management and without the public footprint. And therein lies the temptation for abuse.
Related article Opinion: What’s really working for Trump
As illustrated by the 1970’s Church Committee hearings and by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Study of the CIA’s Detention and Interrogation Program, the agency’s capabilities have too often been used to serve a president’s political interests, rather than the nation’s security.
It was not until President Ronald Reagan issued Executive Order 12333 (E.O 12333) in 1981 that a framework was established for the country’s national intelligence efforts to safeguard Americans’ privacy and civil liberties. President George W. Bush revised and reissued the order in 2008 to better align it to the 2004 Intelligence Reform and Terrorist Prevention Act that established the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI).
The agency’s capabilities have too often been used to serve a president’s political interests, rather than the nation’s security.
Douglas London
The revisions expanded privacy rights and the definition of a “United States person,” but more significantly transferred the Director of Central Intelligence’s authorities for setting policy and lanes across the US Intelligence Community to the DNI.
E.O. 12333 prohibits the CIA from spying on US persons or even soliciting one’s voluntary cooperation without making its true affiliation and intentions clearly known. That includes both at home and abroad, and covers everything from hacking, bugging, break-ins and shadowing, to use the colloquial terms, or collecting and storing personal information on Americans without higher-level and Justice Department approvals.
Unlike the FBI, CIA officers cannot operate undercover to penetrate domestic organizations, not even those which carry out or advocate violence. And American journalists, clergy, and US Peace Corps personnel are among the prohibited categories from which the CIA can’t recruit, even abroad. Likewise, the agency can’t use such occupations as operational cover given the risk to those in these professions who might be suspected of being CIA.
While the CIA is prohibited from conducting assassinations, American or foreign, the US Justice Department approved America’s targeted killing of al Qaeda terrorist and American citizen Anwar al-Awlaki in 2011 without the benefit of legal due process.
Related article Opinion: Listen to what Trump’s own officials have to say about him
In fact, the White House, under Democratic President Barack Obama, acknowledged in 2015 that the US had killed a total of six other Americans, including one accidentally who was being held hostage, Warren Weinstein. Five other American citizens, including the more notorious Adam Gadahn and Ahmed Farouq, who were both killed in Pakistan while serving in senior al Qaeda positions, were struck incidentally without the benefit of the same Justice Department process afforded al-Awlaki.
Beyond E.O. 12333, there are still more restrictions and guidelines memorialized in internal DNI and DCIA policies and authorities which set the legal requirements, ethical standards and its tradecraft. These policies address everything from interrogation, the use of force, dealing with agents and foreign partners suspected of human rights abuses to information sharing that enables lethal consequences and the duty to warn of potential targets of violence.
As an example, reforms addressing the CIA’s use of “black sites,” renditions and enhanced interrogation were aligned to Executive Order 13491, issued on January 22, 2009, by Obama, requiring compliance with US domestic law, and its international agreements, in its treatment of captives. And the Biden White House walked back Trump-era policies which reportedly liberalized and delegated targeted killing and capture operations outside of conflict zones in its own revised Presidential Policy Memorandum. But all of this is subject to change should the President, the DNI or the DCIA choose — Congressional authorization is not required.
Still, weaponizing the CIA requires enablers who might come from among Trump’s sycophantic followers like former DNI John Ratcliffe, former acting DNI Richard Grenell or former Chief of Staff to the then-Acting Secretary of Defense Kash Patel. It was Patel, more recently, who told former Trump adviser Steven Bannon during a podcast that “We will go out and find the conspirators, not just in government but in the media.”
Related article Opinion: In victory, Trump loses it
Toward the end of his administration, Trump directed that Patel be installed as the CIA’s or the FBI’s deputy director until CIA Director Gina Haspel threatened to resign. Her resistance thwarted what the CIA workforce expected to be the former president’s plan to have Patel replace Haspel as acting director in order to execute a “deep state” loyalty purge.
Such a goal would be facilitated by Trump’s plans, should he win another term, to reintroduce an executive order known as Schedule F which would empower him to reclassify some 50,000 or more civil service positions as political appointees whom he can fire and replace at will.
None of this even begins to consider how Trump could use a new term to transform the CIA into a rubber-stamp echo chamber. Trump’s resentment of agencies like the CIA is well known: The former president’s lawyers filed a 68-page discovery motion reflecting plans to defend Trump against charges accusing him of illegally holding onto classified documents after he left office by painting the intelligence community as biased against him.

Besides previously embracing Russian President Vladimir Putin’s word over his intelligence community’s, Trump publicly chided its 2019 Worldwide Threat Assessment, observing that the agencies should “go back to school.”
And how might the CIA workforce respond? The reality is that officers are required to obey lawful orders. Some might follow their conscience and walk, but how many could afford to? Moreover, Trump is not without his supporters at CIA, particularly among the older, White, male circle of senior officers who may feel threatened by the agency’s generational changes and greater focus on diversity, inclusion, and equity.
Still, handcuffing the CIA by turning relevant executive orders into law might not be politically feasible nor would it be in the nation’s best interests. But the real prospects for a president’s abuse of the agency’s unique authorities and capabilities merit an a la carte review of those most applicable to domestic issues, privacy and civil liberties and of how to install further guard rails."
AW4U9OFMVF_GX2MWPNO4KAYX4C,Redistricting fights in these states could determine which party controls the US House,"By Fredreka Schouten, CNN","11 minute read Published 5:50 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/politics/redistricting-states-congressional-maps-house/,"Around the country, politicians are waging high-stakes battles over new congressional lines that could influence which party controls the US House of Representatives after the 2024 election.
In North Carolina, the Republicans who control the state legislature have crafted a map that could help them flip at least three seats. Democrats, meanwhile, could pick up seats under news lines in Alabama, Louisiana and New York.
In all, the fate of anywhere from 14 to 18 House seats across nearly a dozen states could turn on the results of these fights. Republicans currently hold just a narrow majority in the US House, with one vacancy. That razor-thin margin was underscored by the GOP’s recent chaotic struggle to elect a new speaker.
“Given that the majority is so narrow, every outcome matters to the fight for House control in 2024,” said David Wasserman, who follows redistricting closely as senior editor and elections analyst for The Cook Political Report with Amy Walter.
And with fewer competitive districts that swing between the political parties, Wasserman added, “every line change is almost existential.”

Experts say several other factors have helped lead to the slew of consequential – and unresolved – redistricting disputes, just months before the first primaries of the 2024 cycle.
They include pandemic-related delays in completing the 2020 census – the once-a-decade population count that kicks off congressional and state legislative redistricting – as well as a 2019 Supreme Court ruling that threw decisions about partisan gerrymandering back to state courts.
In addition, some litigation had been frozen in place until the US Supreme Court’s surprise ruling in June, which found that a Republican-crafted redistricting plan in Alabama disadvantaged Black voters in the state and was in violation of the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act.
That decision “is functionally reanimating all of these dormant cases,” said Adam Kincaid, the president and executive director of the National Republican Redistricting Trust, which supports the GOP’s redistricting efforts.
Kincaid said it’s too soon to tell whether Republicans or Democrats will emerge with the advantage by Election Day 2024. In his view, either party could gain or lose only about two seats over redistricting.
In many of the closely watched states where action is pending, just a single seat hangs in the balance, with two notable exceptions: North Carolina and New York, where multiple seats are at stake. Republicans controlled the map-drawing in the Tar Heel State, while a ruling by New York’s highest court leaves the job ultimately to the Democrats who control the state legislature, potentially canceling out each party’s gains.
“Democrats kind of need to run the table in the rest of these states” to gain any edge, said Nick Seabrook, a political scientist at the University of North Florida and the author of the 2022 book “One Person, One Vote: A Surprising History of Gerrymandering in America.”
Here’s a state-by-state look at recent and upcoming redistricting disputes that could shape the 2024 race for control of the US House:
North Carolina’s legislature, where Republicans hold a supermajority, has drawn new congressional lines that observers say could prove a windfall for the GOP and boost the party’s chances of retaining its House majority next year.
The state’s current House delegation is split 7-7 between Democrats and Republicans.
A map that state lawmakers recently approved puts three House Democrats in what one expert called “almost impossible to win” districts.
The affected Democrats are Reps. Jeff Jackson, who currently represents a Charlotte-area district; Wiley Nickel, who holds a Raleigh-area seat; and Kathy Manning, who represents Greensboro and other parts of north-central North Carolina. All three have announced they will not seek reelection to the House.
A fourth Democrat, Rep. Don Davis, saw his district retooled to become more friendly toward Republicans while remaining competitive for both parties.
State-level gains in the 2022 midterm elections have given the GOP new sway over redistricting in this swing state. Last year, Republicans flipped North Carolina’s Supreme Court, whose members are chosen in partisan elections. The new GOP majority on the court this year tossed out a 2022 ruling by the then-Democratic leaning court against partisan gerrymandering.
A map that had been created after the Democratic-led high court’s ruling resulted in the current even split in the state’s House delegation.
Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper does not have veto power over redistricting legislation. A group of Black and Latino residents of North Carolina recently filed a lawsuit alleging that the GOP-approved map “intentionally discriminates” against minority voters in violation of the US Constitution.
In one of the cycle’s highest-profile redistricting cases, a three-judge panel in Alabama approved a map that creates a second congressional district with a substantial Black population. Before the court action, Alabama – which is 27% Black – had only one Black-majority congressional district out of seven seats.
The fight over the map went all the way to the Supreme Court – which issued a surprise ruling, affirming a lower-court opinion that ordered Alabama to include a second Black-majority district or “something quite close to it.” Under the map that will be in place for the 2024 election, the state’s 2nd District now loops into Mobile to create a seat where nearly half the population is Black.
The high court’s 5-4 decision in June saw two conservatives, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, side with the three liberals to uphold the lower-court ruling. Their action kept intact a key pillar of the Voting Rights Act: that it’s illegal to draw maps that effectively keep Black voters from electing a candidate of their choice.
The ruling has reverberated around the country and could affect the outcome of similar court cases underway in Louisiana and Georgia that center on whether Republican-drawn maps improperly diluted Black political power in those states.
Given that Black voters in Alabama have traditionally backed Democrats, the party now stands a better chance of winning the newly reconfigured district and sending to of its members to Congress after next year’s elections.
The new map also could result in two Black US House members from Alabama serving together for the first time in state history.
Facing a court-ordered deadline, the Republican-controlled state legislature in January approved a map with a second, Black-majority district that will be in effect for this year’s elections.
The action, which is viewed as a win for Democrats, endangers a seat now held by Republican Rep. Garret Graves.
The new map follows a protracted legal battle over the state’s district lines.
Although Black people make up roughly a third of the state’s population, Louisiana has just one Black lawmaker – who is also the lone Democrat – in its six-member congressional delegation.
A federal judge threw out the state’s Republican-drawn map in 2022, saying it likely violated the Voting Rights Act. Republican officials in the state appealed to the US Supreme Court, which put the lower-court ruling on hold until it decided the Alabama case, which it did in June this year.
Once the high court weighed in on the Alabama case, the legal skirmishes again lurched to life in Louisiana.
A federal court had given the GOP-controlled state legislature until the end of January to draw a new map, after deciding that the lower court had ruled correctly that the lawmakers’ map improperly diluted the voting power of Louisiana’s Black residents.
If the legislature had﻿ not acted by that deadline, the lower court could have proceeded to a full trial to resolve the map in time for this year’s elections.
Georgia Republicans, who hold a governing trifecta in the state, finalized a new congressional map last year that safeguarded their party’s dominance in state politics and dashed Democrats’ hopes of adding an additional US House seat.
The new map complied with an order issued by US District Judge Steve Jones to establish an additional Black-majority district. But it preserved the GOP’s 9-5 edge in Georgia’s US House delegation by moving the Atlanta-area district represented by﻿ Rep. Lucy McBath, a Black Democrat, farther into Republican territory.
Jones had ordered state lawmakers to draw a new congressional map by December 8, arguing that the Republican-controlled legislature improperly diluted the political power of Black voters in their establishment of district boundaries following the 2020 census. In that ruling, Jones said state lawmakers’ earlier map had violated the Voting Rights Act.
In a big win for Republicans, Jones in late December ruled that the new legislature-drawn map that preserved Republicans’ 9-5 advantage “fully complied” with his order.
A separate federal case in Georgia challenges the congressional map on constitutional grounds.
Republicans flipped four US House seats in New York in the 2022 midterm elections, victories that helped secure their party’s majority in the chamber.
But a new ruling by the state’s highest court could jeopardize those gains by potentially making it easier for Democrats to pick up as many as six GOP-held seats.
First, a bit of history: A state court judge oversaw the process of drawing the current map following a long legal battle and the inability of New York’s bipartisan Independent Redistricting Commission to agree on new lines. But Democrats scored a court victory this summer when a state appellate court ruled that the redistricting commission should redraw the map.
Republicans appealed that decision, and oral arguments were held in November before New York’s Court of Appeals, the state’s highest court.
On December 12, the Court of Appeals ordered the state to once again restart the mapmaking process. New York’s redistricting commission will be tasked with creating the new districts by February 28. The Democratic-controlled state legislature would have ultimate say over the new map.
A state judge in September struck down congressional lines for northern Florida that had been championed by Gov. Ron DeSantis, ruling that the Republican governor’s map had improperly diluted Black voting power.
This case, unlike the Alabama fight decided by the US Supreme Court, centers on provisions in the state constitution.
The judge concluded that the congressional boundaries – which essentially dismantled a seat once held by Al Lawson, a Black Democrat, that connected Black communities across a northern reach of the Florida – violated the state’s Fair Districts amendments, enacted by voters. One amendment specifically bars the state from drawing a district that diminishes the ability of racial minorities “to elect representatives of their choice.”
But in December, a state appeals court upheld the map DeSantis had advocated, saying the plaintiffs “failed to present any evidence” that the earlier version of the district – which connected Black communities from Jacksonville to Tallahassee – contained a singular cohesive community that would have a right to protection under Florida’s constitution.
The case still could land before the all-Republican state Supreme Court, where DeSantis appointees hold most seats.
A separate federal case – which argues that the map violates the US Constitution – is pending.
Observers say the outcome of the state litigation is more likely than the federal case to determine the future of the North Florida district, given the state constitution’s especially strong protections for the voting rights of racial minorities and the lower burden of proof required to establish that those rights were abridged.
The Kentucky Supreme Court  in December rejected arguments from Democrats that a map drawn by the state’s Republican-controlled legislature violated the state constitution as an “extreme partisan” gerrymander.
The dispute centered on lawmakers’ decision to move Kentucky’s capital city – Democratic-leaning Frankfort – out of the 6th Congressional District and into an oddly shaped – and solidly Republican – 1st District. Doing so helped shore up GOP odds of holding the 6th District, represented by Rep. Andy Barr.
The seat was among the more competitive ones in Kentucky under its previous lines. (Democrat Amy McGrath came within 3 points of beating Barr in 2018; last year, Barr won a sixth term under the new lines by 29 points.)
A lower-court judge had ruled that the Republican-drawn map did not violate the state’s constitution, and the state’s high court, in a December 14 ruling, agreed.
A redistricting case pending before the US Supreme Court centers on the future of a Charleston-area seat held by Republican Rep. Nancy Mace, who made headlines recently for joining House GOP hard-liners in voting to remove Kevin McCarthy as speaker.
Earlier this year, a three-judge panel concluded that lines for the coastal 1st Congressional District, as drawn by state GOP lawmakers, amounted to an unconstitutional racial gerrymander.
The Republican lawmakers appealed to the US Supreme Court. During oral arguments, several justices in the court’s conservative majority expressed skepticism that South Carolina officials had engaged in an improper racial gerrymander and seemed inclined to reinstate the lawmakers’ map.
Republicans in New Mexico say the congressional lines drawn by the Democrats who control state government amount to an illegal gerrymander under the state’s constitution.
At stake: a swing district along the US border with Mexico. If Republicans prevail, the 2nd District seat – now held by a Democratic Rep. Gabe Vasquez – could become more favorable to Republicans.
A state judge in October upheld the map drawn by Democrats, and the New Mexico Supreme Court recently affirmed that ruling.
New Mexico GOP Chairman Steve Pearce, who represented an earlier version of the seat in Congress, said the party was “contemplating our next course of action in conference with our legal team.”
The state Supreme Court, in a case it heard in July, is considering whether it even has the authority to weigh in on map-drawing decisions by the GOP-controlled state legislature.
Republican state officials argue that the court’s power over redistricting decisions is limited.
Advocacy groups and a handful of voters are challenging a congressional map that further carved up Democratic-leaning Salt Lake County between four decidedly Republican districts.
Doing so, the plaintiffs argued in their lawsuit, “takes a slice of Salt Lake County and grafts it onto large swaths of the rest of Utah,” allowing Republican voters in rural areas and smaller cities far away from Salt Lake to “dictate the outcome of elections.”
Redistricting fights over congressional maps are ongoing in several other states – ranging from Texas to Tennessee – but those cases might not be resolved in time to affect next year’s elections.

The Delta Air Lines plane had been preparing to fly to Bogotá, Colombia, on January 20 when the “nose wheel came off and rolled down the hill,” according to a preliminary report from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
Passengers were able to disembark the plane after the incident, which occurred at around 11:15 a.m., and were bused back to the terminal, the FAA has confirmed. No injuries were reported.
In LiveATC.net audio posted by VASAviation on Tuesday, an unidentified pilot can be heard alerting the pilot of the lost wheel via air traffic control.
“Delta 982 this is the aircraft looking at you. One of your nose tires just came off, it just rolled off the runway behind you,” the pilot says.
The Delta pilot then explains that they are working to get the plane tugged in.
Delta Air Lines has released a statement confirming the incident.
“Delta Flight 982 ATL/BOG was taxiing for departure when a nose gear tire came loose from the landing gear,” reads the statement.
“All customers and their bags were removed from the aircraft, transferred to the gate and onto a replacement aircraft.
“We apologize to our customers for the inconvenience.”"

Putin thanked Kim for an invitation to visit Pyongyang and pledged to go there “at an early date,” the report from the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said.
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the dates for Putin’s visit to North Korea were still being discussed through diplomatic channels and would be announced later, Russian state-run news agency TASS reported.
Last Tuesday, North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui met Putin and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow to discuss issues regarding the Korean Peninsula, Northeast Asia and international peace and security, according to TASS.
At that meeting the two sides expressed a “strong will to further strengthen strategic and tactical cooperation in defending the core interests of the two countries,” KCNA said.
A Putin visit to Pyongyang would reciprocate one Kim made last September, when the North Korean leader traveled in his armored train to Russia’s far eastern region, visiting a factory that produces fighter jets and a rocket-launch facility among other stops.
During that visit, Kim praised Russia for standing up to “hegemonic forces” with its war in Ukraine, while Putin signaled a willingness to assist North Korea in developing its space and satellite programs.
Signs of increasing Russian-North Korean cooperation have been seen in Ukraine.
According to the US Defense Department, Russia has twice in the past month fired North Korean-made missiles at targets in Ukraine. And South Korean intelligence has reported that Pyongyang has supplied Moscow with more than 1 million artillery shells that could be used in the invasion of Ukraine.

Meanwhile, Western analysts say Russia could be a source of technology and expertise for Kim as he refines a nuclear-capable missile program that could threaten not only his neighbors in East Asia, but possibly the mainland United States with intercontinental ballistic missiles.
Kim has been drawing an increasingly harder line against South Korea in recent weeks, saying the North will no longer seek reconciliation and reunification with the South and instructing the country’s army, munitions industry, nuclear weapons and civil defense sectors to accelerate war preparations in response to “confrontation moves” by the US.
Last week, in a speech to a Supreme People’s Assembly (SPA) meeting in Pyongyang, Kim called the South the North’s “primary foe and invariable principal enemy” and said a reunification monument in the North Korean capital was an “eyesore” that should be demolished."
AYGZ6W0SFL_QOFEN4CTE55L13M,Fire kills at least 39 in southeast China in second deadly blaze involving students in a week,"By Nectar Gan, CNN","2 minute read Updated 10:16 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/24/china/china-fire-xinyu-jiangxi-intl/,"A fire broke out at a mixed-use building in southeastern China Wednesday, killing at least 39 people and injuring nine others in the second deadly blaze involving students in a week, state media reported.
The fire started in the basement of the street-front building in Xinyu city, Jiangxi province, and quickly spread to stores on the ground floor and a tutoring center and guesthouse on the second floor.
Most of the victims trapped by flames and thick billowing smoke were college students taking classes at the center and people staying at the guesthouse, Xinhua said.
A preliminary investigation found the blaze was caused during an improper renovation of a cold storage facility in the basement, state-run news agency Xinhua reported. Twelve people have been detained, the agency said.
The tragedy came days after another fire broke out in the dormitory of a boarding school in the central province of Henan late on Friday night, killing 13 children in third grade. Authorities have not disclosed the cause of that blaze.
Footage of the latest fire circulating on Chinese social media shows people jumping out of the second-floor window and landing on a mattress laid on the street with the help of police.
Others are seen climbing down a ladder around the corner of the building as thick black smoke billows out from the building and engulfs the sky above the street.
“There was too much smoke, and people (on the second floor) might not know where the fire was burning. They might have thought the staircase was in flames and didn’t dare to run there,” a man who escaped from an internet cafe on the ground floor told the state-run Beijing Daily.
Another witness told Cover News, a state-owned media outlet, that many students were at the tutoring center when the fire broke out.
“I saw most of those who made it out were students, about 19 or 20 years old. Some escaped on their own, and some were rescued by firefighters,” the witness was quoted as saying.
Chinese leader Xi Jinping issued a statement about the fire, noting it was yet another major safety tragedy to have occurred recently and calling for “deep reflections.”
Xi urged all government authorities to “learn lessons deeply,” “carefully investigate hidden risks and dangers” in production safety and “resolutely curb the frequent occurrence of various safety accidents to ensure the safety of people’s lives and property and overall social stability,” according to Xinhua.

AZLVOI7EOJ_10MUP0LKPZCRBI7,"Iran executes protester with mental health condition, judiciary says","By Adam Pourahmadi, CNN","3 minute read Updated 5:15 AM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/23/middleeast/iran-executes-protester-mental-health-intl-hnk/,"An Iranian protester with a mental health condition has been executed over the death of a local official during mass demonstrations that rocked the country in 2022, the Iranian judiciary’s news agency reported on Tuesday.
“The death sentence of Mohammad Ghobadlou for the crime of intentional murder of Farid Karampour Hassanvand was executed this morning after 487 days of judicial review of the case,” the Mizan news agency said.
Iranian authorities allege Ghobadlou ran over the official during a protest in Robat Karim, Tehran province, in September 2022, according to rights group Amnesty International.
He was sentenced to death by judge Abolqasem Salavati – who has been sanctioned by the United States for the notoriously harsh sentences he issued to activists, journalists and political prisoners, CNN previously reported.
Ghobadlou received two death sentences – one for “corruption on Earth,” issued by a Revolutionary Court and upheld by the Supreme Court, and one for murder, issued by a criminal court in Tehran province, according to Amnesty.
Mizan reported that the death sentence for “corruption on Earth” was suspended earlier this month until the intentional murder charge was investigated.
Ghobadlou’s lawyer Amir Raesian said he was not notified about a ruling regarding his client, and called on Mizan to release more information on the execution.
“If Mizan news agency is telling the truth, it should announce the number and date of issuance of this verdict,” Raesian said in a statement on X.

Amnesty has criticized the death sentences for following what it described as “grossly unfair sham trials, marred by torture-tainted ‘confessions’ and failure to order rigorous mental health assessments despite (Ghobadlou’s) mental disability.”
Ghobadlou had been under the supervision of a psychiatric hospital for bipolar disorder since the age of 15, Amnesty said. International law and standards prohibit using the death penalty against people with mental disabilities, according to the rights group.
Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam, the director of Norway-based Iranian human rights group Iran Human Rights (IHR), called Ghobadlou’s execution an “extrajudicial killing.”
On X, formerly Twitter, he wrote that “the Islamic Republic’s leader Ali Khamenei and his Judiciary must be held accountable for this crime. This execution must be met with strong international condemnations!”
At least eight protesters are known to have been executed in connection to nationwide demonstrations over the death of Mahsa Amini in September 2022.
Amini, a 22-year-old woman, died in the custody of Iran’s morality police after being arrested for allegedly not wearing her headscarf properly.
Protests spread like wildfire in the following weeks – which Iranian authorities responded to with brute force, mass arrests and hasty sham trials, drawing sharp global condemnation and sanctions from the US.
More than 300 people were killed in the months-long protests, including more than 40 children, the United Nations said. US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) placed the number of dead at more than 500, including 70 children. Thousands were arrested across the country, the UN said in a report last year, citing research from its Human Rights Committee."
B0PBLDPL49_P2OSCT1KKUOBB9T,The crisis at Kyte Baby might not have happened if the US had a mandated paid leave policy for new parents,"By Jeanne Sahadi, CNN","5 minute read Updated 11:50 AM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/23/success/paid-parental-leave-policies-kyte-baby,"The crisis that has enveloped clothing company Kyte Baby this week might not have happened if the United States had a national paid parental leave policy in place.
Company founder and CEO Ying Liu was forced to offer two public apologies after making, in her words, a “terrible decision” to deny an employee more work flexibility after her adopted newborn landed in neonatal intensive care.
The United States is the only developed economy among the 38 members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development not to provide national paid maternal leave and job protection, never mind paid paternal or parental leave.
Related article Kyte Baby under scrutiny for denying mom’s remote work request while newborn was in NICU, CEO walks back ‘terrible decision’
“Across the OECD, statutory rights to paid maternity leave are provided with an average length of 18.5 weeks as of April 2022, ranging from 43 weeks in Greece (the longest entitlement) to none in the United States — the only OECD member with no national provision of paid maternity leave,” the OECD states on its site.
What’s more, almost all OECD countries have paid leave programs around childbirth for mothers and fathers, whether they are birth parents, adoptive parents or same sex parents. Besides pay, the programs offer to protect one’s job while on leave around the time of childbirth and the first few months after, according to the OECD.
Looking more globally, “approximately 83% of countries guarantee at least 12 weeks of paid leave to parents who give birth,” according to the paid leave advocacy group FamilyValues@Work.
US-based employees, by contrast, have to figure out which, if any, options might be available to them from a complex, confusing patchwork of programs.
“Nobody knows what they have access to,” said paid leave expert Vicki Shabo, a fellow at the policy research think tank New America.
Nine US states and the District of Columbia currently have paid family leave laws on the books, and four more states have similar laws that will go into effect in the next couple of years, according to a New America report.

At the employer level, only 27% of US workers in the private sector have access to paid family leave through their job, up from 12% a decade ago, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. (Among state and local government workers, 28% have access to paid family leave today.)
In recent years, in a bid to boost talent attraction and retention, mostly larger employers have been expanding their paid family leave programs, not just for birth mothers but also fathers, working parents in same sex couples, and employees who adopt or foster a child.
Among companies with more than 500 employees, 75% now offer or plan to offer paid parental leave in 2024, up from 70% last year and from 46% in 2018, according to HR consulting firm Mercer. The median amount of paid time off is seven weeks, up from six in prior surveys Mercer has conducted.
And, according to a recent survey by HR consulting firm WTW, nearly 20% of the employers that currently offer paid leave for parents plan to make those leave policies more generous in the next two years.
At the national level, however, there is still not a federal program for paid leave, despite legislative efforts in recent years to pass one in Congress.
At present, the only federal mandate on the books is the three-decades-old Family and Medical Leave Act, which allows employees to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid but job-protected leave a year — not just for childbirth but for a range of needs, including dealing with one’s own or a family member’s illness or with caregiving needs when a family member is in the military and gets deployed.
Most people, of course, can’t afford to take much unpaid leave. But even if they could, due to its eligibility rules, the FMLA doesn’t cover a large swath of the workforce. In 2020, 44% of workers weren’t eligible for FMLA leave because they didn’t have sufficient tenure on the job, didn’t work enough hours and/or their work site was too small, according to the US Department of Labor. Given that the Kyte Baby employee in question had only worked at the company for “a little over 7 months,” the company wrote in an email to CNN, she likely would not have qualified for FMLA coverage.
In the wake of its troubles this weekend, Kyte Baby’s CEO told CNN the company will now expand its maternity leave policy, which currently only offers two to four weeks with pay depending on tenure.

And perhaps it may also follow in the footsteps of other employers when it comes workplace flexibility.
The initial video on TikTok that alerted the world to the Kyte Baby situation alleged that the new mother was “fired” after proposing she be allowed to work remotely. But the company told CNN that “[s]he did propose a remote option for her job, but given that her role was largely on-site, at that time, we did not feel that the proposed plan would fulfill the responsibilities of her current position. We told her we understood her situation and informed her that her job would be here if and when she opted to return. However, upon reflection, we should have taken more steps to accommodate her situation.”
One trend that workplace experts expect to see in 2024 is more employers coming up with different ways to provide equity in their workplace policies so employees whose jobs are not remote friendly can enjoy more flexibility on par with that of their desk-based colleagues — for instance, by providing them with four-day workweeks or more flexibility in scheduling their hours.
But as executives at Kyte Baby are no doubt learning the hard way, it is always better to proactively offer these types of new or expanded benefits before a very public crisis forces their hand and potentially threatens their brand.

The steps by the Harvard Medical School affiliate come after a molecular biologist published a blog post earlier this month alleging researchers falsified data by manipulating images.
More than 50 papers are part of the ongoing review by Dana-Farber into four researchers, all of whom have faculty appointments at Harvard Medical School. Four of the papers under review were authored by Dana-Farber CEO Laurie Glimcher.
“We are committed to a culture of accountability and integrity. Therefore, every inquiry is examined fully to ensure the soundness of the scientific literature,” Barrett Rollins, Dana-Farber’s research integrity officer and chief science officer emeritus, said in a statement to CNN on Monday. “Dana-Farber has been swift and decisive in this regard.”
Six manuscripts have retractions underway, 31 have been “identified as warranting corrections” and another one with a reported error “remains under examination,” according to Rollins.
Dana-Farber has not determined whether misconduct has occurred.
The retractions and corrections add to the pressure on Harvard following weeks of scrutiny over how the Ivy League school responded to allegations of plagiarism facing Claudine Gay, who stepped down as the university’s president earlier this month. Gay requested corrections to some of her writings due to what the university described as “inadequate citation.”
Harvard submitted a trove of documents to Congress late last week as part of an investigation from a House committee.
Earlier this month, Sholto David published a blog post titled “Dana-Farberications at Harvard University,” alleging researchers at the cancer institute manipulated images and data. David suggested Adobe Photoshop was used to copy and paste images in some of the papers.
According to Rollins, Dana-Farber said it was already reviewing “potential data errors” in multiple cases that the blog listed and stressed that the issues uncovered do not necessarily amount to misconduct.
“The presence of image discrepancies in a paper is not evidence of an author’s intent to deceive,” Rollins said in the statement. “That conclusion can only be drawn after a careful, fact-based examination which is an integral part of our response. Our experience is that errors are often unintentional and do not rise to the level of misconduct.”
Some allegations raised in the blog against Dana-Farber researchers are “wrong,” while others concern data generated in outside labs, Rollins said."
B2G42IMCY3_SXN0EX1OW2MTS5W,US secretly warned Iran before ISIS terror attack,"By Natasha Bertrand, CNN","2 minute read Updated 10:27 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/25/politics/us-warned-iran-isis-terror-attack/,"The US secretly warned Iran that ISIS was planning a potential terror attack inside Iran’s borders before the group carried out a deadly attack near the burial site of slain military commander Qasem Soleimani on January 3, according to a US official.
The private warning was based on intelligence the US had obtained about ISIS’ plans and was given to Iran based on the US government’s “duty to warn” policy, the official said. That policy applies even to US adversaries.
The private warning, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, is notable not only because Iran is not a US partner or ally, but also because officials say Iran is behind a recent uptick in attacks by its proxy militias against US personnel in the Middle East. It is not clear through what channels the US delivered the message to Iran given that the countries have no formal diplomatic relations.
“Prior to ISIS’ terrorist attack on January 3, 2024, in Kerman, Iran, the US government provided Iran with a private warning that there was a terrorist threat within Iranian borders,” the official said. “The US government followed a longstanding ‘duty to warn’ policy that has been implemented across administrations to warn governments against potential lethal threats. We provide these warnings in part because we do not want to see innocent lives lost in terror attacks.”
The Iranian government was ultimately unable to stop the ISIS attack, which was the deadliest in Iran since its 1979 revolution. At least 84 people were killed and 284 injured in the blasts on January 3, which hit near Soleimani’s burial site in southern Iran. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack one day later.
CNN has reached out to the Iranian mission to the UN for comment.
According to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, any intelligence community entity that collects or acquires “credible and specific information indicating an impending threat of intentional killing, serious bodily injury, or kidnapping directed at a person or group of people…shall have a duty to warn the intended victim or those responsible for protecting the intended victim, as appropriate.” An intended victim includes both US persons and non-US persons, the policy says."

Nikki Haley doesn’t defeat former President Donald Trump in New Hampshire’s primary on Tuesday, the fight may be over.
With Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis exiting the race Sunday, Haley now has the one-on-one shot at Trump that eluded his rivals in the 2016 GOP primary.
And it’s up to Republican primary voters in the Granite State — where Trump’s big win eight years ago began his road to dominance of a party he has since reshaped in his image — to decide whether they’ll stick with the former president for a third consecutive election.
New Hampshire, where independents play an outsize role in the GOP primary and where the popular governor, Chris Sununu, has been her top campaign surrogate, could be Haley’s only shot at delivering a political earthquake in the Republican race.
Another big Trump win, though, might effectively end the Republican primary after only two states, and tee up a general election rematch between Trump and President Joe Biden.
Here are six things to watch in the New Hampshire primary:
Haley’s campaign has for months focused on New Hampshire, identifying its more moderate electorate as her best shot of winning one of the four states — Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina — that kick off the GOP’s presidential nominating contest.
That’s fueled in part by the state allowing “undeclared” voters — those without a party affiliation — to vote in primaries. Undeclared voters make up a plurality of New Hampshire’s overall electorate.

For Haley, polls — including national and early-state surveys and CNN’s entrance poll in Iowa — have long found that she appeals most to moderates and Republicans eager to move on from Trump.
She’s also been helped by the endorsement of Sununu, himself one of the most prominent anti-Trump voices within the Republican Party. (A home-state gubernatorial endorsement has its limits: DeSantis had the support of Iowa’s Kim Reynolds and still flopped.)
Sununu, in an NBC News interview Sunday, sought to tamp down expectations for a Haley win, arguing that it won’t be critical for Haley to win primary contests until the slate of Super Tuesday primaries in early March.
“I’ve always said you wanted a one-on-one race going into Super Tuesday,” he said. “I think Super Tuesday is probably where you actually have to start winning states.”
Haley said Sunday she would “absolutely” remain in the Republican presidential race through South Carolina’s February 24 primary.
“South Carolinians know I won that state twice. They know I’m a fighter. They know I’m gonna go all the way through,” she said. “I’m also an accountant. So we saved a lot of our dollars to make sure we could be strong in South Carolina.”
Her campaign on Sunday announced plans for its first event in South Carolina after New Hampshire’s primary — a Wednesday evening gathering in North Charleston.
However, presidential candidates rarely admit that the end is near. DeSantis, after all, said he was in the GOP race for the “long haul” a week ago.

If Trump wins, he would make history: In modern presidential campaign history — since the Iowa caucuses began serving as the official kickoff, followed by the New Hampshire primary — no non-incumbent Republican has won both states.
And in doing so, he would make it much tougher for Haley to convince donors to pour money into her campaign and voters to stick with her for the month until the South Carolina primary. She’ll miss her only shot at another win before then because Haley filed to run in Nevada’s state-run primary, instead of competing in the state GOP-run caucuses. Delegates are awarded through the Nevada caucuses.
Some in the party are already eager to see the nominating race reach its end eight days after it started.
Montana Sen. Steve Daines, the chairman of the Senate GOP campaign arm, said Sunday on social media: “Donald Trump is the presumptive nominee. I am encouraging every Republican to unite behind him because it will take all of us to defeat Joe Biden, take back the Senate, and hold the House.”
Recent departures from the 2024 race have already shaped the New Hampshire Republican primary.
The exit of former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who consistently polled in the low double digits in the Granite State, likely benefited Haley, who has similarly tapped into a segment of the electorate dissatisfied with Trump.
Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy’s exit, meanwhile, has likely boosted Trump, coming with an full-throated endorsement from the Ohio businessman on the night of the Iowa caucuses.

DeSantis’ exit Sunday was the latest to shake up the race. And while the Florida governor had little support in New Hampshire, even small movements can prove determinative if the race is much closer than polls suggest it will be.
Trump held 50% support among likely Republican primary voters in the Granite State, with Haley at 39% and DeSantis at 6%, according to a new CNN poll conducted by the University of New Hampshire that was released Sunday before DeSantis’ exit.
And when DeSantis’s supporters are reallocated to their second-choice candidates, Trump leads Haley by a wider 54% to 41% margin. Another 3% of likely GOP primary voters say they’d vote for someone else.
Trump on Sunday night noted his former rivals’ endorsements.
“Vivek just came with us and now Ron just came with us. They’re all coming with us,” Trump said at a campaign event in Rochester, New Hampshire.
Haley, who was Trump’s US ambassador to the United Nations, has in recent days escalated her attacks on her onetime boss — deploying against Trump the same tactic he has used against Biden.
In Derry, New Hampshire, on Sunday, Haley again mentioned Trump’s gaffe Friday night in which he appeared to confuse her with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
“Trump goes on and on multiple times, saying that I prevented the security on January 6 at the Capitol. I wasn’t even anywhere near the Capitol. … The reality is he was confused. He was confused the same way he said Joe Biden was going to start World War II,” she said, referring to another Trump verbal miscue from a September 2023 speech.

Haley also brought up Trump’s claim that he beat former President Barack Obama, not Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, in 2016.
“These things happen because the more you age, it just does — you have declined. Look at Joe Biden, he’s totally different now than he was two years ago. That’s a fact. It’s what happens,” Haley said.
She told CNN after a stop in Seabrook, New Hampshire, on Sunday that she sees Trump and Biden as “equally bad” options.
“If either one of them was good, I wouldn’t be running. Yes, they are equally bad. That’s why I’m running,” she said. “I don’t think we need to have two 80-year-olds sitting in the White House when we basically got to make sure that we can handle the war situation that we’re in. We need to know they’re at the top of their game.”
Tuesday’s result will test whether Haley’s approach — a line of attack no other Republican took against Trump in this election cycle — was effective.
Top Trump campaign aides Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles sent reporters a memo Sunday saying that Haley must win New Hampshire’s primary — citing past comments from Haley and her supporters, including Sununu, predicting her victory.
LaCivita and Wiles said that if Haley does not win Tuesday, she has two options: Either she “drops out, unites behind President Trump, and commits to defeating Joe Biden,” or she “prepares to be absolutely DEMOLISHED and EMBARASSED in her home state of South Carolina.”
“Choose wisely,” they said.
Should Haley lose, how she handles her election night remarks and  any next moves she announces are going to be closely monitored.  Does she see Trump as the all-but-certain nominee?  Does she have her eyes already on 2028, when Trump would either be a second-term incumbent ineligible to run for office again or an 82-year-old who’d have lost two consecutive general elections?
For her part, Haley insisted Monday on Fox News that she’ll continue in the race, no matter the outcome of the New Hampshire primary.
“I know the political class wants to say that this race is over, and I know that the political class is saying everybody has to get behind Trump. This is not a coronation,” Haley said, when asked about her viability in the race. “A democracy is about giving people options.”
“We’re going to go on into South Carolina, and we’re going to be strong,” she said.
The Democrats will also be holding a primary on Tuesday – or, more accurately, the state of New Hampshire will conduct a vote that the national Democratic Party, because it changed its primary calendar to make South Carolina the first official contest, has said will not count toward its nomination process. The winner here will not receive any delegates.

For that reason, along with the fact that he spearheaded the move to change the order of the early primaries, Biden will not appear on the ballot. The Democratic National Committee has called the vote “meaningless” and has urged presidential candidates to “take all steps possible not to participate.” (Most ignored this warning and some familiar names, like author Marianne Williamson and Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips, are on the ballot. Neither are expected to fare well.)
And yet, the Biden camp will surely be watching how the president performs as a write-in candidate. Biden allies launched a low-profile effort to get Democrats to come to the polls to put pen to paper in support of him. But how many voters will bother?
Polls suggest Democratic enthusiasm for Biden is modest, at best, but a strong turnout for the president – with voters having the added onus of needing to write him in – could inject some new confidence into his reelection operation. On the flip side, a meager showing could confirm the intraparty worries."
B35H9OZGSS_8UO8FT58LXYZAEA,"In-N-Out has never closed a location, until now. It cites crime as the problem","By Jordan Valinsky, CNN","3 minute read Updated 6:49 AM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/23/food/in-n-out-oakland-closure-crime/,"In-N-Out is permanently closing one of its restaurants for the first time ever, announcing that its Oakland location will soon shutter because of rampant crime in the California city.
The burger chain said in a statement that “despite taking repeated steps to create safer conditions, our customers and associates are regularly victimized by car break-ins, property damage, theft, and armed robberies.”
The location, which has been open for nearly two decades, will close on March 24. It’s the city’s only In-N-Out and is near the airport.
Crime has indeed substantially increased in Oakland: Burglaries were up 23% and motor vehicle thefts were up 44% in 2023 compared to a year prior, according to Oakland Police Department data obtained by CNN affiliate KGO-TV.
In-N-Out said in a statement that while “several” of its locations have relocated in its 75-year history, the Oakland closure is the first restaurant it has closed.
“We feel the frequency and severity of the crimes being encountered by our customers and associates leave us no alternative,” said Chief Operating Officer Denny Warnick, in the statement.
Notably, Warnick said its Oakland location was “busy and profitable,” but it can’t ask its customers or employees to “visit or work in an unsafe environment.” Affected employees, which amount to about 100, will transfer to a nearby restaurant in San Francisco or receive severance.

A diner told CNN affiliate KPIX-TV that someone broke into their car recently while they were eating inside the In-N-Out location. “They were trying to steal my vehicle, but I had a kill switch on. So they couldn’t get my vehicle, but they took all my belongings out,” the diner said.
An In-N-Out employee also told the station they’ve seen armed robberies at the restaurant’s parking lot.
Councilwoman Treva Reid said she’s been asking Oakland’s mayor’s office for more police in the area but hasn’t received the support. “We’re in a state of emergency. Should it have to take a declaration to deliver (services) when we’re living this? My district has been in crisis,” she told KPIX-TV.
In-N-Out is a privately held company with roughly 400 locations around the United States, mostly on the west coast. It made national headlines last year when it banned its employees in five states from wearing masks as part of new company guidelines that “emphasize the importance of customer service,” notably showing their smiles.
In 2021, its locations in Contra Costa county (also near Oakland) temporarily closed because it didn’t want to verify customers’ vaccination status, which was required during that time for indoor dining.
Starbucks, Target and other stores have closed in Oakland and other cities recently over concerns about crime.
Target said in September that it was closing nine stores in major cities across four states, claiming theft and organized retail crime have made the environment unsafe for staff and customers – and unsustainable for business.
Crime rates vary from city to city, however. Nationally, violent crime fell 8.2% in 2023 for the second straight year after a rise in 2021, according to the FBI.
But crime has increased in Oakland. Violent crime increased 21% in 2023 from the year prior, according to the Oakland Police Department."
B3HUIZ47J6_PUFDPUZ1O0LVMT1,Turkish parliament approves Sweden’s NATO membership bid,"By Isil Sariyuce, Jessie Gretener, and Kristin Wilson, CNN","3 minute read Updated 9:48 AM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/23/europe/turkey-vote-sweden-nato-intl/,"The Turkish parliament voted Tuesday to approve Sweden’s NATO membership bid, bringing the Nordic country one step closer to joining the military alliance after months of delays.
Of the 346 members of parliament who voted, 287 were in favor of Sweden’s accession and 55 voted to reject it. Four others abstained from voting.
The vote was the second step of Turkey’s ratification process after the parliament’s Foreign Affairs Commission approved the bid last month. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan can now sign the protocol into law.
The outcome on Tuesday cleared a significant hurdle for the Nordic country’s accession into the military alliance, with Hungary now set to be the only member state that has not yet ratified Sweden’s accession.
But Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban on Wednesday told NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg that Hungary’s government supports Sweden’s bid for accession.
“I reaffirmed that the Hungarian government supports the NATO membership of Sweden,” Orban wrote on X. Stoltenberg also posted on X, saying he welcomed Orban’s “clear support” for Sweden’s membership bid.
On Tuesday, Orban said he had invited his Swedish counterpart Ulf Kristersson to visit Hungary to negotiate the terms of Sweden’s accession.
Sweden and Finland applied for NATO membership in May 2022 following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine earlier that year. Finland joined NATO in April 2023, doubling the alliance’s border with Russia, but Sweden has faced numerous delays in its path to accession.

Erdogan initially objected to Sweden’s membership bid, accusing Swedish officials of being too lenient on militant groups, including the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK). Since applying, Sweden has tightened its anti-terror legislation and agreed to work more closely with Turkey on security concerns.
Erdogan’s approval of Sweden’s accession bid also rides on a commitment by the United States, with the Turkish president signaling that he won’t sign the protocol into law unless the US approves the sale of F-16 fighter jets to Turkey.
US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chair Ben Cardin said on Tuesday that Congress, however, is waiting to see the accession documents completed before moving forward on the matter.
Following Tuesday’s Turkish parliamentary vote, Swedish Prime Minister Kristersson said Sweden was “one step closer to becoming a full member of NATO.”
The US Ambassador to Turkey Jeffry Flake reiterated the sentiment in a post on X, saying “Sweden’s accession to NATO is a critical step in strengthening the alliance” and that he “greatly appreciate the Turkish’s parliament’s decision to approve Sweden’s entry into NATO.”
The German government welcomed the outcome of the Turkish parliamentary vote. The federal government spokesperson Steffen Hebestreit said in a statement that Finland’s accession last April and Sweden’s “forthcoming accession” were a “direct reaction to the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine.”

B85FFT91PJ_U8TVLXES5162N01,Ancient DNA offers new evidence in long-standing syphilis theory,"By Katie Hunt, CNN","6 minute read Updated 5:25 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/24/world/syphilis-bacteria-origins-scn/,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.
The English, Germans and Italians called it the French disease. Polish people dubbed it the German disease, while Russians blamed it on Poles. In France, it was named the “Neapolitan disease” after the French army got infected during its invasion of Naples, Italy, in the first documented syphilis epidemic.
The origins of syphilis — a sexually transmitted infection that devastated 15th century Europe and is still prevalent today — have remained murky, difficult to study and the subject of some debate.
One long-standing theory is that the disease emerged in the Americas and migrated to Europe after the expeditions led by Christopher Columbus returned from the New World, but a new study suggests the true story is more complicated.
Genetic information about ancient pathogens can be preserved in bones, dental plaque, mummified bodies and historical medical specimens, extracted and studied — a field known as paleopathology.
Research published Wednesday in the journal Nature used paleopathology techniques on 2,000-year-old bones unearthed in Brazil in an attempt to shed more light on when and where syphilis originated. The study resulted in scientists recovering the earliest known genomic evidence of Treponema pallidum, the bacterium that causes syphilis and two other related diseases, which is reliably dated to long before the first trans-Atlantic contacts.
“This study is incredibly exciting because it is the first truly ancient treponemal DNA that has been recovered from archaeological human remains that are more than a few hundred years old,” said Brenda J. Baker, a professor of anthropology at Arizona State University, who wasn’t involved with the study.
Without treatment, syphilis can cause physical disfigurement, blindness and mental impairment. As a sexually transmitted disease, it has long carried a stigma — hence the past attempts by different populations to blame outbreaks on neighboring groups or countries.
It’s particularly complex to study both the disease and the pathogen responsible for it, said Molly Zuckerman, a professor and codirector of the Bioarchaeology Laboratories, New and Old World, at Mississippi State University, who wasn’t involved in the research.
“It was only in 2017 that researchers were able to culture T. p pallidum for the first time, even though we’ve known it’s the cause of syphilis for over one hundred years,” Zuckerman said in an email. “It’s still costly and cumbersome to study in the lab. There are many reasons that, despite our best efforts, it’s one of the least well understood common bacterial infections.”
The timing and sudden onset of the first documented syphilis epidemic in the late 15th century is what led many historians to conclude that it arrived in Europe after the Columbus expeditions. Others believe T. pallidum bacteria always had a global distribution but perhaps grew in virulence after initially manifesting as a mild disease.
“It is very clear that Europeans took a number of diseases (including smallpox) to the New World, decimating the native populations, so the hypothesis that the New World ‘gave syphilis to Europe’ was attractive to some,” noted Sheila A. Lukehart, professor emeritus in the department of medicine, infectious disease and global health at the University of Washington, who didn’t take part in the study.
Gene that protected humans 5,000 years ago may be linked to debilitating modern disease
Syphilis is closely related but distinct from two other subspecies or lineages of treponemal disease, nonsexually transmitted illnesses that have similar symptoms that are known as bejel and yaws and were also a focus of the new research.
The team behind the new study examined 99 bones from the archaeological site known as Jabuticabeira II from the Laguna region of Santa Catarina on the Brazilian coast. Some bones had marks characteristic of infection with T. pallidum — the bacteria effectively eat away at bones, leaving concave lesions.
Bone samples from four people yielded sufficient genetic data for the team to analyze, with one producing what study author Verena Schünemann, an assistant professor at the University of Zurich’s Institute of Evolutionary Medicine, described as a high-coverage genome, detailed enough for fine-grained analysis.
The analysis revealed that the pathogen responsible for the lesions was most closely related to the modern subspecies of T. pallidium that causes bejel, a disease found today in arid regions of Africa and the Middle East that has similar symptoms to syphilis.
The finding adds strength to previous suggestions that civilizations in the Americas experienced treponemal infections in pre-Columbian times, and that treponemal disease was already present in the New World at least 500 years before Columbus set sail.
Schünemann said the new findings do not mean the venereal syphilis that caused the 15th century epidemic came to Europe from the Americas at the time of Columbus. A similar study conducted previously by her team found T. pallidum bacteria in human remains in Finland, Estonia and the Netherlands from the early modern period (early 1400s onward), suggesting that some forms of treponemal disease, if not syphilis, were already in circulation on the continent at the time of Columbus’ expeditions to the New World.
What’s more, the genome recovered from the Brazilian sample provided a bacterial family tree going back thousands of years, suggesting that T. pallidum bacteria first evolved to infect humans as far back as 12,000 years ago. It was possible, Schünemann said, that the bacteria could have been brought to the Americas by its first inhabitants who crossed into the continent from Asia.
“I think that the story is way more complex than the Columbian hypothesis could have ever imagined,” she said.
Superbug crisis threatens to kill 10 million per year by 2050. Scientists may have a solution
Mathew Beale, a senior scientist in bacterial evolutionary genomics at the Wellcome Sanger Institute near Cambridge, England, agreed with Schünemann’s assessment, saying in an email that the study did not “prove or disprove the central tenet of the Columbian hypothesis itself — that Columbus’s voyage led to the importation of Treponema and led to the outbreaks of the 1500s and then to modern day syphilis.”
“This is mainly because the bacteria sequenced is not a direct ancestor of the strain that causes modern syphilis. … (I)t is a sister species. This could mean the various treponematoses were already very widely spread around the world, and could even predate the ancient migration and population of the Americas,” said Beale, who wasn’t involved in the research.
“It could alternatively mean that lots of different treponematoses were present in the New World, and one of those, only distantly related to the ancient genomes from this paper, was indeed imported by Columbus and his peers,” he added.
Further research on ancient genomes from across the world might be able to solve the mystery, illuminating which subspecies of the bacteria were present in Europe and the New World before the voyages of Columbus, according to Lukehart.
“The bigger scientific question now is not about syphilis, but is about the distribution of the three subspecies around the globe, particularly in pre-Columbian samples,” Lukehart said.
“The modern tools available for extracting DNA from ancient samples, for enriching the treponemal DNA, and obtaining deep sequencing from samples has rapidly increased our understanding of the Treponema.”"
B88LM9ESV1_S3PLZ7E0STUTH32,"Venmo and other payment app theft is ‘skyrocketing,’ Manhattan DA warns","By Mark Morales, CNN","4 minute read Updated 7:26 PM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/23/business/venmo-payment-app-theft/,"Venmo, Cash App, PayPal, Zelle and other payment apps may be convenient ways to send cash with a few taps of your smartphone, but they’re a breeding grounds for theft, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg tells CNN.
Culprits range from savvy swindlers, who trick their way into victims’ locked cell phones, to violent offenders who either drug their targets and then take advantage or bark out commands while threatening physical harm, Bragg said in an interview.
The issue has gotten so out of hand in New York that Bragg has sent a letter to the popular apps demanding that they put in more security measures, including lower transfer limits, additional password security, additional wait times for large transactions and increased monitoring for unusual activity.
In the letter, Bragg cited a 2022 letter from Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s office that was sent to the banking industry where they said fraud claims had tripled between 2020 and 2022, costing consumers hundreds of millions of dollars. The investigation centered around Zelle and indicated not only was fraud rampant, but was getting worse. And banks have often been unwilling to make customers whole, even if they were victims of fraud.
As a solution, Bragg asked for more safety measures, such as lowering the limit of daily transfers, requiring wait times on larger transfers, and for a confirmation when suspicious transfers occur. Even something as small as canceling a transaction would help, Bragg said
“A failure to take proactive steps in the name of your consumers will lead to further illegal behavior and countless unsuspecting victims,” Bragg wrote in the letter.
Venmo and its parent company PayPal said they take safety and security seriously.
“In addition to proactively leveraging sophisticated fraud detection tools, manual investigations, and partnering closely with law enforcement agencies to protect our customers against common scams, we have several options in place to enable enhanced layers of security and protection directly within our apps,” a PayPal spokesperson said in a statement.
In a statement, Zelle said it was “aware of isolated criminal incidents described in the Manhattan District Attorney’s letter.”
“Providing a safe and reliable service to consumers is the top priority of Early Warning Services, LLC, the network operator of Zelle, and our 2,100 participating banks and credit unions,” the company said. “As a result of our continued efforts to build on Zelle’s strong foundation of security, less than one tenth of one percent of transactions are reported as fraud or scams, and that percentage keeps getting smaller.”
CashApp did not respond to requests for comment.
Consumers should be protected by fraudulent electronic fund transfers, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
But they often are not covered, Warren’s office found in its investigation, despite regulations that are designed to cover unauthorized access to customers’ accounts. The bank data reviewed by Warren’s office suggest the bulk of unauthorized cases are going unpaid.
Bragg says he’s seen so many instances of criminals using payment apps as a crime of opportunity.
This past year, one man was arrested several times after targeting drunk victims in the early morning hours, either asking to borrow their phone or outright snatching it, prosecutors said.
In one instance in 2022, the alleged thief grabbed his victim’s phone and slashed them on the ear, shoulder and forearm with what appeared to be a knife when the victim tried to get it back, according to court records in Manhattan. When he was asked by a detective why he kept robbing people like this, he replied “because it’s easy,” records show.
In another instance, a team of thieves worked together to steal roughly $6,500 from as many as 50 Lyft drivers in 2020, court records show. The passenger would ask to put in a new address into the Lyft driver’s phone and once inside, they would transfer the in-app earnings to their own bank accounts using Cash App, the records show.
Last January, two men were charged after one held a gun to the victim’s chest and the other held a knife to the same victim’s throat, demanding their unlocked mobile device, court records show. Once in custody, investigators found that the pair has sent themselves $1,749 using Cash App, the records show.
These offenses aren’t just happening in New York. Other major cities are seeing this trend increase as well.
In Los Angeles, a 23-year-old man pleaded guilty to charges stemming from a scheme where he met other men from a dating app and then used their phones to send himself money, federal prosecutors said.
In Boston, a man who thought he was meeting up for an online date was forced to unlock his phone at knifepoint when masked robbers ordered him to Vemno them $1,000, according to local prosecutors.
Bragg said his team has been trying to get the word out in recent years and have heard from victims who never came forward during outreach campaigns about cash app thefts.
“It’s sobering and disconcerting,” Bragg said. “Preventing this is what we need to be focused on as well and that’s what this initiative is all about.”"

Early detection is key to saving lives,"By Nicquel Terry Ellis, CNN","4 minute read Published 7:15 AM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/26/us/black-men-prostate-cancer-risks-reaj/,"Nate Battle said he had avoided doctor’s visits for most of his life until 2014, when his insurance company began incentivizing preventive health screenings.
Battle, who is Black and was 49 at the time, said he made an appointment, thinking it would be routine and harmless. But the results from a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test led to a series of other procedures that ultimately revealed Battle had aggressive prostate cancer.
Battle told CNN that he was able to have his prostate removed and that he’s thankful the cancer was caught early.
“At my follow-up appointment the doctor said, ‘You had another six months before things were going to get really bad for you,’” Battle recalled. “That was really scary to hear.”
One in six Black men will develop prostate cancer in their lifetime, according to the advocacy organization ZERO Prostate Cancer. Research from the American Cancer Society shows Black men are more than twice as likely to die from the disease than their White counterparts.

The stark racial disparity has spurred health advocates like Battle to sound the alarm and urge Black men to consider getting prostate cancer screenings.
The rate of prostate cancer among Black men has been underscored in recent weeks as Dexter King, the youngest son of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., died after a battle with prostate cancer. And in December, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin underwent a prostatectomy to treat prostate cancer that was discovered that same month.
Doctors and health advocates suggest the disparity in deaths results from a lack of access to quality health care in many Black communities, mistrust and avoidance of the health care system, and the stigma surrounding the disease, which oftentimes means Black men aren’t discussing their diagnosis with other people.
These factors can also be barriers to screening, doctors say.
According to the American Cancer Society, “having a father or brother with prostate cancer more than doubles a man’s risk of developing this disease,” but the disease is easier to treat when it’s diagnosed at an earlier stage.
Dr. Otis Brawley, professor of oncology and epidemiology at Johns Hopkins University, said the death rates among Black men are also higher because health care facilities in marginalized Black and brown communities often have doctors with less training and fewer resources for providing high-quality care. Low-income people, he added, are also less likely to seek health screenings because of the associated costs.
“If you take Black men and White men who are stage II and give them equal treatment, you end up with equal outcome and equal prognosis,” Brawley said. “If you remove the insurance issues, social issues, racism issues and give everybody equal quality of care, you end up with equal outcomes.”
Brawley said there is also a stigma surrounding the digital rectal examination, which requires that a health care provider insert a gloved finger into a man’s rectum to feel the prostate for abnormalities.
Brawley said many of his Black patients have refused to go through with that procedure.
In 2021, Brawley was part of a team at Johns Hopkins that launched the Schaufeld Program for Prostate Cancer in Black Men, which travels to barbershops in the Baltimore and Washington, D.C. areas, to raise awareness about prostate cancer and screening in Black communities.
“A lot of men in their 30s and 40s don’t even know what the prostate is, or where it is,” Brawley said. “We want them to know [screening] is available, and we want them to understand that we are respecting their choice.”

Courtney Bugler, president and CEO of ZERO Prostate Cancer, said she has spoken with some Black men who had no idea they had a family history of prostate cancer because no one ever discussed it.
“What we find is, because men are not always interacting with their health care providers in a regular fashion and because they don’t realize they are at risk for the disease, they don’t know to be more vigilant,” she said.
ZERO Prostate Cancer has spent more than two decades working to raise awareness of the disease. Bugler said the organization is also lobbying Congress to pass the PSA Screening for High Risk Insured Men Act.  The measure would require health insurance companies to offer prostate-specific antigen screenings for Black men or men between ages 55 and 69 who have a family history of prostate cancer without co-pays, deductibles or co-insurance.
Bugler said ZERO Prostate Cancer recommends that Black men start talking to their doctors about the risks and benefits of prostate cancer screening at the age of 40. She also encourages them to share their stories of survival with one another.
Although Battle knew that there were men in his family with the disease, he said he still refused to go to the doctor for years. He blames toxic masculinity and stubbornness, which he said can also play a role in preventing Black men from getting screened for prostate cancer.
“It’s ingrained in us that we are supposed to be strong,” Battle said.
But this mindset is only contributing to the high prostate cancer death rates in the Black community, Battle said.
“It’s about putting your pride aside,” Battle said. “And asking yourself, is your pride more important than your life?”"
BA6S2D8QH9_X56NJ9A4NI5QVDS,"CIA director expected to meet with Israeli, Egyptian and Qatari negotiators to push for hostage deal","By Kevin Liptak, CNN","2 minute read Updated 1:57 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/25/politics/cia-director-israel-hamas-hostages/,"CIA Director Bill Burns is expected to meet in the coming days with Israel and Egypt’s intelligence chiefs and the Qatari prime minister to discuss a deal to secure the release of remaining hostages held by Hamas, according to a US official familiar with the plans.
The meetings with Mossad director David Barnea, Egyptian intelligence director Abbas Kamel and Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani will come amid intensive discussions on the parameters of a new deal that would pair hostages’ release with a cessation in the fighting in Gaza.
The meetings are expected to occur in Europe, the official said. The CIA declined to comment.
Another top American official, White House Middle East coordinator Brett McGurk, has been in the Middle East this week to continue discussions on the release of hostages. McGurk has visited Cairo and Doha for the talks.
Egypt and Qatar have acted as key players in brokering with Hamas, including securing a temporary pause and hostage release in November.
The White House, which declined to confirm Burns’ meetings, said Thursday that ongoing hostage talks were “sober and serious.”
The Washington Post first reported Burns’ plans.
Burns and McGurk’s discussions with regional players come amid tensions between Israel and Qatar over a leaked recording said to be of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticizing Qatar.
On the recording, which aired on Israeli television, a voice purportedly Netanyahu’s describes Qatar as “problematic.” The speaker also says he is “very mad at the Americans” for renewing a lease on their military base in Qatar without extracting a concession on hostages from the country. CNN cannot verify that the voice on the leaked recording belongs to Netanyahu.
Responding to the tape, Qatar said Netanyahu was undermining mediation efforts in the Israel-Hamas war.
The White House said it remains focused on securing a release of hostages, including in discussions with Israel and Qatar, after the leaked recording.
“I don’t think I’m gonna comment on leaked comments attributed to another foreign leader,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters aboard Air Force One.
He said efforts on striking a hostage deal — which have included Qatar as a mediator — would proceed apace.
“The Israeli people want their loved ones back, we want to make sure we get our American hostages back to their families where they belong,” Kirby said. “There is a lot of energy being put at this across the region, with our Israeli counterparts as well as our other counterparts, including the Qataris. And we’re just going to keep working at that.”"
BALF92ID5Z_LL12HSQ9WPSZTMA,The end of one key experiment in American democracy is at hand,"Analysis by Zachary B. Wolf, CNN","6 minute read Updated 6:34 PM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/22/politics/voting-experiment-primaries-what-matters/,"A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.
One of the more interesting long-term experiments in the American version of democracy is on the verge of ending, but not before inspiring change elsewhere in the country.
The experiment in Louisiana, which has been ongoing in various iterations for most of the past 50 years, is this: Rather than a traditional party primary system in line with the one Americans use in presidential elections, for nonpresidential offices, Louisiana has given every voter the option of every candidate, regardless of party. If no candidate gets a simple majority, the top two candidates take part in a runoff.
For presidential primaries, on the other hand, Louisiana is among the states that closes its primary off to independent voters.
Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, a Republican, has pushed to replace the unique open primary system used for most elections with a closed primary system open only to party members, arguing that it is a matter of fairness to political parties and complaining that Louisiana lawmakers may not have their elections determined until December.
Unwilling to go as far as the full-on closed primary system pushed by Landry, legislators have instead agreed to scale back the open primary system for congressional and some other races. The open primaries will remain for statewide races, including governor.
Other states, including California and Washington, have followed Louisiana’s lead and adopted their own versions of the system. In California, for instance, it’s now commonplace to see two Democrats emerge from an open primary to square off on Election Day.
Changing the system could have a real effect in Louisiana, where the open primary system has verifiably led to less extreme lawmakers, according to Christian Grose, a political science professor at the University of Southern California who has studied the effect of open primaries.
Grose looked at voting records in Congress for states with completely open primaries and compared them with states that still conduct closed primaries and found the states with open primaries produced more moderate lawmakers.
It is not guaranteed that voters will choose a more moderate candidate, but it is a more likely possibility, Grose told me in an email, arguing open systems provide “an opportunity to elect candidates who are less extreme. In closed systems, this rarely happens.”
There are those that argue the opposite, that party leaders have essentially lost control of the primary process, which has led to more extreme candidates.
Republican Party leaders tried and failed to derail Donald Trump’s candidacy in 2016. Now he has essentially remade the party around himself.
Plus, most states, to varying degrees, have opened their primaries to independent voters, even if they do not have a fully open, nonpartisan primary system like Louisiana or California.
Grose noted that Louisiana’s senators are both Republican, but one of them, Bill Cassidy, voted to remove Trump from office after the January 6, 2021, insurrection and the other, John Kennedy, did not.
Cassidy was actually only one of seven Republican senators to vote to remove Trump from office during his second impeachment trial.
Of those seven, three have since left office. Another, Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, has said he will not run for reelection. The remaining three, Cassidy, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, are all from states that do not have traditional partisan primaries.
Murkowski was reelected to a fourth term in Alaska’s new ranked-choice voting system in 2022. In that system, voters pick a first-, second- and even third-choice candidate. If no candidate gets to 50%, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated and voters who ranked that candidate first will have their vote counted for whoever was their next choice.
That’s the same system by which Alaska elected Mary Peltola as its first Democratic member of Congress in decades (and she made history as the first Alaska Native in Congress). And yet, while Peltola is a Democrat, she has worked with Republicans in the state.
Alaska’s legislature, however, is in the process of trying to undo the ranked-choice system, which was narrowly approved by voters in a 2020 ballot initiative.
Ranked-choice voting is also the system by which New Yorkers picked the Democrat Eric Adams as their mayor.
That’s what happened in Maine in 2016 and Alaska in 2020. Voters in Nevada approved a ranked-choice system once already but must do so again in 2024 for it to take effect.
Meanwhile in Arizona, where Republicans suffered in 2022 by picking more extreme candidates in partisan primaries, there’s an effort to put ranked-choice voting on the ballot in 2024.
The partisan primary system in the US has been cited as one driver of growing partisanship in the US. That’s on display at the national level as Trump consolidates his control over the Republican Party with a message of “retribution” against his opponents if he’s able to win the White House again in 2024.
Adding the voices of independent voters into the primary system is something Trump has been complaining about in New Hampshire.
After Trump romped in Iowa’s caucuses, New Hampshire’s primary could represent the last real chance for former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley to put Trump’s third straight Republican nomination in question.

Primaries continue until June, but Haley is now Trump’s only remaining major Republican opponent, and New Hampshire, where most voters are not registered with either political party, represents a unique opportunity for her.
Trump told supporters at a rally in New Hampshire Sunday that the inclusion of non-Republicans in the primary is equal to bringing “liberals and (Joe) Biden supporters” into the Republican process, but that’s probably in large part because polling suggests independent voters in the state prefer Haley.
Gallup tracks party identification in the US. Those identifying as independent first outnumbered Democrats and Republicans back in 1991 and have continued to do so for all but a few years. In 2023, Democrats reached a new low in party identification (27%), the same as Republicans.
The secret, of course, is that most Americans who describe themselves as independent aren’t really. In a follow-up question, they will routinely tell Gallup they either lean toward Republicans or Democrats. Last year, 45% either identified or leaned toward Republicans, compared with 43% who either identified or leaned toward Democrats.
In 2020’s presidential election, 26% of all voters identified as independent, according to CNN’s exit polls, fewer than the portion who identified as either Republicans or Democrats. But in New Hampshire specifically that year, 46% of voters identified as independent.
In New Hampshire’s Democratic primary in 2020, only about half the people who voted said they were Democrats, according to exit polls. Most of the rest (45%) were independents. Sen. Bernie Sanders, the independent from neighboring Vermont, who describes himself as a democratic socialist, won the Democratic primary in New Hampshire that year, but lost the nomination to Biden."
BBX55F11NP_XTYVODIQJJ1OKU9,FAA approves a path for Boeing 737 Max 9s to return to operations,"By David Goldman, Gregory Wallace and Pete Muntean, CNN","6 minute read Updated 10:06 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/24/business/boeing-ceo-washington/,"Boeing CEO David Calhoun’s Wednesday was decidedly a mixed bag: The Federal Aviation Administration finally approved a set of inspection criteria for the 171 grounded 737 Max 9 planes that, if followed, could return the aircraft to service. But he also learned that his company faces yet another investigation into its safety issues.
The FAA late Wednesday opened its announcement with a stern warning: “The January 5 Boeing 737-9 Max incident must never happen again,” referring to an incident earlier this month in which part of an Alaska Airlines flight blew off in mid-air. And the FAA said it would not grant any production expansion of the 737 Max lineup while its safety probe of Boeing continues.
But the FAA cleared the way for the planes to return to the air. Airlines, especially Alaska and United, had faced hundreds of cancellations a day because of the grounding.
“The exhaustive, enhanced review our team completed after several weeks of information gathering gives me and the FAA confidence to proceed to the inspection and maintenance phase,” FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said in a statement.
Each of the 171 grounded aircraft must be inspected, including the bolts, fittings and guide tracks for the door plug, the piece of fuselage that flew off an Alaska Airlines plane earlier this month. The process also includes tightening fasteners and performing “detailed inspections of…dozens of associated components. ”
In a statement Wednesday, Boeing said it will “continue to cooperate fully and transparently with the FAA and follow their direction as we take action to strengthen safety and quality at Boeing. We will also work closely with our airline customers as they complete the required inspection procedures to safely return their 737-9 airplanes to service.”
On Wednesday, Alaska Airlines said it expects the inspections to take 12 hours and for the first of its 737 Max 9 planes to return to service Friday. It said inspections would be completed next week.
United Airlines announced that it has received approval from the FAA to return to its fleet 79 Boeing 737 Max 9 planes this weekend, according to a memo from the airline’s operations chief that was obtained by CNN.
“We will return each Max 9 aircraft to service once this thorough inspection process is complete,” said Toby Enqvist, executive vice president and chief operations officer at United. “We are preparing aircraft to return to scheduled service beginning on Sunday”
And Whitaker noted Boeing itself is not out of the woods.
“However, let me be clear: This won’t be back to business as usual for Boeing,” he said. “We will not agree to any request from Boeing for an expansion in production or approve additional production lines for the 737 Max until we are satisfied that the quality control issues uncovered during this process are resolved.”
Calhoun’s meeting with Washington lawmakers on Wednesday ended with a CEO’s nightmare: He was forced to defend the safety of his company’s planes to travelers, just before he learned Boeing faced yet another investigation.
“We fly safe planes,” Calhoun said to reporters assembled on Capitol Hill. “We don’t put planes in the air that we don’t have 100% confidence in.”
Calhoun acknowledged the seriousness of passengers’ concerns about flying, and he said he came to Washington in the spirit of transparency and openness to help lawmakers better understand the company’s efforts to improve safety.
“I’m here today … to answer all their questions, because they have a lot of them,” Calhoun said.
After speaking with reporters, Washington Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell, chair of the Senate Commerce Committee, announced that she should hold a future hearing to investigate Boeing’s safety record.
“The American flying public and Boeing line workers deserve a culture of leadership at Boeing that puts safety ahead of profits,” Cantwell said in a statement. “I will be holding hearings to investigate the root causes of these safety lapses.”
Cantwell said that in her meeting with Calhoun earlier in the day, she emphasized that Boeing has to prioritize quality and engineering first. After several incidents in recent years, including this month’s Alaska Airlines incident, that commitment has become a significant question.
The National Transportation Safety Board is also investigating the incident.
Not being able to increase production of the Max is a major blow to Boeing’s efforts to return to profitability.
Boeing’s production of the 737 Max, its best selling plane, has still not returned to the rate of production that it had before two fatal crashes led to a 20-month grounding of the plane in 2019. It is not clear when it will be able to move ahead with its efforts to resume production at a more profitable pace.
Industry experts have cast serious doubt about Boeing’s ability to walk away from its investigations unscathed. Last week, a Wells Fargo report, entitled “FAA audit opens up a whole new can of worms,” noted that Boeing’s quality control and engineering problems have been ongoing for years.
“Given Boeing’s recent track record, and greater incentive for the FAA to find problems, we think the odds of a clean audit are low,” the analysts said.
A week earlier, Calhoun acknowledged the company made a “mistake” at a staff-wide safety meeting, but he did not specify what that mistake was. NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy has demanded Boeing provide answers about any mistake it made as part of its safety investigation, which is separate from the FAA’s audit.
Boeing has faced repeated quality and safety issues with its aircraft for five years now, leading to the long-term grounding of some jets and the halt in deliveries of others.
The 737 Max’s design was found to be responsible for two fatal crashes: one in Indonesia in October 2018 and the other in Ethiopia in March 2019. Together, the two crashes killed all 346 people aboard the two flights and led to a 20-month grounding of the company’s best-selling jets, which cost it more than $21 billion.
Internal communications released during the 737 Max grounding showed one employee describing the jet as “designed by clowns, who in turn are supervised by monkeys.”
Late last month, Boeing asked airlines to inspect all of their 737 Max jets for a potential loose bolt in the rudder system after an airline discovered a potential problem with a key part on two aircraft.
Its quality and engineering problems have extended beyond the 737. Boeing also had to twice halt deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner, for about a year starting in 2021 and again in 2023, due to quality concerns cited by the FAA. And the 777 jet also suffered a grounding after an engine failure on a United flight scattered engine debris onto homes and the ground below.
Two Max variants — the Max 7 and the Max 10 — are still awaiting approval to begin carrying passengers. This latest incident complicates that, Wells Fargo analysts noted."
BC6XI2PNJ7_7WCNBVLJTPQTXKE,Second gentleman reflects on the personal toll of his work fighting antisemitism,"By Michael Williams, CNN","3 minute read Published 12:56 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240117,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/24/politics/doug-emhoff-cnntv/,"Second gentleman Doug Emhoff said Wednesday in an exclusive interview that his work fighting the spread of antisemitism around the country weighs on him.
“There’s some days I don’t want to do it, because it’s too hard,” he told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer in an interview from his office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. “I’m too beat up about it. But my wife, the vice president, has been so supportive, pushing me out there to continue to use my voice and this microphone to push back on the hate, the vitriol of what’s going on.”
“I know I have an obligation to our Jewish community as the first Jewish person in this role,” he added. “There’s high expectations and there’s a lot of accountability – I take that extremely seriously. So, no matter how bad I might be feeling personally, it’s not going to stop me from continuing to use my voice, this microphone, to advocate against antisemitism, against hate, and to push our coalitions back together so we can fight this thing together.”
The second gentleman has taken on an elevated role in fighting antisemitism since the October 7 attack on Israel by Hamas. In the interview, which comes ahead of International Holocaust Remembrance Day on January 27, Emhoff said he is “never going to not feel rage about what happened” during the Hamas attack - the deadliest act of violence against Jews since the Holocaust. Emhoff is the first Jewish spouse of a president or vice president.
The spread of hate and antisemitism has been pervasive, Emhoff said, vowing that he and the Biden administration are doing “everything we can” to push back on all forms of extremism.
“We’ve seen the stoking of hate and anger by so-called leaders in this country,” Emhoff said. “We’ve seen leaders who stay silent and they know better – and silence is not acceptable. Noise is required right now. We all need to come together and combat this hate.”
More than 240 people were taken hostage on October 7. Emhoff met with some of the since-released hostages and their families at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week. The trauma those hostages experienced, Emhoff said, “cannot be minimized.”
“It cannot be forgotten,” he said. “The evidence is outrageous, and we can never forget that.”
But he noted that the roots of hate far pre-date October 7, pointing to the 2017 Unite the Right rally in which tiki-torch-carrying White supremacists marched in Charlottesville, Virginia –†® some of them chanting “Jews will not replace us” – and the 2018 massacre at a Pittsburgh synagogue that killed 11 people.
Emhoff has made fighting hate and antisemitism as central focus point even before October 7. The Biden administration launched a national strategy to combat antisemitism last May, and Emhoff said that plan enabled the administration to not “start from scratch after October 7.”
That strategy included more than 100 Executive Branch actions, including bolstering research into antisemitism, conducting threat assessments and increased security funding.
“So we’ve done, in terms of keeping people safe, funds for security, education, fighting what’s happening online - but what I’m focused on is coalition building. … A lot of of our traditional coalitions are frayed, and it’s not a good thing to happen,” he said. “We need to bring these coalitions back, and so I’m doing a lot of work, a lot of public speaking, a lot of things behind the scenes, to get everyone together - to get everyone to understand this hate is all connected.”"
BCGC6Q6RLK_2A6DHV3U7LLU0NI,Minnesota state trooper charged with second-degree murder in death of man during traffic stop in Minneapolis,"By Andy Rose, CNN","2 minute read Updated 3:50 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/24/us/minnesota-minneapolis-trooper-shooting-ricky-cobb/,"A Minnesota State Patrol trooper was charged Wednesday with second-degree murder in the shooting death of Ricky Cobb II during a traffic stop in Minneapolis last year.
State Trooper Ryan Londregan also faces charges of first-degree assault and second-degree manslaughter, according to a criminal complaint filed in court.
“State troopers may only use deadly force when it is necessary to protect a person from a specific identified threat of great bodily harm or death that was reasonably likely to occur. That did not exist in this case,” Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty said at a news conference. “Ricky Cobb II should be alive today.”
Investigators said Cobb was pulled over July 31 on Interstate 94 by three troopers for not having taillights turned on at night, and troopers determined he was wanted for violating a protective order in Ramsey County. Body camera video showed that Cobb – who is Black – refused to leave his vehicle after being told that he was not facing an arrest warrant.

Londregan – who is White – and another trooper, are seen trying to physically remove Cobb from the car, and the vehicle appears to move forward slowly. The criminal complaint says Londergan shot Cobb twice, and the vehicle sped up and crashed into a concrete barrier a quarter-mile away. Cobb was pronounced dead at the scene.
“This County Attorney has provided sweetheart deals to murderers and kidnappers, and now, today, she charges a hero. This County Attorney is literally out of control. Open season on law enforcement must end. And it’s going to end with this case,” Londregan’s attorney Chris Madel said Wednesday.
The “(Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association) will vigorously defend our trooper who is unjustly charged as a result of acting in accordance with his legal responsibilities,” MPPOA Executive Director Brian Peters said in a statement.
Moriarty said Londregan is expected to make his first court appearance later this week or next week, and they will recommend that he be released on his own recognizance. “We are not requesting bail in this case because it is not consistent with Minnesota’s law on bail and the risk assessment used by Hennepin County.” Moriarty said they would request that Londregan be ordered to surrender his passport and any firearms.
“Ryan Londregan stole my son from me,” said Cobb’s mother Nyra Fields-Miller in a statement released Wednesday by her attorneys. “He gunned Ricky down - for no reason while he was defenseless. Nothing can ever make up for that. But today’s decision is the first step toward closure and justice.”"
BCKFZOMRPI_QTY2CNYM8E2RGMR,"New Hampshire exit poll: Majority of GOP primary voters aren’t MAGA, but most would be satisfied with Trump nomination","By Ariel Edwards-Levy, CNN","5 minute read Updated 11:05 PM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/23/politics/exit-poll-new-hampshire-primary/,"The voters who turned out for New Hampshire’s GOP presidential primary on Tuesday were less staunchly conservative and less closely tied to the Republican Party than the electorate in last week’s Iowa caucuses, according to the early results of CNN’s exit poll. But even in a state less naturally inclined to serve as a stronghold for former President Donald Trump, GOP primary voters proved largely willing to embrace him over his remaining rival, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley.
Related article Trump will win New Hampshire Republican primary, CNN projects
About two-thirds of New Hampshire GOP primary voters described themselves as conservative, according to the early results of the exit poll, with about one-quarter calling themselves very conservative. Most said they did not consider themselves a part of the MAGA movement, referring to the “Make America Great Again” slogan popularized by Trump in 2016. Those numbers form a substantially different backdrop than in Iowa’s caucuses, where nearly 9 in 10 described themselves as conservative, and nearly half identified themselves as MAGA.
But roughly 6 in 10 New Hampshire GOP primary voters said they’d be satisfied to see Trump as the Republican Party’s eventual nominee, and most said they’d consider him fit to return to the presidency even if convicted of a crime.
Exit polls are a valuable tool to help understand primary voters’ demographic profile and political views. Like all surveys, however, exit polls are estimates, not precise measurements of the electorate. That’s particularly true for the preliminary set of exit poll numbers, which haven’t yet been weighted to match the final results of the primary. But the results provide a glimpse of the types of voters turning out to participate.
Voters who were registered as Republicans broke heavily for Trump, the exit poll finds, with roughly three-quarters favoring him. Voters registered as undeclared – the state’s term for independent voters – favored Haley by a wide, if less overwhelming, margin, with about two-thirds backing her.
And echoing a frequently seen split in the Republican Party, there was a sharp educational divide among the state’s GOP primary voters. About two-thirds of voters without college degrees backed Trump, while roughly 6 in 10 college graduates supported Haley.

Roughly 7 in 10 of the New Hampshire voters backing Trump said they were registered as Republicans. And about 8 in 10 of Trump’s voters denied the legitimacy of President Joe Biden’s election win in 2020, highlighting the election denialism that remains widespread among his supporters. There is no evidence of widespread election fraud in 2020. Haley’s backers present a near mirror image: about 7 in 10 said they were registered as undeclared prior to Tuesday, and the vast majority acknowledged the results of the 2020 election.
Most Trump voters in New Hampshire made up their minds early and cast their votes with little hesitation: about three-quarters say they decided on Trump more than a month ago. A similar share said that they cast their vote for the candidate they “strongly favored,” with only a few saying they liked Trump with reservations, or that their vote was driven largely by dislike of his rivals. By contrast, Haley voters decided later – most in the last month – and often with some reluctance: roughly 4 in 10 Haley voters in New Hampshire attributed their support of her mostly to distaste for her opponents, with about 3 in 10 saying they liked her with reservations, and only about a third that they strongly favored Haley.
Asked which of four personal qualities mattered most to them in a candidate, roughly 3 in 10 voters said they wanted to see a candidate who would fight for them and a similar share that they wanted someone who shared their values, with fewer looking for a candidate who had the right temperament or could defeat Biden.
Trump’s voters said they most prized a willingness to fight for them; by contrast, Haley’s voters were more likely to cite temperament as key than to say the same of any other characteristic.
The primary electorate as a whole was a largely unhappy one – about 8 in 10 expressed dissatisfaction with the state of the country. But Trump voters were more than three times likelier than Haley voters to describe themselves as angry about the way things are going in the US. And although only a small share of the electorate felt that their family was falling behind substantially, that group broke heavily for Trump.
New Hampshire’s Republican primary voters largely cited the economy or immigration as their top issue in the election, with fewer citing abortion or foreign policy as their top concern. But Trump and Haley voters diverged widely in their attitudes across the spectrum of issues. Roughly 8 in 10 Trump voters said that most undocumented immigrants in the US should be deported from the country, while about two-thirds of Haley voters said that undocumented immigrants should be given the chance to apply for legal status. About half of Trump voters said the US should take a less active role in world affairs than it currently does, with only 3 in 10 Haley voters saying the same.
While supporters of both candidates in the state largely said they’d oppose a federal law banning most or all abortions – another difference from Iowa, where a majority of caucusgoers supported such a ban – Haley’s backers in New Hampshire opposed the idea by a much broader margin.
The exit poll for New Hampshire’s Republican presidential primary was conducted by Edison Research on behalf of the National Election Pool. It includes 2,029 interviews with Republican primary voters across 40 different polling places. Results for the full sample have a margin of error of plus or minus 4.0 percentage points; it is larger for subgroups.

Smith is due to be executed during a 30-hour window starting Thursday for his part in a 1988 murder for hire. The state 14 months ago aborted an effort to execute him by lethal injection because officials could not set an intravenous line before the execution warrant expired.

Smith and his attorneys last week asked the Supreme Court to pause the execution so they could argue trying to execute Smith a second time would amount to cruel and unusual punishment, violating the Eighth and 14th amendments.
On Wednesday, the justices declined Smith’s requests. They did not provide an explanation in their brief order, and there were no noted dissents.
Still, litigation continues ahead of Smith’s scheduled execution by nitrogen hypoxia, a method only Alabama, Oklahoma and Mississippi have approved and none has used; only Alabama, which adopted the method in 2018, has outlined a protocol for it, indicating officials plan to deliver the nitrogen to Smith through a mask.
Smith’s lawyers had also filed a separate appeal with the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit on Wednesday — that court also declined to halt Smith’s execution Wednesday night, saying “Smith has failed to show a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of his claims.”
“Accordingly, his motion for a stay of execution is due to be denied without regard to the other prerequisites for the issuance of the same,” said the court in its ruling.
In the request to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, Smith’s attorneys said Alabama altered its execution plans by changing the schedule for Smith to have his last meal.
That change was made, the attorneys said, in response to evidence that Smith “has been vomiting repeatedly” — one of several concerns previously raised by Smith and the state’s critics, who fear Smith could vomit into the mask, causing him to choke and raising the risk of a tortuous death.
“While there is no doubt that a stay of execution is the exception and not the rule, it is difficult to imagine a more exceptional case than one in which a State intends to employ a novel protocol for a never-before-used method of execution, using a plan that continues to shift less than 48 hours before the execution is scheduled to begin,” the attorneys wrote.
In response, the state said the evidence Smith had been vomiting was largely from his own self-reporting. The Department of Corrections, the state said, only altered the last meal schedule to alleviate Smith’s concerns.
The state urged the court to deny the request for a stay, saying Smith’s “recent delays and latest filing make a mockery of the judicial process.”
Responding to the appeals court’s decision to deny the stay, Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall said, “While Smith will likely appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, my office stands ready to carry on the fight for Liz Sennett. Two courts have now rejected Smith’s claims. I remain confident that the Supreme Court will come down on the side of justice, and that Smith’s execution will be carried out tomorrow.”
During the November 2022 attempt to execute him, officials “jabbed Mr. Smith repeatedly in his arms and hands” in an effort to access his veins, causing the inmate “severe physical pain and psychological torment, including post-traumatic stress disorder,” his lawyers wrote in their appeal to the Supreme Court.
Smith’s execution would mark only the second time in US history that a state would attempt to execute an inmate a second time after initially failing, they said.
The state opposed Smith’s appeal, pointing out this week in a filing with the Supreme Court it would use a different method this time and describing nitrogen hypoxia as “perhaps the most humane method of execution ever devised.”
“Such treatment is much better than Smith gave Elizabeth Sennett nearly thirty-six years ago,” Alabama wrote, referring to the victim in the 1988 case.
United Nations experts, however, have “expressed alarm” over Smith’s looming execution, saying this month in a news release, “We are concerned that nitrogen hypoxia would result in a painful and humiliating death.” The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights called on Alabama to halt the execution, saying it “could amount to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment under international human rights law.”
“It’s not that nitrogen gas won’t kill you,” Dr. Joel Zivot, an associate professor of anesthesiology and surgery at Emory University, told CNN. “But will it kill you in a way that would comport with the constitutional requirement that it not be cruel and it not be torture?”
Smith was sentenced to death for his role in the 1988 murder for hire of Sennett. Her husband, minister Charles Sennett, hired someone who hired two others, including Smith, to kill his wife and make it look like a burglary for $1,000 each, according to court records.
Sennett, who court records say was having an affair and had taken out an insurance policy on his wife, killed himself a week after her murder as investigators’ focus turned to him. Smith was eventually arrested after investigators searched his home and found the Sennetts’ VCR, which he’d taken in the course of the killing.
Smith expressed a desire to be executed by nitrogen hypoxia both before and after the 2022 execution attempt. But that was before the state had a protocol, a federal judge noted this month.
His stated preference likely owed to his belief the state wasn’t close to finalizing a protocol, the judge wrote, adding if the state were forced to execute him using nitrogen, it would effectively place him “in an indefinite holding pattern” – keeping him safe from execution.
That changed in August, when Alabama suddenly agreed to execute Smith using nitrogen gas and released the protocol, which bore copious redactions the state said it needed to maintain security. Still, the protocol illuminated some aspects of how officials intended to carry out the execution, namely delivering the nitrogen using a mask.

While Alabama later agreed not to try to execute Smith again using lethal injection, he then challenged the nitrogen hypoxia protocol, claiming it left him at risk of “superadded pain” and could cause him to have a stroke or leave him in a vegetative state if it fails, court records show. He proposed the state either amend its protocol or execute him by firing squad.
The judge’s ruling early this month cleared the way for Alabama to proceed, finding there was “simply not enough evidence to find” the protocol would cause Smith superadded pain.
“It could, in a highly theoretical sense, but only if a cascade of unlikely events occurs,” the judge wrote. “Or it may well be painless and quick. Execution by nitrogen hypoxia is novel, and it will remain novel even if the Defendants employ Smith’s proposed amendments to the protocol.”
While the judge acknowledged the “heavily redacted” protocol maintained the Department of Corrections “familiar veil of secrecy over its capital punishment procedures,” he also noted the state had provided Smith’s team with an unredacted protocol.
The office of Republican Gov. Kay Ivey declined to provide an unredacted copy of the nitrogen hypoxia execution protocol or respond to CNN’s questions about experts’ concerns over it. Smith’s attorneys declined to provide a copy of the unredacted protocol to CNN, citing a protective order by the court.

BIV5WC8JXD_WT766SOZOZ7FE4N,Look of the Week: Kim Kardashian steps into Balenciaga ambassadorship in ‘pantaleggings’,"By Jacqui Palumbo, CNN","3 minute read Published 6:24 PM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/23/style/kim-kardashian-balenciaga-closet-campaign-lotw/,"Editor’s Note: Featuring the good, the bad and the ugly, ‘Look of the Week’ is a regular series dedicated to unpacking the most talked about outfit of the last seven days.
Get ready for another parade of Kim Kardashian in black spandex ensembles. Less than 24 hours after Balenciaga announced the Skims founder had officially joined the luxury house as a brand ambassador, Kardashian appeared in her first campaign in her new role to herald the return of the label’s Le City oversized leather bag, which became a mainstay in the 2000s thanks to supermodel Kate Moss.
Over the past few years, Kardashian has played muse to the brand’s most recent creative director, Demna Gvasalia, in everything from mobility-limiting yellow caution tape to spectral head-to-toe black fabric. But for her first official official outing as ambassador, her simple silhouette is classic Kimenciaga: a seamless tube top-pantaleggings ensemble that fits neatly with her own shapewear empire’s aesthetic.
Photographed by Inez and Vinoodh, the “Closet Campaign” features a roster of celebrities, including actor and socialite Nicola Peltz — who wears a Regina George-worthy pink tracksuit — and model Paloma Elsesser, holding the new Le City silhouettes and other signature Balenciaga bags in pristine luxury closets. (Kardashian is photographed in her own enormous handbag closet, along with her own collection of nearly 130 Balenciaga bags.)
The “Closet Campaign” feels like a soft launch rather than a big splash for the new partnership, but is still stirring buzz. After several appearances for the brand, including walking the runway in its 51st Haute Couture show in 2022, Kardashian took a step back from Balenciaga later that year after a holiday campaign ignited controversy.
The fashion house’s “Toy Stories” campaign featured young children with various Balenciaga gifts, including plush bags designed as teddy bears in goth outfits and BDSM-inspired accessories. After the brand and its creative collaborators were accused of sexualizing children — and a separate campaign went viral for featuring documents from a United States Supreme Court case relating to child pornography laws on a desk in an otherwise generic office scene — Balenciaga pulled the campaign and issued an apology for including the teddy bear bags. (They also filed, then dropped a lawsuit against the production company involved in the shoot that included the court case documents.)
Days later, Kardashian called the images “disturbing” on social media and said she was “re-evaluating” her relationship with the house.

But in December, just over a year after the backlash, Kardashian signaled that she was back in the fold, appearing front row at its Los Angeles runway show — closed by Cardi B — along with her half-sister Kendall Jenner.
On Monday, as part of her ambassador announcement, Kardashian said in a press statement that the fashion house “embraces modernity, craftsmanship and takes an innovative approach to design under Demna.”
She added: “For me, this long-standing relationship is built on mutual trust and a commitment to doing what’s right.”"
BJ48XYXHM9_0T2QOQC4ZPXSHI1,Harris pins the blame on Trump for Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade,"By Kevin Liptak, CNN","5 minute read Updated 11:15 PM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240122,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/22/politics/kamala-harris-cnntv/,"Vice President Kamala Harris on Monday pinned blame squarely on Donald Trump for the reversal of Roe v. Wade, saying the former president is “proud that women are silently suffering” without a guaranteed right to abortion.
“The previous president expressed his intentions quite clearly. And fast forward to just recently, says he’s proud of what he did,” Harris told CNN’s Laura Coates during an exclusive interview in Wisconsin, where the vice president was launching a national tour in support of reproductive rights.
She said the likely Republican nominee relishes his role in new, restrictive abortion laws that have emerged in the aftermath of the high court ruling.
“By inference, he is proud that women have been deprived of fundamental freedoms to make decisions about their own body; by inference, proud that doctors are being penalized and criminalized for providing health care, proud that women are silently suffering because they don’t have access to the health care they need,” Harris added. “So, let’s understand that the stakes are so very high.”
It was a preview of a central reelection argument in a rematch between Trump and President Joe Biden, a contest that will be shadowed by the former president’s multiple courtroom trials, including one related to Trump’s role in events that led to the January 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol.
The vice president rejected outright Trump’s assertions that his legal issues amount to political persecution undertaken by the Biden administration: “What he’s saying is not factual, period,” she said. “And that would not be new for him, would it?”
And Harris said it was imperative Americans remain watchful for signs of democratic erosion in the lead-up to this year’s contest.
“I think everyone is right to be vigilant in demanding that we maintain our democracy. And we uphold its pillars, which includes the integrity of a free and fair election system,” Harris said in the CNN interview, listing intimidation of poll workers as an example of what to watch out for in the coming months as the election gets underway.
“It is important that we all remember that a hallmark of a democracy is civic participation. Which means let’s all vote – I’m not telling you who to vote for, but please, in the midst of all that you’ve got going on, take the time to fill out a ballot if you can vote by mail and send it in,” she said.
Harris spoke a day ahead of the New Hampshire primary, where Trump maintains a sizable lead against his remaining GOP rival, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley.
As part of her campaign pitch, Haley has made Harris a frequent target, claiming that because of his age, a vote for Biden would amount to a vote for Harris – and suggesting the vice president wasn’t up for the job. Harris said that type of criticism wasn’t unique for powerful women.
“I think that most women who have risen in their profession, who are leaders in their profession, have had similar experiences,” she told Coates. “I was the first woman to be elected district attorney. I was the first woman to be elected attorney general in the state of California, and I’m the first woman to be vice president. And I love my job.”
As she and Biden gear up for what could be the imminent start of the general election, Harris worked to underscore the stakes of the upcoming contest – stakes many Democrats worry haven’t registered yet with enough voters.
She said those who committed acts of violence on January 6, 2021, “need to be taken into account and held accountable for those acts.”
And Harris accused Republicans of “playing politics” with immigration, as she and Biden come under criticism for not doing more to stem the flow of migrants coming across the southern border.
Still, for Democrats, no issue better illustrates the choice in November than abortion, which the party has seized upon in the wake of the court’s 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.
Trump’s role in gutting abortion rights – his three conservative Supreme Court picks all voted to overturn Roe v. Wade – is emerging as a core theme for Harris and Biden as they seek reelection. Reproductive rights have galvanized Democrats and proven a winner at the ballot box in the 19 months since the high court overturned the ruling.
Harris plans to travel to several other states to speak about the issue on her national “Fight for Reproductive Freedoms Tour,” which is expected to last through March. And she will appear at a joint rally with Biden on Tuesday – the same day as the New Hampshire primary – to draw more attention to abortion rights.
“I am going to do exactly what I’m doing here in Wisconsin, which is traveling in the country to remind people of not only what is at stake and the harm that is occurring every day, so many women silently suffering, but also remind them of the connection between their vote and an outcome that puts back in place the protections of Roe. So these months are going to matter,” Harris said Monday.
On Sunday, the Biden campaign unveiled a new television ad that features an emotional direct-to-camera testimonial from Dr. Austin Dennard, a Texas OB-GYN and mother who traveled out of her state, which has a strict abortion ban, to terminate her pregnancy after learning her fetus had a fatal condition. The campaign said the spot would run during this week’s season premiere of ABC’s “The Bachelor” as it targets young female voters.
At the White House on Monday, Biden met with his administration’s task force on reproductive rights, criticizing Republicans for trying to ban abortion and announcing new steps the White House is taking to expand access to contraception and other reproductive care.
Still, Biden and Harris have acknowledged that fully restoring the protections included in Roe will be impossible without congressional action.
“President Joe Biden has been very clear, when Congress puts the protections of Roe back into the law, he will sign it,” Harris told Coates in Wisconsin. “Similarly, President Joe Biden has been very clear if these extremists achieve their other goal, which is to have a national ban, which means state by state by state. Joe Biden will veto that.”
“The stakes are high,” she said.

BKLCZ5AOMH_MAXJILQMV4QDZNI,Man who admitted stealing ‘Wizard of Oz’ ruby slippers from museum tells court it was intended as ‘one last score’,"By Andy Rose, CNN","2 minute read Published 2:29 PM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240122,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/22/us/terry-martin-ruby-slippers-stolen/,"A man who admits stealing ruby slippers used in “The Wizard of Oz” did it for “one last score,” according to a document filed Friday in federal court.
Terry Martin, 76, pleaded guilty to theft in October.
He stole the shoes from the Judy Garland Museum in Grand Rapids, Minnesota, – Garland’s hometown – after being approached by a person he calls “an old mob associate,” offering him “a job,” Martin told authorities.
“While Terry had been crime free for years, the addict’s rush of anticipation was too much, and he gave into the temptation of ‘one last score,’” Martin’s attorneys wrote in a statement to the court.

According to Martin, the man who first proposed the theft – whom Martin has refused to name – wanted the shoes not for their value as cultural artifacts, but because he mistakenly thought the slippers contained real rubies that could be sold as valuable gems.
Martin admitted to taking the slippers after he entered the closed museum on August 27, 2005, by breaking through a door, then breaking the plexiglass enclosure that held the shoes with a sledgehammer. He claims they were in his possession for only two days.
The slippers were recovered by the FBI in a sting operation in 2018 when other suspects attempted to collect an insurance reward for their return, according to Martin’s plea agreement.
Despite a lengthy criminal history, prosecutors agreed to recommend no jail time for Martin because of his poor health. “Martin is on oxygen at all times … and a medical determination was made that Martin’s illness is terminal, and his life expectancy is less than six months,” prosecutors said in a court filing.
Martin’s sentencing is scheduled for January 29.
The stolen slippers are one of four pairs still known to exist that were used in the 1939 film that starred Garland as Dorothy Gale, according to the US Attorney’s Office for Minnesota.
The magical shoes are used in the movie to send Dorothy back to Kansas as she repeats, “There’s no place like home.”"
BMQ36V947V_HY5QEJI8G1IB1BZ,Man found guilty of second-degree murder in Southern California road rage shooting that killed a 6-year-old boy,"By Cindy Von Quednow, CNN","2 minute read Published 5:55 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/25/us/marcus-anthony-eriz-aiden-leos/,"A man was found guilty of second-degree murder on Thursday in the 2021 road rage shooting on a Southern California highway that left a 6-year-old boy dead, according to the Orange County District Attorney’s Office.
A jury also found Marcus Anthony Eriz, 26, guilty of shooting into an occupied vehicle and discharging a firearm causing great bodily injury and death in the killing of Aiden Leos.
Aiden was sitting in a booster seat in the back seat of his mother’s car as she drove him to school when he was shot on the morning of May 21, 2021, CNN previously reported. The kindergartener died at a hospital.
Eriz and his girlfriend, Wynne Lee, 26, were arrested weeks later.
Video from the courtroom showed Eriz did not react to the verdict on Thursday after it was read.
Randall S. Bethune, Eriz’s attorney, had no comment.
The boy’s mother testified that she flipped Lee and Eriz off after Lee cut her off while traveling on a freeway, the Orange County District Attorney’s Office said in a news release.
“After driving away, she said she heard a large noise and heard her son say, ‘ow,’ before pulling over (to) the side of the freeway and pulling Aiden out of his car seat and calling 911,” the release said.
“Six-year-old boys should be playing outside in the sunshine, soaking in all the magic and wonder that is boyhood, not lying dead in a tiny, child-size coffin because a man he never met decided to execute him for no conceivable reason,” District Attorney Todd Spitzer said in a social media post Thursday.

“While we will never know what Aiden would have become, we know that the pursuit of justice did not end until his killer was captured and this child murderer was prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”
Eriz faces 40 years to life in state prison when he is scheduled to be sentenced on April 12, the district attorney’s office said.
Lee, who was driving when the shooting happened, was charged with one felony count of accessory after the fact and one misdemeanor count of having a concealed firearm in a vehicle, according to the district attorney’s office. She has pleaded not guilty, CNN previously reported.
Lee is awaiting trial and is out of custody on GPS monitoring after posting a $100,000 bond in July 2021. She faces three years in state prison and one year in an Orange County jail if convicted on all charges."
BNERRFK64T_XY800ANF0ADR137,Top universities agree to settle financial aid suit for $104.5 million,"By Jeff Winter, CNN","3 minute read Published 4:07 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/24/us/top-universities-agree-to-settle-financial-aid-suit-for-usd104-5-million/,"Five universities agreed to settle a lawsuit accusing them of colluding on financial aid and admissions violations, according to new court filings.
Yale, Columbia, Duke, Brown and Emory universities will pay a combined $104.5 million to settle their portions of the case, which was brought by five former students against more than a dozen schools.
The suit alleges the universities violated antitrust law when they ignored their pledge to not weigh a student’s ability to pay tuition when considering whether or not to accept, a practice referred to as “need-blind” admission.
“It is past time for the presidents and governing bodies of the remaining defendants to stand up and do the right thing for their students and alumni, and resolve the overcharges to middle class and working class students that stemmed from the twenty years of collusion on financial aid by elite universities,” Robert D. Gilbert, one of the lead attorneys representing the students, said in a statement.
In the settlement filings, the schools continue to deny any wrongdoing or liability, asserting that “the Universities’ financial aid policies were legal and pro-competitive and financial aid awards were not artificially reduced, that the Universities have valid defenses to Plaintiffs’ allegations, and that Plaintiffs’ claims would have been rejected prior to trial, at trial, or on appeal.”

CNN reached out to all five schools for comment. Every school denied the allegations of the suit and any wrongdoing in separate statements.
“While Columbia disputes the merit of this case, the University has determined to put this matter behind us,” said a Columbia spokesperson. “The University’s participation in the 568 Group was intended to benefit our students.  Columbia’s mission is to help all students admitted, regardless of individual financial circumstances, achieve their goal of pursuing a world class education at our university.”
“We are settling this case to avoid the wasteful cost and inconvenience of prolonged litigation.  We remain committed to providing equitable access to a Duke education and ensuring students have the resources they need to truly thrive while here at Duke,” Frank Tramble, vice president of communications for Duke, said in a statement.
Columbia and Duke are both settling for $24 million, respectively.
“This settlement contains no admission that Yale did anything wrong but allows the university to avoid the cost and disruption of further litigation and to continue its work in making undergraduate education more affordable for more families,” a Yale spokesperson said in a statement. Yale agreed to settle for $18.5 million.
In a statement, an Emory spokesperson said, “While Emory continues to believe the plaintiffs’ claims have no merit, we are pleased the litigation is behind us. Our focus has been and always will be to make an Emory education accessible to all talented students, regardless of their financial resources, and we look forward to continuing that mission.” Emory is also settling for $18.5 million.
A spokesperson for Brown, which is settling for $19.5 million, said, “We vehemently believe that the claims had no merit, but given the time and financial resources required to take this case to trial, we determined that our resources are better spent resolving this matter and supporting the education of our students.”
Last year the University of Chicago, one of the other schools named in the suit, settled for $13.5 million, bringing the settlement total to $118 million.
Vanderbilt has reached an agreement to settle, but the amount has yet to be disclosed, according to a school spokesperson. “Though we believe the plaintiffs’ claims are without merit, we have reached a settlement in order to maintain our commitment to the privacy of our students and families and keep our focus on providing talented scholars from all social, cultural and economic backgrounds one of the world’s best undergraduate educations,” the spokesperson said in a statement.
The remaining schools yet to settle are the University of Pennsylvania, Georgetown University, Cornell University, University of Notre Dame, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, California Institute of Technology, Johns Hopkins University, Dartmouth College, Northwestern University and Rice University, according to attorneys."
BQ0UAUJCFS_L6G6E6TOKAHIR48,Maine’s top court won’t review Trump ballot eligibility for now,"By Colin McCullough and Marshall Cohen, CNN","2 minute read Published 9:42 AM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/25/politics/maine-ballot-trump-14th-amendment/,"The Maine Supreme Judicial Court declined to weigh in on whether former President Donald Trump should be removed from the state’s ballot, rejecting a request that they decide on the question now.
The ruling leaves in place a prior judge’s decision that froze the state-level proceedings until the US Supreme Court issues its ruling in a similar case from Colorado, which found that Trump is ineligible to hold public office based on the 14th Amendment’s “insurrectionist ban.” Oral arguments are scheduled in that case for February 8.
Maine is the second state to remove Trump’s name from the ballot, after Colorado’s Supreme Court declared Trump ineligible for the presidency using similar reasoning. Other judges and election officials across the country have dismissed related anti-Trump challenges on procedural grounds.
Maine’s Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, a Democrat, had reached the same conclusion and barred Trump from the Republican primary ballot. Trump appealed in state court, and last week, a judge paused the proceedings, pending the outcome of the Colorado case. But Bellows appealed the freeze to Maine’s highest court, and asked the justices to immediately decide whether Trump is disqualified due to his role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection. The high court on Wednesday unanimously declined to take up the appeal.
“There is at least as great a risk of additional process and delay if we consider this appeal and reach an ostensibly final decision, and then the (US) Supreme Court’s decision makes additional court or administrative action necessary to comply with the federal law,” the ruling said. “… Given the high level of uncertainty, the Secretary of State has not identified a concrete and irreparable harm arising from our decision not to review this matter immediately.”
Bellows said in a prior filing to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court that the lower court’s decision to stay the former president’s removal from the ballot pending a decision from the US Supreme Court “is contrary to the statutory design and would sow public confusion.”
The Supreme Judicial Court argued the contrary in its opinion.
“The Secretary of State suggests that there is irreparable harm because a delay in certainty about whether Trump’s name should appear on the primary ballot will result in voter confusion. This uncertainty is, however, precisely what guides our decision not to undertake immediate appellate review in this particular case,” the court wrote."
BQ6SUZ7ZJD_2X9J5BDHCC57BLB,Thai court dismisses media shares case against popular progressive politician - but party’s future still in doubt,"By Helen Regan and Wasu Vipoosanapat, CNN","5 minute read Updated 10:15 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/24/asia/thailand-pita-limjaroenrat-media-shares-verdict-intl-hnk/,"A Thai political leader who led his party to a stunning electoral victory on a campaign that threatened to shake up the country’s powerful conservative establishment has escaped being disqualified from politics but his — and his party’s — political future remains in question.
Thailand’s Constitutional Court on Wednesday dismissed a case against Pita Limjaroenrat, 43, that alleged he violated election rules by running for office while holding shares in a media company – the long-defunct broadcaster iTV.
Thai law bans members of parliament from owning or holding shares in media companies.
Eight of the nine-member panel of judges ruled in favor of Pita, saying that since iTV had not operated since 2007 — before he applied for the party-list candidacy — he had not violated the constitution.
The ruling is one of two highly-anticipated verdicts against Pita and the progressive Move Forward Party that could ultimately see Thailand’s most successful party at the last election dissolved, and bans and criminal charges levied at its leaders.
Following Wednesday’s verdict, Pita told reporters outside court that he will continue to work for the people and that he would like to get back to his duties in parliament “as soon as possible.”
“Whenever I’m allowed in, I’ll be there,” he said.
Supporters who had gathered outside the court began chanting “PM Pita,” referring to his bid to become prime minister, and said justice had been done. Some held placards reading, “We will always support the party” while others mocked the Election Commission that brought the case to court.
Supravee Sansuk, 63, from Bangkok said the outcome has restored her faith in the Thai justice system.
“I was worried about the verdict that it would turn the other way. So I was overwhelmed to receive the good news. Because Pita was not guilty since the beginning and this case shouldn’t have been forwarded to the court,” she told CNN.
Lee Saetung, 69, said he traveled three hours from his hometown of Rayong to attend the verdict.
“I am growing older, I need the country to move forward and we need young people to cultivate the future of my grandchildren. So when the verdict was released, I was very much relieved to see a future ahead for my descendants,” he said.
Besides being defunct for nearly two decades, iTV did not have a media license nor a frequency band to broadcast, and had no income, Pita said in a Facebook post last year.
Pita said he inherited shares owned by his late father but they held “no economic value” and the company was delisted from the Thai Stock Exchange in 2014. The shares were later transferred, he said.
The former prime ministerial hopeful was suspended from his duties as a lawmaker and member of Thailand’s parliament in July while the case was being investigated.
Speaking to CNN in May, Pita said “there are professional and personal attacks against me” but that he has prepared and has “a strong legal basis for anything that comes my way.”
His Move Forward party gained a huge following among young Thais during the 2023 general election for its reformist platform, which included deep structural reforms to how Thailand is run, including to the military and radical plans to amend the country’s strict lese majeste laws despite the taboo surrounding any discussion of the royal family in Thailand.
Move Forward won the most seats and the largest share of the popular vote in the May election.
The result was a decisive victory for progressive parties and delivered a crushing blow to the conservative, military-backed establishment that has ruled on and off for decades, often by turfing out popularly elected governments in coups.

The party was prevented from forming a government, however, as it failed to win support from a big enough majority of parliamentarians over its royal reform agenda and Pita resigned as leader of the party, which is now in opposition.
Move Forward and its former leader Pita remain popular, especially among younger Thais who have hit the streets in huge numbers in recent years calling for political and royal reform.
A January opinion poll by the National Institute of Development Administration showed Pita as being Thailand’s most popular politician for 39% of respondents, with Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin at 22%, Reuters reported.
But its fate hangs in the balance until the Constitutional Court delivers another ruling on January 31 over whether Pita and the party sought to overthrow the monarchy through his election campaign to amend the kingdom’s notoriously strict lese majeste law.
Munin Pongsapan, associate professor at Thammasat University’s Faculty of Law, said Wednesday was “a good day for Thailand’s justice system” and the ruling “was a good sign for the next case.”
“If the court follows this standard in deciding the next case, there will be an even higher chance for the Move Forward Party to survive as the accusations against it are really groundless,” he said.
Thailand’s turbulent political history has previously seen parties that have pushed for change run afoul of the powerful conservative establishment – a nexus of the military, monarchy and influential elites.
Lawmakers have faced bans, parties have been dissolved, and governments have been overthrown. Thailand has witnessed a dozen successful coups since 1932, including two in the past 17 years.
And the purportedly independent election commission, anti-corruption commission and the Constitutional Court are all dominated by members in favor of the establishment.

In 2008, the Constitutional Court ruled that then-prime minister Samak Sundaravej violated the constitution by taking part in a cooking show on TV while in office for which he received a nominal fee, and was ordered to resign.
Three parties linked to billionaire political scion Thaksin Shinawatra – the populist former prime minister who was ousted in a coup in 2006 – have been disbanded in the last decade.
And most recently, Move Forward’s predecessor, the Future Forward Party, won the third most seats in the 2019 election. Shortly afterward, several of the party’s leaders were banned from politics and the party was later dissolved after a court ruled it had violated electoral finance rules.
The decision to dissolve the popular party ignited youth-led protests that swept across Thailand in 2020, politicizing a whole new generation of activists and political leaders – some of whom contested last year’s election with the Move Forward Party."

Brown and Danielle Brooks on their Oscar nominations,"By Lisa Respers France, CNN","1 minute read Updated 5:03 PM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/23/entertainment/niecy-nash-sterling-k-brown-danielle-brooks-oscar/,"What a family tree Niecy Nash-Betts apparently has!
The actress (and recent Emmy winner) took to social media on Tuesday to congratulate her cousins, Sterling K. Brown and Danielle Brooks, on their Oscar nominations.
“Both of my COUSINS are OSCAR NOMINATED,” Nash-Betts wrote in the caption of a photo featuring the three of them on her Instagram, adding by way of clarification, “Yes! We are blood related! REAL cousins!”
“I’m so proud of my fam!” the “Claws” star added, concluding the caption with, “I’m rooting for you!”
While it’s unclear exactly how the three are related, a publicist for Brooks confirmed that she and Nash-Betts are cousins.
CNN has reached out to reps for Nash-Betts and Brown for further clarification.
Brooks and Brown are each nominated in the supporting actor categories at the Academy Awards this year.
Brooks is nominated for her role of Sofia in “The Color Purple,” while Brown received his nod for his work in “American Fiction.”
It turns out, Nash-Betts also has another famous relative.
Last year she appeared on an episode of the PBS series “Finding Your Roots” and discovered that the activist Angela Davis is a distant cousin.
Nash-Betts’ recent Emmy win was for outstanding supporting actress in an anthology series, for her role in Netflix’s “Dahmer – Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story.”"
BT9MBTAI32_JZXM594WNPBF58O,Top Senate Republican says border security package could rise above $14 billion as key sticking points remain,"By Ted Barrett, Morgan Rimmer, Lauren Fox and Clare Foran, CNN","5 minute read Updated 10:48 PM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/22/politics/senate-negotiations-border-policy/,"Senate GOP Whip John Thune said on Monday that the price tag for the border security provisions in a national security package that negotiators are working to finalize could rise above the $14 billion President Joe Biden initially requested for border security.
“That’s being discussed,” Thune acknowledged to reporters when asked if he thought the number was going to have to go up as negotiators search for policy solutions to the complex problems at the border.
Key issues remain outstanding in the effort to strike a deal on border policy that would unlock support to pass aid for Ukraine and Israel in the Senate. It is not yet clear when an agreement might be finalized or when the Senate would be able to hold a vote. Any potential deal already faces long odds in the Republican-controlled House and the cost of the package could add to the challenge of striking an agreement and pushing for its passage.
Border negotiators continued talking throughout the weekend and making progress with most areas of policy agreed to at this point, two sources familiar with the talks told CNN. However, negotiations over border security now hinge on how to appropriate the money, an area rife with major sticking points and political battle lines.
Republican Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma, one of the top Senate negotiators working to strike a deal on an immigration policy and foreign aid package, warned on Monday that it would be “quite a push” to begin voting on legislation this week.
“It’s not going to be ready today, to be able to go out,” Lankford said. “Everybody’s got to have several days to be able to go through it … it would be quite a push to be able to get it out this week.”
The Oklahoma Republican said that one major hurdle at this point is figuring out how to pay for the policies they are writing.
“That’s the biggest issue, is trying to be able to work through all the different pieces, how they cost and then how they function,” he said.
The race to reach an agreement comes as negotiators are facing a series of challenges: diminishing support for aid to Ukraine in the Republican Party, calls from some on the left to attach conditions on Israel aid and a warning from GOP presidential frontrunner Donald Trump not to agree to anything unless it’s everything Republicans are looking for on the border.
Even if a deal is finalized, House Republicans have already warned they would be prepared to reject a compromise measure they deem inadequate.
Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, another top Senate negotiator on the immigration and foreign aid package, told reporters the next major hurdle is figuring out how to pay for the legislation without making too many changes to the bill.
“Our work is largely done. We just need the appropriators to help us fund it rather than rewrite it,” he told reporters.
“We don’t have a deal until we have final text, until we have agreement from the appropriators to fund it, to fund the agreement,” Murphy said.
Murphy told reporters that “it’s possible” they will put the bill on the floor this week.  “I’m saying it’s possible. I don’t know whether that will happen, but it’s possible,” he said.
Thune noted that negotiators still have more work to do to finish text and warned that he’s “not real” optimistic a vote on the package will happen this week.
“There isn’t text yet. We gotta have text. Our members are gonna need time to review it so we’ll see,” he said.
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell had said last week that he hoped they could begin voting on a package this week.
On Monday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said while negotiators are getting ever closer, “there are a handful of issues that have not yet been agreed to” and it’s “not a done deal yet.”
“If presented with the opportunity to pass a national security supplemental here on the floor, we intend to act as quickly as possible. We’re not there yet. We’ll keep going,” he said. “We remain hopeful, but it’s certainly not a done deal yet.”
As the 2024 White House race increasingly looms large over the political landscape, lawmakers have had to contend with presidential politics as negotiations over a border package continue, a factor that threatens to make the effort even more fraught as Trump has openly criticized the idea of any compromise. “I do not think we should do a Border Deal, at all, unless we get EVERYTHING needed to shut down the INVASION of Millions and Millions of people,” he wrote on Truth Social last Wednesday.
Pressed on Trump’s position and how that could affect support for their final product, Lankford replied, “I don’t have any doubt he is supportive of trying to be able to secure the border. Where he is on this particular package, I don’t know, but there’s no question that he’s supportive of trying to secure the border and this is going to have a lot of new tools for any administration to be more effective at actually securing the border.”
Lankford noted that he has not spoken directly with the former president about the negotiations. “There may be a time for that,” he acknowledged.
Immigration policy is a notoriously difficult political issue, a major reason why efforts at compromise have failed in the past.
Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin was skeptical on Monday about proposals to alter the president’s ability to grant parole to immigrants, something that is a key demand of Republicans in the border security negotiations and may be a major part of their emerging deal.
“It’s too important at critical moments in history for the president to have that authority,” Durbin said.
Asked if he is open to changing or limiting parole or asylum,” Durbin said: “I have not seen a specific proposal, but I am skeptical of any diminution of the president’s power in this area.”
“I don’t want to prejudge it until it’s done,” he added.

Putin thanked Kim for an invitation to visit Pyongyang and pledged to go there “at an early date,” the report from the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said.
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the dates for Putin’s visit to North Korea were still being discussed through diplomatic channels and would be announced later, Russian state-run news agency TASS reported.
Last Tuesday, North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui met Putin and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow to discuss issues regarding the Korean Peninsula, Northeast Asia and international peace and security, according to TASS.
At that meeting the two sides expressed a “strong will to further strengthen strategic and tactical cooperation in defending the core interests of the two countries,” KCNA said.
A Putin visit to Pyongyang would reciprocate one Kim made last September, when the North Korean leader traveled in his armored train to Russia’s far eastern region, visiting a factory that produces fighter jets and a rocket-launch facility among other stops.
During that visit, Kim praised Russia for standing up to “hegemonic forces” with its war in Ukraine, while Putin signaled a willingness to assist North Korea in developing its space and satellite programs.
Signs of increasing Russian-North Korean cooperation have been seen in Ukraine.
According to the US Defense Department, Russia has twice in the past month fired North Korean-made missiles at targets in Ukraine. And South Korean intelligence has reported that Pyongyang has supplied Moscow with more than 1 million artillery shells that could be used in the invasion of Ukraine.

Meanwhile, Western analysts say Russia could be a source of technology and expertise for Kim as he refines a nuclear-capable missile program that could threaten not only his neighbors in East Asia, but possibly the mainland United States with intercontinental ballistic missiles.
Kim has been drawing an increasingly harder line against South Korea in recent weeks, saying the North will no longer seek reconciliation and reunification with the South and instructing the country’s army, munitions industry, nuclear weapons and civil defense sectors to accelerate war preparations in response to “confrontation moves” by the US.
Last week, in a speech to a Supreme People’s Assembly (SPA) meeting in Pyongyang, Kim called the South the North’s “primary foe and invariable principal enemy” and said a reunification monument in the North Korean capital was an “eyesore” that should be demolished."
BV0QES0TRM_ELQG8TWYGMMALA8,"They fell in love on vacation but went their separate ways. Four years later, she sent him an email: ‘Remember me?’","By Francesca Street, CNN","16 minute read Updated 9:53 AM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/travel/scotland-romance-lost-touch-reunited-chance-encounters/,"Gabriella Vagnoli never forgot that trip to Scotland.
She tried not to think about it, to “remove that chapter completely.” She’d known Dan Watling for only a few days. He lived in the US. She figured she’d never see him again.
But as her long-term relationship in Italy started to dwindle, Gabriella’s mind returned to how it felt walking around Loch Ness with Dan in the spring of 2002. She thought about his eyes, “very blue, beautiful, striking.” She remembered the way they’d sat together, on the mountainous Old Man of Storr, looking out over the Isle of Skye, sharing stories about their lives.
It was mid-2006 when Gabriella finally typed Dan’s name into Google. Social media was pretty new at the time. She wasn’t sure anything would come up. She’d convinced herself Dan would have long moved on. They weren’t 22 anymore.
“I was just like, ‘Oh I’m just going to see – because by now he’s probably married – Americans marry early. Who knows what he’s doing,” Gabriella recalls to CNN Travel.
To her surprise, Dan popped up right away. Photos of him on a three-month trip around Europe a couple of years earlier.
“He looked different, more rugged, more experienced,” says Gabriella.
He still had the same kind eyes. To Gabriella, he looked “more handsome.”
Gabriella decided to send Dan a message.
“Remember me?” she wrote.
Gabriella and Dan first connected on the banks of Loch Ness, the large body of water in the northerly Scottish Highlands, known as the home of the mythical Loch Ness monster.
At the time, Gabriella was midway through her college degree in Italy, finishing up a year spent studying in the UK.
“Me and a bunch of friends from Italy, Germany and Portugal decided to do this trip to Scotland together,” recalls Gabriella.
The group headed to Edinburgh to join a tour bus traveling further north. It was a three-day trip, with several stops to take in the Highland highlights.
Dan was on the same tour. Dan says his brother Bill “kind of forced” him to join the trip to Scotland. Dan was very committed to his job as a software developer in Chicago. He’d never traveled much.
“He bought my ticket and helped me get the passport and everything else. So essentially, I had no choice but to go,” Dan tells CNN Travel today.
Bill did all the planning too. He picked the backpackers tour. He made sure they got on the bus.
The whole thing was a bit outside of 22-year-old Dan’s comfort zone, but Dan was excited to be there.
There were around 15 people on the tour, including Gabriella and her gang of college friends. When the group boarded the bus, the tour guide suggested the travelers take it in turns to introduce themselves.
Gabriella was one of the first up. She told the group she was from Pisa, in Italy. She talked about her love of music.
“I remember being ‘struck’ when Gabi introduced herself,” Dan recalls. “I thought she was very pretty and interesting.”
When Dan stood up front and nervously introduced himself, Gabriella was struck by him too.
“I noticed Dan because of his eyes,” she recalls. He seemed shy, a bit embarrassed to be talking in front of a group of strangers. Gabriella found she couldn’t stop looking at him.
The first stop on the tour was Loch Ness. The tour guide and most of the group went down to the shore of the Loch, but Gabriella and Dan didn’t join them right away.
“Instead, we hung back and started talking,” says Dan.
Their first conversation was a little awkward – in his nervousness, Dan asked Gabriella what it was like living in Rome. She assumed he hadn’t been listening when she’d introduced herself as sharing a home with the famous Leaning Tower.
After that, things warmed up. Gabriella and Dan carried on chatting as they admired the sweeping expanse of Loch Ness, the imposing ruins of Urquhart Castle in the distance.

Back on the bus, Gabriella and her friends sat with Dan and his brother Bill. The group started playing the card game Uno to pass the time. As the bus headed northwest, the roads got narrower, the scenery glimpsed from the bus window more staggering. Eventually, the bus crossed the bridge to Skye, the famous Scottish island known for its spectacular scenery – think dramatic mountains, picturesque glens and ancient castles.
Gabriella couldn’t believe the vastness of the landscape. It felt worlds away from the city living she was used to.
“It really struck me and it was beautiful,” she says.
But while Dan remembers being immediately enamored with “the rocks, and the hills, the waterfalls, and the clouds and everything,” his main memory of Skye is falling for Gabriella.
“I just remember being with her most of all,” he says.
Skye was a “key moment,” agrees Gabriella.
Their tour guide took them to the Old Man of Storr, a rock formation offering incredible views of Skye’s misty hills and crags, the sea stretching out ahead. The group set out to hike to the pinnacle.
Dan’s brother and Gabriella’s friends strode ahead. But Gabriella and Dan took it slow, more focused on each other than the views.
“We were just walking a lot and asking a lot of questions to each other,” says Gabriella.
In the end, Gabriella and Dan stopped before they reached the top of the ridge, sitting on one of the lower crags together, completely caught up in one another.
“Going up to the Old Man of Storr, that, for me, that’s when I really felt a connection,” says Dan.
He barely knew Gabriella, but felt like he could be himself with her. He’d never really experienced anything like it.
Gabriella really liked Dan.
“We talked a lot,” says Gabriella. “He was very sweet.”
But for Gabriella, the situation was more complicated. She was dating someone back in Italy. And while Dan was a romantic, Gabriella was more pragmatic. She didn’t think their connection would outlast their time in Scotland.
“We had this trip that was very romantic. There was this big connection, but it was a short trip,” says Gabriella. “It wasn’t going to lead anywhere.”

When the tour came to an end and the group returned to Edinburgh, Gabriella and Dan said goodbye, not sure exactly where they stood. They swapped email addresses.
“I remember emailing her almost as soon as I arrived back home,” Dan says.
Dan and Gabriella “kept in touch for a little bit,” says Gabriella.
But before long, she cut things off.
“I shortly after decided it was better not to keep in touch,” she says. “I wanted to focus on my life in Italy.
“I had no desire to move to America. I had a different life and I was like, ‘You know this is not going anywhere. It’s better that we don’t keep this thing going.’”
To Gabriella, her life in Italy felt real, and the time with Dan in Scotland felt like a dream. She tried to draw a line and move on. To make it final, she blocked Dan’s email address.
When Dan received Gabriella’s goodbye email, he was “a little distraught.”
He tried to move on too, but it wasn’t easy.
“I was always thinking about her,” he says.
The trip to Scotland had also opened up Dan’s world and given him a bit of wanderlust. The following year, in 2003, he returned to Europe, backpacking through various European cities for three months.
Dan incorporated Gabriella’s hometown of Pisa into the itinerary – partly to see the Leaning Tower, but mostly because he hoped, against the odds, that he might bump into the girl he’d met the summer before in Scotland.
When his train pulled into Pisa station, Dan couldn’t help but glance around, hopefully, for Gabriella.
“She had told me that she had worked at the Pisa train station as a barista,” he says. “But of course, she wasn’t there.”
Back in the US, Dan dated a couple of other people, but it never got serious.
“There wasn’t that connection. It definitely was not the same. And not what I felt with her.”
He created a website, adding the photos from his three-month European trip.
And then, in 2006, Gabriella’s surprise email landed in his inbox.
When Dan read Gabriella’s email, he was in disbelief.
“She was always in the back of my mind,” he says. “I always hoped that we could reconnect somehow. And so of course, when I got the email, I was overjoyed.”
He replied right away. Gabriella wrote back. The two started emailing regularly, “chatting a lot,” as Gabriella puts it.
“It’s just so crazy that he hadn’t forgotten about me, because as I said, it was a short trip. But he’d been thinking about me,” she says.
They tried video calling – a relatively new concept in 2006. It was hard to get much detail from the grainy, webcam images. But hearing each other’s voices again was special.
“We literally talked about everything,” says Dan.
By coincidence, when Gabriella re-entered Dan’s life, he was in the middle of planning a trip to Oktoberfest in Munich, Germany.
“I had no plans to go to Italy when I started planning it. But then when I got the email from her, I decided, ‘Well, I’m going to make my way down to Italy, for sure,’” says Dan.
Dan and Gabriella agreed to meet in the Tuscan hilltop town of Siena, not far from her home city of Pisa, in September 2006.
On the bus to Siena, Gabriella told herself, “We’re just going to meet and I’ll show him around.” While Gabriella had enjoyed speaking with Dan online, she was “still very much in denial” about what might happen next.
The moment Gabriella and Dan saw one another again was charged.
“When I saw her get off the bus, I cried,” says Dan. “I was just incredibly happy to see her again.”
“I didn’t expect it to be so emotional when I actually saw him and I didn’t expect to be so struck by him,” says Gabriella. “I was struck by his eyes again. It was just romantic. I didn’t think it would be so striking, but it was. There was just something between us.”
“A connection,” says Dan.
“Something very, very unique,” agrees Gabriella. “From the moment we saw each other. It’s hard to explain.”
Gabriella and Dan spent the day wandering around Siena together. They couldn’t stop looking at each other and smiling, almost giddy with excitement.
“I remember walking around Piazza del Campo and how happy I was to be there with her,” says Dan.
When they said goodbye, things were still “open-ended,” says Dan. But unlike when they parted ways in Scotland, there seemed to be a promise of a future.
“I believe Siena was the moment that the wheels started turning for the both of us, as far as beginning to actually think about what it would mean to pursue a real relationship with one another,” Dan says.
For Gabriella, the years apart, the unexpected reunion, and the fact the connection was still there gave her the confidence to embrace her feelings for Dan.
“I do think we both needed those few more years of growth to truly find each other,” she says.

A couple of months later, Gabriella planned a trip to the US to visit Dan in Chicago. She intended to stay for almost a month.
“Three, four weeks, something like that – which was a pretty crazy thing to do for a guy that I didn’t know that well,” says Gabriella.
On Gabriella’s first evening, Dan took her out for dinner with his brother Bill and his wife, and his mother.
“It was a bit overwhelming to meet his mom the first night I got there,” says Gabriella.
But despite being tired from the flight, Gabriella felt immediately welcomed by Dan’s family. It was great to see Bill again. It was exciting to be in the US. And Dan held her hand all evening.
The only hiccup during the four-week trip was Gabriella discovering Dan’s cooking ability – or lack thereof.
“I always say that I saved him because he was so deprived, he ate so bad,” says Gabriella, laughing. “He told me, ‘I’m going to take you to have the best breakfast ever.’ And he took me to McDonald’s.”
As an Italian foodie, Gabriella was slightly horrified. But part of her also found it endearing. And over the course of her trip, she taught Dan to cook pasta.
The following year, in 2007, Gabriella returned to the US, taking some time off work to stay with Dan for three months. While she was there, Gabriella studied for a qualification to teach Italian as a foreign language.
By then, Gabriella and Dan were talking about their future and what being together long-term might look like. They didn’t want to date across continents for too long. They talked about Dan moving to Italy, or Gabriella moving to the US.
“It was pretty fast, but at the same time, we knew that it was serious,” says Gabriella.
As Dan was more settled in his job, and owned a house, Gabiella moving to the US felt like the obvious choice.
“He had the more stable life,” says Gabriella.
So she made plans to move, getting a job as an Italian teacher at a language school in the Chicago area. And in November 2007, Dan proposed. The couple were on vacation in the historic town of Galena, Illinois.
“We had a nice, romantic evening at the house that we’re staying at,” recalls Dan. “I felt that was the time and so I proposed to her in Italian. And she said yes.”
Dan and Gabriella had a small wedding ceremony in the US in 2008 and then a big wedding party in 2009 in Italy, at “a beautiful Renaissance villa in the countryside with wonderful frescoes,” called Villa di Corliano, in the Tuscan town of San Giuliano.
Gabriella’s college friends who’d been there when she first met Dan in Scotland came along to celebrate.
“It was a fun reunion,” says Gabriella.
Gabriella and Dan’s wedding celebration was characterized by happy tears.
“When I walked in, we were both crying,” says Gabriella. “Dan cried when he saw me. I was crying the moment I walked in anyway. So it was just really sweet.”
Dan didn’t know much Italian – despite his best efforts to learn. He’d started calling Gabriella “mi amore” – which, as Gabriella pointed out to him, is “grammatically wrong.” But she found it adorable.
“I had that engraved inside my wedding ring,” she says. “And then I call him ‘sweetie.’ So he has ‘sweetie’ inside his ring.”
While Dan struggled with Italian, he wanted Gabriella to hear wedding vows in her first language.
So he wrote down what he wanted to say, translated the phrases into Italian and memorized them.
“It was just very, very sweet,” says Gabriella.
At the wedding, Gabriella and Dan also shared with their guests some additional happy news – Gabriella was pregnant.
“It was cute for us to announce it at the wedding,” says Gabriella.

Newly married, Gabriella and Dan started a new chapter together in the US. They were excited to be together, and thrilled about the upcoming birth of their child.
But for Gabriella, moving abroad was tough.
“I know a lot of people dream of moving to the States, but it wasn’t one of my dreams,” she says. “It was pretty tough because Chicago is a super-duper cold place.”
Gabriella was aware, before she moved, that relocating across the world was a big step. She wanted to be with Dan, but she knew she’d miss Italy and her family and friends.
Before making the decision, Gabriella spoke with her mother, who she figured would be able to empathize with her mixed emotions.
Gabriella’s mother was from Brazil, and her father is from Italy. In the mid-1970s, Gabriella’s mother moved across the globe from Brazil to Italy to be with him. The couple met a few years earlier, when Gabriella’s dad was visiting Rio de Janeiro.
“She showed him around Rio and he said he would come back in two years and marry her,” says Gabriella. “Two years later they were in fact married. I of course don’t know all the details, as a kid I thought it was the most romantic story ever.”
Her parents’ love story meant Gabriella grew up thinking “the idea of someone moving away to be with someone” wasn’t “completely implausible.” But it also meant Gabriella knew some of the challenges of leaving one’s own country behind.
Gabriella’s mother cautioned Gabriella to consider the decision carefully.
“She did say that I had to think about it, because it was a big choice to move.”
But Gabriella’s mother also told her daughter to follow her heart. Her dad agreed.
“They both saw that Dan was special and very committed – the love was showing,” says Gabriella. “They liked him right away.”
As Gabriella and Dan established their family in the US – welcoming their first child in 2009 and their second a few years later – they made regular trips back to Italy to visit whenever they could. Gabriella taught her children Italian, and educated them on their Brazilian heritage.
And while adjusting to cold Chicago was tough, Gabriella credits moving to the US with discovering an unexpected new career.
She’d always loved drawing and doodling, but until she lived in the US, she never considered turning that hobby into a job. Living in Italy, she associated art with “Michelangelo.”
“For good or bad, there’s the weight of Italian history and all the art that came before,” says Gabriella.
Calling herself an artist in Italy felt wrong. But in the US, she found a “different mentality.” To Gabriella, American art and design felt “a lot more innovative.”
So when her kids were little, Gabriella went back to school to study children’s book illustration. Now she draws for a living.

Today, Gabriella and Dan live in Seattle with their two teenage kids. They moved to Seattle a couple of years ago, and realized the landscape reminded them a bit of Scotland, the place where they’d first met and fell in love.
“We were both so drawn to it, because there’s a similarity – not only the weather, it’s kind of rainy, gray – but also the ocean, the rocks, the wilderness,” says Gabriella.
While Gabriella and Dan haven’t returned to Scotland together, they would love to. They want to go to Skye and make it to the top of the Old Man of Storr this time round.
In the meantime, they’ve been focusing on exploring new places together.
“We have that in common that we like to travel a lot, explore new things, new places,” says Gabriella.
While a love of adventure unites them, Gabriella and Dan insist they’re quite different in many other ways. He’s a self-described computer programming “nerd.” She’s passionate about art and music. He’s a romantic. She’s more pragmatic.
But there’s “something deeper that we have in common,” as Gabriella puts it.
“Maybe just our perspective on what is important in life,” says Gabriella. “We both think that our family is the first thing – our kids are the first thing – and not work.”
They support each other through the tough times too, such as when Gabriella’s mother passed away in 2022.
Today, after 15 years of marriage, Gabriella likes to say her relationship with Dan is a “vacation fling gone wrong.”
“Because a vacation fling, it’s supposed to end on vacation,” she says, laughing. “How crazy that is that he’s the guy that I met in Scotland on that trip and we’re married and have kids and we’re happy.”
Dan says if you told 22-year-old him, sitting on the Old Man of Storr next to Gabriella, that he’d end up married to this Italian stranger, he’d have absolutely believed you. He never got over that first meeting.
“I immediately felt that connection,” he says, adding that reuniting with Gabriella and building a life with her feels like “winning the lottery.”
“I feel incredibly lucky to have met Gabi back in 2002 and incredibly lucky that we reconnected again years later,” says Dan. “I would not be who I am today without having had her by my side.”
“I also feel like we were incredibly lucky,” says Gabriella. “I look at my kids and think about all the incredible coincidences that had to happen just for them to be here now and it blows my mind.
“I can’t believe how lucky we have been, but also I think that when you know you know. I’m glad I followed my heart.”"
BX1708K3P1_SQDOZ1SOS15OB38,Nikki Haley sweeps 6-person midnight vote in New Hampshire,"By Eva McKend and Jack Forrest, CNN","3 minute read Updated 6:26 AM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/23/politics/dixville-notch-new-hampshire-primary/,"Voters in Dixville Notch have cast the first votes in the New Hampshire primary, with all six voters choosing former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley.
“A great start to a great day in New Hampshire,” Haley said in a statement reacting to the vote minutes after it was recorded. “Thank you Dixville Notch!”
The tiny town in northern New Hampshire opened and closed its poll just after midnight ET on the morning of the state’s primary. Four registered Republican voters and two independents participated in the vote, in which former President Donald Trump, the front-runner for the GOP presidential nomination, failed to earn support.
In New Hampshire’s northern tip, Dixville Notch is the first place to declare primary results because voters there cast ballots so early. Its midnight voting tradition dates back to 1960.
While the neighboring cities of Hart’s Location and Millsfield began midnight voting earlier than that, they haven’t participated continuously and aren’t conducting midnight voting this year. A fictionalized version of the three neighbors was featured in an episode of Aaron Sorkin’s “West Wing” dubbed “Hartsfield’s Landing.”
Midnight voting in Dixville Notch has historically been held at the now-dormant Balsams Hotel, which has become a media event over the years.
Recently, with the hotel closed and awaiting redevelopment, there have been questions about whether Dixville Notch would have enough voters, but the tradition has continued.
As its population has dwindled over the years, Dixville Notch’s hold on the mini-contest is a success story for local leaders – and a reason to smile for political junkies eager for an early taste of what’s to come.
In 2020, voters backed former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg in the Democratic primary, but went on to support the eventual winner in the general election, unanimously casting five votes for Joe Biden.
Biden’s name did not appear on the ballot, and no delegates will be awarded because of a dispute between the state and the Democratic National Committee, which moved the first approved primary to South Carolina. Democratic Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesota appeared on the ballot but did not receive any votes.
According to Town Moderator Tom Tillotson, his father – former Balsams resort owner Neil Tillotson – worked to get Dixville Notch incorporated specifically so the community could vote and residents would not be forced to travel close to an hour away in the snow to participate in elections.
But he cautioned against thinking the midnight results would be too instructive.
“There’s no magic bullet that comes out of here that tells people what to do or what’s going to happen. Sometimes we are right. Sometimes we are wrong,” said Tillotson.
The core takeaway, he said, is that people should not shy away from participating in the democratic process.
“If all these people in the wilderness can get up at midnight and go vote, 100% of the town, maybe we should take voting a little more seriously. If we do anything positive, it’s maybe encourage a few extra people to vote,” Tillotson said.

BXH6DQ2XKG_VBQXULMC3JC7UKD,Mammography AI can cost patients extra. Is it worth it?,"By Michelle Andrews, KFF Health News","6 minute read Published 6:00 AM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/26/health/ai-mammograms-kff-health-news/,"As I checked in at a Manhattan radiology clinic for my annual mammogram in November, the front desk staffer reviewing my paperwork asked an unexpected question: Would I like to spend $40 for an artificial intelligence analysis of my mammogram? It’s not covered by insurance, she added.
I had no idea how to evaluate that offer. Feeling upsold, I said no. But it got me thinking: Is this something I should add to my regular screening routine? Is my regular mammogram not accurate enough? If this AI analysis is so great, why doesn’t insurance cover it?
I’m not the only person posing such questions. The mother of a colleague had a similar experience when she went for a mammogram recently at a suburban Baltimore clinic. She was given a pink pamphlet that said: “You Deserve More. More Accuracy. More Confidence. More power with artificial intelligence behind your mammogram.” The price tag was the same: $40. She also declined.

In recent years, AI software that helps radiologists detect problems or diagnose cancer using mammography has been moving into clinical use. The software can store and evaluate large datasets of images and identify patterns and abnormalities that human radiologists might miss. It typically highlights potential problem areas in an image and assesses any likely malignancies. This extra review has enormous potential to improve the detection of suspicious breast masses and lead to earlier diagnoses of breast cancer.
While studies showing better detection rates are extremely encouraging, some radiologists say, more research and evaluation are needed before drawing conclusions about the value of the routine use of these tools in regular clinical practice.
“I see the promise and I hope it will help us,” said Etta Pisano, a radiologist who is chief research officer at the American College of Radiology, a professional group for radiologists. However, “it really is ambiguous at this point whether it will benefit an individual woman,” she said. “We do need more information.”
The radiology clinics that my colleague’s mother and I visited are both part of RadNet, a company with a network of more than 350 imaging centers around the country. RadNet introduced its AI product for mammography in New York and New Jersey last February and has since rolled it out in several other states, according to Gregory Sorensen, the company’s chief science officer.
Sorensen pointed to research the company conducted with 18 radiologists, some of whom were specialists in breast mammography and some of whom were generalists who spent less than 75% of their time reading mammograms. The doctors were asked to find the cancers in 240 images, with and without AI. Every doctor’s performance improved using AI, Sorensen said.
Among all radiologists, “not every doctor is equally good,” Sorensen said. With RadNet’s AI tool, “it’s as if all patients get the benefit of our very top performer.”
But is the tech analysis worth the extra cost to patients? There’s no easy answer.

“Some people are always going to be more anxious about their mammograms, and using AI may give them more reassurance,” said Laura Heacock, a breast imaging specialist at NYU Langone Health’s Perlmutter Cancer Center in New York. The health system has developed AI models and is testing the technology with mammograms but doesn’t yet offer it to patients, she said.
Still, Heacock said, women shouldn’t worry that they need to get an additional AI analysis if it’s offered.
“At the end of the day, you still have an expert breast imager interpreting your mammogram, and that is the standard of care,” she said.
About 1 in 8 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer during their lifetime, and regular screening mammograms are recommended to help identify cancerous tumors early. But mammograms are hardly foolproof: They miss about 20% of breast cancers, according to the National Cancer Institute.
The FDA has authorized roughly two dozen AI products to help detect and diagnose cancer from mammograms. However, there are currently no billing codes radiologists can use to charge health plans for the use of AI to interpret mammograms. Typically, the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services would introduce new billing codes and private health plans would follow their lead for payment. But that hasn’t happened in this field yet and it’s unclear when or if it will.
CMS didn’t respond to requests for comment.
Thirty-five percent of women who visit a RadNet facility for mammograms pay for the additional AI review, Sorensen said.
Radiology practices don’t handle payment for AI mammography all in the same way.
The practices affiliated with Boston-based Massachusetts General Hospital don’t charge patients for the AI analysis, said Constance Lehman, a professor of radiology at Harvard Medical School who is co-director of the Breast Imaging Research Center at Mass General.
Asking patients to pay “isn’t a model that will support equity,” Lehman said, since only patients who can afford the extra charge will get the enhanced analysis. She said she believes many radiologists would never agree to post a sign listing a charge for AI analysis because it would be off-putting to low-income patients.
Sorensen said RadNet’s goal is to stop charging patients once health plans realize the value of the screening and start paying for it.
Some large trials are underway in the United States, though much of the published research on AI and mammography to date has been done in Europe. There, the standard practice is for two radiologists to read a mammogram, whereas in the States only one radiologist typically evaluates a screening test.
Interim results from the highly regarded MASAI randomized controlled trial of 80,000 women in Sweden found that cancer detection rates were 20% higher in women whose mammograms were read by a radiologist using AI compared with women whose mammograms were read by two radiologists without any AI intervention, which is the standard of care there.
“The MASAI trial was great, but will that generalize to the U.S.? We can’t say,” Lehman said.

In addition, there is a need for “more diverse training and testing sets for AI algorithm development and refinement” across different races and ethnicities, said Christoph Lee, director of the Northwest Screening and Cancer Outcomes Research Enterprise at the University of Washington School of Medicine.
The long shadow of an earlier and largely unsuccessful type of computer-assisted mammography hangs over the adoption of newer AI tools. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, “computer-assisted detection” software promised to improve breast cancer detection. Then the studies started coming in, and the results were often far from encouraging. Using CAD at best provided no benefit, and at worst reduced the accuracy of radiologists’ interpretations, resulting in higher rates of recalls and biopsies.
“CAD was not that sophisticated,” said Robert Smith, senior vice president of early cancer detection science at the American Cancer Society. Artificial intelligence tools today are a whole different ballgame, he said. “You can train the algorithm to pick up things, or it learns on its own.”
Smith said he found it “troubling” that radiologists would charge for the AI analysis.
“There are too many women who can’t afford any out-of-pocket cost” for a mammogram, Smith said. “If we’re not going to increase the number of radiologists we use for mammograms, then these new AI tools are going to be very useful, and I don’t think we can defend charging women extra for them.”

BYD827ZV67_J071AIDN907BTUR,China’s largest oil supplier in 2023 was Russia,"By Laura He, CNN","3 minute read Published 2:25 AM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20231223,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/22/business/china-top-oil-supplier-2023-russia-intl-hnk/,"Russia surpassed Saudi Arabia to become China’s largest oil supplier in 2023, according to the latest Chinese customs data.
The world’s largest crude buyer imported a record amount of bargain-priced Russian oil last year, taking advantage of Moscow’s desperate search for new buyers amid Western sanctions following the Kremlin’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
The volume of Russian crude shipped to China jumped 24% in 2023 to 107.02 million metric tons, compared to 2022, according to data released by China’s General Administration of Customs on Saturday.
That helped Russia overtake Saudi Arabia as China’s largest crude oil supplier for the year. The Middle Eastern country shipped 85.96 million metric tons of crude oil to China in 2023, down 2% from 2022.
Russia now accounts for 19% of China’s oil imports, while Saudi Arabia makes up 15%.
Russia became China’s largest oil supplier eight years ago, but it fell behind Saudi Arabia between 2019 and 2021, when the Gulf nation boosted its energy trade with Beijing.
However, since 2022, China has amplified its purchase of cheaper Russian oil after the West hit Moscow with unprecedented sanctions. China’s imports of Russian crude increased 8% in 2022 to 86.24 million metric tons, compared to 2021. Its neighbor India also ramped up its purchases sharply.
“China would necessarily maximize intake of discounted crude,” said Vandana Hari, founder of Vanda Insights based in Singapore. “Russian barrels were way cheaper than comparable grades through 2023, being limited to the Chinese and Indian markets, more or less.”
China’s total spending on Russian crude reached $60.64 billion last year. That translates to an average import price of $566.64 per metric ton, according to CNN’s calculation. This was about 10% cheaper than the average price it paid for Saudi crude, which was $626.86 per metric ton.
Russia’s oil discounts have helped China reduce its energy bills. Despite an 11% increase in its overall volume of crude imports, including from Saudi Arabia and Iraq, its total spending on oil purchases actually dropped 7.7% in 2023 to $337.5 billion compared to 2022, customs data showed.
According to Hari, Saudi’s production cut also helped Russia to leapfrog. The Gulf nation implemented an additional voluntary output cut of 1 million barrels per day from July through December last year. Though Russia also volunteered additional output and export cuts, they were about half of the Saudi reduction, she added.
Despite the war, Beijing and Moscow have developed closer ties in areas other than energy over the last two years.
Overall trade between China and Russia hit a fresh record high of $240 billion in 2023, up 26% from the previous year. That means the two countries have achieved a goal set in 2019 about a year ahead of schedule.
In the two years since the invasion, hundreds of global brands have fled Russia. That’s forced Russians to find alternatives for everything from smartphones to cars, with Chinese firms often benefiting.
Last month, Chinese leader Xi Jinping hailed Beijing’s partnership with Moscow in a meeting with Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin.
The trade figures showed a “strong resilience and broad prospects,” Xi said during the meeting in Beijing, according to Chinese state news agency Xinhua.
The two sides should “give full play to the advantages of political mutual trust,” and “deepen cooperation on economy, trade, energy and connectivity,” Xi added.

In an interview with Spanish newspaper El País, the “Griselda” star revealed that she and Manganiello disagreed about having children, according to People magazine.
“My marriage broke up because my husband was younger; he wanted to have kids and I didn’t want to be an old mom,” Vergara reportedly said. “I feel it’s not fair to the baby. I respect whoever does it, but that’s not for me anymore.”
Vergara, 51, is the mother of an adult son Manolo, whom she shares with her ex-husband. Manganiello is 47.
Vergara said she’s ready to move on to the next stage of her life.
“I had a son at 19, who is now 32, and I’m ready to be a grandmother, not a mother, she said. “So, if love comes along, he has to come with [his own] children.”
CNN has reached out to representatives for Vergara and Manganiello for comment.
Vergara will next be seen as the title character on “Griselda” about the female drug lord Griselda Blanco. It starts streaming on Netflix Thursday."
C59X0XBXOF_ANWK38JLE50ZS6K,"Biden family business associate had no contact with Joe Biden, lawyer says","By Annie Grayer, CNN","4 minute read Updated 5:44 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/25/politics/mervyn-yan-gop-investigators-interview/,"House Republicans interviewed a former business associate of Hunter and James Biden on Thursday who told Congress ahead of the interview he had “no contact” with President Joe Biden, according to a letter obtained by CNN.
The letter sent to House Oversight Chairman James Comer on Wednesday is the latest example of a witness undercutting Republican allegations related to their impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden.
The committees conducting the investigation subpoenaed Mervyn Yan in November for his testimony, claiming that he may know whether the president had been involved in his family’s business dealings, an unproven allegation that rests at the heart of their probe.
But Yan’s lawyer wrote to Congress on Wednesday to refute that allegation.
“Throughout his interactions with Hunter and James Biden, Mr. Yan never met, spoke to, did business with, or had any personal or professional communication with President Biden, who was then the former Vice President of the United States,” Yan attorney Soumya Dayananda wrote to Comer, a Republican from Kentucky.
“He never heard mention of President Biden with respect to any of the transactions pursued by Hudson West III and is unaware of any involvement President Biden may have had with his son’s business pursuits,” Dayananda added.
As a result, Dayananda wrote, “Mr. Yan does not possess any materials or information bearing on President Biden’s alleged involvement in his family’s business dealings.”
Dayananda also mentioned that Comer never responded to a letter she wrote to him last year, outlining that her client was a private citizen who never worked with the president, and therefore should not be a target of congressional oversight.
“He is not a public official and he is not himself a valid target for inquiry. He has had no professional contact or communication with President Biden at any time,” Dayananda wrote in May to Comer.
Dayananda’s letter in May was in response to a separate subpoena from the House Oversight Committee for a broad array of documents related to his business dealings.
Yan, a Chinese-American businessman, worked with Hunter and James Biden, the president’s son and brother, on a joint venture involving a Chinese-backed energy company that dissolved in 2018, when Joe Biden was not in office. Yan worked as an “independent consultant” on the joint venture, known as Hudson West III, between Hunter Biden and a Chinese executive named Gongwen Dong, according to Dayananda.
As part of the joint venture agreement, the president’s son drew a monthly compensation of $100,000 and the president’s brother drew a monthly compensation of $65,000, Yan’s lawyer added. Yan, per Dayananda, is unaware of where the funding for the initial $5 million operating budget originated from.
Hunter Biden began to “investigate potential infrastructure projects” with the Chinese-backed energy company, CEFC, in 2015, when Joe Biden was vice president, according to the recent indictment in the federal tax case against the president’s son.
A House Oversight Committee aide told CNN that Republican members of the panel are concerned about the veracity of the letter Yan’s attorney sent based on the facts and information obtained in the investigation and that is why Yan is being cross examined about claims contained in the letter.
Following the interview, Comer said in a statement provided to CNN, “Mervyn Yan admitted on the record the Bidens had no experience in the energy and infrastructure sectors and was not sure what they brought to the table. His testimony raises many questions about the Bidens’ dealings with the Chinese government linked energy firm.”
“We will release the transcript from Mervyn Yan’s interview soon,” Comer added.
Meanwhile, the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, Rep. Jamie Raskin, said in a statement on X after the interview, “Mervyn Yan testified to the Committee today that he has no evidence of wrongdoing by President Biden and that, to his knowledge, President Biden was not involved in, did not profit from, and took no official actions in relation to his family’s business dealings.”
Republicans have continued to dig in on Hunter Biden’s foreign business dealings and have raised concerns about the transactions that came out of the joint venture with Yan.

C927CM4CHC_LA212OBUWKDAXGU,The man who captured images of a long-forgotten Ghana,"By Zoe Whitfield, CNN","4 minute read Published 1:02 AM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/23/style/jk-bruce-vanderpuije-archive/,"While visiting London to see the work of her grandfather, the late Ghanaian photographer J.K. Bruce-Vanderpuije, at the 2023 contemporary African art fair “1-54,” Kate Tamakloe was surprised to discover another of his images, uncredited, in the collection at the British capital’s Victoria and Albert Museum.
“I asked how they got the photo and was told it was in the library,” she recalled in an interview with CNN. “We have the original (in our archives), but somehow a copy got taken to the UK, and along the line, its history got lost.”
One of West Africa’s foremost documentarians of the 20th century, Bruce-Vanderpuije created a prolific record of life in pre- and post-independence Ghana, illustrating the country’s changing fashions and cultural practices with portraits of young couples getting married, newborn babies and everyday life for over 70 years. He also encountered a number of important community leaders and political figures throughout his career, among them Kwame Nkrumah, the first president of Ghana following its independence from Britain in March 1957.
For more than a decade — since Tamakloe began managing the Deo Gratias Photo Studio, which her grandfather set up in the Jamestown area of Accra, Ghana in 1922 — she has overseen an archive of some 50,000 images. Championing them and rectifying oversights in international collections has become a vital part of her job.
Spellbinding photos capture the ‘mermaid’ divers of South Korea
In collaboration with Efie Gallery in Dubai, the Ethiopian photographer Aïda Muluneh has curated a new exhibition titled “Unveiling the Shadows of the Past: J.K. Bruce-Vanderpuije — The Hidden Icon of Photography in Africa” that highlights images from the 1920s and 1930s, when Ghana was still a British colony (then called the Gold Coast).
“When I look at Bruce-Vanderpuije’s work, I think about the responsibility we bear (for) preserving the changing faces of the continent,” Muluneh told CNN.
“His dedication to the field and the amassed body of work is a diary of a country and its people,” she added, alluding to the significant events Bruce-Vanderpuije captured, including the moment three ex-servicemen protesting unpaid war allowances were fatally shot. The incident sparked the 1948 Accra riots and would inform constitutional changes that shaped the country’s eventual independence.
“Photographers of that generation were not capturing images for recognition or with the aim of being showcased in an exhibition,” explained Muluneh. “It was a necessity to preserve a moment in history.”
Born in March 1899, James Kobla (J.K) Bruce-Vanderpuije studied at the Accra Royal School and enjoyed photography as a hobby in his teens. Later, he trained with J.A.C Holm (another Ghana-based photographer) for three years before establishing his own studio aged just 23.
Despite growing up privy to the studio and her grandfather’s practice, Tamakloe’s involvement was almost happenstance; after an accident caused her to move her cybercafé business to the studio, she began supporting her father — Isaac Hudson Bruce-Vanderpuije, also a photographer and an earlier custodian of the studio — when his eyesight started to deteriorate.
“Once, a photographer from South Africa visited and said, ‘You guys are sitting on a goldmine,’” she explained. “That’s when I paid more attention and realized that I needed to do this. I needed to sort out the archive.”
For the past 12 years, Tamakloe has been digitalizing her grandfather’s pictures. “I’m still making a lot of discoveries, which is very exciting,” she added, recounting how some of Bruce-Vanderpuije’s subjects were identified decades later — including Miss Ghana 1958 and Seth Anthony, the first Black African to be commissioned as an officer in the British army, who were both recognized in pictures by their grown-up children.

“I have always been fascinated to see the reaction of the young generation when they see images of people from the past,” noted Muluneh, who has worked on a number of archive-building projects in Ethiopia. “The magic of photography, for me, is that it can bring us back to a time and moments that offer a unique perspective of not only understanding our people, but also ourselves. I believe that a bigger discussion is needed as it relates to the preservation, publication and promotion of the visual archives of Africa.”
Tamakloe is similarly engaged in pursuing this conversation, and keen to export her grandfather’s work more broadly. Ultimately, she said, “I would like to tell the Ghanaian story, truthfully.”
Today, nearly two years after celebrating its centenary, Deo Gratias is widely considered to be the oldest operational photo studio in West Africa, and is still largely used as it was in its early years (albeit with a different, smaller crowd), said Tamakloe. “It’s in a very densely populated area and we have a lot of festivals happening around us — we’re also surrounded by churches — so people still come and have their photograph taken all dressed up,” she explained.
With a shift in new technologies and the way we interact with photography evolving, however, Tamakloe acknowledged that most people now look elsewhere for their mementos. “People do come and have passport pictures taken, but it’s not as busy as it used to be,” she said. “These days, people take photographs on their phones. Those who do come in though, want a print to keep and probably frame.”
“Unveiling the Shadows of the Past: J. K. Bruce-Vanderpuije — The Hidden Icon of Photography in Africa” runs until Feb. 20, 2024 at Efie Gallery, Dubai."
CBB2X1BVM4_CYT8B0VBYNOAJ9Y,Redistricting fights in these states could determine which party controls the US House,"By Fredreka Schouten, CNN","11 minute read Published 5:50 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,http://www.cnn.com/politics/redistricting-states-congressional-maps-house/,"Around the country, politicians are waging high-stakes battles over new congressional lines that could influence which party controls the US House of Representatives after the 2024 election.
In North Carolina, the Republicans who control the state legislature have crafted a map that could help them flip at least three seats. Democrats, meanwhile, could pick up seats under news lines in Alabama, Louisiana and New York.
In all, the fate of anywhere from 14 to 18 House seats across nearly a dozen states could turn on the results of these fights. Republicans currently hold just a narrow majority in the US House, with one vacancy. That razor-thin margin was underscored by the GOP’s recent chaotic struggle to elect a new speaker.
“Given that the majority is so narrow, every outcome matters to the fight for House control in 2024,” said David Wasserman, who follows redistricting closely as senior editor and elections analyst for The Cook Political Report with Amy Walter.
And with fewer competitive districts that swing between the political parties, Wasserman added, “every line change is almost existential.”
Related article Lawsuit seeks to block North Carolina congressional map, alleging it discriminates against minority voters
Experts say several other factors have helped lead to the slew of consequential – and unresolved – redistricting disputes, just months before the first primaries of the 2024 cycle.
They include pandemic-related delays in completing the 2020 census – the once-a-decade population count that kicks off congressional and state legislative redistricting – as well as a 2019 Supreme Court ruling that threw decisions about partisan gerrymandering back to state courts.
In addition, some litigation had been frozen in place until the US Supreme Court’s surprise ruling in June, which found that a Republican-crafted redistricting plan in Alabama disadvantaged Black voters in the state and was in violation of the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act.
That decision “is functionally reanimating all of these dormant cases,” said Adam Kincaid, the president and executive director of the National Republican Redistricting Trust, which supports the GOP’s redistricting efforts.
Kincaid said it’s too soon to tell whether Republicans or Democrats will emerge with the advantage by Election Day 2024. In his view, either party could gain or lose only about two seats over redistricting.
In many of the closely watched states where action is pending, just a single seat hangs in the balance, with two notable exceptions: North Carolina and New York, where multiple seats are at stake. Republicans controlled the map-drawing in the Tar Heel State, while a ruling by New York’s highest court leaves the job ultimately to the Democrats who control the state legislature, potentially canceling out each party’s gains.
“Democrats kind of need to run the table in the rest of these states” to gain any edge, said Nick Seabrook, a political scientist at the University of North Florida and the author of the 2022 book “One Person, One Vote: A Surprising History of Gerrymandering in America.”
Here’s a state-by-state look at recent and upcoming redistricting disputes that could shape the 2024 race for control of the US House:
North Carolina’s legislature, where Republicans hold a supermajority, has drawn new congressional lines that observers say could prove a windfall for the GOP and boost the party’s chances of retaining its House majority next year.
The state’s current House delegation is split 7-7 between Democrats and Republicans.
A map that state lawmakers recently approved puts three House Democrats in what one expert called “almost impossible to win” districts.
The affected Democrats are Reps. Jeff Jackson, who currently represents a Charlotte-area district; Wiley Nickel, who holds a Raleigh-area seat; and Kathy Manning, who represents Greensboro and other parts of north-central North Carolina. All three have announced they will not seek reelection to the House.
A fourth Democrat, Rep. Don Davis, saw his district retooled to become more friendly toward Republicans while remaining competitive for both parties.
State-level gains in the 2022 midterm elections have given the GOP new sway over redistricting in this swing state. Last year, Republicans flipped North Carolina’s Supreme Court, whose members are chosen in partisan elections. The new GOP majority on the court this year tossed out a 2022 ruling by the then-Democratic leaning court against partisan gerrymandering.
A map that had been created after the Democratic-led high court’s ruling resulted in the current even split in the state’s House delegation.
Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper does not have veto power over redistricting legislation. A group of Black and Latino residents of North Carolina recently filed a lawsuit alleging that the GOP-approved map “intentionally discriminates” against minority voters in violation of the US Constitution.
In one of the cycle’s highest-profile redistricting cases, a three-judge panel in Alabama approved a map that creates a second congressional district with a substantial Black population. Before the court action, Alabama – which is 27% Black – had only one Black-majority congressional district out of seven seats.
The fight over the map went all the way to the Supreme Court – which issued a surprise ruling, affirming a lower-court opinion that ordered Alabama to include a second Black-majority district or “something quite close to it.” Under the map that will be in place for the 2024 election, the state’s 2nd District now loops into Mobile to create a seat where nearly half the population is Black.
The high court’s 5-4 decision in June saw two conservatives, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, side with the three liberals to uphold the lower-court ruling. Their action kept intact a key pillar of the Voting Rights Act: that it’s illegal to draw maps that effectively keep Black voters from electing a candidate of their choice.
The ruling has reverberated around the country and could affect the outcome of similar court cases underway in Louisiana and Georgia that center on whether Republican-drawn maps improperly diluted Black political power in those states.
Given that Black voters in Alabama have traditionally backed Democrats, the party now stands a better chance of winning the newly reconfigured district and sending to of its members to Congress after next year’s elections.
The new map also could result in two Black US House members from Alabama serving together for the first time in state history.
Facing a court-ordered deadline, the Republican-controlled state legislature in January approved a map with a second, Black-majority district that will be in effect for this year’s elections.
The action, which is viewed as a win for Democrats, endangers a seat now held by Republican Rep. Garret Graves.
The new map follows a protracted legal battle over the state’s district lines.
Although Black people make up roughly a third of the state’s population, Louisiana has just one Black lawmaker – who is also the lone Democrat – in its six-member congressional delegation.
A federal judge threw out the state’s Republican-drawn map in 2022, saying it likely violated the Voting Rights Act. Republican officials in the state appealed to the US Supreme Court, which put the lower-court ruling on hold until it decided the Alabama case, which it did in June this year.
Once the high court weighed in on the Alabama case, the legal skirmishes again lurched to life in Louisiana.
A federal court had given the GOP-controlled state legislature until the end of January to draw a new map, after deciding that the lower court had ruled correctly that the lawmakers’ map improperly diluted the voting power of Louisiana’s Black residents.
If the legislature had﻿ not acted by that deadline, the lower court could have proceeded to a full trial to resolve the map in time for this year’s elections.
Georgia Republicans, who hold a governing trifecta in the state, finalized a new congressional map last year that safeguarded their party’s dominance in state politics and dashed Democrats’ hopes of adding an additional US House seat.
The new map complied with an order issued by US District Judge Steve Jones to establish an additional Black-majority district. But it preserved the GOP’s 9-5 edge in Georgia’s US House delegation by moving the Atlanta-area district represented by﻿ Rep. Lucy McBath, a Black Democrat, farther into Republican territory.
Jones had ordered state lawmakers to draw a new congressional map by December 8, arguing that the Republican-controlled legislature improperly diluted the political power of Black voters in their establishment of district boundaries following the 2020 census. In that ruling, Jones said state lawmakers’ earlier map had violated the Voting Rights Act.
In a big win for Republicans, Jones in late December ruled that the new legislature-drawn map that preserved Republicans’ 9-5 advantage “fully complied” with his order.
A separate federal case in Georgia challenges the congressional map on constitutional grounds.
Republicans flipped four US House seats in New York in the 2022 midterm elections, victories that helped secure their party’s majority in the chamber.
But a new ruling by the state’s highest court could jeopardize those gains by potentially making it easier for Democrats to pick up as many as six GOP-held seats.
First, a bit of history: A state court judge oversaw the process of drawing the current map following a long legal battle and the inability of New York’s bipartisan Independent Redistricting Commission to agree on new lines. But Democrats scored a court victory this summer when a state appellate court ruled that the redistricting commission should redraw the map.
Republicans appealed that decision, and oral arguments were held in November before New York’s Court of Appeals, the state’s highest court.
On December 12, the Court of Appeals ordered the state to once again restart the mapmaking process. New York’s redistricting commission will be tasked with creating the new districts by February 28. The Democratic-controlled state legislature would have ultimate say over the new map.
A state judge in September struck down congressional lines for northern Florida that had been championed by Gov. Ron DeSantis, ruling that the Republican governor’s map had improperly diluted Black voting power.
This case, unlike the Alabama fight decided by the US Supreme Court, centers on provisions in the state constitution.
The judge concluded that the congressional boundaries – which essentially dismantled a seat once held by Al Lawson, a Black Democrat, that connected Black communities across a northern reach of the Florida – violated the state’s Fair Districts amendments, enacted by voters. One amendment specifically bars the state from drawing a district that diminishes the ability of racial minorities “to elect representatives of their choice.”
But in December, a state appeals court upheld the map DeSantis had advocated, saying the plaintiffs “failed to present any evidence” that the earlier version of the district – which connected Black communities from Jacksonville to Tallahassee – contained a singular cohesive community that would have a right to protection under Florida’s constitution.
The case still could land before the all-Republican state Supreme Court, where DeSantis appointees hold most seats.
A separate federal case – which argues that the map violates the US Constitution – is pending.
Observers say the outcome of the state litigation is more likely than the federal case to determine the future of the North Florida district, given the state constitution’s especially strong protections for the voting rights of racial minorities and the lower burden of proof required to establish that those rights were abridged.
The Kentucky Supreme Court  in December rejected arguments from Democrats that a map drawn by the state’s Republican-controlled legislature violated the state constitution as an “extreme partisan” gerrymander.
The dispute centered on lawmakers’ decision to move Kentucky’s capital city – Democratic-leaning Frankfort – out of the 6th Congressional District and into an oddly shaped – and solidly Republican – 1st District. Doing so helped shore up GOP odds of holding the 6th District, represented by Rep. Andy Barr.
The seat was among the more competitive ones in Kentucky under its previous lines. (Democrat Amy McGrath came within 3 points of beating Barr in 2018; last year, Barr won a sixth term under the new lines by 29 points.)
A lower-court judge had ruled that the Republican-drawn map did not violate the state’s constitution, and the state’s high court, in a December 14 ruling, agreed.
A redistricting case pending before the US Supreme Court centers on the future of a Charleston-area seat held by Republican Rep. Nancy Mace, who made headlines recently for joining House GOP hard-liners in voting to remove Kevin McCarthy as speaker.
Earlier this year, a three-judge panel concluded that lines for the coastal 1st Congressional District, as drawn by state GOP lawmakers, amounted to an unconstitutional racial gerrymander.
The Republican lawmakers appealed to the US Supreme Court. During oral arguments, several justices in the court’s conservative majority expressed skepticism that South Carolina officials had engaged in an improper racial gerrymander and seemed inclined to reinstate the lawmakers’ map.
Republicans in New Mexico say the congressional lines drawn by the Democrats who control state government amount to an illegal gerrymander under the state’s constitution.
At stake: a swing district along the US border with Mexico. If Republicans prevail, the 2nd District seat – now held by a Democratic Rep. Gabe Vasquez – could become more favorable to Republicans.
A state judge in October upheld the map drawn by Democrats, and the New Mexico Supreme Court recently affirmed that ruling.
New Mexico GOP Chairman Steve Pearce, who represented an earlier version of the seat in Congress, said the party was “contemplating our next course of action in conference with our legal team.”
The state Supreme Court, in a case it heard in July, is considering whether it even has the authority to weigh in on map-drawing decisions by the GOP-controlled state legislature.
Republican state officials argue that the court’s power over redistricting decisions is limited.
Advocacy groups and a handful of voters are challenging a congressional map that further carved up Democratic-leaning Salt Lake County between four decidedly Republican districts.
Doing so, the plaintiffs argued in their lawsuit, “takes a slice of Salt Lake County and grafts it onto large swaths of the rest of Utah,” allowing Republican voters in rural areas and smaller cities far away from Salt Lake to “dictate the outcome of elections.”
Redistricting fights over congressional maps are ongoing in several other states – ranging from Texas to Tennessee – but those cases might not be resolved in time to affect next year’s elections.

CD69SDQG0H_PMP4O8WDJ5UIV6H,"As Trump dominates nomination race, major GOP donors who backed Haley shift focus to Congress","By Fredreka Schouten and Alayna Treene, CNN","8 minute read Updated 7:08 AM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/26/politics/republican-donors-trump-haley-senate/,"As former President Donald Trump marches closer to the Republican presidential nomination, some conservative outside groups and donors opposed to his candidacy say they now must redouble their efforts to win the Senate in November.
And some fret that with Trump at the top of the ticket – a scenario growing more likely with his decisive back-to-back victories in Iowa and New Hampshire – the task of holding the House and flipping the Senate will grow harder, even in a year when the Senate electoral map strongly favors the GOP.
“If Trump ultimately is the nominee, the threat of a repeat of the last three elections and a Democrat sweep increases dramatically – making the Senate and the House that much more important,” said Bill Riggs, a spokesman for Americans for Prosperity Action.
The group, aligned with billionaire industrialist Charles Koch, has spent millions promoting former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley as the best GOP candidate to defeat Trump in the primary, since endorsing her in late November. AFP Action leaders, who will discuss their political plans with the network’s donors at a Southern California gathering this weekend, say they continue to support Haley – despite her bruising loss Tuesday in New Hampshire and the “steeper road” she faces in her home state. Polls show Trump with a big lead in the Palmetto State’s February 24 primary.
But the Koch officials say the group’s biggest 2024 investment will come in Senate contests, with a prime focus on flipping Democratic-held seats in six states: Michigan, Montana, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. It’s already endorsed in three of those primaries with more announcements to come.
In a recent AFP Action memo that appeared to hedge its bet on Haley, Emily Seidel, a top official, said the Senate represented the organization’s “highest probability play” to guard against what she called “One Party Progressive rule” in Washington.
Eric Levine, a New York-based donor who has backed Haley and plans upcoming fundraisers for GOP Senate candidates, said a day after Trump’s New Hampshire win: “It’s all hands on deck for the Senate.”

He said he holds out little hope of Republicans retaining the House after a court ruling last month ensured New York Democrats will have ultimate control over the redrawing of New York’s 26-seat congressional map ahead of this year’s elections. (A court-drawn Empire State map in 2022 helped Republicans flip four seats in the midterms – victories that allowed the GOP secure its current, narrow majority in the House.)
“The Senate is absolutely critical to saving the republic,” Levine said.
For his part, Trump is threatening to blacklist donors who continue to support Haley, writing on social media that anyone who contributes to her moving forward “will be permanently barred from the MAGA camp.”
Art Pope, a Republican from North Carolina and a longtime Koch donor, is backing Haley’s candidacy and said Trump’s threat only “emboldens” him to further support her.
“I and most Americans do not respond well to a bully,” Pope told CNN.
Doug Deason, a Republican donor from Texas who also will join the Koch conclave over the weekend, has donated to several GOP candidates – including Haley, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Trump – this election cycle.
But he thinks Haley has reached the end of the road.
“I really like Nikki,” Deason said. “But I just think she’s kind of painted herself in the establishment role that most Republicans just don’t want.”
Despite his early dominance, Trump’s critics point to troubling signs for the party in the general election should he become the GOP’s standard-bearer – including his angry rhetoric Tuesday night in New Hampshire that mocked Haley’s post-election speech and her “fancy dress.”
In another warning for some Republicans, CNN’s exit polls show Haley won by a wide margin the third of the New Hampshire GOP electorate that identified as moderate or liberal – a bloc with whom the eventual nominee will need to make inroads. Additionally, 42% of the electorate said Trump – who faces criminal charges in four separate cases – would be unfit for the presidency if convicted of a crime.
“It’s every man for himself,” one Republican member of Congress said this week of the prospect of sharing a ballot with Trump.  “It is going to be chaos and mayhem and a free-for-all. You have to look after you.”
“You’re going to have to make (the campaign) about what you’ve done or what you’re going to do locally,” added the lawmaker, who requested anonymity to speak freely about Republicans’ electoral challenges this fall.
Democrats, of course, face an enormous risk of their own this year with the top of their ticket. CNN’s most recent Poll of Polls shows President Joe Biden with an average 60% disapproval rating.
Democrats and allied independents currently control the Senate 51-49.
Republicans, however, have the big advantage in this year’s Senate races – defending just 11 seats compared with 23 held by the other side. Three of those Democratic seats are in states Trump won easily in 2020.
But, in the 2022 midterms, a favorable map blew up for Republicans, in part, because some Trump-backed candidates flamed out in the general election.
This time around, Republican Senate leaders worked to forge close ties with Trump.
Montana Sen. Steve Daines, the head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, was the first member of Senate GOP leadership to back Trump’s presidential bid. Several other prominent Republicans have recently begun to close ranks behind the former president.
“The NRSC is being smart to work with Trump and instead of against him since he has proven he can torpedo our Senate races,” said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist. “Looking at our map, there’s absolutely no reason Republicans shouldn’t win the Senate.”
But given the polling showing Trump’s underperformance among independents, that “makes candidate quality in the Senate races even more important,” he added.
Trump has privately told many of his advisers and allies that he believes he made too many endorsements during the 2022 midterm elections and is planning to stay out of many of the upcoming congressional fights, three sources familiar with the discussions said. That decision is in part due to his preoccupation with his own campaign, the sources said, but he also doesn’t want to alienate key blocs of conservative voters by engaging too deeply in Republican primaries.
Yet Trump has not removed himself entirely from the process and has chosen to put his finger on the scale in a series of crucial races for candidates he believes in personally and thinks could help Republicans secure the Senate majority, assist him on the campaign trail or prove useful in the Senate, post-2024, if he were to reclaim the White House.

Arizona Senate candidate Kari Lake, a fierce Trump ally who has stumped for the former president this year, is a prime example. He delivered an early endorsement in October for Lake, who ran unsuccessfully for Arizona governor in 2022.
Of the three Trump-won states where Democrats are defending Senate seats – West Virginia, Montana and Ohio – the former president has taken sides in two of those races.
He endorsed Ohio Senate candidate Bernie Moreno in December, following encouragement from a top ally –the state’s junior senator, JD Vance –  to get behind behind the wealthy businessman during a meeting at Mar-a-Lago, CNN previously reported.
In the case of Moreno, who is running in a crowded GOP primary, Trump views his endorsement as something that will help narrow the field in a meaningful way, a source familiar with the former president’s thinking told CNN.
Trump also endorsed West Virginia Senate candidate Jim Justice, someone he likes personally, the sources said. Justice, a second-term governor, faces US Rep. Alex Mooney, who is backed by the conservative Club for Growth — a group Trump has battled with in past years. The stakes are lower in West Virginia, a state Trump won by nearly 40 points in 2020 and where Republicans are expected to pick up the seat now held by outgoing Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin.
Trump, however, has steered clear so far of wading into Montana’s Senate race, despite the efforts of hard-line GOP Rep. Matt Rosendale to attract his endorsement.
This year, Senate leaders also have made clear that they will take a more hands-on approach in GOP primaries than they have in the past.
Top GOP Senate recruits include retired Army Capt. Sam Brown in Nevada, businessman Tim Sheehy in Montana and former hedge fund executive Dave McCormick in Pennsylvania – who lost the 2022 GOP primary for the state’s other Senate seat to Trump’s pick, celebrity physician Mehmet Oz. All three have been endorsed by AFP Action.
In the 2022 midterms, Oz went on to lose to John Fetterman as Democrats flipped the seat and retained control of the Senate.
This year, the Keystone State will once again be awash in campaign money and advertising as part of the crucial “blue wall” of Rust Belt states – including Michigan and Wisconsin – that Biden flipped from Trump on his way to winning the White House in 2020.
Even as the GOP coalesces around McCormick in his bid to oust three-term Democratic Sen. Bob Casey, he and other Republicans on the Senate ballot this year will have to “walk a fine line,” said Pennsylvania Republican strategist Vince Galko.
“He’ll need to make this race about the Biden-Casey record and not about the Trump rhetoric,” he said, “which is easier said than done.”

CEVUOYXNWN_V3RW64DOOVNJ881,"DeSantis, once a rising Republican star, ran a presidential campaign filled with missteps and mistakes","By Steve Contorno, Jessica Dean and Kit Maher, CNN","12 minute read Published 12:00 AM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240122,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/22/politics/desantis-campaign-what-happened/,"In the days leading up to the Iowa caucuses, top advisers to Ron DeSantis steeled themselves for a grim result. The polling that for months told them enough Republicans there were ready to move on from Donald Trump was now predicting that most of them wouldn’t, and they began to consider options for the Florida governor with his political future in mind.
They presented DeSantis with a range of potential outcomes and paths forward. In the event of a dominating performance by Trump, they pitched that DeSantis could bow out, endorse the former president, finish his second term as governor and rebuild his reputation with an eye toward 2028.
He rejected the idea outright, according to a source familiar with the exchange. That was the end of that conversation.
Related article Why DeSantis’ departure isn’t likely to change the dynamic between Trump and Haley
Or so they thought. On Sunday, less than a week after a crushing defeat in Iowa and days before New Hampshire voters are expected to deliver another one, DeSantis bowed out of the 2024 presidential race. In a scripted video statement from Florida, DeSantis endorsed Trump and looked ahead to finishing his second term as governor.
His exit marked a stunning fall for a Republican who for a time appeared singularly positioned to pull the party from Trump’s vice grip. DeSantis once seemed to have it all: money and momentum behind him, a compelling background, a generational argument and a success story to share. Some early polls actually showed him with a lead over Trump.
But what he didn’t have was room for error running up against a popular former president. And the DeSantis campaign made many of them, his advisers, allies and supporters have acknowledged to CNN in interviews.
“Every single thing that could have not gone as we had hoped or planned for went horribly wrong,” one close adviser said.
DeSantis has suggested the race would be different if Trump wasn’t facing four indictments and 91 charges in federal and state courts. Many of his advisers also believe Trump’s legal peril galvanized Republicans just as the GOP presidential contest was about to get underway, closing an opening for an alternative. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley will attempt to test how wide that opening is in the coming days and weeks.
“I would say if I could have one thing change, I wish Trump hadn’t been indicted on any of this stuff,” DeSantis told the Christian Broadcasting Network in December.
But over a campaign that stretched eight months, there is little DeSantis’ team could point to that they did right – from the disastrous, glitchy kickoff announcement on Twitter Spaces with Elon Musk to the Iowa ground operation that was supposed to overcome Trump’s popularity and arctic weather to deliver a surprise outcome that would shock the country.
It was that final miscalculation that ultimately provided the knockout blow. Not only did the result in Iowa evaporate enthusiasm for his campaign, it also sapped it of credibility. He had promised victory in the Hawkeye State, convinced that the polls hadn’t captured his 99-county tour of the state and insisted the nearly 1 million doors his supporters had touched would be rewarded.
Instead, Iowa revealed how ineffective his effort had been all along — his ground game, his message, his strategy, all exposed as a paper tiger and turning his candidacy into a punchline in Republican circles.
“Historic disaster,” said one veteran Republican fundraiser once hopeful of DeSantis’ chances. “JV team.”
Veteran GOP strategists Curt Anderson and Alex Castellanos called it the “Worst Republican Presidential Campaign Ever” in a blistering audit written for Politico that was devoured Friday by DeSantis allies and enemies alike.
It’s a title DeSantis earned as much for what he squandered as how he fared.
DeSantis’ White House bid carried more than just the weight of a political campaign.
“He thinks he’s on a mission from God,” one close confidant described DeSantis’ drive to become president.
It’s an attitude captured in the closing message of his 2022 reelection campaign: A black-and-white video posted to social media by his wife, Casey, that suggested God created DeSantis, “a fighter,” on the eighth day.
After a 19-point reelection victory that November, some in the Republican Party were at least ready to anoint him the inevitable heir to Trump.
“DeFuture,” the New York Post declared the day after, the culmination of two years of Rupert Murdoch’s media empire showering DeSantis with praise for his pandemic contrarianism and cultural battles.
Trump, already a candidate for president once again, was ready for a fight. He called his former ally “an average Republican governor” as the buzz around DeSantis reached new heights and escalated the attacks from there.
But DeSantis, who once donned a Top Gun outfit to declare he would “never back down from a fight,” opted not to punch back. He instead put his focus on the 2023 legislative session in Florida, plotting an agenda of long-sought conservative priorities – universal school choice, a near ban on abortion, fewer restrictions on guns – that would serve as the platform for a policy-oriented presidential campaign. He also escalated his fight with Disney over new state restrictions on teaching sexual orientation and gender identity by taking control of the company’s special taxing district.
He didn’t step foot in Iowa until March to sell his new book. His first earnest swipe at the former president – a dig at the hush money payments allegedly made to adult film star Stormy Daniels – was followed days later by DeSantis defending Trump in the face of an indictment in a New York case related to those payments.
“The war had begun and we were kind of sitting on our backsides,” a source close to the campaign said, describing the time when DeSantis was traveling around the country on a book tour but had yet to formally announce. It left his team unable to push back on his behalf as Trump and his allies pounded the governor, ultimately spending $21 million in ads seeking to define DeSantis when he wouldn’t punch back.
Meanwhile, an emerging super PAC, led by veteran GOP strategist Jeff Roe and Ken Cuccinelli, a former homeland security official in the Trump administration, was given the keys to the DeSantis’ financial coffers. The super PAC, Never Back Down, received $83 million from DeSantis’ former state political committee in a move that a campaign finance watchdog group flagged as potentially illegal, but nevertheless provided an unprecedented financial advantage for the Republican governor.
In an unusual arrangement, Never Back Down was asked to take on many tasks traditionally reserved for campaigns, including training paid canvassers and hosting the governor’s events. Roe and others promised a novel concept that would change presidential campaigns forever.
But Never Back Down’s team of seasoned political consultants clashed immediately with the inexperienced but scrappy Tallahassee team that had just steered DeSantis to a historic gubernatorial victory. The early squabbling, which the media quickly caught wind of, was a precursor to a summer and fall of discontent that ultimately ended with several top staff and advisers leaving acrimoniously, including Roe.
Meanwhile, the Republican donor class that rained six- and seven-figure checks on DeSantis during his reelection bid suddenly had second thoughts. Some voiced displeasure with his contentious second-term agenda and fixation with Disney. Others wanted to kick the tires on other GOP candidates after all.
The DeSantis financial team wrongly assumed the flush times wouldn’t end, and they budgeted for $200 million between the campaign and super PAC at launch with a goal of amassing half a billion dollars by the year. Instead, the super PAC had raised $130 million by June 30 – a historically large amount that nevertheless fell well short of expectations.
“Pick a name,” another fundraiser said. “Every one of them, it was expected they would keep giving.”
His fundraising team downplayed the pull back at the time, with one person telling CNN it would only be a problem if Ken Griffin, the billionaire hedge fund owner who helped bankroll DeSantis’ reelection, decided he wouldn’t donate. They expected $25 million from him.
Griffin ultimately did not give a cent toward DeSantis’ White House bid.
“If you had told me finances would be the problem, I would have hung up on you as needing a mental health check,” the fundraiser continued. “All the dynamics that Trump would be difficult to beat I expected, but I believed there was enough of a coalition of the willing to fund an opposition candidate.”
Ad spending by Never Back Down peaked in mid-April – before DeSantis had officially entered the race.
By the time DeSantis was ready to announce, his entire political operation was on edge.
“People already felt like it was an uphill battle,” the fundraiser said.
There was a “contentious” debate among DeSantis’s orbit over how best to launch the candidate, with some people pushing for a more traditional announcement from his hometown of Dunedin followed by stops in Iowa and New Hampshire, according to a source familiar with the conversations. But that approach was rejected by the woman who would be announced as DeSantis’ campaign manager, Generra Peck.
Another idea emerged to do something with Elon Musk and X, formerly known as Twitter, which ultimately snowballed into the final idea of the two appearing together on Spaces to broadcast a live announcement. The idea’s supporters argued it was a nontraditional announcement for a nontraditional campaign, according to a source familiar with the discussions.
But donors and other DeSantis allies worried after all the build-up to his candidacy there would be no visual of DeSantis actually announcing his run to air on television stations across the country. A compromise was struck with DeSantis immediately going on Fox News after the Spaces launch to talk about his campaign. An intermediary took the idea to Musk, who agreed.
Musk’s website, though, crashed repeatedly during the announcement, which quickly became the narrative of his introduction as a presidential candidate.
“It could have been cool and successful,” one source familiar with the launch told CNN, “but the glitchiness at the top was perhaps a foreshadowing of the campaign to come.”
Donors gathered in a glitzy Miami hotel for the launch were stunned, and grew more furious when Peck and others tried to spin it as DeSantis breaking the Internet.
As coverage of these early stumbles on mainstream news outlets snowballed, DeSantis stayed inside a right-wing media bubble. He spoke almost exclusively to Fox News, conservative radio stations and right-wing podcasters, ignoring some aides who pushed aggressively for DeSantis to do more with the national media from the very beginning.
DeSantis instead listened to others in his orbit, particularly Christina Pushaw and Bryan Griffin, both of whom joined his campaign from the governor’s office and encouraged him to continue to ignore the mainstream media. He now acknowledges that decision was a mistake.
“I came in not really doing as much media,” DeSantis recently told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt. “I should have just been blanketing. I should have gone on all the corporate shows. I should have gone on everything.
“We had an opportunity, I think, to come out of the gate and do that and reach a much broader folk,” he added.
The abnormalities surrounding DeSantis’ campaign continued to stack from there.
It quickly became apparent that the campaign grew too quickly for its financial situation. In mid-July, the trickle of layoffs began. Meanwhile, DeSantis pulled back plans for a national campaign and refocused his efforts almost exclusively on Iowa.
Yet, as his campaign shrunk, it spent $1.5 million on private planes through September, campaign finance reports show, and held donor retreats at posh locations, like a resort in Park City, Utah.
A bizarre series of events on July 25 illustrated the disconnect. DeSantis flew privately into Tennessee for a fundraiser. Once on the ground, his four-vehicle motorcade was involved in an accident, including the car carrying the governor. That same day, his campaign cut one-third of its staff. And Never Back Down aired its last ad in South Carolina.
Two weeks later, Peck was fired.
Yet, amid the turmoil, DeSantis’ team, led by his top pollster Ryan Tyson, assured donors and operatives that there was an opening in Iowa. Each time they went into the field, their poll numbers showed a growing pool of Republicans open to moving on from Trump. They assumed the surge of support for the former president was a sugar rush from his indictments that would eventually end.
But rather than a coherent message around his candidacy, there was a scattershot of approaches in the ads coming from the super PAC and the campaign. It was largely left up to DeSantis to win over Trump voters through appearances in the state.
Across his 99-county tour of Iowa, DeSantis struggled to articulate a coherent rationale for his candidacy and focused more often on his past accomplishments as a governor than his ideas for the future. He regularly responded to questions from Iowans with actions he took in Florida, rattling off local terms from back home and sometimes leaving crowds perplexed.
His speeches sometimes required a glossary for regular Republicans to understand: woke, ESG, DEI, CRT, Central Bank Digital Currency, social credit scores, Zuckerbucks – all words, phrases and acronyms that were staples of DeSantis’ campaign appearances, media interviews and debate responses.
Still, there were moments when it seemed DeSantis was on the cusp of gaining momentum, such as when Iowa’s popular governor, Kim Reynolds, endorsed him in November.
But that evening also offered a window into his flailing candidacy.
Her involvement represented a momentous coup for DeSantis and a striking break from a tradition from her predecessors. In a stirring speech that night inside a Des Moines event space, she defended her involvement and made an impassioned case for the like-minded conservative governor from Florida.
Yet, during his turn at the mic, DeSantis delivered a largely rote speech filled with familiar lines from his six-month tour of the state, an extended riff off his Florida accomplishments and the “woke” forces he had destroyed. There were only a few passing references to the woman who risked her political capital to back him. He said little that night to suggest he had grown as a politician during his bruising uphill fight for the nomination or had learned much about Iowa or its people despite spending hundreds of hours in the state and meeting thousands of its residents. At times, the crowd could barely muster more than polite cheering.
After stepping off the stage, he shook hands and posed for pictures for 10 minutes from behind a barrier, leaving Reynolds to mingle with his supporters.
The night laid bare the promise and the shortcomings of DeSantis as a presidential candidate. An exacting and relentless leader, DeSantis could execute a game plan as well as anyone but lacked a feel for the campaign trail and struggled to stir a room. He could summon the energy to barnstorm across the state for weeks on end but often appeared disinterested in the people who showed up to hear him.
In the end, a politician who had seemingly done everything necessary to win Iowa – shown up, spent money, secured endorsements – could not win over Iowans.
DeSantis himself acknowledged the limits of the key endorsements he often touted on the trail.
A day before suspending his campaign, he told reporters in Myrtle Beach, “Iowa Republican leadership lined up behind me, and we came in second,” in response to a question about Trump’s new support in South Carolina.
And yet, in the face of this overwhelming rejection of his pitch to Make America Florida, DeSantis refused to change gears. The contours of his stump speech stayed the same as he half-heartedly moved on to South Carolina. Vote for me, he told Republicans there, because I have already done the stuff you supposedly like.
Even in defeat, DeSantis vowed to continue to take on “woke ideology.”
“While this campaign has ended, the mission continues down here in Florida,” DeSantis said as he signed off. “We will continue to show the country how to lead.”"

Trump’s critics have long argued that if he ever faced a one-on-one fight for the Republican nomination against a single candidate who united all the party’s opposition against him, he’d lose.
The theory is about to be put to its ultimate test.
Haley will never have a better chance than in New Hampshire, among an electorate in which moderate and independent voters play a crucial role, to beat Trump in a single contest and to prove she can mount a nationwide challenge against him. A victory, or very close runner-up spot, will be vital to the former South Carolina governor’s capacity to run through her home state’s primary next month and into the Super Tuesday major-state primaries at the beginning of March.
“There’s two people in this race. That’s what we wanted all along,” Haley told CNN’s Dana Bash on the trail Sunday, moments after DeSantis quit the campaign.
But Haley faces an existential question for her own campaign Tuesday. Is the front-running ex-president, who is hugely popular among GOP base voters after turning his unprecedented legal morass into a rallying call, simply too strong at this point for anyone in the party to beat him? And if there is a consolidation of the Republican pack, it seems to be around Trump, not her, as three of the ex-president’s defeated rivals – DeSantis, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy – have endorsed him in the last week. “They’re all all coming with us,” Trump noted with satisfaction at a rally in Rochester, New Hampshire, on Sunday night.

But the chief proponent of the idea that a head-to-head contest could imperil Trump and open the way for a prolonged duel for delegates has been New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu. The popular Republican seemed ecstatic that his preferred scenario had come true as he rallied for Haley in Exeter on Sunday night.
“A little while ago, there were 13 candidates in the race, and now there are only two,” he roared to the crowd. “They said that couldn’t be done, but then Nikki Haley came along and wiped them all out. For years we have been waiting for something where the Republicans could galvanize together.” Sununu’s remarks underscored how Haley’s race has become part of a long battle for the soul of the GOP, even if she has trodden carefully in criticizing Trump for fear of alienating party voters who like him. Still, Sununu has also been downplaying expectations for Haley in recent days, arguing she only needs to start winning states on Super Tuesday.
Practically, the DeSantis departure came late for Haley – giving her only one full day to make her case that she’s a genuine contender in an one-on-one battle with Trump before voters go to the polls in New Hampshire. But she quickly tried to capitalize on her new status, presenting herself as the antidote to Trump’s “chaos” – her code word for his criminal problems, impeachments and tumultuous first term – and as a far surer bet to beat President Joe Biden in November’s general election.
The news sent a jolt of energy through Haley and her crowd. She’s had a rocky few days, despite the withdrawal of former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, whom her team had feared would split the anti-Trump vote in New Hampshire. She came third in the Iowa caucuses last week, a showing that dented a narrative of momentum surrounding her campaign. And in a CNN poll released Sunday, Trump led Haley by 11 points in the state. If anything, she might have benefited from DeSantis staying in until Wednesday. When his small slice of the vote in the CNN poll was reallocated based on voters’ second preferences, Trump led by 13 points since the Florida governor’s voters are likely a better fit for his coalition.

Yet the signature unpredictability and fabled history of the New Hampshire primary means there’s a chance that the late-in-the race narrowing of the GOP field could justify Sununu’s euphoria and give Haley the shock win she needs.
While most polls show a solid Trump lead, a complication in New Hampshire is that no one can be sure how many undeclared voters – the name for independents in the Granite State – will show up on Election Day to vote in the GOP primary. An unexpectedly high turnout of undeclared voters powered late Arizona Sen. John McCain to a shock victory in the 2000 GOP primary against George W. Bush. The state has also sprung shocks on the other side of the aisle: In 2008, Democrat Hillary Clinton won New Hampshire days after losing the Iowa caucuses to Barack Obama, in a result that turned his march to the nomination into a monthslong slog.
“The New Hampshire polling is all over the place – one reason – and that is the proportion of the undeclared voters that can vote in the Republican primary,” Republican pollster Whit Ayers said in a Brookings Institution briefing last week. “It is very difficult to anticipate what proportion they will make of the final turnout.”
Trump has long had to endure arguments that his shock capture of the Republican nomination in 2016 was only possible since party heavyweights such as Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Christie and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush all vainly believed they were the only candidate who could beat him – and thus divided the anti-Trump vote among them.
There is some truth to this version of history. Bush only quit in February 2016 after a fourth place in the South Carolina primary proved what Trump was saying – that his campaign was a “low energy” failure. Rubio, whose soaring vision of 21st century Reaganism was destroyed by Trump, only pulled out in March of that year after losing his home state to the future president. Cruz survived as the last opponent standing and stayed in the race until May, but by then, Trump was too far ahead. Had the Texas senator been the lone challenger from New Hampshire onward, perhaps the outcome may have been different.
In many of the races in the last competitive GOP nominating season, Trump benefited from a fractured opposition, and the first-past-the-post rules of many contests meant he was able to harvest all the delegates on offer even without a majority of votes. In the South Carolina primary, for instance, Trump won 32.5%, ahead of Rubio with 22.5%, Cruz with 22.3% and Bush with 7.8%. Had there been a single unified anti-Trump Republican challenge, the future president would almost certainly have lost the race. Instead, he walked away with all the state’s 50 bound convention delegates. Even in New Hampshire last time, Trump won a relatively close race in a packed field with only 35% of the vote but won all 11 delegates.

Eight years later, Trump has changed the Republican Party beyond recognition. He’s remade it in his populist, nationalist image. This time last year, the former president looked vulnerable after his attempts to push his favored candidates in the midterm elections may have cost the GOP the Senate. But he successfully leveraged his 91 criminal charges, including over his attempt to overturn democracy to stay in power after losing the 2020 reelection, into a foundation for a revived campaign. Millions of Americans now believe his falsehoods about a stolen election. His expected appearance in a New York courtroom Monday in a civil defamation case is another example of how he has used his legal dramas to fuel his campaign. And Trump has driven out Republican lawmakers who still oppose him – such as former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, who lost a primary in 2022, and 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney, who is not running for a second term as a Utah senator.
That transformation of the GOP – and Trump’s extraordinary bond with voters – has often been reflected in polls of this race, which have shown Trump with greater popularity in key states than all of his rivals combined. This was borne out in Iowa last week when Trump got just over 50% of the vote in the widest victory in the GOP contest in the state’s history. While the magnitude of that result is unlikely to be repeated in New Hampshire, given the state’s demographic makeup, Haley’s path becomes far more complicated going forward even if she notches a win in the Granite state.
Take South Carolina. While she twice won gubernatorial battles, Haley hasn’t been on the ballot there in a decade. And now, the state is one of the most fervent pro-Trump bastions, a point the ex-president tried to make by inviting Gov. Henry McMaster, Lt. Gov. Pamela Evette and other top state Republicans who have endorsed him to join him on stage in New Hampshire on Saturday night. Scott delivered another blow to Haley on Friday by endorsing the former president, and argued on CNN on Sunday that Trump would be a much stronger commander in chief than Haley.
In Exeter, Haley pitched a vision of a deeply conservative presidency on issues including immigration reform, deficit reduction and foreign policy. But her demeanor and plans also offered a promise of a return to calm, steady governance instead of Trump’s tumult and the “retribution” he’s promising for a second term. There’s no suggestion, even from Democrats, that Haley would threaten democracy from the Oval Office or turn decades of US foreign policy values upside down. Hypothetical matchup polls showing Haley defeating Biden in many cases suggest that’s a campaign many Americans could get behind.
But Haley’s problem is that most Republican voters may not want what she’s offering.
“Republicans set all the issues aside,” CNN commentator and Republican consultant Scott Jennings said Sunday. “(They said) the only way for us to get euphoric vindication for all the wrongs that have been done to Donald Trump is to nominate him again, and I think that’s what they are going to do.”
In this race, being the last candidate standing against “the fellas,” as Haley calls her rivals, may not mean much or last very long. It might simply be a passport to be the last candidate who gets rolled over by Trump."
CH8Y67GKGM_QWN282AI0V03SOX,New Hampshire ad spending tops $77 million as Haley and Trump fight to the finish,"By David Wright and Alex Leeds Matthews, CNN","7 minute read Published 10:00 AM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/23/politics/new-hampshire-ad-spending-trump-haley/,"Donald Trump, Nikki Haley and their allies have traded sharp attacks on New Hampshire airwaves ahead of the second nominating contest in the Republican presidential primary.
Haley and groups supporting her White House bid have invested heavily in the Granite State, spending roughly twice as much on advertising there as Trump’s political network since the start of the 2024 race. But Haley’s advantage narrowed in the new year as Trump and his allies ramped up ad spending there to counter signs of momentum for the former South Carolina governor.
Combined, Republican campaigns and outside groups have spent more than $77 million on advertising in New Hampshire through Monday, significantly more than the roughly $50 million that campaigns and outside groups spent on advertising in the Granite State during the 2020 battle for the Democratic presidential nomination, according to data from the ad tracking firm AdImpact.
Trump and his political network spent more than $10 million on TV ads looking to blunt the high-profile challenge posed by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, hitting him in Iowa, New Hampshire and on national cable during the summer and fall of last year. The former president cruised to a dominant win in the Iowa caucuses last week while DeSantis and Haley finished a distant second and third respectively. DeSantis ended his presidential campaign on Sunday and endorsed Trump.
But with signs of a more competitive race in New Hampshire, Trump and his allies turned their attention to Haley and have spent more than $6 million attacking her on the Granite State airwaves.
Meanwhile, after months avoiding mention of Trump in most of their paid messaging, Haley and her allies have responded with attacks of their own, airing more than $4 million worth of ads targeting the former president.
Anti-Haley ads warn that she is soft on illegal immigration and wants to cut Social Security,  while ads touting the former South Carolina governor call for generational change and laud Haley as the only candidate who can beat Trump.
According to AdImpact data, Haley’s campaign and supportive outside groups have spent more than $31 million on advertising in New Hampshire since the start of 2023. By comparison, Trump’s campaign and its allies have spent about $15.7 million on New Hampshire advertising since the start of the race, while a pro-DeSantis super PAC spent about $8 million in the state last year.
So far in 2024, Haley’s campaign and its allies have spent about $12.3 million advertising in New Hampshire compared  with about $9.8 million for Trump and his allies. In stark contrast, DeSantis and his allies spent nothing on the New Hampshire airwaves this year.
In the closing days of the race in New Hampshire, SFA Fund, the super PAC supporting Haley, has been airing a new ad featuring popular Gov. Chris Sununu, who has endorsed and vigorously campaigned for Haley.
In the ad, Sununu tells voters, “There are now only two candidates who can win. One is surrounded by chaos and drama. That’s the Donald Trump we all know. The other is honest and hopeful. That’s Nikki Haley. She campaigned the New Hampshire way, and now we have a chance to reset the election for our entire country.”
The ad’s explicit criticism of the former president reflects a notable shift in the messaging from pro-Haley advertisers, who spent much of the last year avoiding any mention of Trump.
Earlier this month, SFA Fund began airing another ad hitting the former president, telling voters that “Trump can’t stop lying about Nikki Haley. One temper tantrum after another. His entire campaign based on revenge.”

The super PAC has also spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on an ad responding to some of the attacks leveled by Trump and his allies. The spot featured voters at a Haley town hall touting her toughness and pointedly mentioning her commitment to protecting Social Security.
And in the final week before votes are counted in New Hampshire, the Haley campaign launched its first ad targeting Trump by name. The commercial opens with a blunt message: “The two most disliked politicians in America? Trump and Biden. Both are consumed by chaos, negativity and grievances of the past.” The narrator continues, “The better choice for a better America: Nikki Haley.”
Another pro-Haley super PAC, Independents Moving the Needle, has aired ads in New Hampshire that feature voters who say they previously supported Trump but are now backing Haley.
Countering those efforts, Trump and his allies have spent millions attacking Haley on air in New Hampshire since she supplanted DeSantis as the top perceived threat to the former president’s campaign there.
The Trump campaign has spent more than $800,000 in New Hampshire on an ad claiming that Haley, who has campaigned on raising the retirement age for Americans currently in their 20s, would cut Social Security benefits. MAGA Inc., the super PAC supporting Trump, has spent more than $2.5 million airing an ad in New Hampshire that portrays Haley as soft on border security.
The Trump campaign has also spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on another ad focused on illegal immigration, knocking Haley for opposing a ban on Muslims entering the United States that Trump proposed as a candidate in 2015 and telling voters that “Haley’s weakness puts us in grave danger.”
Additionally, MAGA Inc. has put more than $2.7 million behind an ad that attacks Haley for her stance on the gas tax when she was governor of South Carolina. “New Hampshire can’t afford Nicky high-tax Haley,” the ad’s narrator says.
Looking beyond New Hampshire, Trump, Haley and the super PACs supporting them are mostly holding their fire, waiting on the outcome of the Granite State contest.
As a result, the next two states hosting GOP nominating contests, Nevada and South Carolina, have seen far less ad spending than New Hampshire and Iowa, where GOP campaigns and groups spent over $123 million.
In Nevada, none of the campaigns or outside groups are on the air. Haley’s campaign is not competing in the state’s party-run caucuses on February 8, opting instead for the state-run primary on February 6. But only the caucuses will be used to determine the allocation of delegates to this summer’s Republican convention.
And in South Carolina, the next major contest on February 24, just one group is actively spending: Americans for Prosperity Action, the super PAC arm of the Koch family’s political network, which is backing Haley.
AFP Action has spent more than $3 million on advertising in South Carolina and went up earlier this month with an ad touting Haley’s electability and showcasing her performance in hypothetical general election polls against President Joe Biden.
Meanwhile, Haley’s team said over the weekend that it plans to spend up to $4 million on a new ad campaign in South Carolina, signaling her intent to press on with her one-on-one matchup against Trump.
On the Democratic side, Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips and supporters of his long-shot presidential primary challenge to Biden have poured nearly $5 million into advertising in New Hampshire, where the president is not on the ballot.
According to AdImpact data, Phillips’ campaign and a super PAC supporting him, We Deserve Better, have spent $2.7 million and $2.2 million respectively delivering sharp criticism of Biden and slamming the national Democratic Party’s treatment of the state’s primary.
Biden did not register for the New Hampshire ballot following an internal party dispute over the date of the primary. The Democratic National Committee has said that no delegates will be awarded based on the New Hampshire primary as the contest is noncompliant with the DNC’s revamped nominating calendar. Accordingly, Biden and the outside groups supporting his reelection have not advertised in the state, though supporters have undertaken a low-key write-in effort on the president’s behalf.
Away from New Hampshire, Biden’s campaign and allied outside groups have been spending millions on early reelection advertising since last year.
According to AdImpact data, the Biden campaign, a supportive super PAC, his joint fundraising committee and a joint effort with the DNC have combined to spend about $50 million on ads so far. The network has committed millions to several key battleground states, including Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada, and North Carolina."

Red flags about Trump’s mental fitness can’t be ignored,Opinion by Dean Obeidallah,"6 minute read Published 6:49 PM EST, Sun January 21, 2024",20240122,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/21/opinions/nikki-haley-trump-mental-fitness-obeidallah/,"Editor’s Note: Dean Obeidallah, a former attorney, is the host of SiriusXM radio’s daily program “The Dean Obeidallah Show.” Follow him on Threads. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.
GOP presidential candidate Nikki Haley raised an important issue Saturday about former President Donald Trump that demands far more media attention. After an alarming series of recent verbal missteps by Trump, Haley questioned whether he is “mentally fit” to serve in the White House.
Haley — who is challenging Trump for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination — raised questions about Trump’s mental acuity, pointing to a major slip-up he made related to the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol in which he appeared to confuse her with Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic former speaker of the House.
At the Trump event on Friday, Trump told the audience, “By the way, they never report the crowd on January 6. You know, Nikki Haley, Nikki Haley, Nikki Haley … did you know they destroyed all of the information, all of the evidence, everything, deleted and destroyed all of it?”
He added: “All of it, because of lots of things, like Nikki Haley is in charge of security, we offered her 10,000 people, soldiers, national guards, whatever they want. They turned it down.”
The 77-year-old Trump then repeated the glaring error, stating, “Nikki Haley is in charge of security. We offered her 10,000 people, soldiers, national guards, whatever they want. They turned it down.”
Back in the real world, Haley — a Republican former governor of South Carolina who served as Trump’s UN ambassador from 2017-2018 and who did not hold public office on January 6, 2021 — had nothing to do with security at the Capitol that day. Yet Trump invoked her name multiple times during that speech. That’s why Haley spoke at length the following day expressing doubts regarding Trump’s mental fitness.
“Last night, Trump is at a rally and he’s going on and on, mentioning me several times as to why I didn’t take security during the Capitol riots. Why I didn’t handle January 6 better. I wasn’t even in DC on January 6. I wasn’t in office then,” Haley said. “They’re saying he got confused. That he was talking about something else. That he was talking about Nancy Pelosi. He mentioned me multiple times in that scenario.”
Haley told the crowd that the confusion by the president is beyond worrisome. “The concern I have is — I’m not saying anything derogatory — but when you’re dealing with the pressures of a presidency, we can’t have someone else that we question whether they’re mentally fit to do it.”

As controversy over his misstatements swirled, Trump later Saturday boasted about his cognitive abilities, saying, “A few months ago I took a cognitive test my doctor gave me … and I aced it.”
He continued: “I’ll let you know when I go bad; I really think I’ll be able to tell you. Because someday we go bad,” he said at a campaign event in Manchester, New Hampshire. “I feel my mind is stronger now than it was 25 years ago.”
Meanwhile, a senior Trump campaign adviser, Chris LaCivita, glossed over the error on Saturday, posting on X, “Nancy … Nikki … its a distinction without a difference.”
In truth, the differences between Haley and Pelosi are substantial and the two prominent politicians are hard to mix up — starting with the fact Pelosi is a frequent Trump antagonist who served as Democratic speaker of the House, while Haley is a Republican who once served in Trump’s own administration.
Trump’s often cited claim that Pelosi oversaw January 6 security is a lie that has been fact checked numerous times. This raises another valid question about Trump’s mental state: Is he knowingly lying, or does he sincerely believe facts that are detached from reality?
Haley is 100% correct to raise red flags about Trump’s cognitive abilities. The president of the United States must be mentally fit to do the job. To be clear, Haley also raised questions during her campaign event about President Joe Biden’s potential cognitive issues. But to be blunt, those issues — as well as concerns about Biden’s age — have been litigated extensively in the media, which allows voters to make up their own minds on the subject.

By contrast, Trump — who will turn 78 in June — has been subjected to much less scrutiny about his mental acuity, despite a series of mental gaffes that led conservative television host Megyn Kelly to raise alarm bells last month.
Speaking on conservative pundit Glenn Beck’s radio show, the former Fox News anchor said of the former president ,“There’s no question that Trump has lost a step or multiple steps.” Kelly cited a number of errors by Trump, including instances when he claimed to have defeated former President Barack Obama at the ballot box and when he said he’s currently running against Obama.
Trump, Kelly remarked, “is confusing Joe Biden for Obama. I know he’s now saying he intentionally did that — go back and look at the clips, it wasn’t intentional.”
Kelly is correct about Trump’s long and growing list of mental glitches. For example, in October, he misstated what country his longtime ally Viktor Orban — the prime minister of Hungary — is the ruler of, wrongly telling voters that Orban was the leader of Turkey.
That same month, Trump greeted a crowd of supporters with the words, “Hello, to a place where we’ve done very well, Sioux Falls! Thank you very much.” In reality, Trump was in Sioux City, Iowa — not in Sioux Falls, a city in South Dakota — prompting a local elected official to whisper in his ear where he actually was at the time so that he could clean up his remarks.
And the list goes on.
This is not the first time one of his opponents for the GOP presidential nomination has raised the issue of Trump’s mental sharpness. In November, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’s campaign posted on social media a thread of more than two dozen confusing remarks Trump had made, claiming this was the reason “why his handlers won’t let him debate.”

But given the fact that Trump handily won last week’s Iowa GOP caucus and is well positioned to wrap up the GOP presidential nomination shortly, it’s imperative that the media robustly cover the issue, so that GOP voters can be fully informed about the mental fitness of the person they may nominate to be president. This is especially true for conservative media outlets, since that is where Republican voters are likely gathering their information.
True, these conservative media outlets may be reticent to cover negative stories about Trump out of fear of potentially upsetting their viewers. But this is an issue that transcends partisan lines.
If there’s anything that ought to outweigh party identity, it’s our collective concern about the potential threat posed to our nation by a future president who might not be up to doing the job mentally of being commander in chief."
CNJPIGHT8A_0FB7Z5HP0TVVPIO,‘The straw that broke the camel’s back’: United CEO’s frustration with Boeing’s problems,"By Chris Isidore, CNN","5 minute read Updated 1:21 PM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/23/business/united-boeing-max-9-grounding/,"United Airlines, one of the biggest buyers of Boeing jets, is losing patience with the troubled aircraft maker.
“I’m disappointed that… this keeps happening at Boeing. This isn’t new,” said Scott Kirby, CEO of United, in an interview Tuesday on CNBC. “We need Boeing to succeed. But they’ve been having these consistent manufacturing challenges. They need to take action here.”
Kirby made his comments after the airline warned investors that it will report a larger-than-expected loss in the first three months of this year because of the grounding of all 737 Max 9 jets after a door plug blew off on an Alaska Air flight on January 5, leaving a massive hole in the side of the plane.
The plane landed without any serious injuries, but the Federal Aviation Administration ordered the grounding and additional inspections of the more than 200 jets of that model worldwide.
United Airlines said it now expects its fleet of Boeing Max 9 jets to remain grounded through the end of this month, and that the company will report a first quarter loss in the range of $116 million to $262 million. That’s more than the $138 million loss already forecast by analysts surveyed by Refinitiv.
United has 79 of the Max 9s, more than any other airline, and had originally scheduled nearly 8,000 flights with the plane for this month before the incident, according to Cirium, an aviation analytics firm.
Beyond the current 737 Max 9 problem is what this means for Boeing’s orders for the 737 Max 10, a newer, larger version and more expensive version of the 737 Max that has yet to be certified by the FAA. It will be at least five years in a best case scenario before Boeing can delivery those Max 10 jets to United, Kirby said, and the airline is now no longer counting on getting that plane in the future.
“I think the Max 9 grounding is probably the straw that broke the camel’s back for us,” said Kirby. “We’re going to build a plan that doesn’t have the Max 10 in it.”
United has firm orders for 277 of the 737 Max 10, and options to buy an additional 200, and so if the airline were to pull out of those orders, it would be a massive blow for Boeing’s efforts to bring that plane to market.
And in a call with investors later in the day, Kirby said that the airline is not quite canceling the orders that it has for the Max 10, but it doesn’t anticipate it’ll be receiving the jets, either.
“We are taking it out of our internal plans,” said Kirby. “And we’ll be working on what that means exactly with Boeing. But Boeing is not going to be able to meet their contractual deliveries on at least many of those airplanes. And let’s leave it at that.”
United has orders for more than 500 Boeing jets in total on the books, more than twice as many as it does for jets from its rival Airbus. But in the last six months, United took delivery of its first A321neo, a model that directly competes with the Boeing 737 Max.
But thanks to a deep order backlog at both companies, even if United were to drop its 737 Max 10 purchase plans, it would probably be forced to buy other 737 Max models rather than getting at the end of the line for buyers of Airbus jets.
That will constrain the company for quite some time, Kirby added.
“We’re still going to be the fastest growing airline,” Kirby said. “But we’re not going to be as fast growing as we planned.”
Boeing would not comment directly on United’s comments on its orders, other than to once again apologize for the problems that led to the incident at Alaska Air and the subsequent 737 Max 9 grounding.
“We have let down our airline customers and are deeply sorry for the significant disruption to them, their employees and their passengers,” said Stan Deal, head of Boeing’s commercial aircraft unit, in a statement released by the company. “We are taking action on a comprehensive plan to bring these airplanes safely back to service and to improve our quality and delivery performance. We will follow the lead of the FAA and support our customers every step of the way.”

Boeing has had a series of quality issues that have dogged the aircraft maker for the last five years, ever since two fatal crashes of the 737 Max 8 in late 2018 and early 2019 led to a 20-month grounding of the jet.
United believes it is getting close to the completion of the inspections it needs to get approval to fly the 737 Max 9 once again, Kirby said.
“I have a lot of confidence in the safety of these airplanes, particularly since we know what happened with this Max 9,” he said. “I think we’re near the end game of getting that [model] back flying.”
United did say it expects full year earnings of between $9 to $11 a share, a range which would include the current estimates of full-year earnings of $9.45 a share according to analysts, as well as 2023 earnings of $10.05 a share that it reported Monday.
And it reported fourth-quarter earnings of $2.00 a share, topping the $1.69 a share forecast by analysts.
The earnings beat and the full-year guidance helped to lift shares of United more than 5% in trading Tuesday."
CS5UPEK935_0IHSNZ860UGZQ4M,US Supreme Court declines to halt execution of Alabama inmate set to be the first to die by nitrogen gas,"By Dakin Andone and Devan Cole, CNN","6 minute read Updated 9:05 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/24/us/alabama-kenneth-smith-execution/,"The US Supreme Court on Wednesday declined to halt the execution of Alabama death row inmate Kenneth Smith, who is scheduled to be put to death this week using nitrogen gas – a wholly new method some experts have decried as veiled in secrecy amid concerns it could lead to excessive pain or even torture.
Smith is due to be executed during a 30-hour window starting Thursday for his part in a 1988 murder for hire. The state 14 months ago aborted an effort to execute him by lethal injection because officials could not set an intravenous line before the execution warrant expired.

Smith and his attorneys last week asked the Supreme Court to pause the execution so they could argue trying to execute Smith a second time would amount to cruel and unusual punishment, violating the Eighth and 14th amendments.
On Wednesday, the justices declined Smith’s requests. They did not provide an explanation in their brief order, and there were no noted dissents.
Still, litigation continues ahead of Smith’s scheduled execution by nitrogen hypoxia, a method only Alabama, Oklahoma and Mississippi have approved and none has used; only Alabama, which adopted the method in 2018, has outlined a protocol for it, indicating officials plan to deliver the nitrogen to Smith through a mask.
Smith’s lawyers had also filed a separate appeal with the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit on Wednesday — that court also declined to halt Smith’s execution Wednesday night, saying “Smith has failed to show a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of his claims.”
“Accordingly, his motion for a stay of execution is due to be denied without regard to the other prerequisites for the issuance of the same,” said the court in its ruling.
In the request to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, Smith’s attorneys said Alabama altered its execution plans by changing the schedule for Smith to have his last meal.
That change was made, the attorneys said, in response to evidence that Smith “has been vomiting repeatedly” — one of several concerns previously raised by Smith and the state’s critics, who fear Smith could vomit into the mask, causing him to choke and raising the risk of a tortuous death.
“While there is no doubt that a stay of execution is the exception and not the rule, it is difficult to imagine a more exceptional case than one in which a State intends to employ a novel protocol for a never-before-used method of execution, using a plan that continues to shift less than 48 hours before the execution is scheduled to begin,” the attorneys wrote.
In response, the state said the evidence Smith had been vomiting was largely from his own self-reporting. The Department of Corrections, the state said, only altered the last meal schedule to alleviate Smith’s concerns.
The state urged the court to deny the request for a stay, saying Smith’s “recent delays and latest filing make a mockery of the judicial process.”
Responding to the appeals court’s decision to deny the stay, Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall said, “While Smith will likely appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, my office stands ready to carry on the fight for Liz Sennett. Two courts have now rejected Smith’s claims. I remain confident that the Supreme Court will come down on the side of justice, and that Smith’s execution will be carried out tomorrow.”
During the November 2022 attempt to execute him, officials “jabbed Mr. Smith repeatedly in his arms and hands” in an effort to access his veins, causing the inmate “severe physical pain and psychological torment, including post-traumatic stress disorder,” his lawyers wrote in their appeal to the Supreme Court.
Smith’s execution would mark only the second time in US history that a state would attempt to execute an inmate a second time after initially failing, they said.
The state opposed Smith’s appeal, pointing out this week in a filing with the Supreme Court it would use a different method this time and describing nitrogen hypoxia as “perhaps the most humane method of execution ever devised.”
“Such treatment is much better than Smith gave Elizabeth Sennett nearly thirty-six years ago,” Alabama wrote, referring to the victim in the 1988 case.
United Nations experts, however, have “expressed alarm” over Smith’s looming execution, saying this month in a news release, “We are concerned that nitrogen hypoxia would result in a painful and humiliating death.” The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights called on Alabama to halt the execution, saying it “could amount to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment under international human rights law.”
“It’s not that nitrogen gas won’t kill you,” Dr. Joel Zivot, an associate professor of anesthesiology and surgery at Emory University, told CNN. “But will it kill you in a way that would comport with the constitutional requirement that it not be cruel and it not be torture?”
Smith was sentenced to death for his role in the 1988 murder for hire of Sennett. Her husband, minister Charles Sennett, hired someone who hired two others, including Smith, to kill his wife and make it look like a burglary for $1,000 each, according to court records.
Sennett, who court records say was having an affair and had taken out an insurance policy on his wife, killed himself a week after her murder as investigators’ focus turned to him. Smith was eventually arrested after investigators searched his home and found the Sennetts’ VCR, which he’d taken in the course of the killing.
Smith expressed a desire to be executed by nitrogen hypoxia both before and after the 2022 execution attempt. But that was before the state had a protocol, a federal judge noted this month.
His stated preference likely owed to his belief the state wasn’t close to finalizing a protocol, the judge wrote, adding if the state were forced to execute him using nitrogen, it would effectively place him “in an indefinite holding pattern” – keeping him safe from execution.
That changed in August, when Alabama suddenly agreed to execute Smith using nitrogen gas and released the protocol, which bore copious redactions the state said it needed to maintain security. Still, the protocol illuminated some aspects of how officials intended to carry out the execution, namely delivering the nitrogen using a mask.

While Alabama later agreed not to try to execute Smith again using lethal injection, he then challenged the nitrogen hypoxia protocol, claiming it left him at risk of “superadded pain” and could cause him to have a stroke or leave him in a vegetative state if it fails, court records show. He proposed the state either amend its protocol or execute him by firing squad.
The judge’s ruling early this month cleared the way for Alabama to proceed, finding there was “simply not enough evidence to find” the protocol would cause Smith superadded pain.
“It could, in a highly theoretical sense, but only if a cascade of unlikely events occurs,” the judge wrote. “Or it may well be painless and quick. Execution by nitrogen hypoxia is novel, and it will remain novel even if the Defendants employ Smith’s proposed amendments to the protocol.”
While the judge acknowledged the “heavily redacted” protocol maintained the Department of Corrections “familiar veil of secrecy over its capital punishment procedures,” he also noted the state had provided Smith’s team with an unredacted protocol.
The office of Republican Gov. Kay Ivey declined to provide an unredacted copy of the nitrogen hypoxia execution protocol or respond to CNN’s questions about experts’ concerns over it. Smith’s attorneys declined to provide a copy of the unredacted protocol to CNN, citing a protective order by the court.

CVXMZLEM0V_FEE5CXD4G0XC5QN,Top universities agree to settle financial aid suit for $104.5 million,"By Jeff Winter, CNN","3 minute read Published 4:07 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/24/us/top-universities-agree-to-settle-financial-aid-suit-for-usd104-5-million/,"Five universities agreed to settle a lawsuit accusing them of colluding on financial aid and admissions violations, according to new court filings.
Yale, Columbia, Duke, Brown and Emory universities will pay a combined $104.5 million to settle their portions of the case, which was brought by five former students against more than a dozen schools.
The suit alleges the universities violated antitrust law when they ignored their pledge to not weigh a student’s ability to pay tuition when considering whether or not to accept, a practice referred to as “need-blind” admission.
“It is past time for the presidents and governing bodies of the remaining defendants to stand up and do the right thing for their students and alumni, and resolve the overcharges to middle class and working class students that stemmed from the twenty years of collusion on financial aid by elite universities,” Robert D. Gilbert, one of the lead attorneys representing the students, said in a statement.
In the settlement filings, the schools continue to deny any wrongdoing or liability, asserting that “the Universities’ financial aid policies were legal and pro-competitive and financial aid awards were not artificially reduced, that the Universities have valid defenses to Plaintiffs’ allegations, and that Plaintiffs’ claims would have been rejected prior to trial, at trial, or on appeal.”

CNN reached out to all five schools for comment. Every school denied the allegations of the suit and any wrongdoing in separate statements.
“While Columbia disputes the merit of this case, the University has determined to put this matter behind us,” said a Columbia spokesperson. “The University’s participation in the 568 Group was intended to benefit our students.  Columbia’s mission is to help all students admitted, regardless of individual financial circumstances, achieve their goal of pursuing a world class education at our university.”
“We are settling this case to avoid the wasteful cost and inconvenience of prolonged litigation.  We remain committed to providing equitable access to a Duke education and ensuring students have the resources they need to truly thrive while here at Duke,” Frank Tramble, vice president of communications for Duke, said in a statement.
Columbia and Duke are both settling for $24 million, respectively.
“This settlement contains no admission that Yale did anything wrong but allows the university to avoid the cost and disruption of further litigation and to continue its work in making undergraduate education more affordable for more families,” a Yale spokesperson said in a statement. Yale agreed to settle for $18.5 million.
In a statement, an Emory spokesperson said, “While Emory continues to believe the plaintiffs’ claims have no merit, we are pleased the litigation is behind us. Our focus has been and always will be to make an Emory education accessible to all talented students, regardless of their financial resources, and we look forward to continuing that mission.” Emory is also settling for $18.5 million.
A spokesperson for Brown, which is settling for $19.5 million, said, “We vehemently believe that the claims had no merit, but given the time and financial resources required to take this case to trial, we determined that our resources are better spent resolving this matter and supporting the education of our students.”
Last year the University of Chicago, one of the other schools named in the suit, settled for $13.5 million, bringing the settlement total to $118 million.
Vanderbilt has reached an agreement to settle, but the amount has yet to be disclosed, according to a school spokesperson. “Though we believe the plaintiffs’ claims are without merit, we have reached a settlement in order to maintain our commitment to the privacy of our students and families and keep our focus on providing talented scholars from all social, cultural and economic backgrounds one of the world’s best undergraduate educations,” the spokesperson said in a statement.
The remaining schools yet to settle are the University of Pennsylvania, Georgetown University, Cornell University, University of Notre Dame, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, California Institute of Technology, Johns Hopkins University, Dartmouth College, Northwestern University and Rice University, according to attorneys."
CZEIMCCB0H_D9MRYOAC5PS0I2O,"White House clinic handed out medications with little oversight during past administrations, new investigation shows","By Brenda Goodman, CNN","6 minute read Updated 4:58 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/24/health/white-house-medical-unit-report/,"During previous presidential administrations, the White House Medical Unit operated a pharmacy where staff members freely distributed prescription and non-prescription drugs – including controlled substances – without adequate record-keeping and sometimes to people who weren’t legally eligible to get them, according to a report released this month.
The report – from the independent Office of the Inspector General of the US Department of Defense, which oversees the Military Health System and thus the White House Medical Unit – says the clinic also misused taxpayer funds by dispensing brand-name drugs instead of less expensive generics and providing free medical care to staff who weren’t allowed to get it.
The Office of the Inspector General said in a news release that the problems it uncovered in the White House clinic were “severe and systemic.”
The report is based on reviews of records from the White House Medical Unit, including prescriptions, from between 2017 and 2019. In addition, investigators interviewed more than 120 officials, including hospital administrators, military medical providers and pharmacists. The office also reviewed the transcripts of 70 previous interviews with former members of the White House Military Office who served there between 2009 and 2018.

The interviews indicated that medication was often dispensed without any written records. Before “we would get ready for a big overseas trip,” staffers were directed to make “prepacks” that consisted of plastic sandwich bags containing the sleeping drug Ambien as well as the stimulant Provigil, which is meant to help people stay awake. Both are categorized as controlled substances, meaning they require special handling and record-keeping by pharmacies because they carry a risk for dependence and abuse.
These prepacks would often be handed out to senior staff or their assistants without any record of who was ultimately getting them, the testimony said.
The directive to give medication, “including all controlled substances,” to patients’ representatives “without the need to present the patient’s ID card” was also found by investigators on a handwritten note dated March 21, 2014.
In one case, according to the excerpted testimony, a doctor in the medical unit asked a staffer if they could “hook up” someone with some Provigil “as a parting gift for leaving the White House.”
The report, published January 8, found that the “White House Medical Unit’s controlled substance records did not accurately reflect the unit’s procurement, inventory, or disposal of controlled substances.”
The report says the practices it documents did not comply with guidance from the government or the Department of Defense. Rather, it says, the problems occurred because officials in the medical unit “did not consider their operations to be a pharmacy,” despite the fact that the medications were kept and dispensed behind a door marked “pharmacy” and that medications were handed out in pill bottles that bore the logo of the White House Medical Unit.
However, there was no pharmacist on staff at the medical unit, although officials said controlled substance audits are performed quarterly, according to the report. Staff members testified that they submitted a request to get a pharmacy technician assigned to the White House, but it still had not been filled during the period of the investigation.
The unit’s lax prescribing practices were allowed to go unchecked because the office lacked oversight, according to the report. None of the senior Military Health System leaders interviewed for the report could identify which division was responsible for the medical office.
The investigation was launched after the Defense Department received complaints that a senior military medical officer assigned to the unit had “engaged in improper medical practice,” the report says.
In May 2018, the Office of the Inspector General began a separate inquiry into complaints about Dr. Ronny Jackson, who had previously served as physician to the president and head of the White House Medical Unit.

Several of the complaints alleged improper medical and pharmaceutical practices as well as problems with Jackson’s behavior. They also called into question the eligibility of some patients to be seen at the executive medical facilities in the National Capital Region.
Jackson, who is not named in the new report, was director of the White House Medical Unit from 2010 through 2014 and served as physician to the president for both Barack Obama and Donald Trump.
He stepped back from his role as physician to the president in March 2018, after Trump nominated him to helm the Department of Veterans Affairs. But he withdrew from consideration for that role after the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs interviewed 23 current and former colleges of Jackson’s who alleged that he led a hostile work environment and allowed overprescribing of medications.
He was named chief medical adviser to the president in February 2019.
Asked whether he participated in the activities described in the report or was aware of them, a spokesperson for Jackson – who is now serving in Congress as a representative from Texas – noted in a statement that “Dr. Jackson was not the Director of the White House Medical Unit during the timeframe mentioned in the report (2017-2019). He was Physician to the President and later Chief Medical Advisor. The Chief Medical Advisor is a policy role, not clinical. This healthcare policy role had no association or involvement with the White House Medical Unit’s clinical delivery of care.”
According to a review of the clinic’s medical records detailed in the report, staffers dispensed brand-name medications instead of less-expensive generics in violation of Defense Department policy. Over the three years from 2017 through 2019, the brand-name drugs Ambien and Provigil cost taxpayers $144,520, but generic versions of those drugs would have cost $2,064, the report found.
The White House Medical Unit cost taxpayers in another way too, the report says: by routinely treating people who weren’t legally eligible for care through the Department of Defense. This was done at the direction of senior leaders of the medical unit, the report says.

According to the Code of Federal Regulations, people who can access care through the Military Health System include the president, the vice president, their spouses and their minor children; members of the Cabinet; officials of the Department of Defense who were appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate; assistants to the president; the director of the White House Military Office; and former presidents and their spouses, widows and minor children. Anyone needing emergency care can get it through Military Health Services, but they have to pay for their care.
According to the report, the White House Medical Unit has about 60 patients enrolled in its clinic but provided “health care by proxy” to 6,000 White House and other government and employees and contractors, many of whom were ineligible to receive it. These employees were given urgent care including the provision of cold medications, antibiotics or sleep aids, the report says, but this care was not tracked and couldn’t be billed. Records show that the Department of Defense waived nearly $500,000 in care for senior US officials over three years, according to the report.
The report makes recommendations that include:
The report says that the Department of Defense’s assistant secretary for health affairs agreed with all the recommendations and that they would be implemented, although it noted those tasks haven’t yet been completed.
The White House did not immediately offer comment to CNN on the report’s findings or any changes made in the medical unit made since the investigation was completed."
D3J18SSEHP_VS3ESKHMSGDK4WO,Judge puts deposition of Fulton County DA on hold while ordering divorce records of her lead prosecutor unsealed,"By Holmes Lybrand, Hannah Rabinowitz, Nick Valencia and Jason Morris, CNN","3 minute read Updated 2:43 PM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240122,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/22/politics/fani-willis-nathan-wade/,"The deposition of Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis has been put on pause in the divorce proceedings of her lead prosecutor in the Georgia election subversion case, a judge decided Monday.
Willis’ testimony is being sought by the wife of special prosecutor Nathan Wade, who was hired by Willis several years ago to pursue the criminal case against former President Donald Trump and his allies over efforts to overturn the 2020 election.
Allegations of an improper romantic relationship between Willis and Wade first came to light in the Trump case as part of an effort to get that case dismissed. The alleged affair also has been raised in Wade’s divorce from Joycelyn Wade, who is seeking more information about Nathan Wade’s finances.
Judge Henry Thompson said during the hearing in Cobb County Superior Court on Monday that “it seems to me that Mr. Wade would be the first and best source of what his income has been and how he’s been spending it, and that he would have firsthand knowledge of whether he is engaged in an extramarital affair.”
“Only after I hear what Mr. Wade has to say do think I can make a determination of whether the proposed opponent has any unique knowledge about these issues,” Thompson said of Willis’ potential testimony.
In a court filing Friday, Joycelyn Wade included credit card statements showing Nathan Wade purchased airline tickets for Willis to accompany him on trips to Miami and San Francisco in recent years.
For her part, Willis has suggested in court filings that Joycelyn Wade is using the divorce proceedings to harass the district attorney and damage her reputation and is “obstructing and interfering with an ongoing criminal prosecution.”
On Monday, Joycelyn Wade’s attorneys pushed the judge to order Willis to testify, saying the district attorney “is trying to hide under the shield of her position” to avoiding sitting for a deposition that had been set for Tuesday in the divorce case.
“We’re not seeking her deposition as the district attorney of Fulton County,” Joycelyn Wade’s attorney Andrea Dyer Hastings said. “We’re seeking her deposition in her individual capacity as the alleged paramour of my client’s husband.”
Thompson also ruled Monday that records in the divorce proceedings should be unsealed, noting that court rules require a hearing before sealing such records and that such a hearing never took place.
The judge said he’d put in a written order regarding the unsealing later Monday.
The controversy surrounding the alleged affair between Willis and Nathan Wade has led to the circulation of a comment Willis made in 2020, when she told a local public access station that it would be “inappropriate for the No. 1 law enforcement officer in the state” to have a relationship with an employee. She added that she would not date people “that work under me” and reposted clips from the interview on her Facebook page in April of that year.
Willis’ office has not responded to multiple CNN requests for comment about the video.

D46RMQ469O_6PJ8QJYDGJ5ATAV,Seoul police chief indicted for negligence over Itaewon Halloween crush,"By Yoonjung Seo, Gawon Bae and Heather Chen, CNN","2 minute read Published 4:34 AM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240122,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/22/asia/south-korea-itaewon-halloween-crowd-crush-intl-hnk/,"Seoul’s police chief has been indicted for negligence over the 2022 crowd crush that killed more than 150 people during Halloween festivities in the popular Itaewon neighborhood that left the nation reeling.
South Korean police on Monday confirmed that Kim Kwang-ho, head of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency (SMPA), had been indicted in connection with the tragedy – the most senior police officer charged over the incident.
A statement released on Friday said Kim was charged with “professional negligence resulting in injury or death,” Reuters reported.
According to police emergency call logs from the night of October 29, 2022, multiple calls from members of the public were made about overcrowding as early as four hours before the situation gravely worsened.
Four police dispatches were sent out to Itaewon, which had hosted Halloween celebrations in Seoul for years.
But crowds had already swelled and the streets became so packed that partygoers were unable to move. Some slipped below the feet of others, unable to breathe. Most who died that night were young South Koreans – largely in their teens and early 20s.
In the aftermath of the crush, South Korean authorities maintained that they had no guidelines to handle the huge crowds that gathered for the Halloween festivities – stirring anger among survivors and families of the deceased.
Public outrage turned toward South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and his government – survivors and families of the victims remain strongly critical about what they see as a continuing lack of accountability on the part of South Korean authorities over the disaster.
Kim has not been dismissed from his position following the indictment, according to Seoul police.
His indictment comes after the arrest of two former officers in December on charges of destroying evidence relating to the disaster, authorities said.
The trauma of that night still haunts some survivors and bereaved families.
One survivor, who wanted to be known only by her last name Lee, told CNN in October that she had not been back to Itaewon and she doubted whether lessons from the disaster had “truly been learnt” by authorities.
“For me, Halloween and the Itaewon tragedy are (inextricably) linked,” she said. “It’s impossible to see reminders everywhere and not think about the death of friends that night.”"
D4ILTHHPCL_WPVNH4FV2ZFUO0J,"Medical facilities battered amid Israeli assault in Khan Younis, say Palestinian officials in Gaza, as death toll rises","By Celine Alkhaldi and Ibrahim Dahman, CNN","5 minute read Updated 3:10 AM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/22/middleeast/khan-younis-gaza-israel-attack-intl/,"Medical facilities in Khan Younis in southern Gaza have been battered amid an Israeli assault in the area Monday, Palestinian health officials said, as the number of people killed in Israel’s siege on Gaza continues to rise.
Dozens of people have been killed and wounded in the latest offensive in western Khan Younis, according to the Hamas-controlled health ministry in Gaza. Medical facilities including the Nasser Medical Complex, Al Amal Hospital and the Palestine Red Crescent Society headquarters are located in the area.
“The situation here is completely catastrophic. We didn’t sleep last night. The hospital is entirely besieged,” Ahmad Al Moghrabi, a doctor at the Nasser Medical Complex said in a video shared to his Instagram page Monday.
“There is no way for us to escape the hospital and no way for evacuation. The troops are all around, and the only roads for evacuation are filled with dead bodies,” he said.
The Nasser Medical Complex is receiving more serious injuries than it can accommodate, the health ministry said, adding that intensive care units are at capacity.
Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) staff at the Nasser hospital said “there is a sense of panic among staff, patients and displaced people sheltering inside the building,” as they could feel the ground shaking during the strikes, MSF said on social media.
The hospital wards are full and exit routes are blocked, preventing the evacuation of medical staff and patients from the hospital, MSF added.
Health officials also said that Israeli forces Monday stormed the Al Khair Hospital, west of Khan Younis, and detained a number of its medical staff, amid an ongoing “siege” of the area.
The Israeli military said it was targeting Hamas outposts, infrastructure, and command and control centers in Khan Younis and the action demanded “precise operations” due to the densely populated civilian areas.
﻿The military operation, which was launched on Sunday, is being led by Israel’s 98th Paratroopers Division and is expected to last for several days, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said, without providing further details on the timeline.
“Dismantling Hamas’ military framework in western Khan Younis is the heart of the logic behind the operation,” the statement added.
The IDF said it had seen militants at “sensitive sites” such as hospitals and shelters in the tightly packed civilian areas.
The Palestine Red Crescent Society said its headquarters and the Al-Amal Hospital, located in the same neighborhood, are “under siege” by Israeli forces, and soldiers are “targeting anyone who tries to move in the area.”
A field ambulance point has been established outside the Al-Amal neighborhood, where the medical facilities are located, to ensure a continuity of operations.
But the organization said the situation remains “extremely dangerous” and around 80 percent of the entrances and exits to Al-Amal are obstructed. Ambulance teams are facing “significant difficulties in reaching the wounded and injured due to the continuous bombardment in the governorate.”
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said he is “deeply concerned” by reports of the fighting, warning that that violence near Al-Amal hospital and the raid on Al-Khair not only “put patients and people seeking safety within these facilities at risk, but they also prevent newly injured people outside the hospitals from being reached and receiving care.”
Israel’s siege in Gaza has devastated swathes of the territory, diminished food, fuel and water supplies, and crushed the enclave’s medical system. Over 1.9 million Palestinians have been forcibly displaced, many multiple times, according to the UN’s agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA).
There are 16 out of 36 hospitals partially functioning across the strip, including nine in southern Gaza and seven in the north, the UN’s humanitarian affairs office reported on Sunday.
In southern Gaza, three hospitals – Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir El-Balah, and Nasser and Gaza European hospitals in Khan Younis – are “at risk of closure due to the issuance of evacuation orders in adjacent areas and the ongoing conduct of hostilities nearby,” OCHA said.
The Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza has been functioning to a “limited degree” since mid-January, added OCHA.
The Health Ministry said Monday that the number of Palestinians killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since October 7 rose to 25,295, with at least 63,000 injuries recorded. At least 190 people were killed and 340 injured in the last 24 hours, the Ministry statement said.

CNN cannot independently verify casualty figures in Gaza due to limited access to the area.
Hamas’s militant wing, the Al Qassam Brigades, said in a statement Monday that they were fighting in the western Khan Younis area, killing a number of Israeli soldiers with anti-personnel missiles.
Ahmed Naseem, a resident of Al-Amal neighborhood in Khan Younis, told CNN Monday that “intense” shelling of the area started in the early hours of Monday.
“There was heavy shelling in the area since the early hours of Monday. I could feel it intensely from the building I live in,” Nassem said. “We don’t even dare open the windows to see where these attacks are happening,” he said.
He said that he is “terrified of filming the scenes taking place nearby” because he fears he will be shot at, if a drone catches him in the act.
“We can’t even go to the rooftop because we cannot determine if drones will fire at us,” he said. “A few days ago water tanks were damaged, after drones fired right at them. My cousin, who was filling water at the time of the strike, was close to getting hit, but survived,” he added.

D5UUV0PPU2_W7ODHDJ2LTLOC4Z,US secretly warned Iran before ISIS terror attack,"By Natasha Bertrand, CNN","2 minute read Updated 10:27 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/25/politics/us-warned-iran-isis-terror-attack/,"The US secretly warned Iran that ISIS was planning a potential terror attack inside Iran’s borders before the group carried out a deadly attack near the burial site of slain military commander Qasem Soleimani on January 3, according to a US official.
The private warning was based on intelligence the US had obtained about ISIS’ plans and was given to Iran based on the US government’s “duty to warn” policy, the official said. That policy applies even to US adversaries.
The private warning, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, is notable not only because Iran is not a US partner or ally, but also because officials say Iran is behind a recent uptick in attacks by its proxy militias against US personnel in the Middle East. It is not clear through what channels the US delivered the message to Iran given that the countries have no formal diplomatic relations.
“Prior to ISIS’ terrorist attack on January 3, 2024, in Kerman, Iran, the US government provided Iran with a private warning that there was a terrorist threat within Iranian borders,” the official said. “The US government followed a longstanding ‘duty to warn’ policy that has been implemented across administrations to warn governments against potential lethal threats. We provide these warnings in part because we do not want to see innocent lives lost in terror attacks.”
The Iranian government was ultimately unable to stop the ISIS attack, which was the deadliest in Iran since its 1979 revolution. At least 84 people were killed and 284 injured in the blasts on January 3, which hit near Soleimani’s burial site in southern Iran. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack one day later.
CNN has reached out to the Iranian mission to the UN for comment.
According to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, any intelligence community entity that collects or acquires “credible and specific information indicating an impending threat of intentional killing, serious bodily injury, or kidnapping directed at a person or group of people…shall have a duty to warn the intended victim or those responsible for protecting the intended victim, as appropriate.” An intended victim includes both US persons and non-US persons, the policy says."
D64Y7ITRLM_QKXXV8DTV3TPNNG,Pro-war Putin critic Igor Girkin sentenced to four years in Russian prison on extremism charges,"By Rob Picheta, Sebastian Shukla and Anna Chernova, CNN","4 minute read Updated 10:30 AM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/25/europe/igor-girkin-russia-trial-verdict-intl/,"Igor Girkin, a prominent Russian pro-war blogger who criticized President Vladimir Putin’s handling of the war on Ukraine, has been found guilty on extremism charges and sentenced to four years in prison by a Moscow court.
Moscow City Court convicted Girkin, also known under his pseudonym, Strelkov, of inciting extremism – a charge he denied.
A former officer of Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) and an ex-military commander, Girkin played a crucial role in Russia’s annexation of Crimea and the early stages of invading Donbas, before becoming a prominent Russian military blogger with over half a million followers on Telegram.

Girkin was also closely linked to the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 in July 2014 and was convicted in absentia of mass murder for his role in the tragedy.
As part of his Thursday sentence he was also barred from accessing the internet, a move that essentially shuts off his ability to publicly lambast Putin’s leadership.
Girkin was arrested in July and charged with calling for extremist activities after he became increasingly critical of Putin and his military’s mishaps in Ukraine.
His detention came weeks after the failed rebellion by Wagner mercenaries in Russia, a period in which Putin’s grasp on power appeared to be more fragile than ever.
A group of around 100 of his supporters gathered outside the Moscow court on Thursday to show opposition to his sentencing.
Girkin’s wife told CNN on Thursday she had been unable to see her husband for six months. “Today I am very worried now. To be honest, I have a storm of negative emotions,” she said.
“It seems to me that now this is a demonstrative flogging for everyone and thus all the heroes of Russian,” she said. “They are simply not wanted now and are being removed. We hope that we still have justice and that my husband will be released sooner or later, and I hope that this will happen after the elections, because now a purge is underway.”
Girkin is among the best-known of Russia’s “milbloggers,” a group of war correspondents who support the invasion but have grown increasingly critical of the military’s faltering operations in Ukraine, and pushed for a harsher approach.
He co-founded an ultra-nationalist political group called the Angry Patriots Club last spring, and told Reuters that Russia was “on the cusp of very grave internal political changes of a catastrophic character.”
But just days before his arrest Girkin intensified his criticisms of Putin, calling the president a “lowlife” and a “cowardly bum” in a blistering post on his Telegram channel.
“For 23 years, the country was led by a lowlife who managed to ‘blow dust in the eyes’ of a significant part of the population. Now he is the last island of legitimacy and stability of the state,” the post read. “But the country will not be able to withstand another six years of this cowardly bum in power.”
Thursday’s verdict highlights the increasing paranoia emanating from the Kremlin about how the war on Ukraine is being conducted.
Both Girkin and another famous war critic, Yevgeny Prigozhin, have now paid a heavy price for overstepping the mark in their criticism of Putin.
Girkin faces a prison sentence in a Russian penal colony with his access to the internet cut – effectively severing his sharp tongue from his 500,000 Telegram followers.
Prigozhin, who ultimately died in a plane crash, was marginalized, had business operations clipped and was publicly rebuked by Putin for stoking a rebellion just weeks before Girkin’s arrest.
Both Girkin and Prigozhin had constantly called for more military support and ammunition for units in Ukraine and personally attacked the top brass of the Russian Defense Ministry, Sergei Shoigu and Valery Gerasimov.
Girkin is a former colonel in Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) and served as defense minister in the separatist so-called Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) in eastern Ukraine, territory captured by pro-Russian forces in 2014.
It was during his time in the DPR that he contributed to the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over eastern Ukraine in 2014, a court in the Netherlands found. All 298 people onboard were killed. The court in 2022 found Girkin guilty of mass murder for his role in the incident and he was sentenced in absentia to life in prison.
According to the court, Girkin participated in the conflicts in Chechnya, Transnistria and Bosnia.

D7FN0V0ER4_GV4KD14DKVQZY32,Judge will not allow Michigan school shooter to testify in mother’s trial if he invokes the Fifth Amendment,"By Nicki Brown and Zoe Sottile, CNN","5 minute read Updated 7:41 PM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/26/us/ethan-crumbley-fifth-amendment-testimony/,"The judge presiding over the trial of Michigan school shooter Ethan Crumbley’s mother said she would not allow the gunman to testify if he invokes his Fifth Amendment right, as his attorneys have previously indicated he would.
The Fifth Amendment protects a person from being “compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.” The amendment is often invoked to avoid answering specific questions during testimony.
“It’s not that I’m saying you can’t call him as a witness, but two of his attorneys have said in no uncertain terms that he’s taking the Fifth,” Judge Cheryl Matthews told defense attorney Shannon Smith in court Friday.
“I am going to prohibit you from putting any witness on the stand who takes the Fifth in front of the jury, that is strictly prohibited,” the judge said.

Jennifer Crumbley’s attorneys have asked the judge to compel her teenage son and his two jail psychiatrists to testify at her trial. Her son was sentenced to life in prison without parole in December for killing four of his classmates and wounding six others and a teacher at Michigan’s Oxford High School in 2021. He was 15 during the attack.
Now, his parents are facing their own trials for manslaughter, with prosecutors alleging the teen’s parents are also responsible for the deaths. Prosecutors have accused Jennifer and James Crumbley of ignoring their son’s pleas for mental health care and buying him a gun despite his deteriorating mental state.
Ethan Crumbley’s attorneys have indicated they will not waive privilege or confidentiality for his medical records, the testimony of his doctors, or his own testimony. A Sunday letter from his attorneys indicated he’s been advised to invoke his Fifth Amendment right if called to testify as the appeal of his life sentence without the possibility of parole remains pending.
Jennifer Crumbley’s attorney claimed in a filing earlier this week that the teenager’s testimony is crucial to refute text messages and journal entries he wrote about his parents’ knowledge of and involvement with his mental health.
Judge Matthews has not yet ruled on Ethan Crumbley’s doctors testifying.
Ethan Crumbley told a friend his mother “laughed” when he asked to see a doctor about his mental health, according to messages shown in court Friday during his mother’s manslaughter trial.
The messages were shown during the testimony of Det. Edward Wagrowski, a cell phone forensics expert who analyzed phone and social media data from the Crumbleys.
Ethan Crumbley texted his friend in early April 2021 and said he was hearing people talking to him and seeing someone in the distance, according to the texts.

“I actually asked my dad to take [me] to the Doctor yesterday but he just gave me some pills and told me to ‘Suck it up,’” Ethan Crumbley wrote in the messages. “Like it’s at the point that I am asking to got [sic] the doctor. My mom laughed when I told her.”
Crumbley texted his friend he was experiencing insomnia and paranoia, and he was thinking about calling 911 so he could go to the hospital, according to the evidence presented in court.
“I’m going to ask my parents to go to the doctor’s tomorrow or Tuesday again. But this time I am going to tell them about the voicees [sic],” he texted his friend. “Like I am mentally and physically dying.”
Later in the month, Jennifer Crumbley messaged the mother of her son’s friend, saying Ethan Crumbley had been acting “kind of depressed.”
“I’m not used to Ethan being moody he’s usually pretty happy and we’ll talk about anything,” she said, adding she thought her son had been stressed about his grades.
Prosecutors also displayed concerning messages between the Crumbleys from the month prior to the shooting.
On March 8, 2021, Jennifer Crumbley messaged her husband expressing concern about their son, saying he was “upset” and she didn’t want him to do “anything stupid.”
The next day, Ethan Crumbley repeatedly texted his mother saying he thought someone was in the house – flushing the toilet and slamming a door – even though nobody was home.

“Maybe it’s just my paranoia,” he texted her.
Phone records show his mother did not call or text him until the next day, Wagrowski testified.
On March 17, Jennifer Crumbley messaged her husband saying she was going to “get drunk and ride my horse,” according to Wagrowski’s testimony. Later that evening, Ethan Crumbley texted her multiple times about a demon throwing objects in the house, according to the testimony.
Jennifer Crumbley called her son about an hour after he texted her, and the phone call lasted 19 seconds, according to cell phone records shown in court. Photographs from her phone show she and her husband, James, were at a barn during the time she did not respond to her son, Wagrowski testified.
A few days later, Ethan Crumbley texted his mother saying items were flying off the shelf. His mother did not call him until hours later, and evidence indicates his parents were at the barn again that day, Wagrowski said in his testimony.
Wagrowski testified the “vast majority” of the parents’ Facebook messages he read were about their horses. He estimated that upwards of 75% of the conversations, which began in early 2021, were about the horses, and he could only recall reading a couple conversations about their son. Wagrowski testified he did not see any conversations discussing getting mental health treatment for their son.
And on the morning of the shooting, Oxford High School officials contacted Jennifer Crumbley regarding disturbing drawings her son drew on a math worksheet. According to messages shown in court, Jennifer Crumbley sent the image to her husband and said “Call NOW. Emergency.”
“My God. WTF,” James Crumbley responded, then added he was still waiting on their horse’s vet.
Prosecutors played surveillance video in court that showed the gunman’s parents in the school counselor’s office for about 12 minutes that day. After they left the school, Wagrowski testified both parents returned to work.
After the school sent out an active shooter alert later that day, Jennifer Crumbley texted her son telling him she loved him, asking if he was OK – and then writing “Ethan don’t do it,” according to messages shown in court.

D9CVDUUU9Q_92YCIXF98D7FEF1,"Netanyahu must be removed, top former Israeli national security officials say","By Alex Marquardt, CNN","5 minute read Published 5:00 AM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/26/middleeast/netanyahu-letter-israel-national-security-intl/,"More than 40 senior former Israeli national security officials, celebrated scientists and prominent business leaders have sent a letter to Israel’s president and speaker of parliament demanding that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu be removed from office for posing what they say is an “existential” threat to the country.
The signatories on the letter include four former directors of Israel’s foreign and domestic security services, two former heads of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and three Nobel Prize winners.
The letter blasts the coalition Netanyahu assembled to form the most right-wing government ever in Israel, along with his highly controversial efforts to overhaul Israel’s judiciary that they say led to security lapses that resulted in the October 7 attacks, the deadliest day in Israel’s history.
“We believe that Netanyahu bears primary responsibility for creating the circumstances leading to the brutal massacre of over 1,200 Israelis and others, the injury of over 4,500, and the kidnapping of more than 230 individuals, of whom over 130 are still held in Hamas captivity,” it reads. “The victim’s blood is on Netanyahu’s hands.”
Related article Israeli government divisions deepen as cabinet minister says defeating Hamas is unrealistic
The letter was sent to Israeli President Isaac Herzog on Thursday and to Knesset Speaker Amir Ohana on Friday.
Netanyahu’s popularity has fallen dramatically since starting his sixth term as prime minister, just over a year ago. Critics have blasted his judicial reform efforts – which threatened to trigger a constitutional crisis and divided the country, with months of massive, regular demonstrations.
“Leaders of Iran, Hezbollah, and Hamas,” the letter says, “openly praised what they correctly saw as a destabilizing and erosive process of Israel’s stability, led by Netanyahu, and seized the opportunity to harm and damage Israel’s security.”
Among the 43 signatories are former IDF chiefs Moshe Ya’alon and Dan Halutz, Tamir Pardo and Danny Yatom, who ran the Mossad intelligence agency, and Nadav Argaman and Yaakov Peri, who were directors of the domestic security service, Shin Bet.
Former CEOs, ambassadors, government officials and three Nobel laureates for chemistry - Aaron Ciechanover, Avram Hershko and Dan Shechtman - also signed the letter.
A poll released this week by Israel’s Channel 13 suggests that Netanyahu’s political party, Likud, would now come in a distant second if elections were held today. The frontrunner in the poll was the National Unity party led by former IDF chief of staff Benny Gantz, currently a member of Netanyahu’s war cabinet.
The next elections aren’t planned until late 2026, though there have been protests and calls for early elections, including from one of Israel’s main opposition leaders, Yair Lapid.
“The situations that brought Israel to elections beforehand are almost nothing in comparison to what Israel is going through now,” said Haim Tomer, a longtime Mossad officer who retired after heading the agency’s intelligence division and who signed the letter demanding Netanyahu’s removal.
“Everybody understands that Netanyahu is incompetent to lead Israel,” Tomer told CNN.
In the past week Netanyahu has repeatedly expressed his opposition to Palestinian sovereignty for security reasons, as Israel’s main ally, the United States, continues to call for a two-state solution.
The letter’s signatories accuse Netanyahu of spending years propping up Hamas in Gaza at the expense of the Palestinian Authority, which the US has argued should be revitalized to govern both the West Bank and Gaza.
CNN has reported that for years Qatar delivered cash-filled suitcases to Gaza with Netanyahu’s blessing, despite concerns from his own government. The money was intended to pay civil servants’ salaries and retirees’ benefits. It is now delivered via bank transfers rather than in cash, and as recently as last month, Qatar said it was continuing to pay it.
To form his current government, Netanyahu brought together other parties well to the right of Likud and assembled the most right-wing government in Israeli history. Two of its most prominent members, Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben Gvir, have been called out by the Biden administration for arguing that Palestinians should leave Gaza.
The letter accuses Netanyahu of refusing to take responsibility for the October 7 attacks, instead “blaming others and inciting against those who had fought to save the Israeli democracy from his destructive actions and plans, and now mobilize whole heartedly to support Israel’s national war efforts.”
It concludes with a plea to the Israeli president and Knesset speaker to replace the prime minister, as well as a warning: “The Israeli nation and Jewish history will not forgive you if you don’t fulfill your utmost national responsibility.”
Neither the president nor the speaker has the power to remove a prime minister from office unilaterally, but the letter was also to be distributed by the speaker to Knesset members who can remove and replace a prime minister.
The right people need “to get their hands on the steering wheel,” said Tomer, the former Mossad official.
“I think people start to look from the outside towards Israel and ask themselves what happened to this country,” Tomer said. “What’s happened to this country with very, very smart people that are now being led with some idiots?”
“The word that we have been using in the circles that I’ve been participating in is: we need a restart, we need a restart.”

Israel has come under intense international criticism for its war in Gaza, which has killed more than 25,000 Palestinians and displaced almost two million people since the October 7 Hamas attacks.
Israel has repeatedly insisted that its war is not against the Palestinian people but Hamas militants who are holding more than 130 hostages in dire conditions in the war zone.
Netanyahu told a news conference last week that politicians who are asking him to step down are essentially asking for a Palestinian state.
Israel’s actions in Gaza are the subject of a genocide case in the International Court of Justice (ICJ), initiated by South Africa that accuses the country’s leadership of intending to “bring about the destruction of its Palestinian population.”
Israel denies the allegations, arguing that the war is being fought in self-defense and that its leadership has not displayed genocidal intent."
D9NOFBN0S0_MOOU1XPFRC81OBW,Sofia Richie Grainge announces pregnancy with ‘Vogue’ photoshoot,"By Alex Rees, CNN","3 minute read Published 5:45 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/25/style/sofia-richie-grainge-pregnant-vogue/,"For young celebrities in the public eye today, many of life’s milestones are accompanied by a glossy magazine feature — or perhaps a carefully-staged paparazzi shoot, depending on the narrative at hand.
It could be the announcement of a new professional venture or personal success; a “revenge body” reveal if there’s a failed relationship to bounce back from or a wedding dress reveal if love — and luxe confetti — is in the air. And then, of course, there’s the time-honored tradition of the fashion shoot-meets-baby-bump-debut.
Sofia Richie Grainge is the latest star to partake in this trend, with a “Vogue” spread released Thursday featuring her in bump-baring shirts, tank tops and even some loose tailoring as a means of confirming her first pregnancy.
(Richie Grainge and her husband, the music executive Elliot Grainge, were married last April in a ceremony which was also splashed across “Vogue.”)
Richie Grainge told “Vogue” she learned of her pregnancy after a whirlwind trip to Milan Fashion Week last fall, when it turned out what she first thought to be jet-lag was an early bout of morning sickness.
“I told everyone that I had bought them a gift from Milan,” the fashion influencer told the magazine of how she and Grainge then hid her positive pregnancy tests in designer gift boxes. “That’s how we told all of our parents. Watching their reaction go from like, ‘I’m about to get an expensive present’ to like ‘I’m about to get a grandchild’ was really sweet.”

“I’ve learned more in the past six months than I have in my entire life,” Richie Grainge continued, confirming that her baby — a girl — will be due in the late spring. “And also just like what the female body is capable of. Every week brings new things, whether it’s hormonal shifts or expansion — there’s just so much our bodies go through, and it’s so interesting to experience it all.”
Having kept her news among close family and friends until today, Richie Grainge acknowledged stepping back from the social media platforms where her “It girl” aesthetic is widely-followed (and widely-envied) during the early stages of her pregnancy. That was a conscious choice, she said: “I’m definitely not posting as much. It’s been hard for me to have that connection with my followers when I can’t really be honest,” she explained.
And while she will be back in their feeds moving forward, it will be with some new boundaries in mind. “I’m not going to publicize my child on Instagram,” Richie Grainge said. “I don’t plan to take that approach because I want my kid to have the option to do what she wants with her life. If she wants to be a private person, I want her to be able to make that choice.”"
DBYSWCKKMC_UWV4ZUKYHPSGCMF,New York man found guilty of murder after 20-year-old woman was shot and killed when car turned in wrong driveway,"By Brynn Gingras, Nicki Brown, Nic F. Anderson and Ray Sanchez, CNN","4 minute read Updated 7:30 PM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/23/us/new-york-man-found-guilty-of-murder-after-20-year-old-woman-was-shot-and-killed-when-car-turned-in-wrong-driveway/,"Kevin Monahan was found guilty of second-degree murder Tuesday for shooting and killing a woman who was a passenger in a car that mistakenly drove up his driveway in rural New York last year, according to Katherine Thompson, deputy chief clerk of Washington County Supreme and County Courts.
Monahan had pleaded not guilty to charges of murder in the second degree, reckless endangerment and tampering with physical evidence in the death of 20-year-old Kaylin Gillis on April 15, 2023. He was convicted of all charges after about two hours of deliberations.
Monahan shot at the vehicle when it accidentally turned into his driveway while the occupants looked for a friend’s house in Washington County, roughly 55 miles north of Albany. Gillis died a short time after the shooting.
District Attorney Tony Jordan will seek a maximum sentence of 25 years to life when Monahan is sentenced on March 1.
Prosecutors argued that the 66-year-old defendant acted recklessly when the teens used his driveway to turn their vehicles. The defense said what happened was a  terrible accident.
Defense attorney Kurt Mausert said his client was disappointed by the verdict. Mausert told CNN the trial was “ripe with appellate issues” and he planned an appeal.
“He truly believes what happened was an accident. That he stumbled and he fell and the shotgun went off by accident,” Mausert said of his client.
“You got a beautiful 20-year-old girl, who, of no fault of her own, is dead. There’s no way to look at this case other than a horrible tragedy. But an accident has been turned into depraved indifference and that’s a tragedy also,” Mausert said.
Jordan said he hopes the guilty verdict means the families of Gillis and the others who were in the car “can have continued hope that there is justice and have something to hold onto as they move into their next chapter of recovery.”
“For us, our hope was to let people know that justice is possible,” Jordan told CNN. “There were neighbors who stepped up and heard something and reported it. Our hope is people can have faith in the system.”
Monahan took the stand at his trial last week, testifying that he felt like he and his wife were under siege that day and that he only wanted to protect his wife, Spectrum News 1 reported.
Monahan told jurors that he and his wife were awakened by three vehicles in his driveway: two SUVs and a motorcycle revving its engine, the station reported. He testified that he told his wife to hide in their closet and he loaded his 20-gauge pump-action shotgun before going outside.
Monahan testified that he thought about past criminal activity in the area and fired a warning shot into the air. The vehicles began to leave slowly, he testified, and he lost his balance on some nails on his deck when the second fatal shot was fired, Spectrum News 1 reported.
Under cross-examination, Monahan was not able to point out in a photograph the nails that caused him to lose his balance. He was emotional when asked how Gillis’ death made him feel, telling the jury that his “soul is dead,” the station reported.
Gillis was fatally shot just days after a Black teenager in Kansas City was shot twice by a White homeowner after going to the wrong address to pick up his siblings.
In the New York shooting, both Monahan and Gillis are White.
After the shots were fired, Gillis and the rest of the group drove away from the house, looking for cell phone service and then called 911.
They were found around 5 miles away from the home in the town of Salem. First responders began administering CPR but Gillis was pronounced dead at the scene.
Police officers went to Monahan’s home in Hebron and found him to be uncooperative, the Washington County sheriff told reporters at the time.
Gillis’ family issued a statement at the time praising her as a “kind, beautiful soul and a ray of light to anyone who was lucky enough to know her.”
“She was a big sister, much loved daughter, devoted friend and partner to her loving boyfriend. She was just beginning to find her way in the world with kindness, humor, and love,” the family said. “Kaylin was a talented artist, an honor student, a Disney fanatic and loved animals. She was looking forward to starting college in Florida to pursue her dream of becoming a marine biologist.”
Gillis graduated from Schuylerville High School in 2021 and held the position of “flyer” on the cheerleading team."
DCXM0D7EG3_YEFPB9U6899J6TU,Trump is already flexing strongman power in the GOP,"Analysis by Stephen Collinson, CNN","7 minute read Updated 8:30 AM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/26/politics/trump-strongman-power-gop-analysis/,"Donald Trump is moving to assert total dominance over the Republican Party in a harbinger of the strongman rule he envisages for his possible second term, following his twin triumphs in Iowa and New Hampshire.
The ex-president is trying to intimidate Nikki Haley into abandoning the GOP presidential race. He’s warning donors who contribute to the former South Carolina governor they’ll be ostracized. Trump’s supporters launched a bid to jolt the Republican National Committee to anoint him presumptive nominee after only two nominating races — until Trump backtracked amid concern from his allies it could backfire.
And the 45th president is now pressuring GOP members of Congress to kill an immigration deal to deprive President Joe Biden of a victory and to ensure he can exploit the border crisis on the campaign trail. Trump has also been browbeating former opponents and key decision makers in the GOP to quickly endorse him as he forces the party to genuflect before him as he did during four years in the White House.
Related article Haley remains defiant as Trump ratchets up attacks on last-standing 2024 GOP rival
Trump’s brisk assertion of his growing power as the likely nominee is a characteristic dismantling of constraints that echoes his behavior in office. He was twice impeached in his single term, which ended after he tried to overturn an election in which voters ejected him from office. It is consistent with Trump’s self-created persona as the strongest person in every room that sustained him through a life in business, reality television and as an ex-president.
Among Trump’s critics, his behavior is stirring fresh concerns that his potential second term could mean a dawn of autocracy in the Oval Office. And Trump’s desire to pressure Haley out of the race after only two contests – while he leads in the delegate count 32 to 17, out of the 1,215 needed for the GOP crown – is consistent with his disrespect for democratic processes.
The former president is not hiding his intent. He has frequently warned, for instance, that he would dedicate a second term to exacting “retribution” on his enemies. Almost every day he demands full criminal immunity for presidents, partly as an effort to avoid prosecution for his attempt to overturn the 2020 election but also to permit him to behave exactly as he pleases in a possible second term with no risk of consequences.
In a rally Saturday night in Manchester, New Hampshire, that pulsated with aggressive imagery, the ex-president praised Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán as a “great man.” Orbán has methodically eroded political freedoms, cracked down on the independent press, and discredited the electoral system, the courts and alternative sources of power. He’s regarded by many “Make America Great Again” supporters as a hero and a model. “Some people don’t like him because he’s too strong. It’s good to have a strong man at the head of a country,” Trump reflected. His comments cemented an impression that Orbán may be a better prototype for the authoritarian leader that the ex-president would like to become than the extreme 1930s European dictators to which his recent rhetoric, toward immigrants especially, has drawn comparisons.
The former president’s autocratic instincts are one reason why the coming election promises to be one of the most fateful in modern American history.
But there are also risks for Trump in his truculent approach. By throwing his weight around he could confirm Biden’s arguments that he’d endanger democracy if elected to a second term in November. And the bullying approach and sexist language he’s using toward Haley could alienate some of the more moderate, independent, suburban voters that she’s attracting in the GOP primary. These are exactly the kinds of voters that Trump alienated in his 2020 defeat. If he’s to win another term, he must at least mitigate his deficit to Biden among this group in November.
Katon Dawson, a former chairman of the South Carolina GOP, noted the potential consequences of Trump’s behavior in an interview with Kasie Hunt on “State of the Race” on CNN International and CNN Max on Thursday. Dawson, one of the few Palmetto State GOP heavyweights supporting Haley, warned that Trump would “polarize” women in South Carolina with his “seedy little comments about what Nikki had on.” He added: “Donald Trump is running more like he wants to be the President of Cuba instead of the President of the United States.”
Haley might not have beaten Trump in Iowa or New Hampshire. But she provoked him by refusing to quickly fold her campaign and endorse him like other GOP candidates, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott. Trump’s fury was revealed in a self-absorbed victory speech in New Hampshire on Tuesday night. Haley’s mockery of that performance has infuriated the former president even more.
“We did our thing and we said what we had to say and then Donald Trump got out there and just threw a temper tantrum,” Haley said in Charleston on Wednesday. “He pitched a fit. He was insulting. He was doing what he does, but I know that’s what he does when he’s insecure.”
Trump has appeared deeply frustrated that Haley is defying his calls for her to leave the race, CNN’s Kaitlan Collins has reported. During his New Hampshire speech, he mocked the dress she wore on caucus night in Iowa. He has been calling her “birdbrain” on social media. Trump has also warned that anyone who makes a financial contribution to her will be “barred from the MAGA camp” – which Haley has turned around into a fundraising pitch for her campaign.
Related article Trump comes out against draft RNC resolution from supporter declaring him presumptive nominee
It is not surprising that there have been calls for Haley to end her campaign, given the size of her defeats to Trump and the fact that New Hampshire, where independents can vote in the GOP primary, was her best shot at a win. Parties generally like to consolidate quickly behind a nominee to look ahead to a general election once the destiny of the primary race becomes obvious. But the disdain toward Haley from Trump world is remarkable.
For instance, even before all the polls had closed on Tuesday night, Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, one of Trump’s top supporters, issued a statement saying Haley’s campaign “must end” after the ex-president’s “monumental” victory “for the sake of the republic.” The history of past campaigns suggests that restraint and respect might be more effective in prodding Haley out of the race than threats. And while her prospects appear grim, the idea that a candidate should abandon a campaign after just two contests in a nationwide primary season just because the front-runner says so is in itself an affront to a democratic process.
Even Trump seems to have been convinced some of this has gone too far. The former president on Thursday came out against an RNC draft resolution that would have declared him the presumptive nominee — a move that would have allowed him access to the RNC’s data and fundraising operation. It would have essentially joined the party’s forces with Trump while an election involving a rival was still taking place.
But Trump wrote on Truth Social that while he appreciated the RNC’s “respect and devotion,” he wanted to win the “old fashioned way,” at the ballot box. While the campaign had initially approved of the resolution and Trump himself was on board, that changed when a backlash ensued, a source familiar told Collins. The resolution was withdrawn later Thursday.
The former president, whose business career was mythologized in “The Art of the Deal,” is more concerned currently with the art of killing a deal – one being painfully pieced together by Republican and Democratic senators to address a southern border crisis. Trump has been lobbying Republicans in both private conversations and public statements on social media to oppose the deal because he wants to campaign on the issue this year and ensure Biden doesn’t get a legislative victory that could ease pressure at the border and help his reelection, sources said.
Related article GOP senators seethe as Trump blows up delicate immigration compromise
Trump’s maneuvering has infuriated some GOP senators looking for a deliverable for their voters at a moment when Biden appears willing to accept the return of some hardline Trump-era immigration policies in a compromise. Republican Sen. Todd Young of Indiana called any efforts to disrupt the ongoing negotiations “tragic.” Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, a frequent Trump antagonist who’s not running for reelection, said that if Trump sabotaged the deal just to blame Biden, it would be “appalling.” Trump and his acolytes on Capitol Hill have also made clear their opposition to Biden’s latest $60 billion aid package for Ukraine, which is running out of bullets and ammunition.
Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, who has been heavily involved in both the immigration and Ukraine discussions, raised concerns that the looming shadow of one man – who doesn’t currently hold any governing role – could overwhelm a branch of the US government.
“I hope we don’t live in a world today in which one person inside the Republican Party holds so much power that they could stop a bipartisan bill to try to give the president additional power at the border to make more sense of our immigration policy,” Murphy told CNN’s Manu Raju.
“I would hope that one person isn’t so powerful inside the Republican Party to hand Ukraine to Vladimir Putin, but we’ll find out the answer to that.”"

A scathing edition of the association’s annual State of Tobacco Control report, published Wednesday, calls o﻿n the Biden administration to finalize the proposed rules and says that failing to do so will result in more death and disease caused by smoking, especially among historically marginalized Black communities.
Related article Dozens of health organizations pledge ‘full support’ for federal ban on menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars
“Menthol cigarettes make it both easier to start and harder to quit by reducing the harshness of the smoke and cooling the throat,” the report notes. Researchers estimate that a regulation banning menthol cigarettes would save about 654,000 lives over the next 40 years, especially those of Black smokers, who are disproportionately more likely to smoke menthols.
In October, the US Food and Drug Administration sent rules for banning the manufacturing and sale of menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars to the White House’s Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review. Within the OMB is the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, which is responsible for reviewing all regulatory action – and this review process is a key step before a final rule may be published in the Federal Register.
But no action on this regulation has been made since it was submitted to the OMB. Under a “timetable” for each rule – on menthol in cigarettes and flavors in cigars – a final rule action has been given the date of March.
“In an extremely disappointing end to 2023, the White House bowed to tobacco industry pressure and failed to move forward in 2023 with finalizing rules to eliminate menthol as a characterizing flavor in cigarettes and prohibit all characterizing flavors in cigars,” the new report says. “This lack of action prioritizes politics and tobacco industry profits over public health and if the White House fails to finalize the rules.”

Proponents of the regulation were hoping that the rule would be finalized by January 20. That would have given it exactly a year to be implemented ahead of Inauguration Day, when there could be changes coming to the White House.
“That would have given the FDA the year’s time it claimed was necessary to implement the regulation,” said Daniel Karon, an attorney based in Cleveland who has been following the menthol cigarette rule and who teaches consumer law at the University of Michigan Law School and The Ohio State University Moritz College of Law.
“Even if the Biden administration freed up the regulation to go forward, the question is, would that be sufficient time for the FDA to enact it? Or would it just die on the vine because Trump could come in and stop the rulemaking process in its tracks?” he said of the potential Republican nominee. “If the White House does not at least make an internal decision this week and Biden does not win a second term, a new president could kill the regulation before it ever gets started.”
Another hurdle if the rules are implemented: Tobacco companies will probably sue in federal court, Karon said.
“Big Tobacco will petition for two things: declaratory relief, that is, a declaration or order that what the FDA issued is illegal, and equitable relief, that is, an injunction requiring withdrawal of the regulation,” he said. “Declaratory and injunctive relief are likely going to be on Big Tobacco’s mind when it inevitably files its federal lawsuit against the federal government.”

Menthol cigarettes have emerged as a pivotal issue for President Joe Biden, who is facing an election year with worries over diminished enthusiasm from Black voters.
Some civil rights leaders with ties to the tobacco industry have raised concerns with the White House that a ban would criminalize menthol cigarettes and lead to an increase in deadly police interactions. Meanwhile, the NAACP and the Congressional Black Caucus have endorsed the ban, along with dozens of public health experts, saying it would save hundreds of thousands of Black lives.
The FDA proposal would ban the manufacturing and sale of menthols but would not police smokers themselves. The rule explicitly states, “This regulation does not include a prohibition on individual consumer possession or use, and FDA cannot and will not enforce against individual consumers for possession or use of menthol cigarettes. FDA’s enforcement will only address manufacturers, distributors, wholesalers, importers, and retailers.”
The divide among Black leaders has made the proposed ban a ripe political issue for the administration. It has delayed a decision on the issue﻿ three times.

Tobacco remains the leading cause of preventable death and disease in the US, according to the new State of Tobacco Control report. About 16 million people in the US live with a tobacco-related disease.
“Tobacco use is responsible for 480,000 deaths each year, including 45,000 Black individuals. Right now, President Biden can take action and save lives if he finalizes the rules to end the sale of menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars,” Harold Wimmer, president and CEO of the American Lung Association, said in a news release Wednesday.
“Once these rules are final, fewer people will start smoking, millions will begin their journey to quit and lives will be saved,” he said. “We know that the tobacco industry will do anything to protect their profits at the expense of public health, so the White House must focus on implementing lifesaving policies and push back against the industry’s delay tactics.”
The State of Tobacco Control report acts as a “report card” that evaluates state and federal policies. In the new edition, the federal government gets an A grade for its mass media campaigns that encourage people to not smoke or vape. But it received a C grade for its federal regulation of tobacco products, a D grade for how federal health care plans may be required to cover tobacco cessation and an F grade for its tobacco tax policies.
Taxes are considered one of the most effective ways to reduce smoking, particularly among children, studies suggest. But Congress hasn’t raised federal tobacco taxes in 15 years, since 2009. The federal cigarette tax remains $1.01 per pack, and taxes can vary among other tobacco products.

In the new report, the American Lung Association lists five “key actions” for the Biden administration and Congress to take this year to help eliminate death and disease caused by tobacco use. These include for the FDA to finalize its premarket review of tobacco product applications, for Congress to at least maintain current funding for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Office on Smoking and Health and to pass the Helping Tobacco Users Quit Act, which would expand comprehensive Medicaid coverage for tobacco cessation. Another key action is for the FDA and Departments of Justice and Homeland Security to remove all illegal tobacco products from the marketplace.
The White House “swiftly” finalizing the two rules that will remove menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars from the market was No. 1 among those key actions.
“This report highlighted how the tobacco industry continues to exert its political and economic power to undermine, delay, or prevent the enactment of effective tobacco control policies in the US,” Daniel Giovenco, assistant professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia Mailman School of Public Health, who was not involved in the new report, wrote in an email.
“While tremendous progress has been made in reducing tobacco use over the last several decades, social inequalities in tobacco use persist, contributing to grave tobacco-related health disparities,” he said. “US lawmakers and public health agencies must double down on efforts to enact legislation and increase funding for tobacco control initiatives in order to mitigate a leading cause of preventable disease, disability, and death in the US.”
The State of Tobacco Control report also highlights how a decline in adult cigarette smoking rates has stalled, with about 11.6% of adults reporting smoking in 2022, compared with 11.5% in 2021, according to data from the CDC’s 2022 National Health Interview Survey. Overall tobacco use among adults increased in 2022, driven by a rise in e-cigarette use from 4.5% to 6%.
“The increases in e-cigarette use over the past two years have been driven by the 18- to 24-year-old age group and 65.5% of e-cigarette users in this age group did not smoke cigarettes previously in 2022,” the report says. “The increase in adult tobacco use in 2022 is a worrying sign, and an indication that state and federal lawmakers must redouble their efforts to prevent and reduce tobacco use in 2024.”

In the report’s evaluation of state-by-state tobacco control policies, Alabama and Georgia were rated the worst in the nation, scoring grades of F in all five categories: tobacco prevention and control funding, tobacco tax policies, state smoking restrictions for smoke-free air, access to cessation services and restrictions on flavored tobacco products.
The low grades given to many states stood out to attorney Karon.
“I was disappointed yet not surprised to see such meager activity at the state level. Under the 10th Amendment to the US Constitution, any power that is not specifically given to the federal government or withheld from the states is reserved for the states. To me, state involvement should be a bipartisan issue,” he said.
“Liberal states should want to participate in saving lives, while conservative states should want to act independently of the federal government,” he said. “That is something I would have liked to see more activity on.”
The report gave the best grades to California, which earned A grades for smoke-free air and access to cessation services; the District of Columbia, which earned A grades for tobacco tax policies, smoke-free air and restrictions on flavored tobacco products; and Massachusetts, which earned As for smoke-free air and flavored tobacco product restrictions.
California and Massachusetts are the only states with statewide bans on the sale of menthol cigarettes, according to the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. In 2020, Massachusetts became the first to ban flavored tobacco products. California’s ban went into effect at the end of 2022.
The American Lung Association has been joined by other public health groups – including the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids and the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, or ASTHO – in urging the White House to ban menthol cigarettes.

Last week, Michael Fraser, ASTHO’s chief executive officer, sent a letter to President Biden asking for the administration’s support in adopting and implementing the federal rule to prohibit the sale of menthol-flavored combustible cigarettes as soon as possible.
“The more time that passes, the more likely that more youth are going to be sort of addicted to cigarettes and creating a new generation of smokers. So we want to make sure that the momentum is really sharp right now,” said Jeffrey Ekoma, ASTHO’s senior director of government affairs.
“If [the White House is] talking about this and they’re actively talking to stakeholders, we want to make sure that they’re hearing not just the voice of the tobacco industry but also the voices of tobacco control advocates like ASTHO and others to make sure that they’re not just hearing one side of the issue,” Ekoma said.
RJ Reynolds, the manufacturer of Newport cigarettes, the most popular brand of menthol cigarettes in the US, said in a statement in December that it thinks a ban would ultimately do more harm to Black smokers than good.
“Reynolds has been clear on where it stands on banning menthol – we strongly believe there are more effective ways to deliver tobacco harm reduction than banning products. A ban on menthol cigarettes would harm, not benefit, public health,” the statement says.
ASTHO’s letter argues that although the tobacco industry and others who are against the ban claim that the rule would increase the potential for criminal charges in Black communities and create an underground market, the FDA has no authority to criminally charge consumers of banned products.

“It’s important to note that the regulations would not penalize the use or possession of these products among consumers, only companies that make or sell non-compliant products,” Columbia’s Giovenco said in his email.
“The tobacco industry and some organizations that have received tobacco industry funding have propagated a false narrative that the ban would contribute to over-policing, particularly in Black communities where menthol smoking is common. Unsurprisingly, the industry fails to acknowledge how their own targeted and exploitative marketing practices are directly responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Black Americans,” he said. “The proposed ban has the support of virtually every major public health and medical association, as well as many prominent civil rights and social justice advocacy groups, who understand the devastating health toll caused by menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars.”

DI1TZCI3UU_WFCVJXMMI1F9681,"Bloodied and cold, this Venezuelan couple is caught in the border battle between Texas and federal authorities","By Alisha Ebrahimji, Rosa Flores and Sara Weisfeldt, CNN","3 minute read Published 12:19 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/25/us/venezuelan-couple-us-border-battle/,"As the migrant crisis continues at the US-Mexico border and beyond, tensions between Texas and federal officials remain high.
Here are the latest developments:
Cold, hungry and bloodied from razor wire grazes.
This was the reality for one Venezuelan couple as they spent two days waiting to turn themselves in to immigration authorities on the US side of the Rio Grande, which is lined by sharp razor wire and shipping container border barriers.
Kevin, 25, and Vanessa, 21, left their home in Venezuela for Mexico three weeks ago, fleeing a regime they’ve protested against for years, they told CNN Wednesday. Now they’ve found themselves in the middle of the ongoing border battle between Texas and the US federal government.
CNN is sharing the couples’ first names only for safety reasons.
With only the clothes on their backs and a belt bag across their bodies, the architecture students, who spoke to CNN through thick layers of razor wire, said they only had one viable option: to cross the river through high water levels and strong currents, losing most of their belongings throughout the journey.
Related article ‘This is not over,’ Texas says after Supreme Court lets Biden administration remove razor wire at US-Mexico border
Home was no longer in Venezuela, a place where the pair said they have no rights. And home couldn’t be Mexico either, because of how dangerous it is, they said.
Their end goal, having endured the difficult conditions of the journey to the US, was to seek asylum once they arrived.
“We are dying of thirst and cold,” Kevin said.
Vanessa and Kevin hadn’t eaten since their wait for authorities began and were only able to share a single bottle of water between them, which a soldier with the Texas National Guard handed to them earlier in the day Wednesday, they said.
Under federal policy, migrants like Kevin and Vanessa would have surrendered two days ago, been taken into custody by federal authorities and transported for immigration processing. But in Eagle Pass, the zone recently taken over by Texas, migrants who jump the fence or crawl between the razor wire are arrested and charged with criminal trespassing, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety.
The razor wire lining the border is so dense, you can hardly see through it. What is visible are pieces of fabric, presumably clothing, caught in the middle of wired loop after loop stretching across the 2.5-mile line of fencing.
Despite the Supreme Court’s ruling this week allowing federal Border Patrol agents to remove the wire while the state’s legal challenge to its removal plays out, it still remains intact.
The concertina wire was installed by Texas authorities in the Eagle Pass area – recently the epicenter of the migrant crisis and near where three migrants drowned this month.
The federal government doesn’t have an immediate plan for a mass removal unless the situation changes drastically or there is an emergency, a law enforcement source familiar with operations told CNN.

However, given the high court’s ruling Monday, federal law enforcement can and will cut or remove the wire as needed to enforce immigration laws and in the case of medical emergencies, the same source said.
Federal agents were standing ready to breach the fencing to render aid to any individual in distress or if otherwise deemed “operationally necessary,” another enforcement source told CNN Tuesday.
The only way to get to the other side is up and over one of the shipping containers that run parallel to the barbed wire fence – and that’s exactly what Kevin and Vanessa did several hours after speaking with CNN, helping each other jump down onto the Shelby Park area.
Moments later, Texas National Guard members were seen contacting Texas DPS officers who then arrived and took them into custody, a CNN team observed.
The takeover at Shelby Park by Texas authorities is a separate dispute from the razor wire legal battle that is also expected to play out in the courts, the same source added.

DIP3KR6K3T_2E7PSVSUBL1QJ60,24 soldiers killed on deadliest day for Israeli forces in Gaza combat,"By Amir Tal and Richard Allen Greene, CNN","4 minute read Updated 4:16 PM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/23/middleeast/gaza-israeli-soldiers-deaths-intl-hnk/,"Twenty-four Israeli soldiers were killed during fighting in Gaza on Monday, the military said, in the deadliest day for its troops inside the battered enclave since the war with Hamas began.
Most of the soldiers – 21 – were killed in an attack in central Gaza “when a terrorist squad surprised our fighters and launched missiles and rockets,” said Daniel Hagari, spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).
That attack, which Hagari said happened several hundred meters from the eastern border, was the deadliest single incident for the IDF in Gaza since the ground invasion began on October 27. A further three Israeli soldiers - an IDF captain and two majors - were killed in a separate incident the same day, in southern Gaza.
The attack in central Gaza took place as the IDF soldiers were laying explosives to demolish “terror infrastructure and buildings,” according to Hagari.
A rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) hit one of the buildings and set off an explosion that led to its collapse.
“Most of our fighters died because of the collapse of that building,” Hagari said.
Another RPG hit a nearby IDF tank, killing the tank commander and another Israeli soldier, Hagari added.
On Monday, the Hamas-controlled health ministry in Gaza said the number of Palestinians killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since October 7 has risen to 25,295, with at least 63,000 injuries recorded.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is facing increasing political pressure on multiple fronts, said the deaths of the soldiers represented “one of the most difficult days since the outbreak of the war.”
“I mourn for our fallen heroic soldiers. I hug the families in their time of need and we all pray for the peace of our wounded,” Netanyahu said, adding that the IDF had launched an investigation into the incident.
The Israeli military’s large-scale bombing campaign in Gaza has been ongoing since the October 7 murder and kidnapping rampage by Hamas gunmen that saw some 1,200 people killed in Israel and more than 250 taken hostage. One hundred and thirty two hostages remain in Gaza. Of those, 104 are believed to still be alive.
The incidents in Gaza on Monday bring the number of Israeli soldiers killed since operations there began to 219.
The previous deadliest day for IDF soldiers in Gaza since the start of the conflict was October 31, when 16 Israeli troops died. That day also included the previous deadliest incident, which saw 11 troops killed in an armored personnel carrier.
In recent weeks, the Israeli military’s main focus has been in southern Gaza, with intense fighting around the city of Khan Younis.
The IDF said Tuesday that the city is now surrounded, while the Hamas-controlled Health Ministry says nearly 200 people have been killed in the past day.
In a statement Tuesday, the IDF said “dozens of terrorists” had been killed in the past 24 hours by IDF ground troops in coordination with the Israeli air force.
“Over the past day, IDF troops carried out an extensive operation during which they encircled Khan Younis and deepened the operation in the area. The area is a significant stronghold of Hamas’ Khan Younis Brigade,” the IDF said.
Hagari said Israeli soldiers continue to fight in Khan Younis, adding, “It’s a very complicated area – very crowded, with a lot of people living there.” One hundred Hamas fighters have been killed in the Khan Younis area within the last day, Hagari claimed.
A source familiar with the matter told CNN Monday that a major Israeli military offensive underway in western Khan Younis is expected to last several more days. The source said Israeli troops had encircled the Khan Younis refugee camp and were conducting raids to try and dismantle Hamas’s military capabilities in the area.
Medical facilities in the city have been battered amid an Israeli assault in the area Monday, Palestinian health officials said, as the number of people killed in Israel’s siege on Gaza continues to rise.
On Monday, the Hamas-controlled health ministry said Nasser Hospital is receiving more patients with serious injuries than it can accommodate and intensive care units have reached capacity.
This month, Israeli officials said its military will shift toward a new, less intense phase of operations in Gaza, but a humanitarian crisis in the enclave continues to deepen.
Netanyahu is facing mounting pressure both on the state of the conflict at present and on what Gaza will look like once the fighting ends.
The Israeli prime minister is being pushed by the international community – including the US, Israel’s most important ally – to allow the creation of a viable Palestinian state. Domestically, he is being pressured to guarantee Israel’s security, most notably from far-right members of his coalition.
He has also faced growing criticism inside Israel for so far failing to secure the release of all the hostages taken by Hamas during their October 7 attack.
Israel has offered a two-month ceasefire to Hamas as part of a prospective hostage deal, Axios reported Monday, citing two unnamed Israeli officials. Israeli officials are optimistic about Hamas’ response to that proposed deal, CNN foreign policy analyst Barak Ravid told CNN on Monday.

DIU8GX9MTK_782PBO4OY3A3T73,"Russia accuses Ukraine of shooting down military plane, killing all 74 on board","By Andrew Carey, Radina Gigova, Katharina Krebs, Yulia Kesaieva, Anna Chernova, Olga Voitovych and Sophie Tanno, CNN","7 minute read Updated 8:53 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/24/europe/russian-military-plane-crash-belgorod-intl/,"Russia accused Ukraine of downing a Russian military plane near the Ukrainian border Wednesday, saying all 74 people on board were killed including dozens of Ukrainian servicemen being transported for a prisoner swap.
The Ilyushin-76 cargo plane crashed inside Russian airspace, 5 to 6 kilometers (about 3 to 3.7 miles) from the village of Yablonovo in the Belgorod region. Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and its Defense Ministry called it an act of terrorism.
“The plane was destroyed by the Ukrainian Armed Forces from the area of Liptsy, Kharkiv region, using an anti-aircraft missile system,” the ministry said in a statement.
“The radar equipment of the Russian Aerospace Forces observed the launch of two Ukrainian missiles.”
Air defense systems in the Belgorod region were active shortly before the crash, according to the region’s governor Vyacheslav Gladkov.
Ukraine’s military command said it regarded Russian military aircraft approaching Belgorod as legitimate targets but stopped short of acknowledging it fired at the plane.
In a carefully worded statement, the General Staff of Ukraine’s armed forces said recent attacks on the city of Kharkiv, which lies just 18 miles (30 km) from Russia, are being facilitated by Russian cargo planes bringing weapons close to the border.
“The recorded intensity of the shelling is directly related to the increase in the number of military transport aircraft that have recently been heading to the Belgorod airfield,” the statement said.
“With this in mind, the Armed Forces of Ukraine will continue to take measures to destroy delivery means and control the airspace to eliminate the terrorist threat, including on the Belgorod-Kharkiv direction.”
Ukrainian sources earlier said the plane was carrying missiles for the S-300 air defense system. CNN cannot independently verify either side’s claims.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of “playing with the lives” of Ukrainian prisoners of war and called for an international investigation, saying “it is necessary to establish clear facts as much as possible, given that the plane crash happened on Russian territory that is beyond our control.”
Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov told reporters on Wednesday that he had requested an emergency United Nations Security Council meeting following the crash.
A video geolocated by CNN appeared to show the IL-76 plane’s final seconds before it crashes to the ground.
The video was filmed in Yablonovo, which lies about 40 kilometers (25 miles) northeast of the city of Belgorod, and begins with the plane already in a steep fall. Just before it disappears behind a passing truck and trees, what appears to be a part of the plane can be seen falling from the front of the fuselage.
Two seconds later, after the plane has disappeared from view, a huge fireball and black smoke can be seen emerging from the point of impact – which is not visible – with the ground.
The camera then pans sharply to the left to show what appears to be a small cloud of smoke. This could be an indication of a possible explosion on the plane, though the flight path of the plane cannot be established with certainty from the video.

Several eyewitness described hearing loud, thunderous claps at the time of the crash, followed by an air raid alert in the Russian city.
“We heard one or two loud bangs. With an interval of a minute or less. The second bang was much louder. We all ran out to see if someone needs help, but the crash was further away after the village. It was very loud and scary,” one woman told Russian state media RIA Novosti.
“We heard three claps. The claps were loud enough, and we thought that either something had fallen somewhere here, or that missiles had been shot down in the air. Then right after that, the guys in my class began to say that air raid alert went off in Belgorod, the sound of a siren,” said one young man.
Another man said there was a “strong vibration” in the room after the loud noises.
The pilots of the Il-76 managed to steer the plane away from the village of Yablonovo, sacrificing their lives, the rector of the local church, Priest Georgy Borovikov said.
Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov said 65 Ukrainian servicemen were on board the plane and being flown to Belgorod ahead of a prisoner swap.
“It was supposed to transport from the Moscow region to Belgorod 65 military servicemen of Ukraine. They were accompanied by three Russian officers plus the crew of six people. All of them died,” Lavrov said. “The Ukrainian side launched an air defense missile from the Kharkiv region. It targeted the aeroplane and was a fatal strike.”
CNN is not able to independently verify Russia’s claims.
A Ukrainian government agency for prisoners of war said it was investigating claims that the plane was carrying Ukrainian servicemen.
Ukraine appears to be unclear, at least publicly, on whether Ukrainian prisoners were actually on board but has suggested Moscow might have deliberately put the Ukrainian servicemen’s lives at danger.
A statement from the “Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War of Ukraine” provided no further details but did warn Russia was “actively conducting information special operations against Ukraine aimed at destabilizing Ukrainian society.”
Ukraine confirmed that a prisoner of war exchange with Russia had been due to take place on Wednesday. “It is not happening at the moment,” Andriy Yuson, from Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence, told CNN.

Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence arm said in a subsequent statement that it had fulfilled its side of that agreement, bringing captured Russian servicemen to an agreed location. However, it said Ukraine had not received details from Russia about how Ukrainian servicemen were to be brought forward to the exchange – whether they would be moved by air, rail, or road.
Crucially, it said it had not been warned against challenging the security of Belgorod’s airspace at an appointed time – something it had been warned against doing “many times in the past.” Russia has a duty to ensure the safety of prisoners of war, the statement added.
“This may indicate deliberate actions by Russia aimed at endangering the lives and safety of prisoners. Landing a transport plane in a 30-kilometer combat zone cannot be safe and in any case should be discussed by both sides, because otherwise it jeopardizes the entire exchange process.”
Six Russian crew members and three “accompanying personnel” were also on board the plane, Russian officials said. Russian Parliament’s defense committee member Andrey Kartapolov said a second military plane, also an IL-76, was carrying an additional 80 prisoners of war, which was diverted.
Kartapolov said the “Ukrainian leadership was well aware of the impending exchange and was informed of how the prisoners would be delivered. But the IL-76 plane was shot down by three missiles, either with anti-aircraft missile systems or Patriot, or with German-made IRIS.”
Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said the cause of the crash was being investigated. “A transport airplane crashed in the Korochansky district. It went down in a field near a settlement. All those on board died,” Gladkov said. “Now the crash site is cordoned off. All operational services are on site, investigative measures are being carried out,” he added.
Two Russian officials, including the Russian governor of the Tambov region, Maksim Yegorov, claimed the plane changed its course after it was hit “to avert danger to civilians” in a nearby village.
The Ilyushin Il-76 is a Soviet-era military transport aircraft with a payload of more than 50 tons, according to Europe’s air safety body, Eurocontrol. It has been in service since 1975.
The border city of Belgorod was the site of one of the deadliest Ukrainian attacks on Russian soil late last year. At least 24 people, including three children, were killed and 108 others wounded in the attacks, which sparked retaliatory Russian strikes on the Kharkiv region of Ukraine.
The plane crash comes as Russia’s war in Ukraine is set to enter its third year, with little battlefield progress made by either side in recent months. Western intelligence assessments warn that battlefield movement could further stagnate this year.
Kyiv and Moscow have exchanged prisoners of war throughout the conflict. The largest swap came earlier in January, when the two sides each exchanged over 200 prisoners.

DVYAHM61O1_5I8OGMUP0M9N348,Russia’s relentless ‘meat assaults’ are wearing down outmanned and outgunned Ukrainian forces,"By Joseph Ataman, Frederik Pleitgen and Daria Tarasova-Markina, CNN","7 minute read Updated 3:54 AM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/23/europe/ukraine-weapons-avdiivka-russian-assault-intl-cmd/,"Straddling the frontlines, the small town of Avdiivka has become the epicenter of the war in Ukraine. Still in Ukrainian hands – just – it’s enclosed on three sides by Russian troops and cannons.
Pounded by the Russians, the town itself is unrecognizable.
Concrete carcasses mark what were once the town’s tallest buildings, seemingly floating amid small hills of rubble. The cross atop the town’s church﻿, bent double by an explosion, points accusatorially at the Russian lines.
Amid the ruins, Russian and Ukrainian troops clash, preyed upon by drones and the occasional tank. Casualties are heavy on both sides but especially among the Russian attackers, who have thrown wave after human wave against the entrenched defenders.
“Meat assaults” is how one Ukrainian sniper, “Bess,” described these attacks to CNN. His callsign means demon in Ukrainian and the scene he recounts is hellish. The dead soldiers, “just lie there frozen,” the Omega Special Forces Group officer said from a house several miles behind the frontline in eastern Ukraine’s Donetsk region.
“Nobody evacuates them, nobody takes them away,” he said. “It feels like people don’t have a specific task, they just go and die.”
“Teren,” the commander of a Ukrainian drone reconnaissance unit in the town, said that even “if we can kill 40 to 70 servicemen with drones in a day, the next day they renew their forces and continue to attack.”
In 18 months of fighting around the town, he said, his pilots from the 110th Mechanized Brigade have killed at least 1,500 Russians. Still, they keep coming.
Ukrainian casualties are a closely guarded secret, but the battle has turned into an attritional slog, matching seemingly chaotic Russian attacks against the limited, but determined, resources and manpower of the Ukrainians.
In a surprise trip to Avdiivka in late December, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky described the battle for the town as an “onslaught,” adding that the battle could in many ways “determine the overall course of the war.”
Ukraine’s leaders appear conscious of the criticisms around the defense - but subsequent fall - of Bakhmut in 2023, acknowledging the obvious tensions between holding on to locations without huge strategic significance and protecting the lives of soldiers.
“Every piece of our land is precious to us,” army chief Valery Zaluzhny said, but in Avdiivka, “there is no need to do anything remotely reminiscent of a show.”
But those lives depend on weapons and arms.
On an ice-bitten January morning, the mercury idling at -22 degrees Celsius (-7.6 Fahrenheit), CNN watched another team of Omega special forces troops race to their firing position around Avdiivka.
Rushing to set up their Soviet﻿-era rocket launcher – bolted on to the back of an American pick-up - one of the men flicked the switch to launch a salvo.
Clicks – and curses – followed. Frozen solid, the rockets wouldn’t fire.
Reliant on the kit they have, not the Western hardware they crave, they know that each lost chance to fire back at Russians may cost Ukrainian lives.
A few days later, a supply truck chewed through the mud of a field around the nearby town of Marinka, bringing much-needed shells to a gun position.
But the cannon – a US-supplied M777 howitzer – is silent for much of the day, rationed to around 20 shells a day, 30 on a “good day” the gunners said. Last summer, supporting Ukraine’s failed counteroffensive, the gun crew would fire at least twice as many foreign rounds, many American-made, at the Russians, they said.
And in an artillery position 90 minutes north of Avdiivka, around the town of Bakhmut, that CNN visited, the ammunition compartment of a US-supplied Paladin howitzer sat cavernously empty. The crew had no shells to fire at all.
A delivery later in the day brought four shells but nothing that would do the Russians much harm: they were only smoke shells.
“Every shell that is suitable for the Paladin we use,” the gun commander “Skyba” told CNN, “It’s better than no shells.”
“10 to 1” is the difference between Russian and Ukrainian artillery supplies, the artillery commander in Ukraine’s 93rd mechanized Brigade told CNN.
“They use old Soviet systems,” Korsar said, “but Soviet systems can still kill.”
However, US support to Ukraine – including much-needed shells - no longer seems assured. Future aid packages are still mired in Capitol Hill squabbling, and the specter of a possible Ukraine-aid-averse Trump presidency on the horizon adds further uncertainty.
US National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby put it plainly this month: “The assistance that we provided has now ground to a halt. The attacks that the Russians are conducting are only increasing.”
But when they can put their Western weapons to use, the Ukrainians have much more to celebrate in Avdiivka.
The tip of the spear during last year’s ill-fated Ukrainian counteroffensive, the Bradley Fighting Vehicle - gifted to Ukraine by the US and designed to support infantry - is reinforcing its reputation blunting waves of Russian attacks.
Without the Bradley, “I doubt that we would be here talking with you,” crew commander “Barbie” told CNN from behind the Avdiivka frontline.
“The vehicle is a tough one,” he said. “It’s not afraid of anything.”
In video provided to CNN by another Bradley unit in the 47th mechanized brigade, a US-trained crew take on a Russian T-90 tank – one of the most powerful in Moscow’s army. Their fire disables the tank, its turret spinning uncontrollably, before an exploding drone slams into its side.
But the US-made Bradleys are in limited supply along the front.
Some 200 Bradleys were promised by the US and dozens have been damaged and destroyed in battle. Some of these will likely have been repaired and sent back to the frontlines.
Ukrainian crews, although admirers of the Bradley’s power, have also criticized its ability to weather the harsh Ukrainian winter and the state of some of the older vehicles shipped by the US.

Ukraine’s lack of firepower compared to its adversary is a common theme on the front line. “Teren” the commander of a nearby drone reconnaissance unit, said outright that Ukraine doesn’t have enough arms and equipment to win against Russia.
The Ukrainians are forced to be better pilots and more inventive with their limited resources, he said.
“At the beginning of the war, their advantage in drones was 10 times greater than ours,” he said. “At the moment, I think we are a worthy opponent in the drone format. We cover the sky around the clock.”
Observing their hunt for Russian troops from the unit’s command post, CNN saw multiple drones from his unit circling one Russian foxhole.
The powerful cameras on one drone caught two Russian soldiers desperately take aim at a weaving suicide drone, the smoke from their rifles and cigarettes billowing into the cold air. The Ukrainian drone dives into the narrow dugout behind them and explodes.
CNN does not know the fate of the men, but drone pilots in the area told CNN that they were unlikely to have survived given the number of drone units operating in the area.
Still, the Russian assaults continue, meaning holding Avdiivka is now a matter of numbers, said “Bess,” the special forces sniper.
“If there is a liter bottle, there’s no way you can fit a liter and a half in it,” he said.
To balance Russia’s superior numbers, Ukraine’s leadership – under pressure from the country’s top generals - is weighing a possible half a million extra troops to bolster the military’s ranks.
Life in Ukrainian cities away from the front appears relatively untouched by the fighting, at least on the surface. Although recruitment posters and military checkpoints dot highways and men in uniform are a regular sight, there’s little overt sign of wartime restrictions or changes to daily life. Supermarkets are full and cafes brim with customers.

But conscription is a touchy subject.
The Ukrainian president does have the power to enforce further mobilization – currently limited to those aged over 27 – but has chosen to seek parliamentary approval for it. The bill is slowly – and not without difficulty - making its way through lawmakers﻿’ scrutiny.
Zelensky has also questioned how to pay for the mobilization, with six taxpayers required to pay for the salary of each soldier in uniform, he said.
His reticence is a sign of the political sensitivities around public opinion in Ukraine, even as the country’s enemies make no secret of their violent ambitions for Kyiv.
“The existence of Ukraine is deadly for Ukrainians,” Russia’s former President Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council and one of the most hawkish Russian politicians, posted on Telegram on January 17.
“Why? The existence of an independent state on the historical Russian territories will now be a constant pretext for the resumption of combat actions,” he continued.
Back on the front line, morale among the troops with whom CNN spoke was high.
The soldiers, tired though rarely disgruntled, acknowledged that reinforcements would provide a welcome increase in their rotations off the front line.
For now, though, that remains a distant hope, as in Avdiivka the fight rages on.
“We are doing everything possible and impossible to hold this line,” Omega Special Forces officer “Sayer” told CNN.
“I don’t know what will happen next,” he said. “But Avdiivka is holding on. We are on our land. We have nothing to lose.”"

In an interview with Spanish newspaper El País, the “Griselda” star revealed that she and Manganiello disagreed about having children, according to People magazine.
“My marriage broke up because my husband was younger; he wanted to have kids and I didn’t want to be an old mom,” Vergara reportedly said. “I feel it’s not fair to the baby. I respect whoever does it, but that’s not for me anymore.”
Vergara, 51, is the mother of an adult son Manolo, whom she shares with her ex-husband. Manganiello is 47.
Vergara said she’s ready to move on to the next stage of her life.
“I had a son at 19, who is now 32, and I’m ready to be a grandmother, not a mother, she said. “So, if love comes along, he has to come with [his own] children.”
CNN has reached out to representatives for Vergara and Manganiello for comment.
Vergara will next be seen as the title character on “Griselda” about the female drug lord Griselda Blanco. It starts streaming on Netflix Thursday."
DYKE995QUS_W1F75H4XF1TFGP7,The hurricane cone graphic is changing this year. Here’s why experts say it’s needed,"By Allison Chinchar, CNN","3 minute read Published 9:52 AM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/25/weather/hurricane-cone-change-risk-perception-climate/,"The iconic cone graphic used by the National Hurricane Center to depict the potential path of tropical systems will undergo a noticeable change for the upcoming hurricane season.
The cone will be deemphasized over land in the continental US, with more emphasis being placed on expected impacts by showing tropical storm and hurricane watches and warnings instead. This means you’ll see active tropical alerts instead of a cone where applicable over land.
Watches and warnings used to only be shown alongside the cone “in a line along the coastline of the affected area,” NHC director Michael Brennan told CNN. Now, the alerts are taking “precedence over the cone,” and “will be predominant on the graphic,” NHC spokesperson Maria Torres told CNN.
The hurricane cone is changing this upcoming hurricane season! Instead of a track forecast, the forecast will now include hazards. What you can expect where you live. This change was unveiled at #OSSTahoe. @EdgewoodTahoe Here is the info:https://t.co/LsZVZY5DaP pic.twitter.com/evMEvuyvmj
The changes aim to address shortcomings in how people perceive a storm’s threats based on the boundaries of the track forecast cone, which only depicts the potential track of the center of a storm and not the storm’s hazards.
A recent study found people perceive areas highlighted within the cone as “at risk” and areas that are outside of it as being “safe.” Researchers refer to this perceived notion as the “containment effect.”
A storm’s winds can be expansive and stretch well beyond the cone.
“This is most critical for strong hurricanes that can carry tropical storm and hurricane force winds well inland, but it will improve the risk communication for wind hazards for all tropical cyclones,” Brennan said.
Tropical storm and hurricane watches and warnings are used to indicate the impending risk of winds of tropical storm force (39 to 73 mph) or hurricane force (74 mph-plus) in a given area, independent of the cone.
Brennan said the decision was based in part on research that tested “alternative cone variations.”
“The inclusion of inland wind risk information on the cone graphic decreased focus on the storm track and increased focus on wind hazard information compared to the versions of the cone without inland watches and warnings,” Brennan said.
The track forecast cone is designed to show where the center of a storm could be over the next five days. Statistically speaking, the longer the forecast period, the greater the likelihood for track error. The cone is much wider five days out compared to 24 hours out to account for the increase in potential track errors.
Every storm’s forecast is different and can have more or less error, but the width of the cone represents the majority of track errors from past storms over a five year period. This means the center of a forecast storm remains within the cone on average 60% to 70% of the time, according to the hurricane center.
But given that the effects of tropical storms and hurricanes often extend much farther than this defined boundary, it can be confusing for the public which may be trying to make critical decisions about preparations or even evacuations.
Two different hurricane forecast examples from the past highlight the difficulty in forecasting and the risks of paying too much attention to the traditional cone.
The forecast track for Hurricane Elsa in 2021 five days before landfall in Florida was almost an exact match of where the storm actually tracked. The consistency made it much easier for people to prepare.
But in the case of Hurricane Marco in 2020, the center of the storm tracked outside of the cone originally issued five days before its approach to the Gulf Coast.
You may not have been ready for Marco if you based your hurricane preparedness plans solely off of its cone.
The cone graphic change will be experimental for the 2024 hurricane season in both the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific basins. Brennan said that feedback during this phase will be used to determine whether this change will be permanent or if any other changes are needed in the future."
E1DYZ7JQ7Q_AFO11NOOQ4YUF2K,CBS newsman Charles Osgood dies at 91,"By Andy Rose and Christina Zdanowicz, CNN","3 minute read Updated 12:38 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/23/us/charles-osgood-death/,"Former CBS journalist Charles Osgood, an award-winning newsman known for his work on radio and television, died Tuesday at his home in New Jersey, CBS News reported. He was 91.
Osgood was the anchor of the network’s venerable “CBS Sunday Morning” program from 1994 to 2016, succeeding original host Charles Kuralt. For decades, he also hosted a daily news commentary series for CBS News Radio called “The Osgood File.”
Osgood said he never liked to think of TV being just for the ratings – it was sharing in something that people love.
“I think that ‘CBS Sunday Morning’ has been successful because the people who watch it don’t tune in to see how much you can shock them or distress them, but they tune in to see what – you know, what would be fascinating, interesting and possibly even inspiring, and that’s what we try to do,” Osgood told CNN in a previous interview.
In his nearly 50-year run at CBS – 22 years on “CBS Sunday Morning” alone – Osgood cemented his legacy by carrying on the tradition of oral storytelling and his predecessor, Kuralt, called him “one of the last great broadcast writers.” Osgood’s published books and poems, his gift for playing music and his signature bowties conjure memories beyond his days in the news business.
The show was the highest-rated Sunday morning news program on TV when Osgood stepped down, with its growth being a marvel when many other shows were shrinking.
While his time on TV brought him great fame, Osgood maintained that he considered himself a radio man. His famous sign-off line was proof of that: “As for me, I will see you on the radio.”
“I never considered myself a television guy who happened to do radio. I was a radio guy who happened to do a television show,” Osgood said.
Osgood took his love of poetry and sometimes delivered the “The Osgood File” in rhyming verse. His unique style earned him the title of poet in residence at CBS News.
“I never took a broadcasting course or a journalism course when I went to school,” Osgood once said. “At Fordham, I majored in economics, so in a way, I sort of learned on the job, and since I don’t know how to do it right I just do it in whatever way I can think of.”
His creative style of storytelling earned Osgood accolades, including five Emmy Awards, one for lifetime achievement in 2017, the George Foster Peabody Award and many more.
Beyond being a man on the air, Osgood had another major passion: music. Osgood, who would sometimes play piano on the show, owned three Steinway pianos, he told audiences on his final “CBS Sunday Morning.”
And he even had a top 40 hit in 1967, “Gallant Men.” It reached No. 29, one spot above “Wild Thing.”
In addition to the piano, Osgood could play the organ, banjo and violin. He also found success as a composer and a lyricist.
He shared the stage, whether at CBS or elsewhere, with The New York Pops, The Boston Pops and The Mormon Tabernacle Choir, according to CBS.

A jury also found Marcus Anthony Eriz, 26, guilty of shooting into an occupied vehicle and discharging a firearm causing great bodily injury and death in the killing of Aiden Leos.
Aiden was sitting in a booster seat in the back seat of his mother’s car as she drove him to school when he was shot on the morning of May 21, 2021, CNN previously reported. The kindergartener died at a hospital.
Eriz and his girlfriend, Wynne Lee, 26, were arrested weeks later.
Video from the courtroom showed Eriz did not react to the verdict on Thursday after it was read.
Randall S. Bethune, Eriz’s attorney, had no comment.
The boy’s mother testified that she flipped Lee and Eriz off after Lee cut her off while traveling on a freeway, the Orange County District Attorney’s Office said in a news release.
“After driving away, she said she heard a large noise and heard her son say, ‘ow,’ before pulling over (to) the side of the freeway and pulling Aiden out of his car seat and calling 911,” the release said.
“Six-year-old boys should be playing outside in the sunshine, soaking in all the magic and wonder that is boyhood, not lying dead in a tiny, child-size coffin because a man he never met decided to execute him for no conceivable reason,” District Attorney Todd Spitzer said in a social media post Thursday.

“While we will never know what Aiden would have become, we know that the pursuit of justice did not end until his killer was captured and this child murderer was prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”
Eriz faces 40 years to life in state prison when he is scheduled to be sentenced on April 12, the district attorney’s office said.
Lee, who was driving when the shooting happened, was charged with one felony count of accessory after the fact and one misdemeanor count of having a concealed firearm in a vehicle, according to the district attorney’s office. She has pleaded not guilty, CNN previously reported.
Lee is awaiting trial and is out of custody on GPS monitoring after posting a $100,000 bond in July 2021. She faces three years in state prison and one year in an Orange County jail if convicted on all charges."
E2NQ2031JM_3JT16ZSWF0C2A5J,China’s largest oil supplier in 2023 was Russia,"By Laura He, CNN","3 minute read Published 2:25 AM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20231223,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/22/business/china-top-oil-supplier-2023-russia-intl-hnk/,"Russia surpassed Saudi Arabia to become China’s largest oil supplier in 2023, according to the latest Chinese customs data.
The world’s largest crude buyer imported a record amount of bargain-priced Russian oil last year, taking advantage of Moscow’s desperate search for new buyers amid Western sanctions following the Kremlin’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
The volume of Russian crude shipped to China jumped 24% in 2023 to 107.02 million metric tons, compared to 2022, according to data released by China’s General Administration of Customs on Saturday.
That helped Russia overtake Saudi Arabia as China’s largest crude oil supplier for the year. The Middle Eastern country shipped 85.96 million metric tons of crude oil to China in 2023, down 2% from 2022.
Russia now accounts for 19% of China’s oil imports, while Saudi Arabia makes up 15%.
Russia became China’s largest oil supplier eight years ago, but it fell behind Saudi Arabia between 2019 and 2021, when the Gulf nation boosted its energy trade with Beijing.
However, since 2022, China has amplified its purchase of cheaper Russian oil after the West hit Moscow with unprecedented sanctions. China’s imports of Russian crude increased 8% in 2022 to 86.24 million metric tons, compared to 2021. Its neighbor India also ramped up its purchases sharply.
“China would necessarily maximize intake of discounted crude,” said Vandana Hari, founder of Vanda Insights based in Singapore. “Russian barrels were way cheaper than comparable grades through 2023, being limited to the Chinese and Indian markets, more or less.”
China’s total spending on Russian crude reached $60.64 billion last year. That translates to an average import price of $566.64 per metric ton, according to CNN’s calculation. This was about 10% cheaper than the average price it paid for Saudi crude, which was $626.86 per metric ton.
Russia’s oil discounts have helped China reduce its energy bills. Despite an 11% increase in its overall volume of crude imports, including from Saudi Arabia and Iraq, its total spending on oil purchases actually dropped 7.7% in 2023 to $337.5 billion compared to 2022, customs data showed.
According to Hari, Saudi’s production cut also helped Russia to leapfrog. The Gulf nation implemented an additional voluntary output cut of 1 million barrels per day from July through December last year. Though Russia also volunteered additional output and export cuts, they were about half of the Saudi reduction, she added.
Despite the war, Beijing and Moscow have developed closer ties in areas other than energy over the last two years.
Overall trade between China and Russia hit a fresh record high of $240 billion in 2023, up 26% from the previous year. That means the two countries have achieved a goal set in 2019 about a year ahead of schedule.
In the two years since the invasion, hundreds of global brands have fled Russia. That’s forced Russians to find alternatives for everything from smartphones to cars, with Chinese firms often benefiting.
Last month, Chinese leader Xi Jinping hailed Beijing’s partnership with Moscow in a meeting with Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin.
The trade figures showed a “strong resilience and broad prospects,” Xi said during the meeting in Beijing, according to Chinese state news agency Xinhua.
The two sides should “give full play to the advantages of political mutual trust,” and “deepen cooperation on economy, trade, energy and connectivity,” Xi added.

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free, here.
Office work has become a far less rigid affair in the era of remote collaboration and hybrid schedules. (Just ask me, I’m writing this in bed while wearing a hoodie and yoga pants on a Monday afternoon.)
But a lot of companies haven’t updated their scripts when it comes to delivering hard news to their employees.
Corporate-speak — that banal, jargon-heavy workplace lingo — is one of those dehumanizing habits from the Before Times that has proven hard to break.
And in the era of TikTok (and shameless oversharing online generally), that’s increasingly proving to be a liability.
ICYMI: Two weeks ago, a Cloudflare employee filmed herself getting fired over a web meeting in an interaction that company’s CEO later called “painful” to watch, partly because of the lack of humanity in the way HR reps delivered the news
And this week, the CEO of clothing company Kyte Baby offered up two public apologies — the first for denying an employee’s request to work remotely while that employee’s newborn was in intensive care, and a second for how detached and scripted the first apology sounded.
In both situations, the corporate comms strategy, or lack thereof, made an already difficult, emotional situation even worse. The companies stuck to their rigid rules about remote work and performance metrics. And in both cases, the fired employees funneled their anger toward a social media audience that would have their backs.
“I am forever amazed at the tendency of corporate America to want to strip the humanity out of their communications, whether it be an apology or any other public statement,” crisis PR expert James Haggerty told my colleague Eva Rothenberg.
“It could be that the lawyers get too involved, and have final say too often. More likely, though, it’s that everyone in the corporate environment is just so used to falling back on corporate-speak, banal cliches, legalese and muddied equivocation. What works in a corporate board meeting doesn’t often fly with the public … and it sure doesn’t work on social media.”
Kyte Baby’s CEO and founder, Ying Liu, learned that the hard way this week.
In her first apology, Liu is on message — clearly reading from a prepared statement — succinct and stiff. It is the kind of button-down speech that might not have raised eyebrows if delivered in a board room.
Related article Kyte Baby under scrutiny for denying mom’s remote work request while newborn was in NICU, CEO walks back ‘terrible decision’
But on TikTok, outrage over the employee’s situation was already boiling over, and Liu’s canned delivery struck the exact wrong note, as she later acknowledged.
“The comments were right — it was scripted … I just basically read it, it wasn’t sincere,” she says in her second apology video. “I’ve decided to go off script and just tell you exactly what happened.”
In the Cloudflare layoff video, viewed more than 2 million times on TikTok alone, two HR employees can be heard telling the woman that her performance didn’t meet expectations.
The problem, Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince wrote on X, was that the two HR reps had never met the woman they were letting go, and couldn’t provide any specifics when she pressed them for information. The laid-off employee noted that she had just been hired in August and had been told she was an excellent employee.
“Clearly we were far from perfect … HR should be involved, but it shouldn’t be outsourced to them,” Prince wrote. “No employee should ever actually be surprised they weren’t performing.”
Whether the Cloudflare episode is something we should model is debatable (and the people on the internet are certainly debating). But either way, the episode underscores a relatively new tool workers have to wield power and rally support when they feel mistreated.
Once upon a time, a bungled speech or messy layoff might have sparked some grumbling, but would rarely be caught on video or rabidly shared and commented upon by millions of people outside the company. But any half decent comms director in the digital age should expect that there’s a potential for anything a leader says to become a viral moment.
“There’s never been a good layoff, right?” one media comms director told me. “But speaking to your colleagues as humans is always best. And that’s in plain language, getting to the point, avoiding euphemisms and corporate-speak as much as possible.”"
EDOKOQKJNR_3NEKQGUEUDMQ808,Former Trump adviser Peter Navarro sentenced to 4 months in jail for defying congressional subpoena,"By Devan Cole and Holmes Lybrand, CNN","4 minute read Updated 11:33 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/25/politics/peter-navarro-contempt-congress-sentence/,"Peter Navarro was sentenced Thursday to four months in jail for contempt of Congress after defying a subpoena related to the congressional investigation into the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack.
Navarro was convicted on two counts of contempt of Congress in September for not complying with a subpoena from the House select committee that investigated the attack.
The judge overseeing Navarro’s case said Thursday that the former Trump adviser’s sentence is of his “own making” as he tore into Navarro for claiming that his prosecution was politically motivated.
“I guess what bothers me ultimately is that here we are after a year and a half plus and you still want to suggest to me that this is a political prosecution. You want me to believe this is a political prosecution,” US District Judge Amit Mehta said during the sentencing hearing, raising his voice. “When the evidence is completely to the contrary.”
“You are not a victim. You are not the object of a political prosecution,” the judge said. “These are the circumstances of your own making.”
Mehta also fined Navarro $9,500.
Navarro quickly appealed the case on Thursday to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. His attorneys have long said they plan to file an appeal to raise issues related to his claim that he didn’t comply with the subpoena because Trump had invoked executive privilege.
Each count carries a mandatory minimum sentence of one month in prison, but prosecutors had asked Mehta to sentence Navarro to six months for each count – running concurrently – and fine him $200,000.
They told the judge last week that a sentence of one month apiece for the two counts “is insufficient to account for, punish, and deter the Defendant’s criminal offenses,” arguing that Navarro’s decision to not comply with the subpoenas was akin to the conduct of some of the people who participated in the riot.
“The Defendant, like the rioters at the Capitol, put politics, not country, first, and stonewalled Congress’s investigation,” prosecutors wrote. “The Defendant chose allegiance to former President Donald Trump over the rule of law.”
Navarro’s conviction and sentence represents another key victory for the now-disbanded House January 6 committee in its efforts to have the Justice Department criminally pursue individuals who refused to cooperate with its probe.
Related article Prosecutors ask for six-month prison sentence for Peter Navarro for defying congressional subpoena
Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon was convicted in 2022 on two contempt counts and later sentenced to four months in prison. Bannon’s case is currently on appeal.
Navarro’s attorneys are seeking a sentence of no more than six months of probation for each count, and they asked Mehta last week to pause the sentence he imposes as they appeal the conviction.
Navarro’s trial last September moved quickly, with it taking less than a day for the jury to hear all the evidence in the case.
Prosecutors put just three witnesses on the stand, all former staff members of the House January 6 committee. The Justice Department used its testimony to make the case that the committee had good reason to subpoena Navarro and that he was informed repeatedly of its demands.
Prosecutor Elizabeth Aloi told the jury in closing arguments that Navarro “had knowledge about a plan to delay the activities of Congress on January 6,” and that he was “more than happy” to air that knowledge in public remarks, but not to the House committee.
Navarro’s attorneys did not put on any witnesses of their own, instead focusing on part of the contempt charge that required a showing that Navarro was willful and deliberate in his decision not to comply with the subpoena – meaning that his lack of compliance was not the result of an inadvertent mistake or accident.

Navarro has insisted that he didn’t comply with the subpoena at the direction of Trump, who he claimed invoked executive privilege in the matter. But ahead of trial, Mehta concluded that Navarro had not carried his burden in proving that Trump had formally asserted a privilege or a testimonial immunity that would have allowed his former aide to not even appear to answer the committee’s questions.
The former aide has said he plans to raise that issue and others on appeal.
“The appeal of this case will definitely answer what is required of a former President to invoke executive privilege as to their senior advisors and no future advisor will be in the same position of not knowing that the President they served had not properly invoked the privilege,” his attorneys wrote in court papers.
The federal appeals court in DC is currently considering Bannon’s bid to overturn his own contempt of Congress conviction.
During oral arguments last year, some members of a three-judge panel handling the appeal appeared skeptical of arguments advanced by Bannon’s attorney that the trial court judge who oversaw Bannon’s criminal case erred when they declined to let him assert executive privilege as part of his defense, and that the ex-adviser was simply acting on the advice of his then-attorney when he didn’t comply with the subpoena.

EGBUMRB61D_OLJK27YLFQ08ZQT,From ‘Barbie’ to ‘Bob the Builder’: All about Mattel’s next big movie (and how Jlo is involved),"By Elizabeth Wagmeister, CNN","2 minute read Updated 11:21 AM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/25/entertainment/bob-the-builder-jennifer-lopez/,"Mattel struck gold – or pink – with “Barbie,” which was the first major feature film to come from the toy company and made nearly $1.5 billion worldwide, becoming the biggest movie of 2023 and racking up eight Oscar nominations earlier this week.
Now, CNN has learned that Mattel hopes to maintain that momentum with a cinematic adaptation of another kids’ character: Bob the Builder. An animated movie based on the long-running animated children’s series is in development, with Jennifer Lopez attached to executive produce and “In the Heights” star Anthony Ramos set to voice the beloved titular cartoon contractor.
In the animated movie, Roberto “Bob” travels to Puerto Rico for a major construction job, takes on issues affecting the island and digs deeper into what it means to build, according to a press release from Mattel. This new take on “Bob the Builder” will “celebrate the vibrant and colorful textures of the Caribbean Latin nations and their people.”
Aside from voicing Bob the Builder, Ramos will also serve as a producer. In a statement, Ramos said that the movie will focus on friends working together and how love can help conquer any obstacle.
“For years, Bob the Builder’s characters have inspired young people around the world,” the actor said, noting that he will bring “elements of life that are inspired by my own” into the film.
Lopez will produce through her production company, Nuyorican Productions, along with her producing partners Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas and Benny Medina.
The “Bob the Builder” television series ran in worldwide syndication for over a decade in the early aughts, and is known for its popular catchphrase, “Can we fix it? Yes, we can!”
“Bob the Builder” is the first animated theatrical movie to come from Mattel, but following the huge success of “Barbie,” the company has plans to bring more toys to the big screen, with films based on everything from American Girl dolls and Magic 8 Ball to “Masters of the Universe” and the card game UNO in the works, according to their release.
A Mattel source also says the  company is developing a “Hot Wheels” movie with J.J. Abrams, “Rock ‘Em Sock ‘Em” with Vin Diesel, “Barney” with Daniel Kaluuya, “Polly Pocket” from Lena Dunham with star Lily Collins and “Major Matt Mason” starring Tom Hanks."

Nearby, toddlers make toys out of garbage, pressing their bare feet into the wet sand.
Torrential rain in Gaza is making an already brutal existence even harder for the tens of thousands of people displaced and camping in the open air.
CNN video from Deir Al-Balah in central Gaza, shows dozens of people searching for their belongings after torrential rain washed away mattresses, food and clothes overnight Wednesday.
“Today, our tents were drowned,” Jamal Ramadan told CNN. “All the nylon flew away. We slept under the rain. Everyone drowned. The children were in the water. Our food and drinks are all gone.”
Israel’s bombardment and besiegement of Gaza has obliterated huge parts of the strip, crushed the medical system and triggered a humanitarian crisis marked by food, fuel and water shortages. More than 2.2 million Palestinians face widespread hunger, dehydration and deadly disease.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) launched its offensive aiming to eliminate Hamas, after more than 1,200 people were killed and another 250 abducted in the militant group’s October 7 attacks on southern Israel.
At least 1.7 million people in Gaza have since been internally displaced, many multiple times, according to the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
Israeli attacks on Gaza since October 7 have killed at least 25,700 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health. CNN cannot independently verify the figures due to the difficulty of reporting from the war zone.

In the past week, the IDF has pressed its campaign further into central and southern Gaza, forcing hundreds and thousands of people into tiny patches of territory without basic sanitation or drinkable water.
With winter winds and heavy rainfall lashing the Palestinian enclave, parents in Deir Al-Balah told CNN they cannot sleep because they are trying to comfort their children.
“We were all asleep, and at midnight, we woke up when all those tents were drowned in water. We started carrying our children,” said Ahmad Al Rebai.
Another civilian, Um Muhammad, said she and others no longer have clothes for their children. “We pulled our children from the water. No one cares about us.”
Gaza sits in the Mediterranean Basin, which is highly vulnerable to climate change. While the region is experiencing less rainfall annually — making it susceptible to drought — some parts are also seeing more frequent and intense extreme rain events that are expected to worsen the more the Earth warms, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
January is traditionally the rainiest month in southern Israel and Gaza, generally seeing around 100 mm of rainfall on average. Totals this week could approach these monthly averages in some locations. A temperature drop of 5-8 degrees Celsius will be felt over the next few days as the weather system moves through the region, which will make for unseasonably cold conditions, according to the Israel Meteorological Service.
“All we say is enough with all this. We want to go back to our homes in Gaza. We are tired of this life,” one man said. “It has been three and a half months. Enough with this life. It’s better that we die than live like this.”
Humanitarian workers in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, meanwhile described mass bombardment, heavy tank fire and air raid alerts in recent days, as Israel intensified its military campaign in the city.
Raging flames engulfed the walls of a UN shelter west of Khan Younis, after the facility was shelled on Wednesday. At least 12 people were killed and another 75 injured, according to Thomas White, director of the UN’s relief agency for Palestine refugees (UNRWA).
Part of the UNRWA training center, hosting thousands of people, was hit by two shells and caught fire, added White.
UN staff managed to reach the location on Wednesday evening, after being denied access multiple times, the director said. “Persistent attacks on civilian sites in Khan Younis are utterly unacceptable and must stop immediately.”
The IDF said in a statement that it “currently” ruled out an aerial or artillery strike carried out by Israeli forces hit the UN facility. A “thorough review of the operations of the forces in the vicinity is underway,” according to the IDF, adding it is “examining the possibility that the strike was a result of Hamas fire.”
Further north, Gaza’s Civil Defense said on Thursday they dealt with “unbelievable” injuries, including loss of limbs, after an attack on civilians waiting for aid in Gaza City.
Crews were trying to reach the injured, but are being “blocked” by Israeli forces, Gaza Civil Defense Mahmoud Basal spokesperson said from the local Al Shifa Hospital, adding that there are areas they have not been able to get to.
Civilians were “targeted” by Israeli forces at the Kuwaiti roundabout in Gaza City, where they were gathered to pick up bags of flour, according to Basal.
Mohammed Al-Rifi, who sustained injuries in his arm and leg after the shelling incident by the Kuwaiti roundabout, said he and others there were “shelled four times.”
CNN asked the IDF earlier Thursday for comment on any military operations in the vicinity of the roundabout.
Earlier in the week, hospital workers reported dire conditions inside facilities including the Nasser Medical Complex, Al Amal Hospital and the Palestine Red Crescent Society headquarters, where displaced staff and patients were trying to shelter.
On Thursday, Al Amal hospital in Khan Younis was targeted for a fourth consecutive day, according to the Palestine Red Crescent Society.
The PRCS also alleged that Israeli forces imposed “a complete curfew around the hospital since yesterday afternoon, restricting the movement of ambulance crews to and from the hospital. Thousands of displaced individuals live in constant fear and anxiety due to the ongoing siege and bombardment.”
The IDF said on Wednesday they were pursuing “military targets, outposts, infrastructure and command and control centers,” in Khan Younis, adding their campaign there will continue for “several days.”
“The manoeuver will continue against military targets that are in the area, outposts, infrastructure, and command and control centers,” the IDF said.
The IDF regularly asserts that it does not target hospitals but that Hamas uses them as cover for its military operations. CNN cannot independently verify operational details reported by the IDF.
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) warned “concrete actions” are needed to preserve “life saving” medical services in war torn Gaza.
The ICRC highlighted the deficiencies in the current healthcare system in Gaza where only two referral hospitals – Nasser Medical Complex and the European Gaza Hospital – providing advanced medical services are operational.
Dr. Ashraf Al-Qidra, the spokesperson for the Hamas-run Ministry of Health in Gaza, described the situation at Nasser Hospital as “extremely catastrophic.”
“The hospital is operating at 10% of its capacity. Operating rooms have run out of anesthesia and painkillers for patients and the wounded,” Al-Qidra said in a statement to CNN.
Fears are also mounting regarding supplies, with Al-Qidra warning that food supplies have run out and there are only enough fuel reserves for five days.
The ICRC added that if the Nasser Medical Complex and the European Gaza Hospital “cease to function,” the “world will bear witness to untold thousands of preventable deaths given the size of the population, the current extreme living conditions, a collapsing health system, and the intensity of the fighting.”

“I’m disappointed that… this keeps happening at Boeing. This isn’t new,” said Scott Kirby, CEO of United, in an interview Tuesday on CNBC. “We need Boeing to succeed. But they’ve been having these consistent manufacturing challenges. They need to take action here.”
Kirby made his comments after the airline warned investors that it will report a larger-than-expected loss in the first three months of this year because of the grounding of all 737 Max 9 jets after a door plug blew off on an Alaska Air flight on January 5, leaving a massive hole in the side of the plane.
The plane landed without any serious injuries, but the Federal Aviation Administration ordered the grounding and additional inspections of the more than 200 jets of that model worldwide.
United Airlines said it now expects its fleet of Boeing Max 9 jets to remain grounded through the end of this month, and that the company will report a first quarter loss in the range of $116 million to $262 million. That’s more than the $138 million loss already forecast by analysts surveyed by Refinitiv.
United has 79 of the Max 9s, more than any other airline, and had originally scheduled nearly 8,000 flights with the plane for this month before the incident, according to Cirium, an aviation analytics firm.
Beyond the current 737 Max 9 problem is what this means for Boeing’s orders for the 737 Max 10, a newer, larger version and more expensive version of the 737 Max that has yet to be certified by the FAA. It will be at least five years in a best case scenario before Boeing can delivery those Max 10 jets to United, Kirby said, and the airline is now no longer counting on getting that plane in the future.
“I think the Max 9 grounding is probably the straw that broke the camel’s back for us,” said Kirby. “We’re going to build a plan that doesn’t have the Max 10 in it.”
United has firm orders for 277 of the 737 Max 10, and options to buy an additional 200, and so if the airline were to pull out of those orders, it would be a massive blow for Boeing’s efforts to bring that plane to market.
And in a call with investors later in the day, Kirby said that the airline is not quite canceling the orders that it has for the Max 10, but it doesn’t anticipate it’ll be receiving the jets, either.
“We are taking it out of our internal plans,” said Kirby. “And we’ll be working on what that means exactly with Boeing. But Boeing is not going to be able to meet their contractual deliveries on at least many of those airplanes. And let’s leave it at that.”
United has orders for more than 500 Boeing jets in total on the books, more than twice as many as it does for jets from its rival Airbus. But in the last six months, United took delivery of its first A321neo, a model that directly competes with the Boeing 737 Max.
But thanks to a deep order backlog at both companies, even if United were to drop its 737 Max 10 purchase plans, it would probably be forced to buy other 737 Max models rather than getting at the end of the line for buyers of Airbus jets.
That will constrain the company for quite some time, Kirby added.
“We’re still going to be the fastest growing airline,” Kirby said. “But we’re not going to be as fast growing as we planned.”
Boeing would not comment directly on United’s comments on its orders, other than to once again apologize for the problems that led to the incident at Alaska Air and the subsequent 737 Max 9 grounding.
“We have let down our airline customers and are deeply sorry for the significant disruption to them, their employees and their passengers,” said Stan Deal, head of Boeing’s commercial aircraft unit, in a statement released by the company. “We are taking action on a comprehensive plan to bring these airplanes safely back to service and to improve our quality and delivery performance. We will follow the lead of the FAA and support our customers every step of the way.”

Boeing has had a series of quality issues that have dogged the aircraft maker for the last five years, ever since two fatal crashes of the 737 Max 8 in late 2018 and early 2019 led to a 20-month grounding of the jet.
United believes it is getting close to the completion of the inspections it needs to get approval to fly the 737 Max 9 once again, Kirby said.
“I have a lot of confidence in the safety of these airplanes, particularly since we know what happened with this Max 9,” he said. “I think we’re near the end game of getting that [model] back flying.”
United did say it expects full year earnings of between $9 to $11 a share, a range which would include the current estimates of full-year earnings of $9.45 a share according to analysts, as well as 2023 earnings of $10.05 a share that it reported Monday.
And it reported fourth-quarter earnings of $2.00 a share, topping the $1.69 a share forecast by analysts.
The earnings beat and the full-year guidance helped to lift shares of United more than 5% in trading Tuesday."
EUFSTXY31K_Q2TKNVYT5US9GKG,Opinion: This is the difference Jon Stewart could make in the 2024 election,Opinion by Dean Obeidallah,"4 minute read Updated 8:05 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/24/opinions/jon-stewart-daily-show-return-trump-obeidallah/,"Editor’s Note: Dean Obeidallah, a former attorney, is the host of SiriusXM radio’s daily program, “The Dean Obeidallah Show.” Follow him on Threads. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.
It only took eight years, but apparently Jon Stewart has finally decided to answer the plea from my May 2016 CNN article titled, “We need Jon Stewart back now!”
At the time, my point was that we desperately needed Stewart back in “The Daily Show” host chair because he was the comedic antidote to then-candidate Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. And after Trump won that election, many — including myself — believed that if only Stewart had not abdicated his late-night show in August 2015, Trump might well have been defeated.
That is why the news that Stewart is returning to “The Daily Show” in February as an executive producer and a host — even if just one day a week in that latter role — is more than the “Moment of Zen” he treated us to on his show for 16 years. It’s truly a moment of celebration.
On a serious note, I don’t actually believe my 2016 article had anything to do with Stewart returning. And no one — not even the award-winning host himself — can save us from Trump or any other societal problem facing our nation today.
I am confident, however, that Stewart’s weekly hosting will bring us much-needed laughs as he points out the absurdity of the words and actions of people in power — including Trump, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene or even President Joe Biden. Stewart — while clearly leaning left on many political issues — had no qualms about directing his comedic barbs at Democrats while hosting “The Daily Show.” And, of course, Stewart also became an insightful critic of the corporate media — much to the chagrin of some cable news outlets. (I’m especially looking at you, Fox News, but who could forget his famous comments on CNN’s Crossfire in 2004, battling with then co-host Tucker Carlson?)

But … and you knew a but was coming … Stewart’s history of effectively ridiculing and taunting Trump is what so many of us will be tuning in for. And if history is any guide, Stewart will get under Trump’s pathetically thin skin, surely causing him to lash out on social media.
That’s how it went before. Just one example came shortly before Trump announced his 2016 run, when Stewart discussed the other GOP presidential candidates. When he got to Trump, Stewart joked, “They’re all very colorful characters, but for me there can only be one F**kface von Clownstick.” Stewart then did an impression of Trump, mercilessly mocking him for saying he had a secret, “foolproof” plan to defeat ISIS.
How did Trump respond? With a series of angry tweets calling Stewart “a wiseguy with no talent,” “the most overrated joke on television” who delivered “dumb clown humor” and more. For a comedian, having a person like Trump respond angrily on social media to your jokes is better than a standing ovation.
Now, however, there’s an added concern that Stewart didn’t have to deal with back in 2015 when he was last hosting “The Daily Show.” If Trump were to win in 2024, he may go beyond simply slamming Stewart on social media and employ the apparatus of government to silence him.
As a reminder, in 2019 as president, Trump threatened “Saturday Night Live” for parodying him by publicly demanding the Federal Communications Commission investigate the iconic comedy show. Trump even bemoaned that there was no form of “retribution” against the show for ridiculing him.

Given Trump has made “retribution” a central theme of his 2024 campaign, even vowing to be a dictator if he wins — but only for “one day” — Stewart has potentially more to lose. But as we’ve seen with his activism, Stewart has not backed down before to a fight with people in power. For example, in 2019 he confronted members of Congress to their faces, slamming them for not helping 9/11 first responders. And in 2022, he again took members of Congress to task for not passing legislation to help veterans who contracted illnesses after being exposed to burn pits during their active service. In both cases, Stewart’s work helped pass the legislation at issue.
As I wrote in 2016 when pleading with Stewart to return to the airwaves, “In what will likely be a truly ugly and stress inducing general election contest,” Stewart would offer “us a much needed comedic cathartic release.” Those words are even more true today given that Trump — or as Stewart called him, “F**kface von Clownstick” — is the likely 2024 GOP presidential nominee. Given what is coming between now and November, we have all earned Stewart back, and at least a few Moments of Zen!"

By running ads for “free” tax services that many customers were not qualified for, the tax filing software violated the FTC Act and deceived consumers, the agency said.
The FTC had first sued Intuit, TurboTax’s owner, for its deceptive advertising in 2022. The FTC staff alleged most tax filers couldn’t use the company’s “free” services — “such as those who get a 1099 form for work in the gig economy, or those who earn farm income.” TurboTax advertising their products as free misled those customers, according to the FTC.
The FTC Administrative Law Judge D. Michael Chappell announced the initial decision in September, which the commission upheld Monday. Intuit had appealed to the FTC as part of the process.
In a statement Monday, Intuit said it has appealed “this deeply flawed decision” to federal circuit court outside of the FTC.
“Absolutely no one should be surprised that FTC Commissioners — employees of the FTC — ruled in favor of the FTC as they have done in every appeal for the last two decades. This decision is the result of a biased and broken system where the Commission serves as accuser, judge, jury, and then appellate judge all in the same case,” an an Intuit spokesperson said.
Intuit cannot advertise or market any goods or services as free unless it’s free for all customers, the FTC ordered.
It could also clearly disclose the percentage of customers that actually do qualify for the free service, somewhere close to the “free” claim advertised, the commission said. The FTC added if the service isn’t actually free for the majority of consumers, TurboTax could state that as well.
The FTC ordered Intuit to “disclose clearly and conspicuously all the terms, conditions, and obligations that are required in order to obtain the ‘free’ good or service.”
“The order also prohibits Intuit from misrepresenting any material facts about its products or services such as the price, refund policies or consumers’ ability to claim a tax credit or deduction or to file their taxes online accurately without using TurboTax’s paid service,” the release from the FTC said.
Last May, roughly 4.4 million people were to receive checks from TurboTax, following a 50-state settlement with parent company Intuit for allegedly steering millions of low-income Americans away from free tax-filing services.
The investigation opened after a 2019 ProPublica report that accused the company of steering eligible clients away from federally supported tax filing products by making them difficult to find in web searches — instead directing them toward the paid version of the company’s filing services.
Most customers will get about $30, with some customers that used TurboTax for three consecutive years getting up to $85. A website has also been set up for more information.
“TurboTax’s predatory and deceptive marketing cheated millions of low-income Americans who were trying to fulfill their legal duties to file their taxes,” said New York Attorney General Letitia James in a May 4, 2023, press release. “Today we are righting that wrong and putting money back into the pockets of hardworking taxpayers who should have never paid to file their taxes.”

EYYXACZQ70_ES1223I0B9U3PXO,Thai court dismisses media shares case against popular progressive politician - but party’s future still in doubt,"By Helen Regan and Wasu Vipoosanapat, CNN","5 minute read Updated 10:15 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/24/asia/thailand-pita-limjaroenrat-media-shares-verdict-intl-hnk/,"A Thai political leader who led his party to a stunning electoral victory on a campaign that threatened to shake up the country’s powerful conservative establishment has escaped being disqualified from politics but his — and his party’s — political future remains in question.
Thailand’s Constitutional Court on Wednesday dismissed a case against Pita Limjaroenrat, 43, that alleged he violated election rules by running for office while holding shares in a media company – the long-defunct broadcaster iTV.
Thai law bans members of parliament from owning or holding shares in media companies.
Eight of the nine-member panel of judges ruled in favor of Pita, saying that since iTV had not operated since 2007 — before he applied for the party-list candidacy — he had not violated the constitution.
The ruling is one of two highly-anticipated verdicts against Pita and the progressive Move Forward Party that could ultimately see Thailand’s most successful party at the last election dissolved, and bans and criminal charges levied at its leaders.
Following Wednesday’s verdict, Pita told reporters outside court that he will continue to work for the people and that he would like to get back to his duties in parliament “as soon as possible.”
“Whenever I’m allowed in, I’ll be there,” he said.
Supporters who had gathered outside the court began chanting “PM Pita,” referring to his bid to become prime minister, and said justice had been done. Some held placards reading, “We will always support the party” while others mocked the Election Commission that brought the case to court.
Supravee Sansuk, 63, from Bangkok said the outcome has restored her faith in the Thai justice system.
“I was worried about the verdict that it would turn the other way. So I was overwhelmed to receive the good news. Because Pita was not guilty since the beginning and this case shouldn’t have been forwarded to the court,” she told CNN.
Lee Saetung, 69, said he traveled three hours from his hometown of Rayong to attend the verdict.
“I am growing older, I need the country to move forward and we need young people to cultivate the future of my grandchildren. So when the verdict was released, I was very much relieved to see a future ahead for my descendants,” he said.
Besides being defunct for nearly two decades, iTV did not have a media license nor a frequency band to broadcast, and had no income, Pita said in a Facebook post last year.
Pita said he inherited shares owned by his late father but they held “no economic value” and the company was delisted from the Thai Stock Exchange in 2014. The shares were later transferred, he said.
The former prime ministerial hopeful was suspended from his duties as a lawmaker and member of Thailand’s parliament in July while the case was being investigated.
Speaking to CNN in May, Pita said “there are professional and personal attacks against me” but that he has prepared and has “a strong legal basis for anything that comes my way.”
His Move Forward party gained a huge following among young Thais during the 2023 general election for its reformist platform, which included deep structural reforms to how Thailand is run, including to the military and radical plans to amend the country’s strict lese majeste laws despite the taboo surrounding any discussion of the royal family in Thailand.
Move Forward won the most seats and the largest share of the popular vote in the May election.
The result was a decisive victory for progressive parties and delivered a crushing blow to the conservative, military-backed establishment that has ruled on and off for decades, often by turfing out popularly elected governments in coups.
Related article Thailand has a new leader but it’s not the one most people voted for. Here’s why
The party was prevented from forming a government, however, as it failed to win support from a big enough majority of parliamentarians over its royal reform agenda and Pita resigned as leader of the party, which is now in opposition.
Move Forward and its former leader Pita remain popular, especially among younger Thais who have hit the streets in huge numbers in recent years calling for political and royal reform.
A January opinion poll by the National Institute of Development Administration showed Pita as being Thailand’s most popular politician for 39% of respondents, with Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin at 22%, Reuters reported.
But its fate hangs in the balance until the Constitutional Court delivers another ruling on January 31 over whether Pita and the party sought to overthrow the monarchy through his election campaign to amend the kingdom’s notoriously strict lese majeste law.
Munin Pongsapan, associate professor at Thammasat University’s Faculty of Law, said Wednesday was “a good day for Thailand’s justice system” and the ruling “was a good sign for the next case.”
“If the court follows this standard in deciding the next case, there will be an even higher chance for the Move Forward Party to survive as the accusations against it are really groundless,” he said.
Thailand’s turbulent political history has previously seen parties that have pushed for change run afoul of the powerful conservative establishment – a nexus of the military, monarchy and influential elites.
Lawmakers have faced bans, parties have been dissolved, and governments have been overthrown. Thailand has witnessed a dozen successful coups since 1932, including two in the past 17 years.
And the purportedly independent election commission, anti-corruption commission and the Constitutional Court are all dominated by members in favor of the establishment.

In 2008, the Constitutional Court ruled that then-prime minister Samak Sundaravej violated the constitution by taking part in a cooking show on TV while in office for which he received a nominal fee, and was ordered to resign.
Three parties linked to billionaire political scion Thaksin Shinawatra – the populist former prime minister who was ousted in a coup in 2006 – have been disbanded in the last decade.
And most recently, Move Forward’s predecessor, the Future Forward Party, won the third most seats in the 2019 election. Shortly afterward, several of the party’s leaders were banned from politics and the party was later dissolved after a court ruled it had violated electoral finance rules.
The decision to dissolve the popular party ignited youth-led protests that swept across Thailand in 2020, politicizing a whole new generation of activists and political leaders – some of whom contested last year’s election with the Move Forward Party."
EZZ9IPRDUV_BP2HJTLI6LA5NHR,UK museums to loan looted gold artifacts to Ghana,"By Jack Guy, CNN","3 minute read Updated 11:22 AM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/25/style/asante-gold-ghana-loan-scli-intl/,"The United Kingdom will send back gold and silver artifacts looted from Ghana in the 19th century after a long-term loan agreement was struck.
Both the British Museum and the V&A will send items related to the Asante royal court to Ghana, where they will be displayed at the Manhyia Palace Museum in Kumasi, according to a press release from the UK museums Thursday.
Many of the items, which include 13 pieces of Asante royal regalia, were looted during the Anglo-Asante wars, while some were part of an indemnity payment that the British forcibly extracted from the Asantehene, or Asante king. Others were sold at auction, entering private collections and museums worldwide.
Items displayed at the V&A in London were selected as “exemplars of the brilliant goldsmithing techniques practiced for centuries by the Asante royal goldsmiths” and served as inspiration for British artists and designers, reads the release.
Now they will be displayed in Ghana for the first time in 150 years, as part of an exhibition celebrating the 2024 Silver Jubilee of His Royal Majesty, the Asantehene, Osei Tutu II, as well as commemorating the Anglo-Asante war of 1873-74.
The items also include a small gold ornament in the shape of a sankuo, or lute-harp, and an ornament in the form of an eagle.
“Since the foundation of the Asante empire during the late 17th century, gold has been central to Asante identity, spirituality and economic stability,” reads the release.
“Asante kings grew powerful on local gold deposits and the palace in Kumasi became the focal point for a lucrative international gold trade,” it adds.
Gold is also used to decorate the royal throne and the Asantehene himself, as well as high-ranking court officials, according to the release.
“These ornaments carry meaning beyond their material value. They are invested with the spirits of former Asante kings and their decoration can be read by those familiar with the visual lexicon,” it continues.
Tristram Hunt, director of the V&A, said that he’s “proud” of the partnership.
“As part of our commitment to sharing collections with a colonial past, we are excited to see these items on public show, in Ghana, as part of Asantehene Otumfuo Osei Tutu II’s Silver Jubilee celebrations,” said Hunt in the release.
Lissant Bolton, keeper of Africa, Oceania and the Americas at the British Museum, hailed the partnership with the Manhyia Palace Museum.
“This relationship is of great importance to us. We are delighted to be lending these beautiful and significant cultural objects for display in Kumasi,” added Bolton.
The agreement comes amid ongoing calls for Western museums to give back stolen property – the cultural heritage of oppressed people plundered by colonial armies in the 19th century or taken unfairly by missionaries or ambassadors.
No less than 90% of African cultural property resides in European museums, according to a report commissioned by French President Emmanuel Macron, who has decided that much of it must be returned.
However, the British Museum has refused to give back to Greece the half of the Parthenon Marbles stolen by Lord Elgin, and the issue is a source of uncomfortable conversations at many other cultural institutions."

Musk made the comments during an interview at a conference hosted by the European Jewish Association near the site of the Auschwitz in Poland. It comes after Musk faced a firestorm of backlash over antisemitic content on X, including a post with an antisemitic conspiracy theory that Musk himself amplified (and later apologized for in the wake of condemnation.)
“It’s never going to be zero if you’ve got 600 million people on the platform, expecting it to be zero is pretty unlikely,” Musk said of antisemitism on X. He added that X has “the least amount of antisemitism” compared to other major platforms, although he cited no evidence for that claim beyond referencing “outside audits that we’ve had done.”

Musk in November agreed with a post on X that claimed that Jewish communities push “hatred against Whites,” calling it the “actual truth.” The antisemitic conspiracy theory that Jews want to bring undocumented minority populations into Western countries to reduce White majorities in those nations has been espoused by online hate groups. Musk’s post led to a rebuke from the White House and a major exodus of advertisers.
Musk later apologized for the post, but told advertisers who halted their spending on X over concerns about antisemitic content to “go f**k” themselves.
Musk has also repeatedly criticized the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), an organization that fights antisemitism around the world, and faced criticism for allowing pro-Nazi content to remain live on X. (Musk had earlier also threatened to sue the ADL, but later walked back that threat.)
The billionaire has also faced pressure for promoting other conspiracy theories on X, including the dangerous Pizzagate theory.
In the wake of pressure over his leadership of the platform, Musk in November visited Israel, meeting the country’s leaders and walking through a kibbutz destroyed by Hamas in its October 7 attack.
Musk on Monday again expressed his support for the Israeli people, calling himself “aspirationally Jewish,” and said that hate against Jewish people must be addressed. As part of Monday’s event, the billionaire appears to have made a visit to Auschwitz along with his young son.
But despite concerns about an uptick in antisemitic content on X, Musk also admitted that he had been somewhat “naive” about the recent surge in antisemitism across the United States that has been recorded since the start of the Israel-Hamas war.
“I must admit to being somewhat frankly naive. In the circles that I move, I see almost no antisemitism,” he said.
The billionaire continued to tout his “free speech” vision for X, saying that “relentless pursuit of the truth is the goal with X and allowing people to say what they want to say, even if it’s controversial provided, provided that it does not break the law.”
Musk also encouraged more world leaders to post on the platform and appeared to reference his past controversial posts as “mistakes.” But he said he thinks that more than 169 million people follow him on X because “I really try to say things that I think are interesting or funny,” although “once a while I’ll do something dumb.”
“It’s only me doing these posts. I don’t have a team or anything,” he said. He encouraged other leaders to post on social media without filtering messages through staff. “Every once in a while you make a mistake. You can’t win them all. Nobody bats 1,000.”"

She is a member of the Historians Council on the Constitution at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU Law School. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion at CNN.
As Wayne LaPierre prepares to take the stand this week in the corruption trial of the National Rifle Association (NRA), fresh questions are swirling around the timing of his resignation and the extent of his health problems, as well as what his continued presence at the trial means for the future of the organization - and the power politics behind the nation’s gun conversation.
On January 5, just five days before the opening of a major trial that alleges self-dealing and financial corruption at the highest level of the NRA, the organization’s executive vice president and CEO Wayne LaPierre, 74, abruptly resigned, citing health reasons.
The case was brought in May 2022 by New York State Attorney General Letitia James, who alleged misuse of funds for personal gain by LaPierre and other senior leaders of the organization, in violation of New York’s nonprofit laws — a charge to which he and his associates pled not guilty.
LaPierre, who has led the organization for more than 30 years, will be replaced on January 31 by Andrew Arulanandam, one of his top lieutenants, who has been instrumental in molding the NRA’s public persona.
Despite NRA leadership downplaying LaPierre’s resignation as a “course correction” (in effect, as nothing to see) in a recent filing, the long-time leader’s departure raises significant questions about his personal legacy, as well as the future of the NRA and the struggle for common sense gun laws.
LaPierre was a long-standing employee of the NRA — first joining the organization as a lobbyist in 1978—before becoming its unlikely executive vice president in 1991, when he also became the NRA’s chief spokesman, as outlined in his 2002 book, “Shooting Straight.” At the trial, a lawyer for New York state described how LaPierre ran the NRA as “Wayne’s World” for decades. And though he sometimes seemed awkward on stage at NRA events and tended to avert eye contact in person, he made up for his lack of charisma in his relentless focus on prioritizing gun rights over the right to live safely in a country where people fear—and live with the many consequences of — being shot.

During the 1990s, the NRA saw internal divisions over its political purity and financial problems. During the Clinton administration, therefore, the NRA focused much of its energy at the state level, successfully enacting numerous “right-to-carry” laws throughout the country, which provided individuals easier access to concealed weapons licenses. Yet, the NRA also experienced major stumbling blocks during this period, including the 1993 Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act — which imposed waiting periods and background checks on purchasers of handguns — and the now-expired 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban.
Significantly, following the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing that killed 168 people by former NRA member Timothy McVeigh, LaPierre referred in a fundraising letter to federal law enforcement agents as “jack-booted thugs,” a term commonly associated with fascism and Nazi SS soldiers. This led the former President George H. W. Bush and many others to resign their lifetime NRA memberships.
LaPierre is credited with the renewal and invigoration of the NRA’s cultural agenda in the years that followed. He recruited the actor Charlton Heston — best known for playing “Moses” on the big screen — to “part the red seas” in shaping a public image for the NRA. The pair led a campaign that encouraged civilian gun owners to believe that it was they who were victimized.
With LaPierre and Heston leading the organization, the NRA expanded its crusade to broaden gun rights and industry protections and positioned gun control advocates as adversaries in an all-out liberal culture war. Whereas before the 1990s, the NRA’s perceived opponents were mainly individuals who lacked rifle training, who were unwilling to fight for the nation, or were “hoplophobes” (a term coined by American marine Jeff Cooper in 1962 to describe an aversion to guns), now the “enemy” was much more expansive: including progressive social movements, government agencies, “globalists,” the UN, and the “mainstream media.”
In contrast, the NRA praised individual citizen gun rights defenders as patriots, defending individual rights and freedoms. As LaPierre wrote in his 2003 book, “Guns, Freedom, and Terrorism,” this battle is “about suppressing our culture, our heritage, our freedom.”  He oversaw the rise of NRA’s televisual presence, with its own high-end advertising campaign ads, films and NRATV station, which ceased operations in 2019. In 2000 the NRA introduced “America’s 1st Freedom” magazine, aimed beyond NRA members, to report “the news from the perspective of the concerned gun owner.” (LaPierre has written a regular monthly column, “Standing Guard,” for the magazine since 1991).

Following the 1999 mass shooting at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, LaPierre and Heston met ahead of the NRA’s annual meeting in Denver to discuss the group’s communications. Heston delivered a defiant message, similar to its position on mass shootings nowadays: The national media was not to be trusted and any conversation about guns and the NRA after mass shootings was a vulgar politicization of the issue. They cast gun rights as a religious and moral imperative, invoking comparisons to Nazi Germany and even hired lawyers who accused critics of gun rights of committing “blood libel.” They argued that other rights (including the right not to be shot) must be sacrificed in the process.
After the attacks of September 11, 2001, the NRA’s leadership compared Osama bin Laden’s attacks on American freedom with those “attacks on freedom” allegedly perpetrated by gun control advocates against gun owners.
The NRA’s defiant stance continued to strengthen. At the group’s 2002 meeting in Reno, Nevada, Heston memorably hoisted a gun in the air and boasted that it could only be taken, “From my cold dead hands!” NRA officers’ gloating messages to the board contrasted sharply with their portrayal of threats to gun rights at the members’ meetings. “The bottom line is, we’re on the offense,” LaPierre proudly announced at the Reno board meeting, meaning that the NRA was able to focus on lobbying for pro-gun legislation rather than against gun control legislation. In Orlando a year later, he told the board that the NRA is “stronger and more widely accepted than ever.”
The NRA’s approach resonated with a rising right-wing, anti-government shift in the Republican Party (as well as with some Democrats). Under pressure from the NRA and its supporters, in 2004 the Republican-controlled Congress allowed the federal assault weapons ban to expire.
LaPierre and the NRA saw another victory in the 2005 enactment of the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which granted immunity to firearms manufacturers and dealers from damages resulting from the misuse of their products. The NRA described the act as “the most significant piece of pro-gun legislation in 20 years.”
He will certainly be remembered for guiding the organization through a bumpy period and for taking the country to new and significantly more dangerous terrain when it comes to guns.
Jennifer Tucker
Lobbying against the inclusion of firearms in consumer product protections, the organization downplayed the state’s collective responsibility for protecting citizens, creating and mobilizing its membership around a slew of laws, policies and social norms that shield manufacturers, sellers and buyers from meaningful liability.
In December 2012, one week after Adam Lanza shot and killed 26 people at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, LaPierre announced during a press conference that “the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.” This narrative has landed with many Americans who believe that guns are essential for self-protection and the swift and just resolution of disputes. It also shifts the argument away from the characteristics of firearms as lethal weapons, to a debate about the moral character, social identities and mental states of the people carrying the gun.
LaPierre’s resignation brings to a close an extraordinary era of growth for America’s most powerful consumer lobby. He will certainly be remembered for guiding the organization through a bumpy period and for taking the country to new and significantly more dangerous terrain when it comes to guns. He oversaw the transformation of the NRA from its somewhat bipartisan past to its current status as a highly politicized social movement — and a political project that does not take the realities of gun violence or the need for equal protection under the criminal justice system seriously.
By both galvanizing gun safety supporters while also emboldening gun rights activists and facilitating a political and cultural evolution whereby defensive homicides are ever more justifiable in the legal system, LaPierre helped make the debate about guns in America even more contentious while shaping how the country talks about guns, gun control and itself.

But does LaPierre’s departure mark a turning point for guns in America?
It’s too soon to say, but it’s unlikely we’ll see significant changes any time soon. Notably, other gun rights organizations are rising in influence, many of which have long seen the NRA as too compromising.
LaPierre and the NRA are not entirely responsible for our country’s growing sense of vulnerability in the wake of mass shootings, police shootings of unarmed Black men and the threat of domestic terrorism. But in shaping a new set of rights and responsibilities, in which where citizens are sold the idea that private gun ownership is generally essential to be prepared to combat potential threats (and that “more guns means less crime”), they escalated the risk that even more people will be silenced, fearful, injured and killed. They moved us farther from being able to look at the distribution of harm rather than the pathologization of “bad actors.” They moved us farther from being able to approach the problem together."
F276Y49W3L_0N5KZU4F7R27B1Q,"Biden administration considers overhaul of natural gas export approval process, throwing major Gulf projects into question","By Ella Nilsen, CNN","3 minute read Published 4:31 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/24/politics/biden-natural-gas-export-cp2-louisiana-climate/,"The Biden administration is contemplating an overhaul of the way federal agencies approve massive natural gas export projects to allow for consideration what the climate impact of those facilities would be, according to an environmental advocacy source familiar with the plans.
The overhaul would effectively pause the federal approval process for a massive and controversial gas export project known as CP2, the source said – a facility that is being proposed for the southwest Louisiana coast, as well as other natural gas projects that are pending federal approval.
The administration’s potential change in posture on these facilities comes as President Joe Biden gears up for a tough reelection campaign, seeking to win the support of young, climate-minded voters. Environmental groups have recently turned their focus to the surge of new and planned fossil fuel infrastructure along the Gulf Coast – and the Biden administration’s role in approving it.
The administration is considering a broad overhaul of how the Department of Energy makes so-called public interest determinations – a key step needed to approve liquified natural gas facilities. This could include updating how the administration determines climate impacts of these projects, modernizing and updating the climate impact considerations, and considering the full upstream and downstream life cycle impacts of these projects, the source said.

The Energy Department, which is responsible for making public interest determinations as one step in the approval process, has never rejected a proposed natural gas project on these grounds.
The White House declined to comment. The Department of Energy did not return CNN’s request for comment. The New York Times and Bloomberg also reported the administration is considering changes to how it approves natural gas projects.
Natural gas is big business for the US fossil fuel industry, which has been exporting much of the product to other countries, particularly after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Europe’s subsequent move away from Russian gas. US companies have stepped in to fill that gap, compressing or freezing gas at export terminals and shipping it across the ocean in enormous tankers.
Biden is facing pressure on all sides as climate groups push back on the continued greenlighting of natural gas projects and the fossil fuel industry continues to invest in them. The CP2 project, which could export up to 20 million tons of natural gas a year, is the largest natural gas export facility proposed to date in the US and has been the subject of contentious debate.
Shaylyn Hynes, a spokesperson for CP2’s owner Venture Global, said the reported plans from the Biden administration would “create uncertainty about whether our allies can rely on US LNG for their energy security” and would “shock the global energy market.”
Environmental groups, who maintain the US is already producing and exporting enough gas to satisfy the energy needs of its foreign allies, cheered the plan.
“That decision would be one we would get behind; these LNG export projects have been rubber stamped up to this point,” said Mahyar Sorour, the director of beyond fossil fuels policy at the Sierra Club. “We’re encouraged.”

F2C2J792K9_J2BPVUXHV8UKUH5,Alabama plans the first nitrogen gas execution this week in largely secret process experts say raises concerns about cruelty,"By Dakin Andone, CNN","8 minute read Updated 11:04 AM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/23/us/nitrogen-gas-execution-kenneth-smith/,"Alabama intends to carry out the first known execution by nitrogen gas this week, when it’s scheduled to put to death Kenneth Smith some 14 months after failing to carry out his capital punishment by lethal injection.
But little is known about how the method, nitrogen hypoxia, will be carried out during a 30-hour execution window Thursday into Friday, as the state’s published protocol bears redactions that experts say shield key details from public scrutiny. The state, in court records, indicated the redactions were made to maintain security.
“This is a protocol that has been created out of whole cloth,” said Robin Maher, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, a non-profit that’s critical of how capital punishment is administered in the United States but does not take a stance on it.
Related article Executions in the US are in decline – but some jurisdictions lead the rest
“There’s no precedent for it,” she told CNN. “There’s no testing of this procedure. No one knows how it’s going to occur.”
Amid the uncertainty, Smith and his lawyers – along with experts from the United States to the United Nations – have questioned whether potential complications from the nitrogen gas procedure could lead to excessive pain or even torture for the inmate who previously asked to be put to death in this way.
“It’s not that nitrogen gas won’t kill you,” Dr. Joel Zivot, an associate professor of anesthesiology and surgery at Emory University, told CNN. “But will it kill you in a way that would comport with the Constitutional requirement that it not be cruel and it not be torture?”
Alabama is one of just three states, along with Oklahoma and Mississippi, that have approved use of nitrogen gas to carry out death sentences. But none has used it, and only Alabama has outlined a protocol.
While some US states decades ago used lethal gas to execute prisoners, the use of nitrogen would be new: In theory, it involves replacing the air breathed by an inmate with 100% nitrogen, depriving the body of the oxygen it needs to survive. Such displacement would lead to a painless death, according to the method’s proponents, who cite nitrogen’s role in deadly industrial accidents or suicides.
But those environments are different than an execution, said Zivot, who added he fears Alabama’s attempt could go awry and prompt myriad potential complications, such as causing Smith to have a seizure or vomit into the mask delivering the nitrogen, causing him to choke.

Meanwhile, though secrecy over the death penalty is not uncommon – many states keep private certain details of their execution procedures – experts say this moment is also troubling because Alabama in 2022 hosted three lethal injections, including Smith’s, that critics deemed “botched” because they deviated from protocol.
“Given the history that Alabama has, with so many botched executions, it seems hard to believe that they would be pivoting to a new, untested and risky procedure,” Maher said.
For its part, though, Alabama this week is “ready to go,” with the nitrogen hypoxia execution of Smith, its Republican governor told CNN in a statement:
“This method has been thoroughly vetted, and both the Alabama Department of Corrections and the Attorney General’s Office have indicated it is ready to go,” said Gov. Kay Ivey, whose office declined to provide an unredacted copy of the nitrogen hypoxia execution protocol or respond to CNN’s questions about experts’ concerns over it.
Smith was sentenced to death for his role in the 1988 murder for hire of Elizabeth Sennett. According to court records, her husband, minister Charles Sennett, hired someone who hired two others, including Smith, to kill his wife and make it look like a burglary.
Sennett, who court records say was having an affair and had taken out an insurance policy on his wife, killed himself a week after her murder as investigators’ focus turned to him. Smith was eventually arrested after investigators searched his home and found the Sennetts’ VCR.
Smith had expressed a desire to be executed by nitrogen hypoxia before Alabama tried to put him to death in November 2022 using lethal injection. The state aborted that attempt because officials could not set an intravenous line before the execution warrant expired.
He shared his wish again after that attempt – then reversed course in August, when the state suddenly agreed to use the method and released the heavily redacted protocol. Smith then challenged the protocol, claiming it left him at risk of “superadded pain,” could cause him to have a stroke or could leave him in a vegetative state if it fails, court records show.
A federal judge’s ruling this month cleared the way for Alabama to proceed, finding there was “simply not enough evidence to find” the protocol would cause Smith “superadded pain.” And while the judge acknowledged the “heavily redacted” protocol maintained the Department of Corrections’ “familiar veil of secrecy over its capital punishment procedures,” he also noted the state had provided Smith’s team an unredacted protocol. Further details, including the specific mask that will be used, were revealed in oral arguments last month.
The ruling placed Alabama “an important step closer to holding Kenneth Smith accountable” for Sennett’s killing, state Attorney General Steve Marshall said in a statement the day of the ruling. “Smith has avoided his lawful death sentence for over 35 years, but the court’s rejection … of Smith’s speculative claims removes an obstacle to finally seeing justice done.”
“Now that the State is prepared to give Smith what he asked for, he objects,” Marshall’s office told CNN this week in a separate statement, which also pointed out that an advocate for assisted suicide later called as an expert witness by Smith and his attorneys posted on X in September that nitrogen hypoxia was “not ‘cruel & unusual’” but “fast” and “effective.”
That expert subsequently testified in Smith’s case to the potential for complications to arise during the nitrogen hypoxia execution, saying he could not exclude the possibility Smith would be left with permanent brain damage, according to the judge’s ruling.
And still in the case, litigation continues: Last week, Smith’s attorneys asked the US Supreme Court for a stay of execution, asserting a second attempt to execute him would constitute cruel and unusual punishment.
For their part, Elizabeth Sennett’s sons plan to be present for Smith’s execution, finally here after 35 years, they told CNN affiliate WAFF.
“The man’s been in prison right at twice as long as we knew our mom,” Mike Sennett said.
The origins of nitrogen hypoxia as an execution method trace in most sources to a 1995 article in National Review, though it’s gained increasing traction in recent years as states struggle to implement lethal injection, according to Deborah Denno, a professor at Fordham Law School who has studied the death penalty for decades.
Since its inception 40 years ago, lethal injection has become by far the most prominent method of execution for the US government and the 27 states that still have the death penalty. But beginning around 2009, states began losing access to the drugs long used to carry it out, leading to use of alternative drugs that have led to a “surge in problems with lethal injection,” Denno told CNN.
Related article Judge blocks Thursday’s execution by lethal injection of Alabama death row inmate who says he requested to die by nitrogen hypoxia
That’s created a moment ripe for the rise of another method, she indicated, describing the circumstances as a pattern that has been repeated for more than a century and a half, such as when electrocution – conceived as more humane than hanging – was sidelined following grisly botches.
“It was when states are pushed into a corner and they are desperate, it’s at that point, they come up with a new method of execution,” Denno said.
Oklahoma was first to adopt nitrogen gas as an execution method in 2015 as a backup if lethal injection were ever found unconstitutional or “otherwise unavailable.” The legislation’s passage, per Denno, was based in part on an unpublished paper by three academics at East Central University, who concluded nitrogen hypoxia could “assure a quick and painless death.”
Then-Oklahoma Corrections Department Director Joe Allbaugh echoed that in 2018, when officials said they intended to move forward with nitrogen gas executions. “After a couple breaths,” Allbaugh said at the time, “the individual loses consciousness, doesn’t feel anything.”
Alabama adopted nitrogen hypoxia that same year, with the state lawmaker who sponsored the legislation telling AL.com he believed it would be more humane than lethal injection.
Many others, including Zivot, however, remain skeptical of nitrogen hypoxia, with the anesthesiologist pointing to several potential complications, including the risk that the nitrogen causes Smith to have a seizure, which could make him vomit into the mask and then choke.
Zivot also raised the possibility of an ineffective seal on the mask, allowing nitrogen to leak out, prolonging the execution or leaving Smith severely injured. A leak could also present a risk to others, like witnesses, corrections officials or Smith’s spiritual adviser, Zivot said. Indeed, the adviser had to sign a waiver acknowledging he could be exposed to the gas, NPR reported.
“Alabama, again, has no idea whether this will happen, whether it won’t happen, what they’ll do about it,” he said. “But these are all kind of concerns, you know, with this particular method of execution.”
Related article Alabama death row inmate asks appeals court to block this week’s scheduled execution
Those concerns are shared by parties far beyond Alabama: Earlier this month, United Nations experts “expressed alarm” over Smith’s looming execution, saying in a news release, “We are concerned that nitrogen hypoxia would result in a painful and humiliating death.”
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights almost two weeks later called on Alabama to halt the execution, saying it “could amount to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment under international human rights law.”
While those sentenced to death are often convicted of particularly heinous crimes and deemed the “worst of the worst,” the Constitution still protects them, said Maher, the Death Penalty Information Center director.
“The people that we have placed in prisons and jails are still human beings who are deserving of the same kind of dignity that we would demand for ourselves and anyone that we love,” she said. “They are entitled to the protections of the Constitution the same as anyone else in this country. And they certainly should be free from being tortured or inhumanely executed.”
How the death penalty is used “says a lot about us as a society,” she added, noting secrecy about it “increases the risk of problems,” leading to more botched executions.
“The fact that this incredibly important function, which is probably the biggest use of government power, the details of which are being kept from the public,” she said, “that raises a lot of questions about whether this is the right thing to do.”"

But Musk conceded that he wasn’t aware until recently that antisemitism was a pervasive problem in the United States.
Musk made the comments during an interview at a conference hosted by the European Jewish Association near the site of the Auschwitz in Poland. It comes after Musk faced a firestorm of backlash over antisemitic content on X, including a post with an antisemitic conspiracy theory that Musk himself amplified (and later apologized for in the wake of condemnation.)

Wreaths of smoke hung over the UN shelter, after a huge blaze broke out at the UNRWA Khan Younis Training Center, video obtained by CNN showed.
“Buildings ablaze and mass casualties. Safe access to and from the center has been denied for two days. People are trapped,” Thomas White, the director of UNRWA Affairs, said on X.
At least nine people were killed and another 75 injured, White said, adding that a team from his agency and the World Health Organization were trying to reach the site. He said the building shelters 800 people. UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini said on X that the entire Khan Younis Training Center, one of the largest UNRWA facilities in Gaza, was sheltering 30,000 people, and is clearly marked as a UN site.
In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had “currently” ruled out that the incident was “the result of an aerial or artillery strike by the IDF.”
It said a “thorough review of the operations of the forces in the vicinity is underway,” adding that it is “examining the possibility that the strike was a result of Hamas fire.”
In the past week, the IDF has intensified its offensive on Khan Younis, where medical facilities sheltering displaced civilians and health workers have been battered. The IDF maintains there are Hamas militants located in hospitals in the area. Relief agencies say the siege has blocked critical humanitarian operations.
The Israeli military launched its campaign in Gaza with the stated aim of eliminating Hamas, after more than 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 kidnapped during the militant group’s October 7 attacks on Israel, according to Israeli authorities.
Since then its bombardment and besiegement of the enclave has decimated swathes of the territory, diminishing food, fuel and water supplies and exposing more than 2.2 million civilians to starvation, dehydration and disease.
On Tuesday, UN Secretary-General António Guterres warned that Palestinians in Gaza “face inhumane, squalid conditions, struggling to simply make it through another day without proper shelter, heating, sanitary facilities, food and drinkable water.”
Israeli attacks on the Palestinian enclave have killed at least 25,700 people, and injured another 63,740, according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health in Gaza. CNN cannot independently verify the figures due to the difficulties of reporting from the war zone.
Palestinian health officials and paramedics have also reported Israeli tanks and attack drones firing at people trying to flee the vicinity of the Amal and Nasser hospitals in Khan Younis.
The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said Israeli forces have surrounded the Nasser Medical Complex, cutting off crucial medical, food, and fuel supplies.
“Hundreds of patients with infections and pregnant women are facing serious complications,” health ministry spokesperson Ashraf Al-Qudra said.
The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said Israeli forces are “surrounding” their headquarters and the Al-Amal Hospital and have enforced “restrictions on movement around both the building and the hospital”.
Six people were killed in attacks on Khan Younis on Wednesday, PRCS added, three of which had been “targeted” at the entrance of their headquarters.
Israeli tanks also surrounded the compound of the Al-Aqsa University in the city where thousands have been sheltering, Palestinian state news agency WAFA said. It said civilians had been targeted elsewhere in southern Gaza in the last 24 hours.
Four civilians, including a child, were killed in an Israeli attack on a “rest stop” in the coastal town of Al-Mawasi, and a man fleeing fighting in Khan Younis was struck in his car, reported WAFA.
Israeli forces conducted “numerous intense air raids, described as ‘fire belts’ to accompany its ground incursion, which has extended all the way to the west of Khan Younis,” a Geneva-based NGO advocating for human rights in the region, Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor, said on Wednesday
Euro-Med HR reported that shelters housing “tens of thousands” of displaced people in the western part of Khan Younis, and in Al-Mawasi, are under siege by the Israeli military.
The IDF said they continue to operate in Khan Younis, where they are pursuing “military targets, outposts, infrastructure and command and control centers,” and said the operation there will continue for “several days.”
“The brigade combat team is located around the [Khan Younis] camp, in the western part, and have begun to operate within it.  The manoeuvre will continue against military targets that are in the area, outposts, infrastructure, and command and control centers,” the IDF said.
“There is an area with shelters, there are several hospitals, several sensitive sites. We have seen terrorists use these sites. Almost a week ago we saw a launch from the Nasser Hospital, there are terrorists located in these hospitals.
“This operation will continue for several days until we maximize the achievements: dismantling Hamas’ military framework and Hamas strongholds, which we are required to thoroughly dismantle,” added the IDF.
CNN cannot independently verify operational details reported by the IDF. CNN has sought comment from the IDF on whether its forces have surrounded the Nasser and Amal hospitals.
As the IDF surrounded the city of Khan Younis, thousands of Palestinians moved south towards Rafah, near the border with Egypt, where 1.3 million people have been displaced, according to the UN.
A CNN video recorded on Monday shows displaced people sitting on the side of streets and in the vicinity of the seashore as they head west and south. The IDF instructed civilians to leave several districts in and around the city and head toward the coast, which it described to CNN as “safer.”
The video shows cars, trucks, and tractors transporting families and their essential belongings, such as blankets, mattresses and food. Many, however, were walking.
Hisham Sayegh said he saw four people killed, which forced him to leave with his family as shelling in the area intensifies.
“There are dead people on the ground. We left them behind. There are people killed inside the houses,” Sayegh said. “We were expecting to die at any minute.”
Jamal al Rozzi, an aid worker displaced near Khan Younis, said he was forced to flee to Rafah on Wednesday after heavy bombardment in the area.
“We had three horrible nights,” Al Rozzi, who is executive director of the National Society for Rehabilitation, told CNN in a voice message.
“We had to evacuate again … because the area where we were was under bombardment,” he said. “It was heavy bombardment and we were hardly safe there.”

F9C2LTWNDO_K4YNWNVM8GUABS6,Kenya court blocks deployment of police officers to Haiti,"By Larry Madowo and Nimi Princewill, CNN","2 minute read Published 8:04 AM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/26/africa/kenyacourt-blocks-deployment-of-police-officers-to-haiti/,"A judge in Kenya has barred the East African nation from deploying 1,000 police officers to Haiti to lead a UN-backed multinational force to restore security in the Caribbean nation.
High Court judge Chacha Mwita ruled on Friday that President William Ruto and his National Security Council do not have the authority to send police officers to Haiti or any other country under Kenyan law.He added that the long-delayed deployment under a deal financed by the United States “contravenes the constitution and the law and is therefore unconstitutional, illegal and invalid.”
In October, the State Department pledged $100 million to support a multinational force in Haiti after the UN Security Council voted to approve it to quell gang violence in the island nation. Kenya volunteered to lead it and got necessary approvals from its cabinet and parliament.
But Kenyan politician Ekuru Aukot led a legal challenge to the planned in deployment in court, terming it unconstitutional. The high court ruling agreed with him.
“There’s no reciprocal arrangement between Kenya and Haiti and there can be no legitimate deployment of police officers to Haiti,” Judge Mwita said when he read his ruling in Nairobi.
The ruling poses a potential setback for Kenya’s peacekeeping mission to the Caribbean nation having previously supported similar initiatives by the UN and the African Union.

It is not immediately clear whether the Kenyan government would appeal the ruling or the extent to which the domestic legal battle could complicate the deployment of the multinational force to Haiti, which it spearheads alongside Haiti’s neighbors – Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, and Jamaica.
Kenya’s UN representative Martin Kimani told the Security Council Thursday that his country “has made substantial progress … including taking legal, administrative steps” in its preparation for the Haiti mission and was awaiting the outomce of today’s ruling. Kimani has yet to react to the verdict.
Gang violence rose by more than 100% in Haiti last year with over 8000 victims documented, according to UN data.
“The Haitian people have had enough of the armed gangs’ savagery,” Haiti’s foreign minister Jean Victor Geneus told the UN council while urging a speedy deployment of the multinational force.
“Every passing day that this long-awaited support has not yet arrived is one day too many,” he added."

The men – Noah Roush and Jatonia Bryant – were found missing around 10:30 a.m. Monday from the Dub Brassell Adult Detention Center in Pine Bluff – a city about 40 miles south of Little Rock, the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office said in a release.
Bryant, 23, was being held on probable cause for capital murder, and Roush, 22, was being held on probable cause for residential burglary and theft, according to the sheriff’s office. Roush is also a suspect in a homicide, it added.
“Both individuals are to be considered dangerous and should only be approached (by) law enforcement personnel,” the sheriff’s office warned.
The sheriff’s office is offering a reward of $2,500 per escaped inmate for any information leading up to the apprehension and return to custody of Roush and Bryant, it said in a release. As of 6 p.m. Wednesday, the two inmates are still on the run, the sheriff’s office said.
On Monday, authorities said the pair is believed to have escaped in the last 48 hours.
Bryant is 5’11,” Black and weighs approximately 145 pounds, the release said. Roush is 6’2”, White, approximately 180 pounds and has a scar on the right side of his head, it said.
The sheriff’s office is working with several agencies to track down the inmates, including the Arkansas State Police and state Department of Corrections.
Anyone with information about the men’s whereabouts or or who may have assisted in the escape are encouraged to reach out to the sheriff’s department.
Correction: An earlier version of this story had the wrong day for when the inmates' escape was discovered. They were found to be missing on Monday."
FBHGV0WNOT_A6RU0L8XBQ28NXS,‘The straw that broke the camel’s back’: United CEO’s frustration with Boeing’s problems,"By Chris Isidore, CNN","5 minute read Updated 1:21 PM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/23/business/united-boeing-max-9-grounding/,"United Airlines, one of the biggest buyers of Boeing jets, is losing patience with the troubled aircraft maker.
“I’m disappointed that… this keeps happening at Boeing. This isn’t new,” said Scott Kirby, CEO of United, in an interview Tuesday on CNBC. “We need Boeing to succeed. But they’ve been having these consistent manufacturing challenges. They need to take action here.”
Kirby made his comments after the airline warned investors that it will report a larger-than-expected loss in the first three months of this year because of the grounding of all 737 Max 9 jets after a door plug blew off on an Alaska Air flight on January 5, leaving a massive hole in the side of the plane.
The plane landed without any serious injuries, but the Federal Aviation Administration ordered the grounding and additional inspections of the more than 200 jets of that model worldwide.
United Airlines said it now expects its fleet of Boeing Max 9 jets to remain grounded through the end of this month, and that the company will report a first quarter loss in the range of $116 million to $262 million. That’s more than the $138 million loss already forecast by analysts surveyed by Refinitiv.
United has 79 of the Max 9s, more than any other airline, and had originally scheduled nearly 8,000 flights with the plane for this month before the incident, according to Cirium, an aviation analytics firm.
Beyond the current 737 Max 9 problem is what this means for Boeing’s orders for the 737 Max 10, a newer, larger version and more expensive version of the 737 Max that has yet to be certified by the FAA. It will be at least five years in a best case scenario before Boeing can delivery those Max 10 jets to United, Kirby said, and the airline is now no longer counting on getting that plane in the future.
“I think the Max 9 grounding is probably the straw that broke the camel’s back for us,” said Kirby. “We’re going to build a plan that doesn’t have the Max 10 in it.”
United has firm orders for 277 of the 737 Max 10, and options to buy an additional 200, and so if the airline were to pull out of those orders, it would be a massive blow for Boeing’s efforts to bring that plane to market.
And in a call with investors later in the day, Kirby said that the airline is not quite canceling the orders that it has for the Max 10, but it doesn’t anticipate it’ll be receiving the jets, either.
“We are taking it out of our internal plans,” said Kirby. “And we’ll be working on what that means exactly with Boeing. But Boeing is not going to be able to meet their contractual deliveries on at least many of those airplanes. And let’s leave it at that.”
United has orders for more than 500 Boeing jets in total on the books, more than twice as many as it does for jets from its rival Airbus. But in the last six months, United took delivery of its first A321neo, a model that directly competes with the Boeing 737 Max.
But thanks to a deep order backlog at both companies, even if United were to drop its 737 Max 10 purchase plans, it would probably be forced to buy other 737 Max models rather than getting at the end of the line for buyers of Airbus jets.
That will constrain the company for quite some time, Kirby added.
“We’re still going to be the fastest growing airline,” Kirby said. “But we’re not going to be as fast growing as we planned.”
Boeing would not comment directly on United’s comments on its orders, other than to once again apologize for the problems that led to the incident at Alaska Air and the subsequent 737 Max 9 grounding.
“We have let down our airline customers and are deeply sorry for the significant disruption to them, their employees and their passengers,” said Stan Deal, head of Boeing’s commercial aircraft unit, in a statement released by the company. “We are taking action on a comprehensive plan to bring these airplanes safely back to service and to improve our quality and delivery performance. We will follow the lead of the FAA and support our customers every step of the way.”

Boeing has had a series of quality issues that have dogged the aircraft maker for the last five years, ever since two fatal crashes of the 737 Max 8 in late 2018 and early 2019 led to a 20-month grounding of the jet.
United believes it is getting close to the completion of the inspections it needs to get approval to fly the 737 Max 9 once again, Kirby said.
“I have a lot of confidence in the safety of these airplanes, particularly since we know what happened with this Max 9,” he said. “I think we’re near the end game of getting that [model] back flying.”
United did say it expects full year earnings of between $9 to $11 a share, a range which would include the current estimates of full-year earnings of $9.45 a share according to analysts, as well as 2023 earnings of $10.05 a share that it reported Monday.
And it reported fourth-quarter earnings of $2.00 a share, topping the $1.69 a share forecast by analysts.
The earnings beat and the full-year guidance helped to lift shares of United more than 5% in trading Tuesday."
FDUEMC4BDW_VXBM7238T83ID20,Sofia Richie Grainge announces pregnancy with ‘Vogue’ photoshoot,"By Alex Rees, CNN","3 minute read Published 5:45 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/25/style/sofia-richie-grainge-pregnant-vogue/,"For young celebrities in the public eye today, many of life’s milestones are accompanied by a glossy magazine feature — or perhaps a carefully-staged paparazzi shoot, depending on the narrative at hand.
It could be the announcement of a new professional venture or personal success; a “revenge body” reveal if there’s a failed relationship to bounce back from or a wedding dress reveal if love — and luxe confetti — is in the air. And then, of course, there’s the time-honored tradition of the fashion shoot-meets-baby-bump-debut.
Sofia Richie Grainge is the latest star to partake in this trend, with a “Vogue” spread released Thursday featuring her in bump-baring shirts, tank tops and even some loose tailoring as a means of confirming her first pregnancy.
(Richie Grainge and her husband, the music executive Elliot Grainge, were married last April in a ceremony which was also splashed across “Vogue.”)
Richie Grainge told “Vogue” she learned of her pregnancy after a whirlwind trip to Milan Fashion Week last fall, when it turned out what she first thought to be jet-lag was an early bout of morning sickness.
“I told everyone that I had bought them a gift from Milan,” the fashion influencer told the magazine of how she and Grainge then hid her positive pregnancy tests in designer gift boxes. “That’s how we told all of our parents. Watching their reaction go from like, ‘I’m about to get an expensive present’ to like ‘I’m about to get a grandchild’ was really sweet.”
‘My body is doing incredible things right now.’ Rihanna is resplendent on Vogue’s May cover
“I’ve learned more in the past six months than I have in my entire life,” Richie Grainge continued, confirming that her baby — a girl — will be due in the late spring. “And also just like what the female body is capable of. Every week brings new things, whether it’s hormonal shifts or expansion — there’s just so much our bodies go through, and it’s so interesting to experience it all.”
Having kept her news among close family and friends until today, Richie Grainge acknowledged stepping back from the social media platforms where her “It girl” aesthetic is widely-followed (and widely-envied) during the early stages of her pregnancy. That was a conscious choice, she said: “I’m definitely not posting as much. It’s been hard for me to have that connection with my followers when I can’t really be honest,” she explained.
And while she will be back in their feeds moving forward, it will be with some new boundaries in mind. “I’m not going to publicize my child on Instagram,” Richie Grainge said. “I don’t plan to take that approach because I want my kid to have the option to do what she wants with her life. If she wants to be a private person, I want her to be able to make that choice.”"
FF8VVQSWKO_VOTV6HPQD3O5V9T,From ‘Barbie’ to ‘Bob the Builder’: All about Mattel’s next big movie (and how Jlo is involved),"By Elizabeth Wagmeister, CNN","2 minute read Updated 11:21 AM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/25/entertainment/bob-the-builder-jennifer-lopez/,"Mattel struck gold – or pink – with “Barbie,” which was the first major feature film to come from the toy company and made nearly $1.5 billion worldwide, becoming the biggest movie of 2023 and racking up eight Oscar nominations earlier this week.
Now, CNN has learned that Mattel hopes to maintain that momentum with a cinematic adaptation of another kids’ character: Bob the Builder. An animated movie based on the long-running animated children’s series is in development, with Jennifer Lopez attached to executive produce and “In the Heights” star Anthony Ramos set to voice the beloved titular cartoon contractor.
In the animated movie, Roberto “Bob” travels to Puerto Rico for a major construction job, takes on issues affecting the island and digs deeper into what it means to build, according to a press release from Mattel. This new take on “Bob the Builder” will “celebrate the vibrant and colorful textures of the Caribbean Latin nations and their people.”
Aside from voicing Bob the Builder, Ramos will also serve as a producer. In a statement, Ramos said that the movie will focus on friends working together and how love can help conquer any obstacle.
“For years, Bob the Builder’s characters have inspired young people around the world,” the actor said, noting that he will bring “elements of life that are inspired by my own” into the film.
Lopez will produce through her production company, Nuyorican Productions, along with her producing partners Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas and Benny Medina.
The “Bob the Builder” television series ran in worldwide syndication for over a decade in the early aughts, and is known for its popular catchphrase, “Can we fix it? Yes, we can!”
“Bob the Builder” is the first animated theatrical movie to come from Mattel, but following the huge success of “Barbie,” the company has plans to bring more toys to the big screen, with films based on everything from American Girl dolls and Magic 8 Ball to “Masters of the Universe” and the card game UNO in the works, according to their release.
A Mattel source also says the  company is developing a “Hot Wheels” movie with J.J. Abrams, “Rock ‘Em Sock ‘Em” with Vin Diesel, “Barney” with Daniel Kaluuya, “Polly Pocket” from Lena Dunham with star Lily Collins and “Major Matt Mason” starring Tom Hanks."
FGHRYS03ML_5Q7SND3EUP9LIJD,Stanley and other drink cups contain lead. Should you be worried?,"By Madeline Holcombe and Sandee LaMotte, CNN","5 minute read Published 4:27 PM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/26/health/stanley-cups-lead-wellness/,"First, Stanley cups were all over social media because so many people wanted them. Now, the oversize tumblers are back in the spotlight over fears they may contain lead.
Videos on social media sites such as TikTok show people breaking out a lead testing kit and trying it on their Stanley cups and other travel flasks.
It’s true: There is some lead sealed within the base of some brands of travel drinking cups — including the wildly popular brand Stanley.
Lead is used as part of the tumbler’s vacuum insulation and is covered by a stainless steel layer that protects consumers from lead exposure, according to the Stanley cup manufacturer, Pacific Market International.
“Our manufacturing process currently employs the use of an industry standard pellet to seal the vacuum insulation at the base of our products; the sealing material includes some lead,” a Stanley spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “Once sealed, this area is covered with a durable stainless steel layer, making it inaccessible to consumers.”
“Rest assured that no lead is present on the surface of any Stanley product that comes into contact with the consumer nor the contents of the product,” the statement said.
But people on social media are nervous, considering the dangers of any exposure to lead. The toxic metal can lead to kidney problems, anemia, reproductive issues and developmental problems, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And Stanley cups are everywhere.
The tumblers, which come in a rainbow of colors and hold up to 40 ounces of water while still fitting in a car cup holder, have become both a status symbol and a wellness essential for those who ascribe to the “clean girl” beauty trends of hydrated, natural skin.
Stanley cups are in the hands of beauty bloggers, the cars of parents at school pickup, and even on the Christmas lists of many kids this past year. Some parents have reported their children were bullied by peers if they came to school with any other brand of cup.

Some caution is warranted, said Jane Houlihan, research director for Healthy Babies, Bright Futures, an alliance of nonprofits, scientists and donors with a stated mission of reducing babies’ exposures to neurotoxic chemicals.
“If the cup stays intact, there’s likely no lead exposure risk for consumers. But if that bottom seal comes off, all bets are off,” Houlihan said.
“Lead is so toxic you just can’t take chances with it,” she said in an email. “If a company has to rely on their product remaining perfectly intact in order for it to be safe, that company has a basic material safety problem that they are passing on to their customers.”
If the base cap of a Stanley cup does come off and exposes the seal, which is rare, the cup is eligible for replacement under the lifetime warranty, according to a statement from Stanley.
It’s not just the Stanley brand that utilizes lead. Other brands have been subject to recall over their use of the material, according to the US Consumer Product Safety Commission.
In November, the federal agency announced the recall of about 84,000 Tiblue Stainless Steel Children’s Cups and 3,600 Klickpick Home Children’s Cup Sets sold on Amazon due to “an accessible solder bead with levels of lead that exceed the federal lead content ban.”
Earlier that month, some 1,600 PandaEar and 200 Laoion stainless steel children’s cups sold on Amazon were recalled for the same reasons, according to the CPSC website.
And in July of last year, around 346,000 Cupkin stainless steel children’s cups were recalled by the manufacturer because they contained levels of lead that exceeded the federal lead content ban of 100 parts per million. (For water, the action level is 15 parts per billion, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency.)
“In general CPSC has strict regulations on lead in the content, especially for children’s products. We have issued several recalls for lead in children’s products,” said CPSC Press Secretary Patty Davis.
“And we encourage consumers to report if they’re concerned about a safety hazard with a product to tell us about it at our website, which is http://www.saferproducts.gov/,” Davis said.
Why would lead be found in a drinking cup at all?
“Using lead to solder is a very old manufacturing practice, which had been quite common,” said Olga Naidenko, vice president of science investigations at the Washington, DC-based Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization “dedicated to protecting human health and the environment.”
“In insulated cups, lead was used in solder that seals the vacuum between the inner and the outer layer of a cup,” she said via email. “Many manufacturers are now stating that they are using alternatives to lead for sealing vacuum in those types of cups.”
Any potential lead exposure is unacceptable, and companies should move to make these products without lead, Naidenko added.
There is no safe level of lead for children, according to the US Consumer Product and Safety Commission. “Even low levels of lead in blood have been shown to affect learning, ability to pay attention, and academic achievement,” the CDC said.
Lead “bio-accumulates” in the body, which means it stays and builds up over time, so ongoing exposure, even at extremely low levels, can become toxic. Children, especially fetuses and infants are the most vulnerable, says the Environmental Protection Agency, because it takes very little lead exposure to damage a child compared with an adult.

“A dose of lead that would have little effect on an adult can have a significant effect on a child. In children, low levels of exposure have been linked to damage to the central and peripheral nervous system, learning disabilities, shorter stature, impaired hearing, and impaired formation and function of blood cells,” the EPA states on its website.
The main source of lead exposure in the United States comes from inhaling dust or eating particles contaminated by paint chips. That’s because lead was a common additive in house paint, gasoline and many other materials for years before its toxicity was known.
Between 10% and 20% of our exposure to lead comes from contaminated water, according to experts. It’s even worse for the youngest and most vulnerable: Babies can get between 40% and 60% of their exposure to lead by drinking formula mixed with contaminated water.
Many experts suggest that parents get their child’s lead level tested at ages 1 and 2, and possibly more often, depending on the area of the country. The test is easily done by a pediatrician, or at a local state, county or city department of health."

It’s been a rollercoaster week for stocks trading in mainland China and Hong Kong.
Key market indexes plunged Monday, taking year-to-date losses to between 7% and 10% and extending a protracted $6 trillion-dollar rout that began in 2021.
Then, following a series of unusual interventions and announcement by worried Chinese officials, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index (HSI) rebounded to end the week up 4.2%, while the blue-chip Shanghai Shenzhen CSI300 logged a 2% weekly gain.
Does the rally mark an end to the country’s three-year long market meltdown? Analysts say not just yet. A slew of economic problems — including a record downturn in real estate, deflation, debt, a falling birthrate and shrinking work force — haven’t gone away, and they will limit longer term gains.
“Over the past 48 hours, China has announced a flurry of measures to support its economy and financials markets,” Nomura analysts said on Thursday. “We think these measures are likely to stabilize stock market sentiment and could potentially even support a relief rally in China stocks, given extremely low valuations, very light investor positioning, and technically oversold markets.”
China is facing a myriad of economic problems, including rising debt levels and worsening demographics. Beijing’s shift towards ideology-driven policies have also scared away foreign firms and investors and soured relations with the United States.
Without progress in tackling some of those deep-seated challenges, investors are likely to remain on the sidelines and markets will continue to drift.
“For a sustained rally in China stocks, we think China will need to address the core of these concerns (predominantly property sector issues and US-China tensions),” the analysts added.
The measures Beijing took this week to boost the stock market were surprising because they mark a rapid turnaround from the previous week, when Premier Li Qiang dashed hopes of major stimulus measures in a speech in Davos, Switzerland. But that was before shares tanked.
On Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that Chinese authorities were considering ordering state-owned enterprises to use money held in offshore accounts to buy shares worth as much as 2 trillion yuan ($282 billion).
A day later, in an unprecedented move, regulators said they were considering evaluating the performance of the heads of state-owned companies based on their stock market value.
The move was aimed at guiding executives “to pay more attention” to their companies’ share prices and to use “methods such as increasing holdings and share buybacks to stabilize market expectations,” a spokesperson for the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission told reporters in Beijing.
On the same day, Li Yunze, director of the recently-established National Administration of Financial Regulation (NAFR), vowed at an international financial conference in Hong Kong to further open its $64 trillion financial industry to international investors.
Hours later, Pan Gongsheng, the governor of the People’s Bank of China, unexpectedly announced that the central bank would slash the amount of cash banks are required to hold as reserves, which could provide one trillion yuan ($141 billion) in long-term liquidity to the economy.
“All these measures were unexpected and likely prompted by the significant rout seen in stock markets recently,” Nomura analysts said, adding that stronger actions were likely to follow.
The measures worked. By the end of Thursday, the HSI had risen for three days in a row, up a combined 8.4%. The CSI300 gained 4% during the same period.
In the 7 days to January 24, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking Chinese stocks recorded large inflows of $12.6 billion, according to a Citi survey of global fund managers. Over the previous week, $2.3 billion flowed out of those funds.
Beijing’s determination to support the equity markets has been successful and the gains could continue, analysts from Enodo Economics said Friday.
“An equity upturn could run a few quarters, especially if [it] leads to foreign investors reassessing their severely underweight China position,” they said.
Still, investors have been fleeing Chinese stocks over a much longer period because they are worried about the country’s economic prospects.
As of January, mainland China had seen six months of consecutive outflows, with foreign institutional investors selling a total of $30 billion of shares listed on mainland Chinese exchanges, a HSBC survey showed on Friday.
“We do not think the market rescue package [in recent days] can change the economic fundamental, that is, weak aggregate demand,” said Raymond Yeung, chief economist for Greater China at ANZ Research.
Deflation is haunting the Chinese economy, which has grappled with weak prices for many months. The country is facing the prospect of a vicious cycle whereby lower demand leads to lower investment, lower production and lower income, thus causing even lower demand.
“A wholesale reflation strategy like the one [at] the end of 2015 is required to avert assert price deflation,” Yeung said, referring to a series of stimulus measures rolled out over several months to support the economy. It included a number of initiatives aimed at reviving home buying.
He called the rescue measures announced this week “piecemeal” and “reactive,” saying they would not be sufficient to fix the economic problems in the longer term."

Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index fell 2.3% Monday, closing at its lowest level since October 2022. The index has lost more than 12% so far this month, nearly as much as it lost in all of 2023.
Mainland China’s Shanghai Composite Index tumbled 2.7% in its biggest daily drop since April 2022. The Shenzhen Component Index, a tech-heavy benchmark, had its worst day in nearly two years, plunging 3.5%. The indexes have tanked 4.8% and 7.7% respectively in the first trading days of 2024.
It’s the worst start to a year for Chinese stocks since 2016, when investors were ditching their holdings following a market crash in 2015. A bubble popped as the economy showed signs of strain and share prices got way ahead of company profits.
In recent months, a real estate crisis, the slowest growth (outside the pandemic) in decades, and a crackdown on some businesses have all combined to undermine investor confidence.
Ken Cheung, chief Asian foreign exchange strategist for Mizuho Bank, said Monday that foreign investors were continuing to “reduce their risk exposure” to China and had “bearish expectations” for business conditions in the country.
“The Chinese government has not yet introduced effective measures to resolve the property turmoil and drive the economic recovery,” he wrote in a note.
Investors were left disappointed on Monday after China’s central bank decided to keep its benchmark lending rate steady. A cut to the rate would lower the cost of borrowing for people and businesses taking out loans or paying down interest, and therefore help stimulate economic activity.

The heavy market losses in 2024 come hot on the heels of a bruising run last year, when the CSI 300 index, comprising 300 major stocks listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen, fell more than 11%.
By contrast, the United States’ benchmark S&P 500 index climbed 24% in 2023, while Europe’s grew almost 13%. Japan’s Nikkei 225 soared 28% last year and is still going strong, notching gains of nearly 10% so far this month.
Demographic data released last Wednesday confirming that China’s population is getting older and smaller hasn’t helped quell investors’ anxieties. They were also perturbed that a speech delivered by Chinese Premier Li Qiang last week at the World Economic Forum failed to mention any new government stimulus measures to help juice the country’s ailing economy.
Brian Martin & Daniel Hynes, analysts at ANZ Research, wrote in a Friday research note that Li’s speech had “doused” expectations of further support measures. “(He) trumpeted the nations’ ability to hit its 5% growth target without flooding the economy with massive stimulus,” they wrote.
In recent months, Beijing has issued $137 billion worth of government bonds, the bulk of which will fund infrastructure projects, while China’s sovereign wealth fund has bought shares to support the country’s sagging stock market.
Li’s speech appears to have dealt another blow to investors already wearied by a raft of disappointing economic data coming out of Beijing, including the ongoing crisis in its real-estate sector and a rapidly shrinking population.
The country’s economy grew by 5.2% last year. That beat government projections but is still one of China’s worst economic performances in over three decades. The International Monetary Fund forecasts the country’s economic growth to slow to 4.2% this year.
In 2023, investors had eagerly anticipated a rebound in China’s economy following Beijing’s decision to scrap its strict zero-Covid policy at the end of the previous year. That robust recovery never came and investors voted with their feet. According to China’s Commerce Ministry, foreign direct investment into the country fell 8% in 2023 compared with the prior year.
Investors have also balked at Beijing’s sweeping crackdown on private enterprise, which began in late 2020 and has included fining foreign companies and detaining their employees in the name of national security.

In his January 16 speech, Li tried to reassure international investors that China presented “not a risk but an opportunity” and pledged to create a “world-class” environment for foreign companies to do business in the country.
He noted that the number of people classed as middle-income in China is expected to double to 800 million over the next decade. “The momentum for consumption … is very strong,” he said.
“Investors who willingly take on exposure to the precarious situation in China need to know the risks or may find themselves at the mercy of an unpredictable and authoritarian financial landscape,” Stephen Innes, managing﻿ partner of SPI Asset Management, wrote in a Friday note.
“Success is contingent on buying shares that avoid government scrutiny, making the entire investment process more akin to a game of chance than an informed decision-making process.”"
FMDBBGGH47_91FMJ9JLUP4YF0G,Colorado voters emphasize January 6 violence as they urge Supreme Court to keep Trump off the ballot,"By Joan Biskupic, Devan Cole and Marshall Cohen, CNN","4 minute read Updated 12:57 PM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/26/politics/colorado-trump-supreme-court-filing/,"The Colorado voters trying to disqualify Donald Trump from the state ballot told the Supreme Court on Friday that the violence the former president provoked on January 6, 2021, qualifies as an insurrection under the terms of the Constitution and bars him from holding future office.
Lawyers for the group of voters filed their brief several days before their deadline of next week, seeking to forcefully respond to Trump’s legal arguments that the President is excluded from the disputed section of the 14th Amendment.
Related article The conservative legal world lines up behind Donald Trump at the Supreme Court
“The most violent attack on our nation’s Capitol since the War of 1812 — an attack which obstructed the peaceful transfer of presidential power for the first time in American history — meets any plausible definition of ‘insurrection against the Constitution,’” the challengers wrote.
Specifically responding to Trump’s leading argument in his brief filed last week, that the president is not an “officer” under the terms of the Constitution, the voters’ lawyers wrote, “Section 3 does not give a free pass to insurrectionist Presidents; they are ‘officers’ because they hold an ‘office.’ And states’ broad authority to regulate presidential elections allows them to exclude constitutionally ineligible candidates from the ballot.”
Section 3 bars certain elected officials, including an “officer of the United States,” from holding “any office” in the future if they have “engaged in insurrection” or aided a rebellion.
In the early pages of their 60-page filing, they also countered Trump lawyers’ warning of the “bedlam” that could follow if the justices were to allow states to block his name from upcoming primary ballots.
“He not-so-subtly threatens ‘bedlam’ if he is not on the ballot,” the lawyers, led by Jason Murray, wrote. “But we already saw the ‘bedlam’ Trump unleashed when he was on the ballot and lost. Section 3 is designed precisely to avoid giving oath-breaking insurrectionists like Trump the power to unleash such mayhem again.”
The challengers also largely reframed the case toward Trump’s “insurrectionist” actions. They showed the justices photos from January 6 and Trump tweets, as they described how Trump “incited a violent mob” that injured more than 140 police officers and forced lawmakers to “flee for their lives.”
Related article Trump is already flexing strongman power in the GOP
Among the photos incorporated was the image of US Capitol Police Officer Daniel Hodges writhing in pain while being squished in a Capitol doorway. He testified in-person at the Colorado disqualification trial about his experience on January 6, including the wounds he suffered during the hours-long battle at the Lower West Terrace of the Capitol.
The voters’ lawyers wrote that the mob “infiltrated the (US Capitol) building through shattered windows” and “erected gallows” outside, while chanting “Hang Mike Pence.” They noted that video of the day was on file at the court.
The challengers said Trump zeroed in on January 6 after his election-related lawsuits failed, “including in this Court.” That reference was to his ill-fated and short-lived Supreme Court case in December 2020 – Texas v. Pennsylvania – which sought to throw out Joe Biden’s legitimate victories in several battleground states.
Oral arguments in the Colorado case are scheduled for February 8.
The Supreme Court agreed earlier this month to hear the case of Trump v. Anderson, accepting the former president’s appeal of the Colorado Supreme Court decision that removed him from that state’s ballot.
Returning repeatedly to Trump’s conduct, the challengers in their brief even compared Trump to a “mob boss” while arguing that his fiery words at the January 6 rally at the Ellipse weren’t protected by the First Amendment.
“The idea that Trump’s words were unlikely to incite imminent lawlessness, even though Trump intended them to do so and even though they in fact did so, fails even the most forgiving of red-face tests,” the challengers wrote. “For obvious reasons, the First Amendment does not protect mob bosses who deliberately incite violence through thinly veiled language they know their audience will understand.”
Trump’s lawyers claim his speech was shielded by longstanding First Amendment precedents because it wasn’t trying to incite imminent violence. The Colorado trial judge disagreed, and her findings were upheld by Colorado’s high court, which concluded that he “intended that his speech would result in the use of violence.”"

In fact, the pair hinted that they’re dating each other during Monday’s episode of Hudson’s talk show “The Jennifer Hudson Show,” where Common appeared – armed with a large floral bouquet – as one of her guests.
“I’m a host, so I have to ask you this question,” Hudson said, going on to ask, “Are you dating anyone?”
Without naming names, he said that he’s in a relationship with “one of the most beautiful people I ever met in my life.”
“She’s smart, she loves God, she got something real down to earth about her. But I set my standard kind of high because she had to have an EGOT, she had to win an Oscar on her first movie… she had to get her own talk show,” Common teased.
As a reminder, Hudson earned her coveted EGOT status in 2022. She also won a best supporting actress Oscar in 2007 for her role in “Dreamgirls,” her first feature film, and she hosts her own talk show. Seems pretty obvious who he’s talking about.
Hudson went on to say that she, too, is dating someone that she’s “very happy” with.
The pair have been romantically linked since they were seen holding hands together in New York in November. Days later, Hudson told Gayle King during an appearance on “CBS This Morning” that she’s in a relationship, but stopped short of revealing with who.
“This relationship is a happy place for me,” Common said on Monday. “We keep it private but I want to acknowledge how wonderful she is.”
“I feel that same way about my partner,” Hudson said, with a wink."

The 75-year-old monarch was admitted to a London hospital on Friday morning for a “scheduled treatment,” Buckingham Palace said earlier in a statement.
“His Majesty would like to thank all those who have sent their good wishes over the past week and is delighted to learn that his diagnosis is having a positive impact on public health awareness,” it added.
The palace revealed on January 17 that the king was set to undergo treatment “in common with thousands of men each year” and that his condition was “benign.”
Charles arrived at The London Clinic, a private hospital near Regent’s Park, accompanied by his wife, Queen Camilla. The move was seen as unusual as the late Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip always went into hospital by themselves.
Camilla was seen leaving the hospital several hours later on Friday afternoon. As made her way to the car, well-wishers could be heard calling out, “We love you.”
The London Clinic is where Catherine, Princess of Wales remains following her abdominal surgery last week. The king visited his daughter-in-law before he went for his own treatment, a royal source told CNN.

Charles will postpone engagements for a short period while he recuperates. It was not immediately clear how long the monarch would remain in hospital.
Queen Camilla has been reassuring the public about her husband’s health during engagements over the past week, saying while in Swindon, southwest England on Monday that he was “fine,” and that he was “looking forward to getting back to work” during an art gallery visit in Aberdeen, Scotland last Thursday.
Specific medical conditions of members of the royal family are rarely divulged publicly. The palace’s perspective is that they are entitled to some level of medical privacy despite their positions as public servants.
But the king made a rare intervention and opted to share his diagnosis as he was keen to encourage other men who may be experiencing symptoms to get checked, a royal source previously told CNN.
And it would appear his approach worked. There was a surge in men seeing if they are at risk of prostate cancer, according to figures from NHS England.

Visits to its “enlarged prostate” webpage - which provides information on causes, symptoms and treatment options - saw traffic surge more than 1,000% above its daily average after the palace’s announcement.
It received 16,410 visits on the day of the announcement, compared to 1,414 visits the day before, according to the organization.
Prostate Cancer UK also said the number of individuals using its online risk checker had jumped 97%. The charity praised the monarch “for his openness that’ll inevitably raise more awareness about the condition.”
In an unprecedented double royal health shock, news of Charles’ procedure was revealed on January 17, only 90 minutes after Kensington Palace separately announced that the Princess of Wales was in hospital.
Kate, 42, is not expected to return to her royal duties until after Easter. Her husband, Prince William has also temporarily stepped away from engagements to juggle supporting Kate’s recovery and childcare.

The royal family’s health woes continued days later as Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York revealed she was also recently diagnosed with skin cancer.
Ferguson, the ex-wife of Prince Andrew, said she was “in good spirits and grateful for the many messages of love and support” following her second cancer diagnosis since the summer.
“I have been taking some time to myself,” she wrote on Instagram on Monday. “Naturally another cancer diagnosis has been a shock.”
The duchess underwent a mastectomy in June last year, followed by reconstructive surgery. Several moles were removed and analyzed at the time of her surgery, the UK Press Association reported Sunday, citing Ferguson’s spokesperson.

FRKUCM9CRY_8Z9KK7WUIFGV9KN,Alaska Airlines CEO says company found loose bolts on ‘many’ Boeing Max 9s,"By Ramishah Maruf, Pete Muntean and Gregory Wallace, CNN","3 minute read Updated 8:50 PM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/23/business/alaska-airlines-ceo-boeing-max-9-loose-bolts/,"Alaska Airlines CEO Ben Minicucci revealed the carrier found “some loose bolts on many” Boeing 737 Max 9s in an interview for “NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt” on Tuesday.
It was the CEO’s first interview since a door plug on one of its Max 9 airplanes shot out from the side of the fuselage only a few minutes into a flight from Portland, Oregon, to Ontario, California, forcing the pilot to make an emergency landing.
“I’m more than frustrated and disappointed. I am angry. This happened to Alaska Airlines. It happened to our guests and happened to our people,” Minicucci said, according to excerpts released ahead of the interview’s airing.
“Boeing is better than this. Flight 1282 should never have happened,” Minicucci said during the interview.
Boeing’s 737 factory will have what the company calls a “quality stand down” at its Renton, Washington facility Thursday, the company announced Tuesday.
“During the session, production, delivery and support teams will pause for a day so employees can take part in working sessions focused on quality. This is part of the immediate quality actions recently shared by Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stan Deal,” the company said in a statement.
The internal notice Boeing sent to its employees indicates that the 737 stand down is the first of several that it will hold at its facilities.
NBC asked Minicucci if Boeing has a problem with quality control extending beyond a single plane.
“I think this is the issue that’s at question right here, which is what is Boeing going to do differently on their quality program, to make sure that when we get an airplane, it’s at the highest degree of excellence and that’s what’s got to be different going forward,” he said.
He added that the company is adding its own extra oversight on the airplane maker’s production line.
The US Federal Aviation Administration urged airlines on Sunday to inspect so-called door plugs on an earlier version of Boeing 737 airplanes. After recent inspections of the newer Max 9s, United Airlines and Alaska Airlines have found loose bolts.
FAA opened a formal investigation into Boeing’s quality control around two weeks ago. The agency said it continued to review data collected from inspections of 40 sample aircraft as it considered how to determine if the planes were safe to fly again.
Minicucci noted in the interview that the inspections take about 10 hours per door.
In a statement, Stan Deal, the CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said: “We have let down our airline customers and are deeply sorry for the significant disruption to them, their employees and their passengers. We are taking action on a comprehensive plan to bring these airplanes safely back to service and to improve our quality and delivery performance. We will follow the lead of the FAA and support our customers every step of the way.”
The CEO of United Airlines, one of the biggest buyers of Boeing jets, also expressed frustration with the company.
“I’m disappointed that… this keeps happening at Boeing. This isn’t new,” said Scott Kirby, CEO of United, in an interview Tuesday on CNBC. “We need Boeing to succeed. But they’ve been having these consistent manufacturing challenges. They need to take action here.”
NBC said Minicucci told the network Alaska Airlines would continue to fly an all-Boeing fleet.
In contrast, United appeared more unsure about its relationship with Boeing.
United has 79 of the Max 9s, more than any other airline, and had originally scheduled nearly 8,000 flights with the plane for this month before the incident, according to Cirium, an aviation analytics firm. Boeing’s future is uncertain regarding orders for the 737 Max 10, a newer, larger version and more expensive version of the 737 Max that has yet to be certified by the FAA.
“I think the Max 9 grounding is probably the straw that broke the camel’s back for us,” said Kirby. “We’re going to build a plan that doesn’t have the Max 10 in it.”

FTUJX64QG6_RG5R7AYJWZOGFSC,Opinion: Three ways to help millennials overcome the cost of living crisis,Opinion by Jill Filipovic,"8 minute read Published 2:26 PM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/22/opinions/millennials-cost-of-living-crisis-filipovic/,"Editor’s Note: Jill Filipovic is a journalist based in New York and author of the book “OK Boomer, Let’s Talk: How My Generation Got Left Behind.” Follow her on Twitter. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely her own. View more opinion on CNN.
Millennials, as you’ve have probably heard, have gotten pretty screwed.
By some accounts, we’re the most educated generation in American history, but also underwater with educational debt. We haven’t amassed the kind of wealth our parents had at our age, and it’s unclear whether we’ll ever catch up. We’ve been slower to purchase homes in part because Baby Boomers won’t sell theirs, and so we’re throwing our hard-earned cash away on skyrocketing rents, which in turn puts saving for a 20% down payment further out of reach. We’re so financially stressed that we can’t afford to have kids, and by staying childless we’re breaking our Boomer parents’ hearts.
I wrote an entire book on the plight of Millennials, on the many advantages Boomers enjoyed and then hoarded for themselves, and what Boomers and Millennials alike don’t understand about each other. There is much doom and gloom to be found in nearly all of the reporting about Millennial life, and things aren’t looking much better for Gen Z and younger generations. But there are also tremendous opportunities. American Boomers enjoyed unprecedented wealth and opportunity not just out of sheer luck or even sheer numbers, but because the government made unprecedented investments in them: in their education, in their health, in their ability to live independently.
Our country could do the same for Millennials. It may, frankly, be too little, too late for many of us. But it could ensure that the Millennial generation is an unfortunate aberration, and that future generations return to a path of prosperity and upward mobility.
The “how to fix it” list could itself fill an entire book. But here are three priorities:
One of the more troubling shifts of the past American decade has been the broad loss of faith in higher education. While 74% of young adults a decade ago agreed that a college degree is very important, only 41% say the same today. Nearly half of Gen Zers say that a high school diploma or GED is sufficient to ensure financial security. And they were the least likely among generations to say that colleges and universities are having a positive effect “on the way things are going in this country today.”
Perhaps unsurprisingly, a smaller proportion of high schoolers are continuing on to college. It’s a decline not seen around the rest of the developed world, where higher education is expanding. At its core, this uniquely American rejection of higher education seems to be about value: Given all we’ve heard about how even well-educated Millennials struggle financially, the price tag on a degree in the US just doesn’t seem worth it.
The truth is, of course, more complicated. A college degree does mean, on average, significantly better wages, and graduates of elite universities do best of all. Those higher wages, though, can be offset by debt. And people who take out loans to go to college but don’t graduate see the worst of both worlds: lower wages and higher debt.
Related article What broke the American Dream for Millennials
Jobs that require a college degree are also likely to remain higher-paying, while those that do not seem to be in a race to the wage bottom. Life for Americans without a college degree has become more perilous by a range of measures: This is the group most likely to perish from “deaths of despair” and to live in communities rife with alcoholism, substance abuse and financial struggle. And American economic growth and global competitiveness both require a workforce with plenty of college graduates.
This is not a problem that one-time student loan forgiveness is going to solve. We need massive state and federal investment in education: in higher education, to make college much more affordable, and in K-12 education, to ensure that where a child grows up doesn’t limit her prospects for college and beyond. The federal government needs to regulate the student loan industry and end the proliferation of predatory and exploitative for-profit educational institutions. Not every student needs to go to an Ivy League school, but every student should have access to an affordable, high-quality four-year education near their homes.
This is largely a solved problem across Europe. We could make it happen here in the US, too. Doing so would benefit young adults, of course, who could graduate without the weight of five- or six-figure debt weighing them down from the start. But it would also benefit the nation as a whole, equipping us with a more sophisticated workforce better prepared for the technological evolutions of the coming decades.
From my vantage point, the single highest barrier to Millennial economic stability is child care. Millennials are now squarely within childbearing age, and while many of us are forgoing children, most of us are or will be parents – but we’re having fewer children than women of previous generations, and we’re having them later. The reasons behind that are complex, but cost is certainly among them: The United States has some of the highest child care costs in the world.
And that isn’t because American kids are getting better-than-average care; it’s because our government simply doesn’t invest in it. The US government spends, on average, $500 per child per year on early childhood care costs. The average spent among OECD countries is $14,436.
Affordable, high-quality, universal child care helps mothers, and particularly low-income mothers, to stay in the workforce, which pays dividends for their families. Child care programs help to prepare kids for school and may keep them more active and socially engaged. As it stands, screens have become a stopgap measure for poor families, with kids in low-income households spending many more hours looking at them than kids in more affluent ones – something that was exacerbated during the pandemic.
Related article Boomers won’t part with their homes, and that’s a problem for young families
Social conservatives often prefer that mothers leave the labor force and stay home with their children, which is one reason there has been such broad resistance to universal child care on the American right. The demand that women stay home seems to be based more on nostalgia and gender traditionalism than evidence, of which there’s plenty, that working mothers bring significant benefits to their children, to themselves and to national economies.
The reality, for many American families, isn’t a well-paid dad who can support a family on a single income and a mom whose primary aspiration is to dedicate herself to raising children, were it not for manipulative feminists and scheming liberals who pressure her into the workforce. Much more often, reality is a complicated mix of mothers who want many sources of purpose and gratification, as well as the freedom and pride that financial independence brings; couples who need two incomes in order to raise their children in financial stability; and single moms who are the only person bringing home the bacon.
All of these groups would benefit hugely from free or affordable child care. It would radically decrease the stress American parents live under, it would enable parents to provide a higher standard of living for their children and it would give children a leg up.
It might also make having a child, or having an additional child, feel possible for a greater number of young people.
America’s housing system is broken, and not just because so many Millennials can’t afford homes. Millennials drove re-urbanization as many of us graduated college and moved to cities instead of returning to the small towns or suburban enclaves in which we were raised. But those cities simply don’t have enough housing units, especially affordable rentals for low-income people or starter homes (and even starter apartments) for those taking a big step into adult life. This housing shortage has expanded out into the suburbs and even rural areas.
This wasn’t the case for Boomers, in large part because the government invested in a massive expansion of housing stock during their early years. The federal government could do the same now, expanding tax credits and voucher programs. Cities could embrace growth and build, and tax homeowners who do not live in or rent out their units. States could expand aid to first-time homebuyers, ideally lowering closing costs for real estate purchases and making that so-hard-to-amass 20% down payment more doable.

And this is very pie-in-the-sky, but the US is far overdue for a total overhaul in property taxation. We are vastly over-reliant on property taxes for government revenue, which poses a big problem for homeowners who are just scraping by, as well as for retirees who may have paid off their homes but still owe a hefty tax bill every year. Property tax costs are inevitably passed down to renters, who also wind up paying more. And local property taxes, in turn, contribute to wildly unequal funding schemes for public schools, the outcome of which is that the kids in the richest enclaves also enjoy the best public educations — better-paid teachers, nicer facilities, smaller classes, updated textbooks, advanced science equipment, college and mental health counselors — while kids in poorer areas receive far less investment and far fewer educational resources.
This, too, hurts young families, who may spend beyond their means to get their kids in to a decent school district, or who see their children’s opportunities drastically diminished simply because a parent doesn’t make enough to move to a tony neighborhood. And it hurts children, who are, after all, future adults, keeping those who already come from challenging backgrounds at an even greater disadvantage, while giving the best-off an additional leg up. That’s fuel for growing inequality, and a compounding of the problems Millennials face for future generations.
There is much more than should be — could be, must be — done to help Millennials and the generations after us achieve the American dream (or at least financial stability). But there’s no time to waste. The oldest Millennials are in our early 40s, and the window to improve our future is rapidly narrowing. We may indeed wind up left behind. But the US can also refuse to repeat these mistakes and instead choose to invest in something better for the generations that come next."
FVLZIRDHYZ_F0DVANF8I5Z23H3,6 things to watch in New Hampshire’s presidential primary,"By Eric Bradner and Gregory Krieg, CNN","8 minute read Published 4:00 AM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/23/politics/what-to-watch-new-hampshire-primary/,"It’s now a two-person race for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination — and if former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley doesn’t defeat former President Donald Trump in New Hampshire’s primary on Tuesday, the fight may be over.
With Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis exiting the race Sunday, Haley now has the one-on-one shot at Trump that eluded his rivals in the 2016 GOP primary.
And it’s up to Republican primary voters in the Granite State — where Trump’s big win eight years ago began his road to dominance of a party he has since reshaped in his image — to decide whether they’ll stick with the former president for a third consecutive election.
New Hampshire, where independents play an outsize role in the GOP primary and where the popular governor, Chris Sununu, has been her top campaign surrogate, could be Haley’s only shot at delivering a political earthquake in the Republican race.
Another big Trump win, though, might effectively end the Republican primary after only two states, and tee up a general election rematch between Trump and President Joe Biden.
Here are six things to watch in the New Hampshire primary:
Haley’s campaign has for months focused on New Hampshire, identifying its more moderate electorate as her best shot of winning one of the four states — Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina — that kick off the GOP’s presidential nominating contest.
That’s fueled in part by the state allowing “undeclared” voters — those without a party affiliation — to vote in primaries. Undeclared voters make up a plurality of New Hampshire’s overall electorate.
Related article Why DeSantis’ departure isn’t likely to change the dynamic between Trump and Haley
For Haley, polls — including national and early-state surveys and CNN’s entrance poll in Iowa — have long found that she appeals most to moderates and Republicans eager to move on from Trump.
She’s also been helped by the endorsement of Sununu, himself one of the most prominent anti-Trump voices within the Republican Party. (A home-state gubernatorial endorsement has its limits: DeSantis had the support of Iowa’s Kim Reynolds and still flopped.)
Sununu, in an NBC News interview Sunday, sought to tamp down expectations for a Haley win, arguing that it won’t be critical for Haley to win primary contests until the slate of Super Tuesday primaries in early March.
“I’ve always said you wanted a one-on-one race going into Super Tuesday,” he said. “I think Super Tuesday is probably where you actually have to start winning states.”
Haley said Sunday she would “absolutely” remain in the Republican presidential race through South Carolina’s February 24 primary.
“South Carolinians know I won that state twice. They know I’m a fighter. They know I’m gonna go all the way through,” she said. “I’m also an accountant. So we saved a lot of our dollars to make sure we could be strong in South Carolina.”
Her campaign on Sunday announced plans for its first event in South Carolina after New Hampshire’s primary — a Wednesday evening gathering in North Charleston.
However, presidential candidates rarely admit that the end is near. DeSantis, after all, said he was in the GOP race for the “long haul” a week ago.

If Trump wins, he would make history: In modern presidential campaign history — since the Iowa caucuses began serving as the official kickoff, followed by the New Hampshire primary — no non-incumbent Republican has won both states.
And in doing so, he would make it much tougher for Haley to convince donors to pour money into her campaign and voters to stick with her for the month until the South Carolina primary. She’ll miss her only shot at another win before then because Haley filed to run in Nevada’s state-run primary, instead of competing in the state GOP-run caucuses. Delegates are awarded through the Nevada caucuses.
Some in the party are already eager to see the nominating race reach its end eight days after it started.
Montana Sen. Steve Daines, the chairman of the Senate GOP campaign arm, said Sunday on social media: “Donald Trump is the presumptive nominee. I am encouraging every Republican to unite behind him because it will take all of us to defeat Joe Biden, take back the Senate, and hold the House.”
Recent departures from the 2024 race have already shaped the New Hampshire Republican primary.
The exit of former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who consistently polled in the low double digits in the Granite State, likely benefited Haley, who has similarly tapped into a segment of the electorate dissatisfied with Trump.
Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy’s exit, meanwhile, has likely boosted Trump, coming with an full-throated endorsement from the Ohio businessman on the night of the Iowa caucuses.

DeSantis’ exit Sunday was the latest to shake up the race. And while the Florida governor had little support in New Hampshire, even small movements can prove determinative if the race is much closer than polls suggest it will be.
Trump held 50% support among likely Republican primary voters in the Granite State, with Haley at 39% and DeSantis at 6%, according to a new CNN poll conducted by the University of New Hampshire that was released Sunday before DeSantis’ exit.
And when DeSantis’s supporters are reallocated to their second-choice candidates, Trump leads Haley by a wider 54% to 41% margin. Another 3% of likely GOP primary voters say they’d vote for someone else.
Trump on Sunday night noted his former rivals’ endorsements.
“Vivek just came with us and now Ron just came with us. They’re all coming with us,” Trump said at a campaign event in Rochester, New Hampshire.
Haley, who was Trump’s US ambassador to the United Nations, has in recent days escalated her attacks on her onetime boss — deploying against Trump the same tactic he has used against Biden.
In Derry, New Hampshire, on Sunday, Haley again mentioned Trump’s gaffe Friday night in which he appeared to confuse her with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
“Trump goes on and on multiple times, saying that I prevented the security on January 6 at the Capitol. I wasn’t even anywhere near the Capitol. … The reality is he was confused. He was confused the same way he said Joe Biden was going to start World War II,” she said, referring to another Trump verbal miscue from a September 2023 speech.

Haley also brought up Trump’s claim that he beat former President Barack Obama, not Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, in 2016.
“These things happen because the more you age, it just does — you have declined. Look at Joe Biden, he’s totally different now than he was two years ago. That’s a fact. It’s what happens,” Haley said.
She told CNN after a stop in Seabrook, New Hampshire, on Sunday that she sees Trump and Biden as “equally bad” options.
“If either one of them was good, I wouldn’t be running. Yes, they are equally bad. That’s why I’m running,” she said. “I don’t think we need to have two 80-year-olds sitting in the White House when we basically got to make sure that we can handle the war situation that we’re in. We need to know they’re at the top of their game.”
Tuesday’s result will test whether Haley’s approach — a line of attack no other Republican took against Trump in this election cycle — was effective.
Top Trump campaign aides Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles sent reporters a memo Sunday saying that Haley must win New Hampshire’s primary — citing past comments from Haley and her supporters, including Sununu, predicting her victory.
LaCivita and Wiles said that if Haley does not win Tuesday, she has two options: Either she “drops out, unites behind President Trump, and commits to defeating Joe Biden,” or she “prepares to be absolutely DEMOLISHED and EMBARASSED in her home state of South Carolina.”
“Choose wisely,” they said.
Should Haley lose, how she handles her election night remarks and  any next moves she announces are going to be closely monitored.  Does she see Trump as the all-but-certain nominee?  Does she have her eyes already on 2028, when Trump would either be a second-term incumbent ineligible to run for office again or an 82-year-old who’d have lost two consecutive general elections?
For her part, Haley insisted Monday on Fox News that she’ll continue in the race, no matter the outcome of the New Hampshire primary.
“I know the political class wants to say that this race is over, and I know that the political class is saying everybody has to get behind Trump. This is not a coronation,” Haley said, when asked about her viability in the race. “A democracy is about giving people options.”
“We’re going to go on into South Carolina, and we’re going to be strong,” she said.
The Democrats will also be holding a primary on Tuesday – or, more accurately, the state of New Hampshire will conduct a vote that the national Democratic Party, because it changed its primary calendar to make South Carolina the first official contest, has said will not count toward its nomination process. The winner here will not receive any delegates.

For that reason, along with the fact that he spearheaded the move to change the order of the early primaries, Biden will not appear on the ballot. The Democratic National Committee has called the vote “meaningless” and has urged presidential candidates to “take all steps possible not to participate.” (Most ignored this warning and some familiar names, like author Marianne Williamson and Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips, are on the ballot. Neither are expected to fare well.)
And yet, the Biden camp will surely be watching how the president performs as a write-in candidate. Biden allies launched a low-profile effort to get Democrats to come to the polls to put pen to paper in support of him. But how many voters will bother?
Polls suggest Democratic enthusiasm for Biden is modest, at best, but a strong turnout for the president – with voters having the added onus of needing to write him in – could inject some new confidence into his reelection operation. On the flip side, a meager showing could confirm the intraparty worries."

Hockney, 86, painted “California,” showing two naked figures in an outdoor swimming pool, in 1965 after his first trip to Los Angeles and it has been held in a private collection since 1968.
The painting, last seen in public in 1979, is a highlight of auction house Christie’s “20th/21st Century: London Evening Sale” on March 7. It is listed with “a price on request,” with an estimate in the region of £16 million ($20.37 million).
“This is one of the earliest examples (of Hockney’s pool paintings),” Tessa Lord, a senior specialist and director of the post-war contemporary department at Christie’s London, told Reuters at a press preview on Thursday.
In 2018, Hockney’s 1972 piece “Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)” sold for $90.3 million, setting a then record for the highest price ever paid at auction for a work by a living artist.
“There is a lot of crossover between the two works but also we’ve seen since that world record price in 2018 a real broadening of the market for David Hockney,” Lord said.

“We have sold works from the Paul Allen estate over the past few years, which in particular shone a light on his later practice, his landscapes and what we’re coming to feel is a real international recognition amongst collectors of Hockney’s contribution to 20th and 21st century art, and a real drive to seek out the best examples of his practice.”
“California” will go on a touring exhibition to Paris and New York next month before returning to London to go on public view before the sale."

“There can be no compromise on territorial integrity, neither for Ukraine, nor for Slovakia, nor for any other country,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Oleh Nikolenko wrote on Facebook.
“Let’s be honest: if Ukraine is not secure, there will be no security, neither in Slovakia nor in Europe in general.”
In an interview with Slovak radio over the weekend, Fico offered a direct challenge to that idea, and the core position of most of his partners in the European Union.
Speaking just days ahead of a scheduled visit to Ukraine, Fico told the public broadcaster both Kyiv and Moscow would need to make painful compromises to bring the war to an end. For Ukraine, that meant accepting at least some of Russia’s gains.

“What are they expecting? That Russia will leave Donbas and Luhansk? Or that they will leave Crimea? No, that’s completely unrealistic. Everybody knows that,” Fico continued.
The Donbas and Luhansk are territories in eastern Ukraine, over parts of which Russia gained control in 2014, and from where it has expanded its territorial gains since launching its full-scale invasion in 2022. Crimea was also captured, and annexed, in 2014.
Widely seen as a pro-Kremlin figure, Fico won election in October, having run on a promise that he would block further military support for Ukraine - which he told the radio interviewer had been under the “total control of the United States” since 2014, when Ukrainians overthrew their pro-Moscow president Viktor Yanukovich.
In the European Union, he is closely aligned with Hungary’s Victor Orban and has been very open about his intentions to block Ukraine’s bid to join the EU and NATO. That blunt message would be repeated when he meets his Ukrainian counterpart, Denys Shmyhal, on Wednesday in the border town of Uzhhorod, he said.
“I will tell him that I am completely against Ukraine’s NATO membership and that I will veto it, because the only thing that would lead to is a Third World War.”
In a reversal of the policy of his predecessor, which saw Ukraine receive an air defense system and fighter jets from Slovakia, as well as other military aid, Fico also promised to tell his Ukrainian host that “he will not be getting any weapons from the Slovak Army” or from “Slovakia’s state stockpiles.”
Instead, he says he would bring an “offer of humanitarian help.”
Shmyhal’s office has not responded to a CNN enquiry about whether the visit will still go ahead.

Bringing a very different sort of message Monday to Ukraine was Poland’s new Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv.
The two leaders discussed possible joint arms production, as well as what Zelensky referred to in a statement from his office as “a new form of our cooperation – aimed at a larger scale of arms purchases for Ukrainian needs,” though no further details were given.
Tusk told his host Poland would try to help Ukraine’s accession to the EU, “so that Ukraine’s full membership in the European Union becomes a fact as soon as possible.”
The two men also expressed confidence that they could achieve lasting solutions to disputes over Ukrainian grain exports and permit-free access to the European Union for Ukrainian truck drivers, which led to blockades for many weeks at border crossings between the two countries."
G3P5JMAYSY_GAGM4N6SVK6A9Z3,Turkish parliament approves Sweden’s NATO membership bid,"By Isil Sariyuce, Jessie Gretener, and Kristin Wilson, CNN","3 minute read Updated 9:48 AM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/23/europe/turkey-vote-sweden-nato-intl/,"The Turkish parliament voted Tuesday to approve Sweden’s NATO membership bid, bringing the Nordic country one step closer to joining the military alliance after months of delays.
Of the 346 members of parliament who voted, 287 were in favor of Sweden’s accession and 55 voted to reject it. Four others abstained from voting.
The vote was the second step of Turkey’s ratification process after the parliament’s Foreign Affairs Commission approved the bid last month. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan can now sign the protocol into law.
The outcome on Tuesday cleared a significant hurdle for the Nordic country’s accession into the military alliance, with Hungary now set to be the only member state that has not yet ratified Sweden’s accession.
But Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban on Wednesday told NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg that Hungary’s government supports Sweden’s bid for accession.
“I reaffirmed that the Hungarian government supports the NATO membership of Sweden,” Orban wrote on X. Stoltenberg also posted on X, saying he welcomed Orban’s “clear support” for Sweden’s membership bid.
On Tuesday, Orban said he had invited his Swedish counterpart Ulf Kristersson to visit Hungary to negotiate the terms of Sweden’s accession.
Sweden and Finland applied for NATO membership in May 2022 following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine earlier that year. Finland joined NATO in April 2023, doubling the alliance’s border with Russia, but Sweden has faced numerous delays in its path to accession.

Erdogan initially objected to Sweden’s membership bid, accusing Swedish officials of being too lenient on militant groups, including the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK). Since applying, Sweden has tightened its anti-terror legislation and agreed to work more closely with Turkey on security concerns.
Erdogan’s approval of Sweden’s accession bid also rides on a commitment by the United States, with the Turkish president signaling that he won’t sign the protocol into law unless the US approves the sale of F-16 fighter jets to Turkey.
US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chair Ben Cardin said on Tuesday that Congress, however, is waiting to see the accession documents completed before moving forward on the matter.
Following Tuesday’s Turkish parliamentary vote, Swedish Prime Minister Kristersson said Sweden was “one step closer to becoming a full member of NATO.”
The US Ambassador to Turkey Jeffry Flake reiterated the sentiment in a post on X, saying “Sweden’s accession to NATO is a critical step in strengthening the alliance” and that he “greatly appreciate the Turkish’s parliament’s decision to approve Sweden’s entry into NATO.”
The German government welcomed the outcome of the Turkish parliamentary vote. The federal government spokesperson Steffen Hebestreit said in a statement that Finland’s accession last April and Sweden’s “forthcoming accession” were a “direct reaction to the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine.”

G3QKWA2C3Y_4KM8UZ8PGC2NBEQ,Biden’s top White House advisers will move to campaign,"By MJ Lee, Jeff Zeleny, Edward-Isaac Dovere and Arlette Saenz, CNN","4 minute read Published 10:38 PM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/23/politics/jen-omalley-dillon-will-move-over-to-biden-campaign-sooner-than-expected/,"President Joe Biden’s campaign is preparing to make a full pivot to the general election with some of the president’s top advisers in the West Wing set to move over to the reelection campaign, as it watches former President Donald Trump’s quick consolidation of the GOP primary.
Biden’s 2020 campaign manager, Jen O’Malley Dillon, will transition to his reelection efforts as campaign chair, according to a senior Biden adviser. Her departure from the White House could come sooner than previously thought, another senior Biden adviser told CNN, because of what the Biden campaign sees as Trump’s quick move to the Republican nomination.
O’Malley Dillon has served as White House deputy chief of staff since Biden’s inauguration.
According to the adviser, another top Biden White House adviser who is in the president’s inner-most circle of aides, Mike Donilon, will also move over to the campaign, becoming its chief strategist. Donilon will be focused on the campaign’s messaging and paid media strategies, campaign officials said.
The moves, set to take place in the “coming weeks” per campaign officials, clearly signal that the Biden campaign is already in general election mode.
“This is the time when the campaign needs to have all hands on deck,” one senior Biden adviser said.
In a statement, Biden praised O’Malley Dillon for leading his “winning campaign in the midst of a historically challenging environment” in 2020 and argued, “no one knows my voice and values better” than Donilon.
“I’m thankful to Mike and Jen both for their service in the White House these last three years, and I am grateful that in rejoining the campaign, they are stepping up one more time to ensure we finish the job for the American people,” the president said.
Shifting some West Wing staff to Biden’s 2024 headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware, has been under discussion for weeks. It is intentionally designed to quiet the concern from leading Democrats – including those in former President Barack Obama’s orbit – that the campaign has not adequately prepared for the fight ahead, one senior Democratic adviser said.
They will work in conjunction with Julie Chavez Rodriguez, who will remain campaign manager, the officials said.
“Mike and Jen were essential members of the senior team that helped President Biden and Vice President Harris earn the most votes in American history in 2020, and we’re thrilled to have their leadership and strategic prowess focused full-time on sending them back to the White House for four more years,” Chavez Rodriguez said in a statement.
Chavez Rodriguez, who was previously the director of the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, had been the target of private criticism of some staff in Wilmington and among leading Biden supporters beyond.
Some aides and top donors alike complained of a lack of direction and believed that top Biden advisers’ decision to choose someone for the job without previous campaign management experience demonstrated that they were not sufficiently serious about the challenges ahead for the 2024 campaign.
Chavez Rodriguez’s defenders tend to acknowledge her shortcomings in the job, but argue that she was at a disadvantage with most of Biden’s inner circle in the West Wing, who have to date retained control of all significant decisions for the campaign at the expense of not empowering the person with the title of being in charge.
That includes O’Malley Dillon, who, despite telling many privately she had no interest in another stint as Biden campaign manager, was guiding decisions about strategy and operations in addition to her duties in the White House.
According to a senior Biden adviser, it is also possible that Anita Dunn, one of Biden’s closest advisers, would eventually move over to the campaign. But that would not happen imminently, they said.
Trump has largely consolidated the GOP primary field in the first two nominating contests, something the Biden campaign had long planned for and viewed as an eventuality. The current president remains wracked with low approval ratings and polling in key battleground states reflects a tight potential rematch with his predecessor.
O’Malley Dillon will be among those working to change minds as voters begin to tune in. As CNN first reported earlier this month, the Biden campaign’s internal research shows that most of the undecided voters that the campaign is targeting – nearly three-in-four of them – do not appear to believe that Trump is likely to be the Republican presidential nominee.
These moves, a source familiar said, will coincide with Biden spending increasingly more time on the campaign trail as he looks ahead to the general election.
He held his first joint rally alongside Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday with a focus on abortion rights in Northern Virginia, and on Wednesday, he is set to appear alongside the United Auto Workers as the union’s elusive endorsement is looming. He travels to battleground Wisconsin ahead of a weekend trip to South Carolina, where the first Democratic primary of the cycle will be underway on February 3.

G3U2WA35SM_X0YVRI0E9EQZ3QH,Biden administration moves to increase assistance to Ecuador amid concerns over the deteriorating situation,"By Priscilla Alvarez, CNN","3 minute read Published 5:06 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/25/politics/us-ecuador-biden-administration-assistance/,"The Biden administration plans to increase assistance to Ecuador amid growing concerns over the deteriorating security situation in the country, ranging from equipment to deploying personnel, according to a senior administration official.
The scale of US assistance to Ecuador underscores the urgency and concern within the Biden administration over the unfolding situation in the country, where gangs have terrorized the population, as well as the growing power of criminal enterprises.
Ecuador, once known as the region’s “Island of Peace,” is nestled between two of the world’s largest cocaine producers, Peru and Colombia, and its deep ports have made it a key transit point for cocaine making its way to consumers in the United States and Europe. Its dollarized economy has also made it a strategic location for traffickers seeking to launder money.
Experts warn that Ecuador’s terror groups are aligned with a wider criminal network, including the notorious Sinaloa Cartel out of Mexico, complicating President Daniel Noboa’s attempts to “neutralize” criminal groups operating within his borders – and as a result, gripping the country, and its armed forces, in fear.
Earlier this month, President Joe Biden asked special adviser for the Americas Christopher Dodd and Commander of the United States Southern Command Gen. Laura Richardson to go to Ecuador, assess the situation and report back, the senior administration official said.
On the heels of that trip, the White House said the US would facilitate the delivery of 20,000 bulletproof vests “and more than $1 million worth of critical security and emergency response equipment, including ambulances and defense logistic support vehicles.”
And more is on the way.
The senior administration official described a whole-of-government approach to address the situation, including regular meetings chaired by deputy Homeland Security adviser Jen Daskal with administration officials to map a way forward.
“Is there intelligence that we can provide to the Ecuadorians? FBI teams have been going down there to help. We have the DHS Homeland Security Investigations Unit … deploying personnel in a couple of days to train police and prosecutors,” the official said, adding that the Secret Service and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency are also assisting.
“We’re throwing everything at this to see what it is in the next 30 days we can do to control the situation,” the official added, stressing that in addition to equipment and personnel, officials are also focused on helping bolster the economy.
Speaking to CNN’s Christiane Amanpour, Noboa said the country “would gladly accept cooperation from the US. We need equipment, we need weapons, we need intelligence and I think that this is a global problem. It’s not only in Ecuador, this is a problem that goes beyond borders.”
The senior administration official cited the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and lingering policy effects of the ex-president of Ecuador Rafael Correa as factors in what’s currently happening in the country.
The situation is alarming for officials not only because Ecuador has been a partner to the US but also because of the criminal enterprises at work and concerns that it will push people to flee and migrate to the US southern border.
“I think this should validate that what we’re dealing with is not a migration challenge at our border, but rather a region that in the post-pandemic has struggled to recover economically. And countries, like Ecuador, are facing enormous security challenges,” the official said.
“When families there feel like they’re not safe, or they can’t find opportunities, they vote with their feet, and they come up here,” the official added.
The number of migrants from Ecuador arriving at the US-Mexico border has increased over time. In November, Border Patrol apprehended more than 13,000 migrants from Ecuador at the US southern border, according to the latest available data from US Customs and Border Protection.
Homeland Security officials are monitoring the Darien Gap to observe any increased flows of Ecuadorians but have not recorded an uptick as of now."
G3X4E4H1R0_WGY1CL040TV8U1X,Exclusive: Israel’s spy chief proposed Hamas leaders leave Gaza as part of broader ceasefire talks,"By Alex Marquardt, CNN","5 minute read Updated 11:04 PM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/22/politics/israel-proposal-hamas-leaders-leave-gaza/,"Israel has proposed that Hamas senior leaders could leave Gaza as part of a broader ceasefire agreement, two officials familiar with the ongoing international discussions told CNN.
The extraordinary proposal, which has not been previously reported, comes as Israel has struggled to achieve its stated goal of completely destroying Hamas. Despite its nearly four-month war in Gaza, Israel has failed to capture or kill any of Hamas’s most senior leaders in Gaza and left around 70% of Hamas’ fighting force intact, according to Israel’s own estimates.
Though it would give safe passage out of Gaza for top Hamas leaders who orchestrated the October 7 attack, draining Gaza of its leaders could weaken Hamas’ grip on the war-torn area while also allowing Israel to continue tracking down high-value targets abroad.
Senior Hamas officials are known to live in Doha, Qatar, and the Lebanese capital Beirut, among other places outside the Palestinian territories. An Israeli airstrike earlier this month killed a top Hamas commander in Beirut.
Israel’s suggestion that Hamas leaders could leave Gaza, though unlikely to be accepted by Hamas, has been discussed as part of broader ceasefire negotiations at least twice in recent weeks — once last month in Warsaw by Israel’s intelligence chief, Mossad Director David Barnea, and then again this month in Doha with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, according to one official familiar with the discussions.
It also comes amid a flurry of diplomatic activity to try to achieve an extended break in the fighting and free hostages believed to still be alive in Gaza. The White House’s top official for the Middle East, Brett McGurk, is traveling to Egypt and Qatar this week for further talks.
American and international officials familiar with the negotiations have said that Israel and Hamas’ recent engagement in talks is encouraging but that a deal doesn’t appear imminent.
Pressure is building on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to deliver some kind of resolution. The “complete victory” over Hamas that he has called for is a long way off, by his own admission. Meanwhile, anger among Israelis has grown over the inability of the government to bring home the more than 100 hostages being held in Gaza.
Israel is “not achieving their military objectives,” says Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. That, combined with the “enormous pressure” on Netanyahu and his government to bring hostages home, Miller said, has created a situation where Israel would be willing to propose having Hamas leaders leave Gaza.
“I think they’re simply bumping up against against reality,” said Miller. “And hostage families are beginning to exert tremendous influence.”
In addition, international sentiment toward Israel has soured over its continued bombardment of Gaza, which has killed more than 25,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry.
For the past two months, the Biden administration has been openly calling on Israel to transition to a lower-intensity phase of the conflict, which US officials argue has started happening, though intense operations continue in southern Gaza.
The proposal for Hamas leaders to leave Gaza was raised in Warsaw in December by Barnea, Israel’s top intelligence official when he met with US CIA Director Bill Burns and Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al Thani, who has acted as an intermediary with Hamas. The official familiar with the discussions in the meetings said it was then brought up again when Blinken was in the Qatari capital earlier this month.
In that meeting Blinken was told by al Thani that the Israeli idea “would never work,” the official said. In part because of distrust by Hamas that Israel would in fact end its operations against Hamas in Gaza even after its leadership left.
A second official, from the Middle East, was told about Israel’s proposal by the US.
The US State Department, CIA and the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office all declined to comment.
While it’s unclear whether in private discussions Israel has named which Hamas leaders they would hope to leave Gaza, there is no bigger target than Yahya Sinwar, Hamas’ top official in Gaza. Sinwar is a “dead man walking,” Netanyahu and others have said.
Sinwar spent two decades in Israeli prisons and is originally from Khan Younis in southern Gaza, where the bulk of Israel’s operations in Gaza are currently focused. Israeli and US officials have said they believe Sinwar could be hiding out in the vast, deep network of tunnels under the city, Gaza’s second biggest.
His closest confidantes and aides are Mohammed Deif, the leader of Hamas’ armed wing, along with Deif’s deputy Marwan Issa. Sinwar’s brother Mohammed is also a senior Hamas commander. None are believed to have been found or killed by Israel.
Last month Israel dropped leaflets on Gaza offering rewards of hundreds of thousands of dollars for information on the Hamas leaders, including a $400,000 reward for information on Sinwar.
“The goal is bringing down Hamas as the ruler in the Gaza Strip,” said Ofer Shelah, a senior researcher at Israel’s Institute for National Security Studies.
“There is no difference if [Sinwar] dies, or if he leaves,” Shelah said. “If he dies, then somebody could take over much in the same way. If we bring all the hostages back and Sinwar leaves, definitely that would make most people in Israel feel that we’ve won the war.”
American officials believe it is highly unlikely Sinwar and those around him would agree to leave Gaza, preferring instead to die fighting their sworn enemy.
Israel has made no secret of its intention to continue hunting Hamas leaders long after the war is over.
Netanyahu said in November he had “instructed the Mossad to act against the heads of Hamas wherever they are.” Ronen Bar, the director of Israel’s domestic security agency Shin Bet, has vowed to “eliminate Hamas” around the world, even if it takes years.
“Everywhere: in Gaza, Israel, Lebanon, Turkey, Qatar, everywhere,” Bar said in a recording aired in early December by Israel’s public broadcaster, Kan.
Sinwar could perhaps be convinced to leave, Miller argued, if Israel were to agree to an “asymmetrical” trade of many times more Palestinian prisoners held by Israel than Israeli hostages.
“I think he would only consider it in the event the Israelis also agreed to free all of the Palestinian prisoners,” Miller said.
“Whatever the Israelis agree to, Sinwar must know that they’re going to try to kill him,” he added. “Weeks, months years.”"

Still in Ukrainian hands – just – it’s enclosed on three sides by Russian troops and cannons.
Pounded by the Russians, the town itself is unrecognizable.
Concrete carcasses mark what were once the town’s tallest buildings, seemingly floating amid small hills of rubble. The cross atop the town’s church﻿, bent double by an explosion, points accusatorially at the Russian lines.
Amid the ruins, Russian and Ukrainian troops clash, preyed upon by drones and the occasional tank. Casualties are heavy on both sides but especially among the Russian attackers, who have thrown wave after human wave against the entrenched defenders.
“Meat assaults” is how one Ukrainian sniper, “Bess,” described these attacks to CNN. His callsign means demon in Ukrainian and the scene he recounts is hellish. The dead soldiers, “just lie there frozen,” the Omega Special Forces Group officer said from a house several miles behind the frontline in eastern Ukraine’s Donetsk region.
“Nobody evacuates them, nobody takes them away,” he said. “It feels like people don’t have a specific task, they just go and die.”
“Teren,” the commander of a Ukrainian drone reconnaissance unit in the town, said that even “if we can kill 40 to 70 servicemen with drones in a day, the next day they renew their forces and continue to attack.”
In 18 months of fighting around the town, he said, his pilots from the 110th Mechanized Brigade have killed at least 1,500 Russians. Still, they keep coming.
Ukrainian casualties are a closely guarded secret, but the battle has turned into an attritional slog, matching seemingly chaotic Russian attacks against the limited, but determined, resources and manpower of the Ukrainians.
In a surprise trip to Avdiivka in late December, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky described the battle for the town as an “onslaught,” adding that the battle could in many ways “determine the overall course of the war.”
Ukraine’s leaders appear conscious of the criticisms around the defense - but subsequent fall - of Bakhmut in 2023, acknowledging the obvious tensions between holding on to locations without huge strategic significance and protecting the lives of soldiers.
“Every piece of our land is precious to us,” army chief Valery Zaluzhny said, but in Avdiivka, “there is no need to do anything remotely reminiscent of a show.”
But those lives depend on weapons and arms.
On an ice-bitten January morning, the mercury idling at -22 degrees Celsius (-7.6 Fahrenheit), CNN watched another team of Omega special forces troops race to their firing position around Avdiivka.
Rushing to set up their Soviet﻿-era rocket launcher – bolted on to the back of an American pick-up - one of the men flicked the switch to launch a salvo.
Clicks – and curses – followed. Frozen solid, the rockets wouldn’t fire.
Reliant on the kit they have, not the Western hardware they crave, they know that each lost chance to fire back at Russians may cost Ukrainian lives.
A few days later, a supply truck chewed through the mud of a field around the nearby town of Marinka, bringing much-needed shells to a gun position.
But the cannon – a US-supplied M777 howitzer – is silent for much of the day, rationed to around 20 shells a day, 30 on a “good day” the gunners said. Last summer, supporting Ukraine’s failed counteroffensive, the gun crew would fire at least twice as many foreign rounds, many American-made, at the Russians, they said.
And in an artillery position 90 minutes north of Avdiivka, around the town of Bakhmut, that CNN visited, the ammunition compartment of a US-supplied Paladin howitzer sat cavernously empty. The crew had no shells to fire at all.
A delivery later in the day brought four shells but nothing that would do the Russians much harm: they were only smoke shells.
“Every shell that is suitable for the Paladin we use,” the gun commander “Skyba” told CNN, “It’s better than no shells.”
“10 to 1” is the difference between Russian and Ukrainian artillery supplies, the artillery commander in Ukraine’s 93rd mechanized Brigade told CNN.
“They use old Soviet systems,” Korsar said, “but Soviet systems can still kill.”
However, US support to Ukraine – including much-needed shells - no longer seems assured. Future aid packages are still mired in Capitol Hill squabbling, and the specter of a possible Ukraine-aid-averse Trump presidency on the horizon adds further uncertainty.
US National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby put it plainly this month: “The assistance that we provided has now ground to a halt. The attacks that the Russians are conducting are only increasing.”
But when they can put their Western weapons to use, the Ukrainians have much more to celebrate in Avdiivka.
The tip of the spear during last year’s ill-fated Ukrainian counteroffensive, the Bradley Fighting Vehicle - gifted to Ukraine by the US and designed to support infantry - is reinforcing its reputation blunting waves of Russian attacks.
Without the Bradley, “I doubt that we would be here talking with you,” crew commander “Barbie” told CNN from behind the Avdiivka frontline.
“The vehicle is a tough one,” he said. “It’s not afraid of anything.”
In video provided to CNN by another Bradley unit in the 47th mechanized brigade, a US-trained crew take on a Russian T-90 tank – one of the most powerful in Moscow’s army. Their fire disables the tank, its turret spinning uncontrollably, before an exploding drone slams into its side.
But the US-made Bradleys are in limited supply along the front.
Some 200 Bradleys were promised by the US and dozens have been damaged and destroyed in battle. Some of these will likely have been repaired and sent back to the frontlines.
Ukrainian crews, although admirers of the Bradley’s power, have also criticized its ability to weather the harsh Ukrainian winter and the state of some of the older vehicles shipped by the US.

Ukraine’s lack of firepower compared to its adversary is a common theme on the front line. “Teren” the commander of a nearby drone reconnaissance unit, said outright that Ukraine doesn’t have enough arms and equipment to win against Russia.
The Ukrainians are forced to be better pilots and more inventive with their limited resources, he said.
“At the beginning of the war, their advantage in drones was 10 times greater than ours,” he said. “At the moment, I think we are a worthy opponent in the drone format. We cover the sky around the clock.”
Observing their hunt for Russian troops from the unit’s command post, CNN saw multiple drones from his unit circling one Russian foxhole.
The powerful cameras on one drone caught two Russian soldiers desperately take aim at a weaving suicide drone, the smoke from their rifles and cigarettes billowing into the cold air. The Ukrainian drone dives into the narrow dugout behind them and explodes.
CNN does not know the fate of the men, but drone pilots in the area told CNN that they were unlikely to have survived given the number of drone units operating in the area.
Still, the Russian assaults continue, meaning holding Avdiivka is now a matter of numbers, said “Bess,” the special forces sniper.
“If there is a liter bottle, there’s no way you can fit a liter and a half in it,” he said.
To balance Russia’s superior numbers, Ukraine’s leadership – under pressure from the country’s top generals - is weighing a possible half a million extra troops to bolster the military’s ranks.
Life in Ukrainian cities away from the front appears relatively untouched by the fighting, at least on the surface. Although recruitment posters and military checkpoints dot highways and men in uniform are a regular sight, there’s little overt sign of wartime restrictions or changes to daily life. Supermarkets are full and cafes brim with customers.

But conscription is a touchy subject.
The Ukrainian president does have the power to enforce further mobilization – currently limited to those aged over 27 – but has chosen to seek parliamentary approval for it. The bill is slowly – and not without difficulty - making its way through lawmakers﻿’ scrutiny.
Zelensky has also questioned how to pay for the mobilization, with six taxpayers required to pay for the salary of each soldier in uniform, he said.
His reticence is a sign of the political sensitivities around public opinion in Ukraine, even as the country’s enemies make no secret of their violent ambitions for Kyiv.
“The existence of Ukraine is deadly for Ukrainians,” Russia’s former President Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council and one of the most hawkish Russian politicians, posted on Telegram on January 17.
“Why? The existence of an independent state on the historical Russian territories will now be a constant pretext for the resumption of combat actions,” he continued.
Back on the front line, morale among the troops with whom CNN spoke was high.
The soldiers, tired though rarely disgruntled, acknowledged that reinforcements would provide a welcome increase in their rotations off the front line.
For now, though, that remains a distant hope, as in Avdiivka the fight rages on.
“We are doing everything possible and impossible to hold this line,” Omega Special Forces officer “Sayer” told CNN.
“I don’t know what will happen next,” he said. “But Avdiivka is holding on. We are on our land. We have nothing to lose.”"

The decision from Manhattan Supreme Court Judge David Cohen represents a significant setback to Fox’s corporate leadership, including the powerful Murdoch family, who will now face more scrutiny in the litigation. Cohen already let the case proceed against Fox News — and on Wednesday, he rejected a request by Fox Corporation to throw out the claims against the parent company.
The lawsuit was filed in the wake of the 2020 election, when Fox repeatedly gave airtime to far-right figures who promoted outrageous and debunked claims that Smartmatic rigged the presidential election by flipping millions of votes from Donald Trump to Joe Biden. They did this even though on-air anchors, top producers and executives privately admitted that the election wasn’t stolen.
The judge said Smartmatic’s case was strong enough to proceed against the parent company because it has “sufficiently alleged that (Fox) Corp. employees acted with malice by purposely and deliberating publishing knowingly false stories about (Smartmatic) in order to benefit (Fox) Corp.’s financial interest.”
Smartmatic has “sufficiently alleged in their amended complaint that (Fox) Corp. employees played an affirmative role in the publication of the defamation at issue,” Cohen concluded.
The parent corporation had argued that it shouldn’t be involved in the defamation case because it only had general oversight of Fox News itself. Further, Fox Corp. argued there wasn’t proof that any corporate employees “directed” the allegedly defamatory statements to be aired.
Fox denies defaming anyone and claims that the lawsuit is an assault on the First Amendment.
“We will be ready to defend this case surrounding extremely newsworthy events when it goes to trial, likely in 2025,” a Fox spokesperson said in a statement after the ruling. “As a report prepared by our financial expert shows, Smartmatic’s damages claims are implausible, disconnected from reality, and on their face intended to chill First Amendment freedoms.”
Smartmatic sued Fox News and its parent corporation in 2021 for defamation and is seeking more than $2 billion in damages. A New York appeals court previously dismissed the case against Fox Corp. but gave Smartmatic a chance to refile the allegations with more evidence. Cohen said Wednesday that the refiled claims against Fox Corp. are sufficient enough to move forward.
“We look forward to proceeding and holding Fox Corporation, as well as Fox News, responsible for the damage they did to Smartmatic,” the company’s lead attorney Erik Connolly said.
The case is still in the discovery phase, with some major depositions taking place in the past month, including former Fox Corporation chairman Rupert Murdoch.
The decision boosts Smartmatic’s case against the right-wing media behemoth. A similar 2020-related lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems was also allowed to proceed against Fox and its parent company. That case unearthed tranches of internal emails that described in devastating detail how top Fox officials cravenly allowed Trump allies like Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell to lie about the election on its shows.
The judge also on Wednesday gave Fox News a greenlight to continue its counterclaims against Smartmatic. The right-wing network is alleging that Smartmatic’s massive $2.7 billion request for damages is a legally baseless attempt to silence the network’s free-speech rights.
Fox filed its counterclaims against Smartmatic last year, in a bid to push back against the company and recover the money it’s spending on high-priced attorneys to defend itself.
“(Fox’s) argument here is that (Smartmatic’s) alleged damages are so extenuated from their actual lost profits that they were pleaded and/or sought in order to chill (Fox’s) free speech rights. That argument has not yet been adjudicated in any court,” Cohen said, paving the way for Fox to continue its fight against the $2.7 billion figure.
Smartmatic had asked Cohen to dismiss the counterclaims, on the basis that of Fox’s arguments were already shut down in Dominion’s similar defamation case that the right-wing network settled last year, and that they shouldn’t be relitigated now.
In the Smartmatic case, Fox has previously argued that the Florida-based voting company couldn’t have lost billions of dollars due to the airing of election lies because it was already unprofitable and scandal-plagued before anyone accused the company of rigging votes against Trump.
“While the recovery of fees and costs will not undo all the damage this First Amendment-defying lawsuit has wrought, at least it may cause the next plaintiff to think twice before trying to penalize the press to the tune of billions of dollars in non-existent damages for ensuring that the people can hear perspectives from all sides of the most pressing controversies of the day,” Fox wrote in a filing last year."
GAXNL0HT1D_XSQOAPL4XHFCGRT,UK pulls out of post-Brexit trade talks with Canada,"By Anna Cooban, CNN","3 minute read Published 10:15 AM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/26/business/uk-pauses-canada-trade-negotiations/,"Britain is finding out just how hard it can be to negotiate free trade deals, even with close allies and friends.
Nearly eight years after Brexit campaigners persuaded a slim majority to vote to leave the European Union, on a platform that included promises of a brighter future as a global trading nation, the UK government has walked away from talks to replace its legacy EU trade deal with Canada over disputes involving beef, cars and cheese.
The talks between the United Kingdom and Canada — which share a head of state (King Charles) and are both members of NATO and the Group of Seven forum of leading advanced economies — began in March 2022, two years after Britain officially left the EU. Goods and services have continued flowing between the two countries under the terms of the EU-Canada free trade deal.
But Britain had sought to negotiate a new trade deal with Canada that would improve upon the terms of the existing agreement. Parts of the current deal are also due to expire, or have already done so, with no new rules to replace them.
UK carmakers, which currently pay low or no import taxes when exporting to Canada, could face much higher taxes from April.
Meanwhile, rules governing the export of British cheese to Canada expired in December. Now, UK producers selling to Canada face paying tariffs of up to 245% of the value of their cheese.
Related article The UK economy still can’t cope with the consequences of Brexit
A key sticking point in the negotiations has been Britain’s refusal to relax a ban on hormone-treated beef, which at the moment effectively bars Canadian farmers from selling to British consumers.
“Trade negotiations are complex, but sometimes it is right to pause if progress is not being made. We remain open to restarting talks with Canada in the future,” a UK government spokesperson said in a statement.
A spokesperson for Canadian trade minister Mary Ng said Friday: “I am confident that we can negotiate an agreement that is win win for Canada and for the UK.”
“But let me be clear: we will not negotiate an agreement that is not good for Canadians, and not good for our Canadian businesses, farmers and workers,” the spokesperson said in a statement.
According to the UK government, total trade in goods and services with Canada was worth nearly £26 billion ($33 billion) in the year to the end of June and Canada is the UK’s 13th-biggest export market.
The stalled talks represent a “blow” to the UK’s ambitions to strike better trade deals now that it is outside of the EU, according to David Henig, a director of UK trade policy at the Brussels-based European Centre for International Political Economy.
“We won’t get an improved deal, we’ll actually have worse trading conditions than we did as EU members,” he told CNN.
An unnamed Canadian government official, speaking to Reuters, suggested the UK had only itself to blame for what is the first failed attempt to replace EU trading arrangements with a third country after Brexit.
“Britain did not act as fast as it should have in negotiations, and expects Canada to just give (it) these things,” the official told Reuters.
But Minette Batters, president of the National Farmers’ Union, which represents farmers in England and Wales, took a different view. “The prime minister put it in writing last year that he would not be importing hormone-treated beef or chlorine-washed chicken,” she told the BBC Friday.
“Canada has played hardball for a long time. It was always going to come to a crunch point as to who was going to capitulate.”"
GB5X3NRS5I_Q53ZVGBXAFI26WQ,Mysterious Russian plane crash raises more questions than answers,"Analysis by Tim Lister, CNN","5 minute read Updated 5:08 AM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/24/europe/plane-crash-belgorod-analysis-intl/,"It’s still unclear why a Russian military transport aircraft crashed in the Belgorod region near the Ukraine border on Wednesday, whether because it was brought down by a missile or suffered some catastrophic technical failure. But all 74 people on board were killed, according to Russian authorities.
The first images of the wreckage on the ground are inconclusive; one video shows the last seconds of the plane as it hurtles towards earth before a large fireball erupts.
But the Russian authorities have claimed that Ukrainian missiles were responsible – and that they killed 65 of their own prisoners of war, along with six crew members and three Russian personnel, who were on board the Ilyushin Il-76.
The Russian Defense Ministry said the plane was destroyed by an anti-aircraft missile system deployed in the area of Liptsy in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region, some 50 miles (80 kilometers) from where the plane came down. It said radar equipment had detected the launches.
The Defense Ministry also claimed that “the Ukrainian leadership knew very well that, according to established practice, today Ukrainian military personnel would be transported by military transport aircraft to the Belgorod airfield for exchange” at the Kolotilovka checkpoint on the Russian border with the Ukrainian region of Sumy.
In response, Ukraine’s military command said it regarded Russian military aircraft approaching Belgorod as legitimate targets but stopped short of acknowledging it fired at a Russian transport plane.
The 50-mile distance from Liptsy to the crash site would be beyond most Ukrainian ground-to-air missile systems. A Ukrainian defense intelligence official did confirm that a prisoner exchange had been due to happen on Wednesday, but did not acknowledge knowing the logistical details of the Russian side of the swap. Another Ukrainian military source was quoted as claiming that the plane was carrying Russian missiles, not prisoners.
So one question is whether the Ukrainians were indeed aware of the timing and route of the aircraft that the Russians say was bringing prisoners to the site of the exchange, and additionally whether that information would have been conveyed to front-line units across the border from Belgorod.
The plane’s two flight recorders could, however, provide answers. An emergency services representative told Russian state news agency RIA Novosti on Thursday that “both flight recorders – flight parameter recording device and voice recorder – have been found” in good condition and handed over to investigators.
But there are already other ramifications from this disaster.
Andrey Kartapolov, who is chairman of the Duma Defense Committee in Moscow, made a significant allegation in claiming that the missiles fired were from US-made Patriot or German-made IRIS-T systems that have been supplied to Ukraine, without offering any evidence. Ukraine has pledged not to use foreign-donated weapons to attack Russian territory and this would have been a highly significant departure from that policy. In any case, the IRIS-T would not have had the range to hit the Ilyushin from the nearest Ukrainian-held territory. A Patriot deployed (at considerable risk) so close to the border with Russia would have been within range of the plane.

Some observers are also pointing out that Russian missile defenses in the area were on high alert Wednesday, and that a Ukrainian drone had been brought down shortly before the plane crashed. However, the governor of Belgorod said that had happened in a location to the west of the city, which would put it at least 37 miles (60 kilometers) from the site where the Ilyushin crashed.
Another puzzling element is that according to the Russian version of events, the Ukrainian PoWs were guarded by just three Russian personnel on board the plane (besides the crew.) A former Ukrainian PoW, Maksym Kolesnikov, said Wednesday in a post on X that when he had been transported by plane from Bryansk to Belgorod, there were about 20 military police for 50 prisoners.
So this disaster already has multiple political dimensions and as yet a lot of unanswered questions. It has quickly become another episode in the information war that has been a constant in this conflict.
Dmytro Lubinets, Ukraine’s human rights ombudsman, said Wednesday that “information warfare is no less important than fighting at the front… The enemy is insidious. We all know what terrible methods Russia can use to destabilize Ukrainian society.”
Indeed the Russian Defense Ministry in its statement said that “by committing this terrorist attack, the Ukrainian leadership showed its true colors – it neglected the lives of its citizens.“
It’s worth recalling that Russia alleged that Ukraine killed its own prisoners of war in a strike on a camp in Olenivka in Donetsk 18 months ago, a claim that after extensive forensic investigation looked extremely dubious.
Then, as most likely in this instance, no independent on-the-ground analysis was possible.
But a large Russian military aircraft without anti-missile defenses approaching Belgorod – itself a frequent target of Ukrainian drones – would have been a tempting and valuable target for Ukraine.
It would therefore have been a flight of considerable risk – unless the Ukrainians had been notified of its purpose, as the Russians have claimed. On the whole, Russian Il-76 aircraft stay well beyond the range of Ukrainian missiles; this would be the first time since the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine nearly two years ago that one of them has been shot down.
But the Ukrainians have extended the range and frequency of their attacks into Russia, using drones, missiles and sabotage. Earlier this month, the Ukrainian military claimed to have shot down one of the Russians’ most advanced early detection aircraft, the A-50, over the Sea of Azov. There’s been no visual evidence of the wreckage, and the Russian Defense Ministry has not responded to the claim. Some analysts believe that the Ukrainians may have repurposed a Patriot battery to carry out that attack, but there has been no confirmation. Patriot missiles generally have a range of just under 100 miles.
For Ukraine, at a time when the battlefield is in stalemate and there are few victories to celebrate, attacking Russian bases, ships, aircraft and infrastructure well beyond the border has become a different way to disrupt the enemy’s military machine.
But if evidence emerges to confirm the version of events being offered up by the Russian Defense Ministry and others in Moscow, what would have been a coup for Ukrainian air defenses may instead have been a horrendous mistake."
GCMYI1L2GD_XS0JPU5ID1T5E7H,"With menthol cigarette ban still uncertain, American Lung Association calls for White House to act ‘swiftly’ to save lives","By Jacqueline Howard, CNN","10 minute read Published 12:01 AM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/24/health/american-lung-association-report-card-menthol/,"The American Lung Association is putting more pressure on the White House to finalize rules to end the sale of menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars in the United States.
A scathing edition of the association’s annual State of Tobacco Control report, published Wednesday, calls o﻿n the Biden administration to finalize the proposed rules and says that failing to do so will result in more death and disease caused by smoking, especially among historically marginalized Black communities.
Related article Dozens of health organizations pledge ‘full support’ for federal ban on menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars
“Menthol cigarettes make it both easier to start and harder to quit by reducing the harshness of the smoke and cooling the throat,” the report notes. Researchers estimate that a regulation banning menthol cigarettes would save about 654,000 lives over the next 40 years, especially those of Black smokers, who are disproportionately more likely to smoke menthols.
In October, the US Food and Drug Administration sent rules for banning the manufacturing and sale of menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars to the White House’s Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review. Within the OMB is the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, which is responsible for reviewing all regulatory action – and this review process is a key step before a final rule may be published in the Federal Register.
But no action on this regulation has been made since it was submitted to the OMB. Under a “timetable” for each rule – on menthol in cigarettes and flavors in cigars – a final rule action has been given the date of March.
“In an extremely disappointing end to 2023, the White House bowed to tobacco industry pressure and failed to move forward in 2023 with finalizing rules to eliminate menthol as a characterizing flavor in cigarettes and prohibit all characterizing flavors in cigars,” the new report says. “This lack of action prioritizes politics and tobacco industry profits over public health and if the White House fails to finalize the rules.”
Related article Biden administration must decide soon on menthol cigarettes or risk proposed ban going up in smoke, advocates say
Proponents of the regulation were hoping that the rule would be finalized by January 20. That would have given it exactly a year to be implemented ahead of Inauguration Day, when there could be changes coming to the White House.
“That would have given the FDA the year’s time it claimed was necessary to implement the regulation,” said Daniel Karon, an attorney based in Cleveland who has been following the menthol cigarette rule and who teaches consumer law at the University of Michigan Law School and The Ohio State University Moritz College of Law.
“Even if the Biden administration freed up the regulation to go forward, the question is, would that be sufficient time for the FDA to enact it? Or would it just die on the vine because Trump could come in and stop the rulemaking process in its tracks?” he said of the potential Republican nominee. “If the White House does not at least make an internal decision this week and Biden does not win a second term, a new president could kill the regulation before it ever gets started.”
Another hurdle if the rules are implemented: Tobacco companies will probably sue in federal court, Karon said.
“Big Tobacco will petition for two things: declaratory relief, that is, a declaration or order that what the FDA issued is illegal, and equitable relief, that is, an injunction requiring withdrawal of the regulation,” he said. “Declaratory and injunctive relief are likely going to be on Big Tobacco’s mind when it inevitably files its federal lawsuit against the federal government.”
Related article Critics charge political concerns have led Biden administration to delay long-awaited ban on menthol cigarettes
Menthol cigarettes have emerged as a pivotal issue for President Joe Biden, who is facing an election year with worries over diminished enthusiasm from Black voters.
Some civil rights leaders with ties to the tobacco industry have raised concerns with the White House that a ban would criminalize menthol cigarettes and lead to an increase in deadly police interactions. Meanwhile, the NAACP and the Congressional Black Caucus have endorsed the ban, along with dozens of public health experts, saying it would save hundreds of thousands of Black lives.
The FDA proposal would ban the manufacturing and sale of menthols but would not police smokers themselves. The rule explicitly states, “This regulation does not include a prohibition on individual consumer possession or use, and FDA cannot and will not enforce against individual consumers for possession or use of menthol cigarettes. FDA’s enforcement will only address manufacturers, distributors, wholesalers, importers, and retailers.”
The divide among Black leaders has made the proposed ban a ripe political issue for the administration. It has delayed a decision on the issue﻿ three times.

Tobacco remains the leading cause of preventable death and disease in the US, according to the new State of Tobacco Control report. About 16 million people in the US live with a tobacco-related disease.
“Tobacco use is responsible for 480,000 deaths each year, including 45,000 Black individuals. Right now, President Biden can take action and save lives if he finalizes the rules to end the sale of menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars,” Harold Wimmer, president and CEO of the American Lung Association, said in a news release Wednesday.
“Once these rules are final, fewer people will start smoking, millions will begin their journey to quit and lives will be saved,” he said. “We know that the tobacco industry will do anything to protect their profits at the expense of public health, so the White House must focus on implementing lifesaving policies and push back against the industry’s delay tactics.”
The State of Tobacco Control report acts as a “report card” that evaluates state and federal policies. In the new edition, the federal government gets an A grade for its mass media campaigns that encourage people to not smoke or vape. But it received a C grade for its federal regulation of tobacco products, a D grade for how federal health care plans may be required to cover tobacco cessation and an F grade for its tobacco tax policies.
Taxes are considered one of the most effective ways to reduce smoking, particularly among children, studies suggest. But Congress hasn’t raised federal tobacco taxes in 15 years, since 2009. The federal cigarette tax remains $1.01 per pack, and taxes can vary among other tobacco products.

In the new report, the American Lung Association lists five “key actions” for the Biden administration and Congress to take this year to help eliminate death and disease caused by tobacco use. These include for the FDA to finalize its premarket review of tobacco product applications, for Congress to at least maintain current funding for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Office on Smoking and Health and to pass the Helping Tobacco Users Quit Act, which would expand comprehensive Medicaid coverage for tobacco cessation. Another key action is for the FDA and Departments of Justice and Homeland Security to remove all illegal tobacco products from the marketplace.
The White House “swiftly” finalizing the two rules that will remove menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars from the market was No. 1 among those key actions.
“This report highlighted how the tobacco industry continues to exert its political and economic power to undermine, delay, or prevent the enactment of effective tobacco control policies in the US,” Daniel Giovenco, assistant professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia Mailman School of Public Health, who was not involved in the new report, wrote in an email.
“While tremendous progress has been made in reducing tobacco use over the last several decades, social inequalities in tobacco use persist, contributing to grave tobacco-related health disparities,” he said. “US lawmakers and public health agencies must double down on efforts to enact legislation and increase funding for tobacco control initiatives in order to mitigate a leading cause of preventable disease, disability, and death in the US.”
The State of Tobacco Control report also highlights how a decline in adult cigarette smoking rates has stalled, with about 11.6% of adults reporting smoking in 2022, compared with 11.5% in 2021, according to data from the CDC’s 2022 National Health Interview Survey. Overall tobacco use among adults increased in 2022, driven by a rise in e-cigarette use from 4.5% to 6%.
“The increases in e-cigarette use over the past two years have been driven by the 18- to 24-year-old age group and 65.5% of e-cigarette users in this age group did not smoke cigarettes previously in 2022,” the report says. “The increase in adult tobacco use in 2022 is a worrying sign, and an indication that state and federal lawmakers must redouble their efforts to prevent and reduce tobacco use in 2024.”

In the report’s evaluation of state-by-state tobacco control policies, Alabama and Georgia were rated the worst in the nation, scoring grades of F in all five categories: tobacco prevention and control funding, tobacco tax policies, state smoking restrictions for smoke-free air, access to cessation services and restrictions on flavored tobacco products.
The low grades given to many states stood out to attorney Karon.
“I was disappointed yet not surprised to see such meager activity at the state level. Under the 10th Amendment to the US Constitution, any power that is not specifically given to the federal government or withheld from the states is reserved for the states. To me, state involvement should be a bipartisan issue,” he said.
“Liberal states should want to participate in saving lives, while conservative states should want to act independently of the federal government,” he said. “That is something I would have liked to see more activity on.”
The report gave the best grades to California, which earned A grades for smoke-free air and access to cessation services; the District of Columbia, which earned A grades for tobacco tax policies, smoke-free air and restrictions on flavored tobacco products; and Massachusetts, which earned As for smoke-free air and flavored tobacco product restrictions.
California and Massachusetts are the only states with statewide bans on the sale of menthol cigarettes, according to the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. In 2020, Massachusetts became the first to ban flavored tobacco products. California’s ban went into effect at the end of 2022.
The American Lung Association has been joined by other public health groups – including the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids and the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, or ASTHO – in urging the White House to ban menthol cigarettes.

Last week, Michael Fraser, ASTHO’s chief executive officer, sent a letter to President Biden asking for the administration’s support in adopting and implementing the federal rule to prohibit the sale of menthol-flavored combustible cigarettes as soon as possible.
“The more time that passes, the more likely that more youth are going to be sort of addicted to cigarettes and creating a new generation of smokers. So we want to make sure that the momentum is really sharp right now,” said Jeffrey Ekoma, ASTHO’s senior director of government affairs.
“If [the White House is] talking about this and they’re actively talking to stakeholders, we want to make sure that they’re hearing not just the voice of the tobacco industry but also the voices of tobacco control advocates like ASTHO and others to make sure that they’re not just hearing one side of the issue,” Ekoma said.
RJ Reynolds, the manufacturer of Newport cigarettes, the most popular brand of menthol cigarettes in the US, said in a statement in December that it thinks a ban would ultimately do more harm to Black smokers than good.
“Reynolds has been clear on where it stands on banning menthol – we strongly believe there are more effective ways to deliver tobacco harm reduction than banning products. A ban on menthol cigarettes would harm, not benefit, public health,” the statement says.
ASTHO’s letter argues that although the tobacco industry and others who are against the ban claim that the rule would increase the potential for criminal charges in Black communities and create an underground market, the FDA has no authority to criminally charge consumers of banned products.

“It’s important to note that the regulations would not penalize the use or possession of these products among consumers, only companies that make or sell non-compliant products,” Columbia’s Giovenco said in his email.
“The tobacco industry and some organizations that have received tobacco industry funding have propagated a false narrative that the ban would contribute to over-policing, particularly in Black communities where menthol smoking is common. Unsurprisingly, the industry fails to acknowledge how their own targeted and exploitative marketing practices are directly responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Black Americans,” he said. “The proposed ban has the support of virtually every major public health and medical association, as well as many prominent civil rights and social justice advocacy groups, who understand the devastating health toll caused by menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars.”

GDZII1AAFL_PHFZKB0WS4CRKES,‘A sneak peek into hell’: Israel’s war in Gaza has cost this young woman her closest friends,"By Zahid Mahmood and Abeer Salman, CNN. Video by Julie Zink, CNN.","7 minute read Updated 7:10 AM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/24/middleeast/gaza-young-woman-loss-israel-war-intl-cmd/,"Nowara Diab was trying to drown out the sounds of airstrikes by listening to music, but it was not enough to shake the unsettled feeling in her gut.
Then her phone rang. It was a friend, who said they had heard that Maimana Jarada - Diab’s best friend - and her family had been killed by Israeli bombardment.
Her stomach was in knots as she felt herself panicking. Diab called Jarada’s number repeatedly but when there was no answer, it dawned on her that it was true - Jarada had been killed.
The 20-year-old says she broke down in tears as she felt the walls close in around her. The pain was even more intense for Diab because she had learned only 10 days earlier that another friend, Abraham Saidam, had also been killed by Israeli airstrikes.
“Living without them is the worst thing I’ve ever felt,” Diab said. “My heart aches every single day thinking that they’re not here and they’re not going to be here for me anymore, it pains me.”
She recalls how she froze in disbelief and started crying when she received the text message about Saidam.
“My mother looked at me to ask me what was wrong. I just covered my mouth with my hands and I was silent, everything was a blur and I was in complete shock.”
Despite repeated telecommunications blackouts amid Israel’s siege, Diab has managed to speak to CNN from Gaza through voice notes, text messages and videos about the life and friendships she has lost since October 7.
As Israel’s war approaches its fourth month, sustained bombardment by Israeli forces in Gaza has had a devastating impact on civilians there. United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres condemned the “utterly unacceptable” killing of civilians, renewing calls for an “immediate humanitarian ceasefire” to relieve the suffering of Palestinians in the strip, after the death toll surpassed 25,000, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry.
Throughout Israel’s war, launched in response to the October 7 Hamas attacks, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has repeatedly said that it only targets Hamas fighters, not civilians.
The enclave is one of the most densely populated areas in the world, with about 2.2 million inhabitants.
At the outset of the war, Diab watched as bombs fell near her home in Gaza City. She and her family knew they had to leave for their own safety.
“That night was dreadful, it was so scary, I was sure I was going to die,” she said.
After fleeing multiple times, Diab and her family are now staying in Rafah, southern Gaza, and are among the nearly 1.9 million people displaced across the territory, according to data from the United Nations’ Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA).
The Israeli bombardment and the ensuing humanitarian crisis have made the situation in the enclave unbearable, with the UN children’s agency, UNICEF, saying conditions for children are a “living hell.” The UN agency has described Gaza as the most dangerous place in the world to be a child and said the ongoing violence is exposing young people to devastating emotional trauma and psychological harm.
Walking through the streets, Diab said, she looks at the faces of fellow residents of Gaza and sees nothing but sadness and pain.
She says losing her best friends and being forced to leave behind the life she’s known has impacted her own mental health.
“I’m unable to feel anything, I don’t feel happy or sad or anything,” she said. “I don’t know why but all of this has consumed my energy, I cry every now and then but not the way I used to cry before, it’s very brief.”
Before the war, Diab was in her final year of college studying English and French literature at Al Azhar University. Like most young people, she enjoyed spending time with her friends and eating tasty food in the city.
Sometimes, when Diab closes her eyes, she can still remember the faint smell of her family home in northern Gaza, destroyed by bombing since October 7. “Even the flaws hold memories,” she said. “If my little sister drew something on the walls, it made my mother mad but it still holds a memory.”
Diab says she longs for the kind of problems she had before the war, like missing the bus for college or being bored in lectures. “I’m not able to do this anymore because my college was bombed, my house was bombed and I lost my best friend,” she said.
Diab describes her situation as worse than a nightmare because she’s unable to wake up from it.
“I laugh at myself when I say ‘my life’ now, because this is not my life, this is far away from my life,” she continued. “This is a sneak peek into hell.”
There’s rarely a moment when Jarada and Saidam leave Diab’s mind, she says, and she thinks of them whenever she looks through photos on her phone or sees other people with their friends.
“I just need her (Jarada) more than ever right now, but I know that she is in a better place,” Diab said.
“And I know that Abraham is happy now, I just know it, but I miss them.”
Diab and Jarada were childhood friends, with shared humor and interests creating a bond like that of sisters. In a video shared with CNN, the pair sit next to each other, giggling and lip syncing to a viral Tik Tok sound that originated from a Saturday Night Live skit about friendship.
“How would I even begin to describe Jarada? She’s just unique, a beautiful soul and a very artistic person,” Diab told CNN, adding that Jarada had “the biggest heart ever” and would create pictures for her.
Jarada painted a sunflower for Diab’s birthday last year. Diab says she accepted it unaware that this would be her friend’s last gift to her before she died at age 20.
When Diab and her family fled Gaza City, she had to leave the painting behind.
At college, Diab’s interest in the arts drew her to participate in a theater group, where she became good friends with Saidam after initially thinking he was quiet.
“He even looked like an introvert, but then we found out he’s an extrovert and was so funny and so exceptional,” she said.
Diab recalls how they both participated in a play based on Homer’s “Odyssey.” Saidam played King Odysseus and would make everybody laugh, she said.
The day Diab learned of her 27-year-old friend’s death, she cried a lot, but resolved to be strong because there was nothing more she could do, she said.
In Rafah, all Diab tries to do is to survive another day, she said, searching for essential items like cooking gas and water, both in very short supply.
“Can you imagine if you live your life without water? The most basic thing, just to drink, just to keep living,” said Diab. “Now everyone is being killed and if you’re not going to die from (airstrikes) we’re going to die from being hungry or thirsty.”
But despite everything that is happening, she says she will never forget the generosity and kindness of neighbors where they’ve sought refuge in Rafah and Khan Younis.
A neighbor in Rafah would give them plates of food and let Diab’s family shower at her home. “To see someone giving so much like this under these circumstances is surprising and she’s so nice,” Diab said.
“(Another family) came over and offered water to shower and to charge our phones and within an hour, our phones came back fully charged,” she said – no small thing in Gaza, where fuel shortages mean electricity is hard to access.
Although aid has entered the enclave, it has done so under challenging conditions and the UN has repeatedly warned that the volume getting in remains “woefully inadequate.”
Diab says extreme thirst has driven her family to drink water suitable only for laundry or showering.
Families across Gaza are having to consume unclean water because of Israel’s siege, adding to the risk of ill health. Earlier this month, UNICEF warned that the intensifying conflict has threatened the lives of over 1.1 million children, putting them in a deadly cycle of violence, malnutrition and disease.
With airstrikes pummeling southern Gaza, Diab fears for her safety in Rafah, saying there’s not an inch in the enclave which is truly safe, despite Israel’s declaration of a safe zone and regular announcements of times when they will stop bombing so people can move safely.
And although she wishes the war to be over, she lacks hope for the future.
“We’re going to see Gaza City wiped out, we’re gonna see it with our own eyes, which will be heartbreaking,” she said of any future return to her home.
“Imagine going back, after all of this is over and there’s going to be nothing to go back to, not a college, not a house, nothing. So even when this is over, there is more agony and pain waiting for us.”"
GFBJJZ1JBQ_Q9HM70NENO238OV,Jennifer Hudson and Common hint they’re dating each other during her talk show,"By Alli Rosenbloom, CNN","2 minute read Published 4:03 PM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240122,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/22/entertainment/jennifer-hudson-common-dating/,"Jennifer Hudson and Common may have just confirmed they have a lot more in, yes, common, than just being two Chicago-raised, highly celebrated musicians.
In fact, the pair hinted that they’re dating each other during Monday’s episode of Hudson’s talk show “The Jennifer Hudson Show,” where Common appeared – armed with a large floral bouquet – as one of her guests.
“I’m a host, so I have to ask you this question,” Hudson said, going on to ask, “Are you dating anyone?”
Without naming names, he said that he’s in a relationship with “one of the most beautiful people I ever met in my life.”
“She’s smart, she loves God, she got something real down to earth about her. But I set my standard kind of high because she had to have an EGOT, she had to win an Oscar on her first movie… she had to get her own talk show,” Common teased.
As a reminder, Hudson earned her coveted EGOT status in 2022. She also won a best supporting actress Oscar in 2007 for her role in “Dreamgirls,” her first feature film, and she hosts her own talk show. Seems pretty obvious who he’s talking about.
Hudson went on to say that she, too, is dating someone that she’s “very happy” with.
The pair have been romantically linked since they were seen holding hands together in New York in November. Days later, Hudson told Gayle King during an appearance on “CBS This Morning” that she’s in a relationship, but stopped short of revealing with who.
“This relationship is a happy place for me,” Common said on Monday. “We keep it private but I want to acknowledge how wonderful she is.”
“I feel that same way about my partner,” Hudson said, with a wink."
GJXN62PPQS_CWRYTL58ZEW33UZ,Trials of Michigan school shooter’s parents set to test limits of who’s responsible for a mass shooting,"By Eric Levenson, CNN","8 minute read Updated 5:09 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/25/us/james-jennifer-crumbley-school-shooting-trial/,"The parents of Ethan Crumbley, the teenager who in 2021 opened fire at his high school in Oxford, Michigan, are going on trial for manslaughter in cases that will test the limits of who is responsible for a mass shooting.
James and Jennifer Crumbley have pleaded not guilty to four charges of involuntary manslaughter for their alleged roles in their son’s rampage, which left four students dead and seven others wounded. They face up to 15 years in prison.
They are standing trial separately. Opening statements in Jennifer Crumbley’s trial began Thursday, and James Crumbley’s trial is tentatively scheduled to start March 5.
In bringing manslaughter charges, prosecutors alleged the gunman’s parents are also responsible for the students’ deaths – a novel and unusual legal theory.
“Jennifer Crumbley didn’t pull the trigger that day, but she is responsible for those deaths,” Oakland County assistant prosecutor Marc Keast said in opening statements.
In particular, prosecutors accuse the gunman’s parents of disregarding the risks when they bought a gun for their son four days before the shooting, even though he was struggling with his mental health and contemplating violence. They also say the parents did not mention the gun to school officials in a meeting to discuss Ethan’s disturbing drawings just hours before the fatal shooting.

“Despite her knowledge of his deteriorating mental crisis, despite her knowledge of his growing social isolation, despite the fact that it’s illegal for a 15-year-old to walk into a gun store and walk out with a handgun by himself, this gun was gifted,” Keast said.
“Even with all of that,” on the day of the shooting, “Jennifer Crumbley was still given the opportunity to prevent these murders from ever happening,” Keast said. “Instead, she chose to do nothing.”
The parents’ defense attorneys have argued the charges have no legal justification, but appeals courts have upheld them.
In the defense’s opening statements, attorney Shannon Smith said Jennifer Crumbley did not know about her son’s deteriorating mental state and could not have reasonably foreseen he would use the gun in a mass shooting. Instead, Smith pushed blame on her husband for purchasing the firearm and on the school for failing to notify her about her son’s problematic behavior. Jennifer Crumbley plans to testify to explain her side of the story, Smith said.
“She is going to take the stand and tell you about her life with her son, about the day he became the shooter, and about the day he did something she could have never anticipated or fathomed or predicted,” Smith said. “She will tell you that when she saw the materials in this case, she learned that her son had not been her son for months. That he had been manipulating her, he had been hiding things from her, he had been sending alarming text messages to other people.”
“You will hear that the school never advised Mrs. Crumbley of problematic issues that, if she had heard about, she would have jumped right on top of it,” Smith added.
Parents have been charged for their child’s actions before, but not in this specific way, according to Misty Marris, a trial attorney who has followed the case.
“It’s not the first time that a parent has been held liable in some capacity for the acts of a child or a shooter, however, usually those charges relate to child neglect or manifest as a failure to keep a firearm locked up,” Marris said. “This is very different because it’s actually holding them responsible for the killings.”

Ethan Crumbley, speaking at his sentencing hearing in December, said, “They did not know, and I did not tell them what I planned to do, so they are not at fault for what I’ve done.” His testimony about his parents’ knowledge of his mental health struggles could be key, but it’s not clear at this point whether he will testify.
His attorneys have indicated he will invoke his Fifth Amendment right to silence if called to testify, as the appeal of his sentence remains open. In court Tuesday, Jennifer Crumbley asked the judge to compel her son and his two jail psychiatrists to testify, while the shooter’s attorneys indicated they will not waive privilege or confidentiality for his medical records, the testimony of his doctors or his own testimony.
Marris said the trials will particularly focus on what the parents did not do, and whether that makes them responsible. “That’s why this is a tricky case because a lot of it is based on omission, not action,” she said. “A lot of criminal culpability is because you did something, not because you failed to do something. That’s why this legal argument is so novel and new and actually pretty groundbreaking.”
The evidence and arguments may also differ for each parent. Jennifer and James Crumbley had been working toward a joint defense, but their cases were separated after their defense learned of a conflict between the two. According to a prosecution filing from last year, Jennifer Crumbley “placed blame” on her husband in the shooting, leading to the split.
On November 30, 2021, Ethan Crumbley, 15 at the time, took a gun from an unlocked container in his home, hid it in his backpack and took it out in a bathroom before opening fire on his schoolmates.
He has pleaded guilty to one count of terrorism causing death, four counts of murder and 19 other charges related to the deadly rampage, and last year was sentenced to life in prison without parole.
In court Thursday, the first two witnesses were educators at Oxford High School, including Molly Darnell, a teacher who was shot in the arm. In addition, Cammy Back, an employee at an Oxford store that sells guns, testified she sold a 9 mm Sig Sauer firearm to James Crumbley on November 26, 2021, with Ethan there as well.
With ATF special agent Brett Brandon on the stand, prosecutors showed a series of videos of Ethan Crumbley shooting at the gun range with his father in the months before the attack. Ethan and Jennifer Crumbley went to the gun range on November 27, and they took turns shooting, surveillance video showed. “Mom & son day testing out his new Xmas present,” she wrote afterward in an Instagram post. “My first time shooting a 9mm I hit the bullseye.”
Further, Ethan texted a video to a friend just after midnight on August 20, 2021, showing him holding and loading a pistol inside his house. “My dad left it out so I thought, ‘Why not’ lol” he wrote.
In pre-trial hearings, prosecutors introduced text messages and other evidence they said showed his parents ignored clear warning signs.
According to phone evidence, Ethan had texted a friend saying he was experiencing hallucinations and hearing voices and had asked his parents to take him to a doctor. In response, his dad gave him pills and told him to “suck it up,” and his mom laughed at him, according to the texts.
Days later, when the school notified them that Ethan had been searching online for ammo on his phone, Jennifer Crumbley texted her son: “LOL I’m not mad at you. You have to learn not to get caught,” according to prosecutors.
Finally, on the morning of the shooting, a teacher found a drawing from Ethan showing a gun and a person bleeding along with the phrases, “the thoughts won’t stop help me,” “blood everywhere” and “my life is useless.” His parents were called into school for a meeting, but they did not inform the school Ethan had access to a gun and declined to take him out of classes for the day.
Shortly after, Ethan took the gun out of his backpack and opened fire.
His parents have been held in jail since they were arrested on manslaughter charges days after the shooting.
There have been several other cases in which parents were charged for shootings carried out by their children, though not one in a school mass shooting.
For example, the father of the July 4 mass shooter in the Chicago suburb of Highland Park, Illinois, was accused of wrongdoing for signing his son’s application for an Illinois Firearm Owners Identification card months after his son displayed concerning behavior. The father, Robert Crimo Jr., ultimately pleaded guilty to misdemeanor reckless conduct charges and agreed to serve 60 days in jail.
In a similar vein, the mother of a 6-year-old boy who shot his teacher at a Virginia school last year faced charges. The boy’s mother ultimately pleaded guilty to a state child neglect charge and felony charges of unlawful use of a controlled substance while possessing a firearm and making a false statement while purchasing a firearm.

Frank Vandervort, clinical professor of law at the University of Michigan Law School, said parents can be held responsible for their children’s actions, such as for truancy. But the level of severity in the case of the Crumbleys is different.
“We do impose on parents certain obligations regarding their children, to say you have a heightened degree of responsibility for what happens when your kids do things. That’s generally in the law,” he said. “The severity of the charges, I think, are what’s unique here.”
Could these cases set a new precedent for parents?
In a written opinion filed last March, a panel of judges for the state’s appellate court acknowledged the possible precedent-setting nature of these cases but called the situation unique and unusual.
“We share defendants’ concern about the potential for this decision to be applied in the future to parents whose situation viz-a-viz their child’s intentional conduct is not as closely tied together, and/or the warning signs and evidence were not as substantial as they are here,” wrote the panel.
The opinion said those concerns are “significantly diminished” by the fact that Ethan Crumbley’s actions “were reasonably foreseeable, and that is the ultimate test that must be applied.”
Vandervort similarly said he believed these cases were so unusual and uncommon that the impact would be limited.
“I don’t anticipate there’s going to be a lot of this kind of thing filed. I think this is a pretty unique case,” he said. “It’s hard to talk about shootings by teenagers as being run of the mill. Unless you’ve got really unusual factual situations, I don’t anticipate a lot of parents getting charged.”
Even so, Joey Jackson, a CNN legal analyst, said the prosecution’s broad goal in bringing these cases was to deter other parents.
“They want to deter other parents from being negligent,” he said. “They want to make sure we have diligent parents who don’t put their kids in a position where they can gain access to firearms easily.”

GM76ILSGQ6_LRQJLM7GVMEA2KI,‘Griselda’ sees Sofia Vergara transform into female drug kingpin Griselda Blanco,"Review by Brian Lowry, CNN","3 minute read Updated 9:25 PM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/23/entertainment/griselda-review-sofia-vergara/,"The title might be “Griselda” and the promotion all about Sofia Vergara, but this limited series devoted to a real-life drug kingpin could easily be dubbed “Narcos,” Season 4. Having a female protagonist in the 1970s and ‘80s does filter the narrative through a misogynistic prism, but despite being generally watchable, the story of a woman nicknamed “The Godmother” feels like one of those offers you can refuse.
After a title card in which Pablo Escobar offers an admiring quote, “Griselda” opens with its frantic title character, Griselda Blanco, fleeing from Medellin to Miami with her three sons.
Left behind – for reasons fleshed out later – is her abusive husband, although as the real brains behind the operation, she’s eager to build her own business with a foothold in the US, with only her wits, guts and a single brick of cocaine to get the party started.
Described as a fictionalized telling of Blanco’s tale, the series follows Griselda as she finds initial help from her friend Carmen (Vanessa Ferlito), who runs a travel agency but wants nothing to do with the illicit enterprise. Of course, getting that off the ground requires overcoming the skepticism of local drug lords, who don’t take her seriously at first, with some of them soon learning that’s a bad idea the hard way.
Vergara dons enough makeup to render her considerably less glamorous than her “Modern Family” image, although early accounts calling her “unrecognizable” must be from people who don’t know what Sofia Vergara looks like.
Next to the attention devoted to Vergara’s personal life, her turn here is a strong dramatic portrayal and showcase, somewhat undercut by how the story beats slip a little too easily into “Scarface” territory as Griselda’s spectacular rise and lavish lifestyle eventually give way to paranoia and the inevitable fall.
The same applies to a subplot that’s too on the nose, with a female detective (Juliana Aidén Martinez) who keeps pushing her skeptical bosses to investigate rumors of a woman occupying an increasingly pivotal role in the drug trade, while facing her own version of the institutional patriarchy at every turn.
The cops and criminals, in other words, are just different sides of the same coin, especially as seen through the overt sexism of those macho cultures in this era. In that context, it’s possible to be historically accurate without feeling particularly insightful.
With a production team that unites Vergara with “Narcos” writer/producer Eric Newman and director Andrés Baiz, “Griselda” is, as expected, dark and brutal, reflecting a world in which crossing the wrong people meant risking the harshest possible retaliation.
Still, as the series spans years and various crises, “Griselda” becomes the least compelling – albeit unintended – addition to the “Narcos” universe, a solid but almost by-the-numbers exercise. Chalk that up in part to the fact that in both TV and the drug trade, the product doesn’t always deliver as much of a kick if you hit the same stuff too often.
“Griselda” premieres January 25 on Netflix."
GMUWM6UG0U_LRUHD960JOH3BZA,The hurricane cone graphic is changing this year. Here’s why experts say it’s needed,"By Allison Chinchar, CNN","3 minute read Published 9:52 AM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/25/weather/hurricane-cone-change-risk-perception-climate/,"The iconic cone graphic used by the National Hurricane Center to depict the potential path of tropical systems will undergo a noticeable change for the upcoming hurricane season.
The cone will be deemphasized over land in the continental US, with more emphasis being placed on expected impacts by showing tropical storm and hurricane watches and warnings instead. This means you’ll see active tropical alerts instead of a cone where applicable over land.
Watches and warnings used to only be shown alongside the cone “in a line along the coastline of the affected area,” NHC director Michael Brennan told CNN. Now, the alerts are taking “precedence over the cone,” and “will be predominant on the graphic,” NHC spokesperson Maria Torres told CNN.
The hurricane cone is changing this upcoming hurricane season! Instead of a track forecast, the forecast will now include hazards. What you can expect where you live. This change was unveiled at #OSSTahoe. @EdgewoodTahoe Here is the info:https://t.co/LsZVZY5DaP pic.twitter.com/evMEvuyvmj
The changes aim to address shortcomings in how people perceive a storm’s threats based on the boundaries of the track forecast cone, which only depicts the potential track of the center of a storm and not the storm’s hazards.
A recent study found people perceive areas highlighted within the cone as “at risk” and areas that are outside of it as being “safe.” Researchers refer to this perceived notion as the “containment effect.”
A storm’s winds can be expansive and stretch well beyond the cone.
“This is most critical for strong hurricanes that can carry tropical storm and hurricane force winds well inland, but it will improve the risk communication for wind hazards for all tropical cyclones,” Brennan said.
Tropical storm and hurricane watches and warnings are used to indicate the impending risk of winds of tropical storm force (39 to 73 mph) or hurricane force (74 mph-plus) in a given area, independent of the cone.
Brennan said the decision was based in part on research that tested “alternative cone variations.”
“The inclusion of inland wind risk information on the cone graphic decreased focus on the storm track and increased focus on wind hazard information compared to the versions of the cone without inland watches and warnings,” Brennan said.
The track forecast cone is designed to show where the center of a storm could be over the next five days. Statistically speaking, the longer the forecast period, the greater the likelihood for track error. The cone is much wider five days out compared to 24 hours out to account for the increase in potential track errors.
Every storm’s forecast is different and can have more or less error, but the width of the cone represents the majority of track errors from past storms over a five year period. This means the center of a forecast storm remains within the cone on average 60% to 70% of the time, according to the hurricane center.
But given that the effects of tropical storms and hurricanes often extend much farther than this defined boundary, it can be confusing for the public which may be trying to make critical decisions about preparations or even evacuations.
Two different hurricane forecast examples from the past highlight the difficulty in forecasting and the risks of paying too much attention to the traditional cone.
The forecast track for Hurricane Elsa in 2021 five days before landfall in Florida was almost an exact match of where the storm actually tracked. The consistency made it much easier for people to prepare.
But in the case of Hurricane Marco in 2020, the center of the storm tracked outside of the cone originally issued five days before its approach to the Gulf Coast.
You may not have been ready for Marco if you based your hurricane preparedness plans solely off of its cone.
The cone graphic change will be experimental for the 2024 hurricane season in both the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific basins. Brennan said that feedback during this phase will be used to determine whether this change will be permanent or if any other changes are needed in the future."

Vergara dons enough makeup to render her considerably less glamorous than her “Modern Family” image, although early accounts calling her “unrecognizable” must be from people who don’t know what Sofia Vergara looks like.
Next to the attention devoted to Vergara’s personal life, her turn here is a strong dramatic portrayal and showcase, somewhat undercut by how the story beats slip a little too easily into “Scarface” territory as Griselda’s spectacular rise and lavish lifestyle eventually give way to paranoia and the inevitable fall.
The same applies to a subplot that’s too on the nose, with a female detective (Juliana Aidén Martinez) who keeps pushing her skeptical bosses to investigate rumors of a woman occupying an increasingly pivotal role in the drug trade, while facing her own version of the institutional patriarchy at every turn.
The cops and criminals, in other words, are just different sides of the same coin, especially as seen through the overt sexism of those macho cultures in this era. In that context, it’s possible to be historically accurate without feeling particularly insightful.
With a production team that unites Vergara with “Narcos” writer/producer Eric Newman and director Andrés Baiz, “Griselda” is, as expected, dark and brutal, reflecting a world in which crossing the wrong people meant risking the harshest possible retaliation.
Still, as the series spans years and various crises, “Griselda” becomes the least compelling – albeit unintended – addition to the “Narcos” universe, a solid but almost by-the-numbers exercise. Chalk that up in part to the fact that in both TV and the drug trade, the product doesn’t always deliver as much of a kick if you hit the same stuff too often.
“Griselda” premieres January 25 on Netflix."

Nicholas Joseph Gutierrez is charged in the indictment with a felony count of vehicular manslaughter with gross negligence; a misdemeanor count of vehicular manslaughter with ordinary negligence; and nine counts of reckless driving on a highway causing a specified injury, the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office said Tuesday.
Gutierrez pleaded not guilty to the charges Tuesday and is scheduled to appear in court February 9 for a pretrial conference, the district attorney’s office said.
About 75 recruits for various California law enforcement departments were on a run near Whittier as part of their training on November 16, 2022, when Gutierrez drove in the wrong direction and hit some of them, authorities said.
One of the injured, Alejandro Martinez-Inzunza, a recruit for the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, died at a hospital of his injuries eight months later, authorities said. Nine others were severely injured, the district attorney’s office said.
“More than a year later, we are still grappling with the profound loss of a promising sheriff’s deputy recruit, Alejandro Martinez-Inzunza, and the other recruits who were seriously injured as a result of this tragic incident,” District Attorney George Gascón said Tuesday. “Today’s indictment is a significant step forward in the progress of this case.”
CNN has sought comment from Gutierrez’s attorney and is working to get a copy of the indictment.
At the time of the incident, Gutierrez showed no signs of impairment and blew a zero in the Breathalyzer test, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department said.
Alexandra Kazarian, an attorney for Gutierrez, told CNN affiliate KABC in November 2022: “I have no doubt that an in-depth investigation will confirm that Nicholas is a hard-working young man who holds no animosity towards law enforcement, and this was an absolutely tragic accident.”"

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’s exit from the Republican nomination fight Sunday gives his former rival, former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley, the one-on-one shot against former President Donald Trump she claimed to crave from the stage following the Iowa caucuses last week. But the former South Carolina governor is only likely to be hurt by the nomination race moving in that direction.
DeSantis’s supporters, limited though they were, comprise one more group of voters from which Trump can add to his already healthy lead over Haley. And DeSantis himself is no longer around as a political deflector shield as Haley heads into Tuesday’s crucial New Hampshire primary.
A CNN poll released Sunday, before DeSantis withdrew from the race, found he was the first choice of 6% of likely New Hampshire GOP primary voters. That put him far behind in the poll, conducted by the University of New Hampshire, with 50% of likely New Hampshire GOP primary voters backing Trump and Haley garnering 39%.
When DeSantis’s supporters were reallocated to their second-choice candidate, however, Haley’s support widened slightly, to 41%. But Trump’s support ticked up to 54%. Another 3% of likely GOP primary voters said they’d vote for someone else.
This isn’t particularly surprising, since the whole concept of DeSantis’s campaign was being a Trump mini-me. In Florida, he picked culture issue fights over the content of social studies textbooks, played up Covid-19 pandemic issues and tangled with the state’s largest employer, Disney, among other actions that were likely to play well with the populist right.

In his GOP nomination bid, DeSantis — who endorsed Trump on Sunday — even tried to chastise the former president from the right for his administration’s supposedly insufficient results in converting MAGA policy proposals into law.
But Haley was eager to show that DeSantis, who was only able to eke out a second-place showing in Iowa despite camping out in the state and at one point leading Trump in the polls, was flagging at the same time she was rising. She seemed to think this would give her more momentum and credibility as the race turned to friendlier territory in New Hampshire.
The make-up of New Hampshire’s Republican primary electorate and Haley’s stronger showing in the polls there also likely factored into Haley’s possible miscalculation. Trump lost New Hampshire in the general elections of both 2016 and 2020. And the state, which doesn’t have as many of the evangelical voters who favor the former president, does have a large independent voter pool. In a reflection of how she’s potentially a better fit for the Granite State than Trump, New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu has been a prominent endorser of Haley.
Some of Haley’s tactics also may have backfired, like pulling out of two debates with DeSantis in recent days unless Trump participated. The idea was to emphasize that her real opponent is Trump. But in doing so, Haley relinquished two high-profile chances to present herself to the undeclared part of the New Hampshire electorate her campaign is now courting so aggressively.
Related article Opinion: Biden’s supporters need to get real about Trump, and fast
Haley risks being victimized by the “bandwagon” effect some researchers have identified in which voters want to go with the perceived winner. A 2014 paper by Neil Malhotra of Stanford and David Rothschild of Microsoft Research showed that some voters do switch sides to feel accepted and to be a part of the winning team. To them, DeSantis dropping out (and quickly endorsing Trump) wouldn’t make Haley look like the safer bet, but Trump.
Haley tried to make the best of DeSantis’s move.
“We’re not a country of coronations,” Haley said in a late afternoon statement. “Voters deserve a say in whether we go down the road of Trump and Biden again, or we go down a new conservative road.”
But with DeSantis’s departure coming a bit over 48 hours before polls close in New Hampshire on Tuesday night, she may be hard-pressed to do better than a second-place finish behind Trump if he indeed gets 50% or more.
While finishing a relatively close second would normally allow for bragging rights against a former president who is effectively a quasi-incumbent, she faces a serious calendar and geography challenge. The South Carolina primary, in Haley’s home state, isn’t until February 24. That gives Trump plenty of time to build on his already considerable Palmetto State Republican support, with lots of GOP elected officials, backing him and no other early states where she looks to have a shot at finishing first.
Moreover, it’s not just Trump’s campaign that is galvanizing against her. With DeSantis out, the Republican establishment is rallying hard behind Trump. Sen. Steve Daines of Montana, who heads the Senate Republican campaign arm, made that point explicitly in an X post late Sunday afternoon less than two hours after DeSantis quit.

“Donald Trump is the presumptive nominee. I am encouraging every Republican to unite behind him because it will take all of us to defeat Joe Biden, take back the Senate, and hold the House,” wrote Daines, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee.
This rally-around-Trump message likely makes Haley supporters even more of an isolated minority in the GOP firmament. Heading into voting Tuesday, DeSantis’s withdrawal only exacerbates her challenge."
GS6RJTI7CB_Z20AB5UCIB0XL3Y,The world successfully tackled a dangerous pollutant. But did it accidentally warm the planet in the process?,"By Laura Paddison, CNN","5 minute read Published 4:00 AM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/26/china/shipping-pollution-global-warming-climate-intl/,"The huge cargo ships that criss-cross the world’s oceans sometimes leave “tracks” in their wake — long, wispy clouds that trail through the sky, lasting for a handful of days at most before disappearing.
These ghost clouds look beautiful, but they are a visible sign of deadly air pollution. They form when tiny sulfur dioxide particles belched out from ships’ smokestacks interact with water vapor in the atmosphere, creating low-lying, highly reflective clouds.
Ships’ sulfur pollution causes tens of thousands of premature deaths a year. But in what may seem a cruel twist — especially from an industry responsible for around 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions — this type of pollution also helps cool the planet by brightening clouds and reflecting the sun’s energy away from the Earth.
So, when in 2020 the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the United Nations body regulating shipping, slashed sulfur content permitted in ships’ fuel by 80%, it was a victory for human health. An estimated 30,000 premature deaths will now be avoided each year.
But it was “a silver cloud with a dark lining,” said Michael Diamond, assistant professor at Florida State University’s Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Science. The regulations ended a vast, accidental geoengineering project. Ship tracks reduced sharply, and with them, the cooling impact of this pollution.
As global temperatures soar, it has left scientists﻿ trying to unpick whether these shipping regulations may be inadvertently fueling an alarming acceleration of global warming — a controversial hypothesis that has divided some experts.
It’s a debate made more urgent by last year’s record-breaking heat. “Scientists are amazed at the outlier that 2023 was,” said Olaf Morgenstern, a scientist at the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research in New Zealand.
The heat was especially pronounced in some parts of the oceans, where water temperatures in areas including the North Atlantic shot wildly off the charts.
Scientists say the surge in global temperature was primarily driven by two factors: the impacts of El Niño, a natural climate phenomenon that tends to have a global heating impact, combined with the backdrop of long-term global warming caused by burning fossil fuels.
But some have speculated the heat spiked so abnormally high that other influences may also be at play. Theories include a lack of sunlight-reflecting dust from the Sahara, a change in wind patterns, and the January 2022 eruption of the Hunga Tonga underwater volcano, which injected enough planet-warming water vapor into the atmosphere to fill 58,000 Olympic-size swimming pools.
Of all of the theories, however, the impact of shipping regulations is swiftly becoming one of the most discussed. Scientists have long known that reducing this particle pollution﻿ would have a warming effect, but by how much “is where the controversy starts,” Morgenstern said.
In November, the prominent climate scientist James Hansen co-authored a paper which argued the curtailing of shipping pollution was the main driver of an alarming acceleration in global warming that goes beyond what climate models have predicted.
The IMO shipping regulations were “an unintentional scientific experiment,” Hansen told CNN. His research predicted global temperatures would breach 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming above pre-industrial levels in the 2020s and 2 degrees in the 2050s — a catastrophic level of warming that could trigger a slew of climate tipping points.
But other scientists have urged caution, not least because the relationship between pollution particles and clouds is extremely complex. Unraveling it is “one of the biggest challenges in climate science,” Diamond said.
Piers Forster, a professor of climate physics at Leeds University in the UK, said the reduction in shipping pollution is likely to have a very small warming influence.
Related article The 1.5-degree climate goal may be ‘deader than a doornail,’ and scientists are bitterly divided over it
According to Forster’s calculations, the regulations will increase global warming by around 0.01 degrees Celsius, which could grow to about 0.05 degrees by 2050 — equivalent to around two additional years of human-caused emissions.
However, he added, the uncertain effect of the pollution on clouds means there’s a possibility the warming impact could be much larger — an additional 0.1 or 0.2 degrees by 2050.
Diamond, whose own work estimates the regulations will bring levels of warming over the next few decades of between 0.05 and 0.1 degrees, said this heat won’t be “a showstopper” but is important. Every fraction of a degree matters when the world is hurtling towards levels of warming to which even humans will increasingly struggle to adapt.
Diamond, along with most of the other scientists CNN spoke to, doesn’t believe the decline in shipping pollution was a major factor in last year’s global heat, not least because there is usually a time lag before changes in the atmosphere are reflected in the Earth’s temperature.
“But I think it could have mattered quite a bit more regionally,” he said. Shipping is unevenly distributed, with much of it concentrated between Europe, North America and Asia, meaning air pollution impacts are also likely to be skewed.
In areas such as the North Atlantic, where temperatures soared several degrees above usual in 2023, Diamond said, “shipping is a decent explanation for part of why that was so warm.”
There are only a few years of data so far, and it will take time for scientists to unravel the exact impact of the fall in shipping pollution.
But it is clear that particle pollution from all sources, including burning fossil fuels, has had a cooling impact. Without it, the world would be about 0.4 degrees hotter, according to a 2021 report from Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. And pollution decreases in the future could have a big impact.
Annica Ekman, professor of meteorology at Stockholm University in Sweden, said her research has found that decreases in human-caused particle pollution between 2015 and 2050 could warm the planet as much as 0.5 degrees.
But this is not an argument against cutting air pollution, Diamond said, it’s an argument for tackling it alongside reducing carbon emissions.
The cooling impact of air pollution is far outweighed by the heating impact of burning fossil fuels. It’s when air pollution is tackled without also reducing carbon emissions, that “we can get into trouble,” Diamond said.
That is what’s happening in this shipping industry, where huge container vessels are still propelled across the oceans by hundreds of millions of tons of fossil fuels.
“We must not forget why the regulation exists,” Forster said. “It is there to save lives from air pollution.” While reducing this pollution will have a small warming impact, immediate action to reduce emissions will both slash the rate of global warming and improve air quality, he said. We are not “on some doomed trajectory,” he added."
GSYALAGSHD_W6UZH04BX2YL3GN,Martin Scorsese and John Williams just made Oscars history,"By Lisa Respers France, CNN","2 minute read Updated 11:45 AM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/23/entertainment/martin-scorsese-john-williams-oscars/,"Someone forgot to tell Martin Scorsese and John Williams about the often complained issue of ageism in Hollywood.
The famed director and composer both broke new Oscar records Tuesday, when the nominees for the 96th Academy Awards were revealed.
With his nomination for best director for “Killers of the Flower Moon,” 81-year-old Scorsese became the oldest nominee in the category that had previously been held by John Huston, who was 79 when he was nominated for “Prizzi’s Honor” in 1985.
It was Scorsese’s tenth nomination in that category, which puts him two behind current record-holder William Wyler, who had 12 best director nominations prior to his death in 1981.
“It’s deeply gratifying to receive this recognition from the Academy, for myself and for so many of my collaborators on ‘Killers of the Flower Moon,’” Scorsese said in a statement to CNN.
“It was a remarkable experience to make this picture, to work together with the Osage community to tell the story of a genuine American tragedy, hidden in the shadows of official culture for far too long,” the director added. “I only wish that Robbie Robertson had lived to see his work recognized—our many years of friendship and Robbie’s growing consciousness of his own Native heritage played a crucial role in my desire to get this film onscreen.”
Robertson, co-founder of The Band, who collaborated as a composer of several films with Scorsese, including “Killers of the Flower Moon,” died in August at the age of 80.
“Killers of the Flower Moon” notched 10 total nominations, including best picture, best actress in a leading role for Lily Gladstone, best actor in a supporting role for frequent Scorsese collaborator Robert De Niro, and best original score.
In that last category, Scorsese’s project is up against another record holder.
Legendary composer John Williams’ work on “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” earned him his 49th Oscar nomination for original score. With a total of 54 career Oscar nominations when including original song, Williams has more Academy Award nominations than any living person.
According to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences that is responsible for the awards show, the late Walt Disney held the overall record with 59 total Oscar nominations.
The Academy also noted that at the age of 91, Williams, who is best known for his work on the “Star Wars” franchise, is the oldest nominee in a competitive award category."

Bob Menendez investigation is ongoing, federal prosecutors say","By Kara Scannell, CNN","2 minute read Published 5:10 PM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/22/politics/bob-menendez-investigation/,"Federal prosecutors say their investigation into New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez is continuing as he faces numerous corruption charges, including that he acted as an agent for a foreign government, and pressure by fellow Democrats to resign.
Prosecutors referenced the ongoing investigation numerous times in a letter to the judge responding to media organizations request to unseal or unredact portions of recent motions filed in the case.
“Although the grand jury has returned indictments in this case, its investigation remains ongoing,” prosecutors said.
Prosecutors often say investigations are ongoing; however, in this case they have added to the allegations facing Menendez twice since they were initially announced.

Prosecutors said they don’t oppose removing redactions for certain information in the filings but argued against unsealing others because it could reveal matters under investigation.
“With an ongoing investigation, and in the shadow of an upcoming trial, any potential witness statement concerning matters under investigation or that may be the subject of trial – whether or not that particular witness is likely to be called – may influence or affect the testimony of other witnesses to those facts, affect the jury pool, or otherwise prejudice the course of the investigation or trial,” prosecutors wrote.
Menendez, his wife, Nadine Menendez, and three New Jersey businessmen were indicated last fall in an alleged bribery scheme involving payments in gold bars, hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, a luxury car and passing sensitive information to the Egyptian government.
A superseding indictment was later handed up charging Menendez and his wife with conspiring to act as a foreign agent to Egypt. Earlier this month a third indictment was returned adding a new allegation that Menendez took steps to help Qatar in order to help one of the businessmen receive a multimillion-dollar investment from a Qatari-related investment fund.
Menendez has vigorously denied any wrongdoing as he faces calls from fellow Democrats to resign. He and the others pleaded not guilty to the charges.
Last week Menendez and his wife asked the judge to sever their cases so he doesn’t have to choose between defending himself and having his lawyers make arguments that could impugn his wife. They are set to go to trial in May."
GVCMH9EQPP_QAP0S8F36G5X4QL,‘I don’t know why I’m not arrested.’ Anti-war presidential candidate ignites Russian anger,"By Clare Sebastian, CNN","3 minute read Updated 2:42 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/25/europe/russia-anti-war-presidential-candidate-boris-nadezhdin-intl/,"For the past week cities and towns across Russia have witnessed an unusual display of defiance.
No protests or picket lines, just patient, orderly queues. Dozens, if not hundreds of people lining up in freezing conditions to try to ensure an anti-war presidential candidate has enough signatures to get on the ballot for the vote in March.
It’s even happening outside of Russia, with volunteers collecting expats’ signatures in cities from London and Paris to Georgia’s capital Tbilisi.
Key endorsements from other Russian opposition figures, including associates of jailed Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny have helped. But the deadline to submit 100,000 signatures, with strict rules on quality and regional quotas, is January 31 – and time is running short.
The candidate is Boris Nadezhdin, on the surface an unlikely opponent for Vladimir Putin.
He’s a physicist by training, served one term in the state Duma 20 years ago, and by his own account joined the ranks of Russia’s opposition after the arrest of exiled oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky in 2003.
He went on to become an adviser to opposition leader Boris Nemtsov, assassinated within view of the Kremlin in 2015. “I know Putin very well from the 90s” he told CNN in an interview from Moscow on Wednesday, in which he spoke English.
“He was a normal Russian bureaucrat, and I was a normal Russian bureaucrat.”
He believes this may be why he can get away with publishing a manifesto calling Russia’s so-called “special military operation” a “fatal mistake,” in a country where spreading “false” information about the army carries a maximum 15-year prison sentence, and the most prominent opposition figure, Navalny, is serving a multi-decade prison term beyond the Arctic Circle.
Ultimately he admits, “I don’t know why I’m not arrested.”
The Kremlin says it doesn’t see him as a rival, but the speculation is that they are allowing Nadezhdin to continue, either so that Putin can win against an anti-war candidate, thereby affording himself a mandate to keep the war going, or to provide a release valve for an undercurrent of anti-war sentiment, to prevent it descending into mass protests.
Related article Putin’s election plan, Navalny’s disappearance. It’s no coincidence, Russian former minister says
Nadezhdin maintains his movement is real. “Millions of people understand,” he says, “we have to change the way Russia is going now, because Putin forced Russia into this track of militarization, this track of isolation.”
His plan, if elected, is to free all political prisoners on day one (including Navalny), call an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine and start peace talks.
For those waiting in line in the Moscow snow, this is not about Nadezhdin himself. Elizaveta from Bryansk, who declined to give her second name and from a border region now under regular drone attack, says the war has hit home.
“My town is in a special situation,” she tells us, “my main wish is that it should stop as soon as possible.”
Another supporter, who also wanted to be identified only as Ivan, tells us he doesn’t care if Nadezhdin is a Kremlin plant or not.
“I am prepared even for the candidate to be, as we say here, a representative of one of the Kremlin towers. For me the most important thing is that military action should stop and any vote in support of that will be valid.”
For several people we spoke to, whether Nadezhdin ends up on the ballot or not, this is a rare opportunity to play a part in Russian political life.
Gripping her hot tea handed out by volunteers, Elena puts it simply. “I think people should see that we want to show our position, that we exist.”

H1SSYV9Q4C_V3ACBBVW70GEABZ,Top UN court says Israel must take ‘all measures’ to prevent genocide in Gaza but stops short of calling for ceasefire,"By Christian Edwards, CNN","5 minute read Updated 1:58 PM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/26/middleeast/israel-genocide-case-icj-hague-ruling-south-africa-intl/,"The UN’s top court ordered Israel to prevent genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, but stopped short of calling for Israel to suspend its military campaign in the war-torn enclave, as South Africa had requested.
In a hearing in The Hague, the Netherlands, on Friday, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) said Israel must “take all measures” to limit the death and destruction caused by its military campaign, prevent and punish incitement to genocide, and ensure access to humanitarian aid.
South Africa had accused Israel of violating international laws on genocide, written in the wake of the Holocaust, and wanted the court to order Israel to cease fire in Gaza.
While the ICJ did not order Israel to end its war, the ruling represents a blow to Israel, which had hoped the case would be dismissed outright.
Friday’s decision related only to South Africa’s request for emergency measures, which act like a restraining order while the court considers the full merits of the genocide case, which could take years.

“The catastrophic humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip is at serious risk of deteriorating further before the court renders its final judgment,” Judge Joan Donoghue, the ICJ’s president, said Friday.
By an overwhelming majority, the court’s 17-judge panel voted in favor of six emergency measures, ordering Israel to “take all measures within its power” to prevent acts which could fall foul of the 1948 Genocide Convention, and to ensure its military does not commit genocidal acts in Gaza.
It also ordered Israel to “prevent and punish the direct and public incitement to commit genocide,” and to guarantee the “provision of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance” in the enclave.
Israel was also ordered to preserve evidence related to allegations of genocide and report back to the court on its compliance with these measures in a month.
The ICJ’s decisions are binding and cannot be appealed, but it has no way of enforcing them. In 2022 it ordered Russia to immediately suspend its invasion of Ukraine, but Moscow’s war rages on nearly two years later.
Israel had already indicated it would not accept the ICJ’s orders. “Nobody will stop us – not The Hague, not the axis of evil and not anybody else,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office wrote on X.
The court’s panel ordinarily comprises 15 judges, but was expanded in this case by additional judges from South Africa and Israel.
Israel’s judge Aharon Barak, an 87-year-old Holocaust survivor and former president of the country’s Supreme Court, voted in favor of two of the emergency measures, ordering Israel to curb incitements to genocide and to ensure aid can enter the enclave.
Apart from its call for a halt in fighting, the bulk of South Africa’s nine requests to the court were granted.
The Palestinian Authority Foreign Minister, Riyad al-Maliki, said the ICJ had “ruled in favor of humanity and international law” and thanked South Africa for bringing the case to the court.
South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa called the ruling a “victory for international law, for human rights, and above all for justice.”
While South Africa said it was “disappointed” that the court did not order a ceasefire, its Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor said she believes Israel will have to observe one if it is to comply with the other measures ordered.
“In exercising the order, there would have to be a ceasefire,” she said after the hearing. “Without it the order doesn’t actually work.”
Despite the court’s ordering emergency measures, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed the ruling as a rejection of discrimination against his country.
“Like every country, Israel has an inherent right to defend itself,” he said in a short video message. “The vile attempt to deny Israel this fundamental right is blatant discrimination against the Jewish state, and it was justly rejected.”
However, not all members of Netanyahu’s cabinet welcomed the ruling. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant criticized the court’s decision to hear the case altogether, claiming the ICJ “granted South Africa’s antisemitic request to discuss the claim of genocide in Gaza, and now refuses to reject the petition outright.”
Israeli war cabinet minister Benny Gantz said, “Those truly needing to stand trial are those that murdered and kidnapped children, women and the elderly,” referring to those killed and taken hostage by Hamas on October 7.
Palestinian militant group Hamas also welcomed the court’s decision in a statement on Friday, saying it anticipates further court decisions convicting Israel “of genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.”
Legal experts have said that, while the court did not grant the most explosive of South Africa’s requests, in finding that Israel is “plausibly” violating laws on genocide, its decision is damning.
“Even though it is not a definitive verdict, it is a very significant rebuke for the armed forces of a democratic state that sometimes says it has the most moral army in the world,” Janina Dill, co-director at Oxford University’s Institute for Ethics, Law and Armed Conflict, told CNN.
“The world court looked at (Israel’s) actions in Gaza and said it is not implausible that it’s violating the Genocide Convention. I don’t see how that can possibly be a victory. In some sense it’s a rebuke, and it is also a rebuke to the governments of the world that support Israel in its actions in Gaza,” she said.
In the initial hearing two weeks ago, South Africa alleged that Israel’s leadership was “intent on destroying the Palestinians as a group in Gaza,” and that its aerial and ground assaults aimed to “bring about the destruction” of Palestinians in the enclave.
South Africa and Israel are both parties to the Genocide Convention, meaning they are obliged not to commit genocide and to prevent and punish it.
Israel reacted furiously to the accusation and rejected what it called South Africa’s “grossly distorted story,” telling the court its war in Gaza was fought in self-defense, that it was targeting Hamas rather than Palestinian civilians, and that its leadership had not displayed genocidal intent.
It said the accusation of genocide was an attempt to “pervert the meaning” of the term and empty it of its “unique force.”
Israel claimed if genocidal acts had been committed, they were “perpetrated against Israel” on October 7, when Hamas fighters stormed into the country from Gaza, killing more than 1,200 people and taking 240 hostage, according to Israeli officials. Israel’s retaliatory offensive in Gaza has since killed more than 26,000 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in the enclave.

Cardinal Michael Czerny, who leads a Vatican department focused on social justice, stressed that while Francis might face criticism or being misunderstood, he has a moral imperative to speak out on behalf of Catholics.
“I think [what] he would say is, I speak out because of the commitment of the faithful. In other words, I’m not speaking because I have personally some kind of a special response to give. No, I speak out because there are millions of Catholics and other Christians and other believers and other people of good will for whom or in whose voice I’m speaking,” he told CNN. “And we’re trying to say to the world’s decision-makers that their decisions are anti-human, short-sighted, suicidal.”
The cardinal’s remarks came after the pope met with reporters on Monday January 22 at the Vatican, where he underlined the importance of responsible journalism in today’s world.
“Being a journalist is a vocation, somewhat like that of a doctor, who chooses to love humanity by curing illnesses,” the pope said. “In a certain sense, the journalist does likewise, choosing to touch personally the wounds of society and the world.”
From the moment of his election almost 11 years ago, the 87-year-old pontiff has been a newsmaker. His decision to avoid the trappings of office, live simply in a Vatican guesthouse and call for a “poor church for the poor” caught the attention of the world. But it’s been his willingness to address the pressing issues of the day that has made him a pope with a voice on the global stage.
He’s been ready to speak to on a range of topics from the death penalty to Artificial Intelligence while repeatedly calling for peace in Gaza and Ukraine, action on climate and greater efforts to help refugees fleeing war and poverty. Francis has given more media interviews than any other pope, always ready to meet and greet reporters on his trips abroad.
In a recent interview broadcast on Nove, which is owned by CNN’s parent company Warner Bros. Discovery, Francis addressed concerns about his health. Francis, who has recently recovered from a bout of bronchitis and had an abdominal operation in June, said he will remain in office for “as long as (he has) the ability to serve.”
The pope’s news making has helped him communicate the pillars of his papacy, chief among them being his consistent support for migrants.
Francis, whose grandparents narrowly escaped a deadly shipwreck when they migrated from Italy to Argentina, ensured that his first visit outside of Rome as pope was to the tiny Italian island of Lampedusa.
While there, he lamented the “global indifference” to refugees while remembering those who had died while trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea. In 2016, he described then-US presidential candidate Donald Trump’s anti-immigration rhetoric as “not Christian” and in the same year he bought back a dozen refugees on his papal plane after a visit to the Greeks island of Lesbos.
Czerny works closely with Francis in this area, and his office has been working to galvanize Catholics to welcome migrants in their communities.
“What we try to do is to help the church locally, wherever it is, to accompany the migrants and refugees, to welcome them, to protect them, to promote them and to integrate them,” he explains.
For Czerny, like Francis, migration is not about numbers but names, faces and people. His family fled Czechoslovakia for Canada when he was four years old. His grandmother was sent to Auschwitz and died soon after World War II.
“I wouldn’t be here talking to you if a family in Canada had not sponsored us,” he said.
The Canadian cardinal said Francis sees the migrant crisis as “a litmus test of our humanity” but one that the developed world is “largely failing.”
The issue is featuring in the US presidential race, with Republican candidate Trump making inflammatory claims that immigrants are “poisoning the blood of our country.” According to polls, 63% of white Catholics who attend Mass monthly or more often supported the former president in the 2020 election.
“It’s the church in the United States that needs to deal with this, needs to respond to it and needs to help God’s people to evaluate whether this discourse has any validity or whether it’s just ideology and fear,” Cardinal Czerny said when asked about the rhetoric being used. “Then they have to vote accordingly and I trust that they will.”
Another concern for the pope and the cardinal is Artificial Intelligence, with Francis recently calling for a treaty to regulate its use. Cardinal Czerny said the development of AI is “so fast in its evolution that for society to respond responsibly to the risks while benefiting from the benefits is not easy.” However, he stressed that countries need to work together to ensure that it “doesn’t become an affliction, a new suffering or a new risk for human life.”
But speaking with a prominent voice means facing criticism. Francis’ critiques of capitalism have led to accusations that he is a “communist,” while some politicians have questioned whether the pope was a credible voice to speak on climate change.
Czerny admitted there is “resistance” to Francis’ progressive message, but said the pope will “continue to be criticized” because he’s touching on “well-to-do-interests” that are both financial and political.
“Jesus had the same trouble in his time,” he said. “People were quick to apply labels and to try to corner him because the basic message was not to their liking.”
Some of the internal opposition to the pope has intensified following his move to authorize the blessings of same-sex couples. The Vatican doctrine office’s ruling that priests can bless couples in “irregular” situations saw bishops in Africa said they “generally prefer” not to bless same-sex couples.
“Yes, there will be criticisms,” said Czerny, who before coming to the Vatican worked in Africa and central America. He stressed Francis’ priority is not to avoid criticisms but “to include and console and bless and reconcile those who are suffering.”
Despite his age, the pope is far from slowing down. And despite his recent health problems, he’s unlikely to be cowed."
H3O3NIMTPP_MJ8ETUPLIZJMA7E,China’s largest oil supplier in 2023 was Russia,"By Laura He, CNN","3 minute read Published 2:25 AM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20231223,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/22/business/china-top-oil-supplier-2023-russia-intl-hnk/,"Russia surpassed Saudi Arabia to become China’s largest oil supplier in 2023, according to the latest Chinese customs data.
The world’s largest crude buyer imported a record amount of bargain-priced Russian oil last year, taking advantage of Moscow’s desperate search for new buyers amid Western sanctions following the Kremlin’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
The volume of Russian crude shipped to China jumped 24% in 2023 to 107.02 million metric tons, compared to 2022, according to data released by China’s General Administration of Customs on Saturday.
That helped Russia overtake Saudi Arabia as China’s largest crude oil supplier for the year. The Middle Eastern country shipped 85.96 million metric tons of crude oil to China in 2023, down 2% from 2022.
Russia now accounts for 19% of China’s oil imports, while Saudi Arabia makes up 15%.
Russia became China’s largest oil supplier eight years ago, but it fell behind Saudi Arabia between 2019 and 2021, when the Gulf nation boosted its energy trade with Beijing.
However, since 2022, China has amplified its purchase of cheaper Russian oil after the West hit Moscow with unprecedented sanctions. China’s imports of Russian crude increased 8% in 2022 to 86.24 million metric tons, compared to 2021. Its neighbor India also ramped up its purchases sharply.
“China would necessarily maximize intake of discounted crude,” said Vandana Hari, founder of Vanda Insights based in Singapore. “Russian barrels were way cheaper than comparable grades through 2023, being limited to the Chinese and Indian markets, more or less.”
China’s total spending on Russian crude reached $60.64 billion last year. That translates to an average import price of $566.64 per metric ton, according to CNN’s calculation. This was about 10% cheaper than the average price it paid for Saudi crude, which was $626.86 per metric ton.
Russia’s oil discounts have helped China reduce its energy bills. Despite an 11% increase in its overall volume of crude imports, including from Saudi Arabia and Iraq, its total spending on oil purchases actually dropped 7.7% in 2023 to $337.5 billion compared to 2022, customs data showed.
According to Hari, Saudi’s production cut also helped Russia to leapfrog. The Gulf nation implemented an additional voluntary output cut of 1 million barrels per day from July through December last year. Though Russia also volunteered additional output and export cuts, they were about half of the Saudi reduction, she added.
Despite the war, Beijing and Moscow have developed closer ties in areas other than energy over the last two years.
Overall trade between China and Russia hit a fresh record high of $240 billion in 2023, up 26% from the previous year. That means the two countries have achieved a goal set in 2019 about a year ahead of schedule.
In the two years since the invasion, hundreds of global brands have fled Russia. That’s forced Russians to find alternatives for everything from smartphones to cars, with Chinese firms often benefiting.
Last month, Chinese leader Xi Jinping hailed Beijing’s partnership with Moscow in a meeting with Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin.
The trade figures showed a “strong resilience and broad prospects,” Xi said during the meeting in Beijing, according to Chinese state news agency Xinhua.
The two sides should “give full play to the advantages of political mutual trust,” and “deepen cooperation on economy, trade, energy and connectivity,” Xi added.

H8OUKDKZXK_48VDJYENOUY3P3E,China says US military makes region more dangerous after Navy ship sails through Taiwan Strait,"By Brad Lendon, CNN","3 minute read Published 11:05 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/26/china/china-us-navy-taiwan-strait-intl-hnk-ml/,"China accused the United States military of “abusing international law” and continuing a pattern of “dangerous provocations” in East Asia Thursday, after a US Navy destroyer made the service’s first transit of the Taiwan Strait of 2024.
The movement on Wednesday of the USS John Finn through the waterway that separates democratically governed Taiwan from communist mainland China was also the first transit of a US warship through the strait since elections on the island two weeks ago.
The vote gave Taiwan’s ruling Democratic Progressive Party a historic third consecutive presidential victory, with the island’s voters shrugging off warnings from Beijing that its reelection would increase the risk of conflict.
China’s ruling Communist Party views Taiwan as part of its territory, despite having never controlled it, and leader Xi Jinping has not ruled out the use of military force to “reunify” the island with the mainland.
The US meanwhile is obligated under the Taiwan Relations Act to provide Taiwan with the military means to defend itself, something Beijing regards as interference in its internal affairs.
US Navy 7th Fleet spokesperson Cmdr. Meagan Greene said in a statement Wednesday that the transit of the USS John Finn through the strait was made “in accordance with international law.”
“The ship transited through a corridor in the Strait that is beyond the territorial sea of any coastal State. John Finn’s transit through the Taiwan Strait demonstrates the United States’ commitment to upholding freedom of navigation for all nations as a principle,” Greene said.
Related article CNN took an 11-day cruise through some of the most-contested waters on Earth. Here’s what we learned
While the John Finn’s transit of the Taiwan Strait was the first of 2024, US warships and warplanes regularly travel through and over the waterway. In 2023, US Navy and Coast Guard ships and Navy reconnaissance planes made 11 transits of the strait, according to a database kept by Collin Koh, research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.
On Thursday, China’s Defense Ministry said Washington was courting danger with its military activities in the region, saying a change in behavior is “needed to avoid maritime and air accidents,” according to the state-run Xinhua news agency’s English-language website.
“The root cause of the China-U.S. maritime and air security issues lies in the U.S. military’s harassment and provocations on China’s doorstep, engaging in prolonged, extensive and high-frequency activities in the maritime and aerial areas surrounding China,” the Xinhua story said, citing Defense Ministry spokesperson Wu Qian.
“He urged the U.S. side to stop abusing international law, cease all dangerous provocations, and strictly discipline its troops on the ground,” the story said.
Earlier this month, the commander of the US Indo-Pacific Command, Adm. John Aquilino, accused Beijing of ramping up tensions.
Aquilino told a defense forum in Hawaii that he expected a show of force from China against Taiwan in the wake of the election result.
“When something occurs that they don’t like, they tend to take actions,” Aquilino told the Pacific Forum’s Operationalizing Integration in the Indo-Pacific conference in Honolulu.
Koh, the Singaporean analyst, said Beijing may be a bit “miffed” at Washington at the moment, especially after agreeing to restart military-to-military talks in December.
“Given that Beijing very likely believes that it extended the olive branch by agreeing to reopen military-to-military communications and other high-level exchanges, it might have perceived a lack of reciprocity from the US,” Koh said."

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.
I host a podcast, “In the Room with Peter Bergen,” which focuses on national security issues. Every day, I see the merits of being part of an entirely remote workforce.
We have a production team, around half of whom live in Brooklyn and Manhattan, and the others live in places like Chicago, Mexico City and San Francisco. We have met in person only twice in the year that the production has been up and running, and we have put out dozens of highly produced episodes, often featuring multiple guests, which go through many rounds of edits.
In my four decades of working in media, I have never worked somewhere with a better esprit de corps, creative energy and a collective willingness to help everyone else out.
And yet, some corporate titans are still pushing for their employees to return to their offices. Banks like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase and tech giants like Meta are demanding that their staff be back at the office several days a week.
Those return-to-office demands are often couched in non-falsifiable claims about the necessity of having chance encounters at the office where folks bounce creative, productive ideas off of each other.
Typical of this view is JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who claimed in 2021 that working from home “doesn’t work for spontaneous idea generation.” There is no empirical evidence for this claim, and the desire for employers to see their employees working in their offices seems to be more about the need for control and an attachment to the old ways of doing things.
The return-to-office demands also make little sense from an overall economic perspective at a time when a third of Americans who can do their job remotely now only work from home, up from only 7% before Covid, according to the Pew Research Center, yet the economy is very strong in terms of low unemployment and GDP growth. If working from home suppressed innovation, productivity and creativity, you would expect quite different economic results.
Further, working from home saves Americans an average daily commute of 72 minutes a day, to say nothing about the reduced pollution and energy consumption that comes from fewer commuters, according to a 2023 University of Chicago study.

Working parents, in particular, benefit from not having to waste time, money and flexibility commuting to an office. A 2023 Bankrate survey found that 74% of working women with children are in favor of remote work, while 64% of all working Americans support it.
I have some insight into this as a parent who now works mostly from home. This arrangement gives me a lot more time to spend with my kids, and if there is any kind of unforeseen emergency, I can be there for them in a way that, during the era of the office, I couldn’t be.
The internet and cell phones obviate so much of what was once done at the office, which is, after all, largely an artifact of the 20th century thanks to the rise of mass transportation, the ability to build tall office buildings and the previous immovability of the “work” telephone, which was stuck to a desk. All this, thankfully, is going the way of the dodo.
During the office era, so many workers spent so much time at their desks that workplaces often tried to present themselves as some kind of alternative family. You had your “work husbands” and mandatory “team building” events. Of course, this all came at the expense of your loved ones at home, as you had to spend time away from them while doing all your office-based events and tasks.
I am writing this column in Washington, DC, but work with editors in New York, London or Atlanta. In fact, I have written several hundred of these columns over the past dozen years and I have never met most of the editors I work with, and yet I still have a warm, productive relationship with them.

To be sure, a Starbucks cappuccino is not going to make itself, and certain kinds of work environments — such as hospitals, restaurants, film sets or government offices where classified material is handled in a secure environment — require employees to be in person.
But for much of the economy where work doesn’t need to be in person, the demand to “return to office” is not rooted in any concern for employees, a large majority of whom want to work from home — not because they are lazy or don’t want to be productive, but because it gives them more freedom and control over their own lives.
So why do some bosses still feel it necessary to prolong the slow and necessary death of The Office? Beats me."
HMR4LS5BWM_YX124XDTXJZBXQH,Robert Kraft is buying a Super Bowl ad to highlight the rise of antisemitism,"By Jordan Valinsky, CNN","2 minute read Published 8:18 AM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/25/business/super-bowl-ad-stand-up-to-jewish-hate/,"A Super Bowl ad set to be shown during next month’s game will highlight the rise of antisemitism, with a 30-second spot from “Stand Up to Jewish Hate,” a campaign from the nonprofit organization founded by Robert Kraft, the billionaire businessman and owner of the New England Patriots.
It’s the first time his Foundation to Combat Antisemitism (FCAS) is buying an ad during the “most visible platform,” which last year was watched by 113 million viewers and was the third most-watched television program of all time.
Specifics of the ad weren’t released, but the organization said it builds on its “work to inspire Americans of all backgrounds to be vocal upstanders for the Jewish community and to stand up against all forms of hate.”
The “Stand Up to Jewish Hate” ad campaign debuted a few years ago in after several antisemitic incidents, including insidious comments from Kanye West (or Ye), but has taken on new significance in recent months following the October 7 assault by Hamas militants in Israel and some US college campuses becoming roiled in the subject.
A focal point of the “Stand Up to Jewish Hate” are its blue squares, which FCAS said is a “symbol of solidarity” for non-Jewish people to show their support for Jews by adding it to their social media presence.

“This message will make its debut at one of the country’s most significant cultural events to not only continue to push against indifference to Jewish hate, but also to celebrate those who stand up to all incidents of hate,” FCAS said in a press release.
According to FCAS research, 183 million posts on social media were related to antisemitism and Jewish culture in 2023 — a 330% increase from the prior year. The organization said Google searches for “Kill Jews” increased by 1,800% in the past three months.
Kraft, who built his estimated $11 billion fortune in the paper business, has recently poured millions of dollars into FCAS to combat the spread of hatred and raise awareness.
The Super Bowl airs on CBS on February 11, with ads costing a reported $7 million each."
HNYKNSKUVT_D95ZBOVAMSPAC0G,Defense secretary expected to return to Pentagon Monday after nearly a month away,"By Oren Liebermann, CNN","3 minute read Updated 6:19 PM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/26/politics/defense-secretary-austin-pentagon-return/,"Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is expected to return to the Pentagon Monday after nearly a month away and host NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, according to a defense official.
Austin was admitted to the hospital on New Year’s Day due to complications from surgery to treat prostate cancer in late-December. He spent two weeks at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center before he was released on January 15. Since then, he has been working from home, where he has continued his recovery.
On Friday, Austin visited Walter Reed Medical Center for a follow-up appointment. Doctors at the hospital released a statement saying he is recovering well and is expected to make a full recovery.
“Beyond planned physical therapy and regular post-prostatectomy follow up appointments, he has no planned further treatment for his cancer,” a statement from his doctors said.
Austin’s unannounced hospitalization, which was not disclosed to the media or President Joe Biden and other senior administration officials for days, raised major questions about transparency and communications within the Biden administration. Republicans have been highly critical of how the Pentagon handled Austin’s illness and the House Armed Services Committee has called on the defense secretary to testify next month about the failure to notify key government leaders.
The White House has new guidelines for agency notification of key absences following its review of each federal agency’s plans for “delegation of authority” when a Cabinet member is unable to perform his or her duties, White House chief of staff Jeff Zients said in a memo first reported by The Associated Press and obtained by CNN.
Every time there is a delegation of authority, Zients said in the memo to Cabinet secretaries, the agency must notify the offices of Cabinet affairs and White House chief of staff. Additionally, any delegation of authority must be documented in writing both when it has gone into effect and when it is over, he added.
Biden acknowledged earlier this month that Austin’s failure to notify him about his hospitalization was a lapse in judgment.
Austin’s chief of staff, Kelly Magsamen, directed a 30-day review of the Pentagon’s processes and procedures for notifying senior national security leaders and the White House when the defense secretary needs to transfer authorities to the deputy secretary, which was required during Austin’s hospitalization. And the Defense Department inspector general launched a separate investigation of whether the Pentagon had the appropriate policies in place to ensure an effective transfer of power and duties.
During Austin’s hospitalization and subsequent recovery at home, the Pentagon has said that he had full access to secure communications capabilities and was able to oversee a number of national security issues.
From the hospital, Austin authorized the first round of strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen and spoke daily with senior Pentagon officials. From his home on Tuesday, Austin hosted a virtual meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, making his first public remarks since he had been hospitalized.
Asked if Austin would take questions from the media upon his return to the Pentagon, press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder demurred.
Ryder said the Pentagon was “very aware of the request” but did not have a date to provide.

HOD65G7622_K00ET48HDSYI554,Top Senate Republican says border security package could rise above $14 billion as key sticking points remain,"By Ted Barrett, Morgan Rimmer, Lauren Fox and Clare Foran, CNN","5 minute read Updated 10:48 PM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/22/politics/senate-negotiations-border-policy/,"Senate GOP Whip John Thune said on Monday that the price tag for the border security provisions in a national security package that negotiators are working to finalize could rise above the $14 billion President Joe Biden initially requested for border security.
“That’s being discussed,” Thune acknowledged to reporters when asked if he thought the number was going to have to go up as negotiators search for policy solutions to the complex problems at the border.
Key issues remain outstanding in the effort to strike a deal on border policy that would unlock support to pass aid for Ukraine and Israel in the Senate. It is not yet clear when an agreement might be finalized or when the Senate would be able to hold a vote. Any potential deal already faces long odds in the Republican-controlled House and the cost of the package could add to the challenge of striking an agreement and pushing for its passage.
Border negotiators continued talking throughout the weekend and making progress with most areas of policy agreed to at this point, two sources familiar with the talks told CNN. However, negotiations over border security now hinge on how to appropriate the money, an area rife with major sticking points and political battle lines.
Republican Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma, one of the top Senate negotiators working to strike a deal on an immigration policy and foreign aid package, warned on Monday that it would be “quite a push” to begin voting on legislation this week.
“It’s not going to be ready today, to be able to go out,” Lankford said. “Everybody’s got to have several days to be able to go through it … it would be quite a push to be able to get it out this week.”
The Oklahoma Republican said that one major hurdle at this point is figuring out how to pay for the policies they are writing.
“That’s the biggest issue, is trying to be able to work through all the different pieces, how they cost and then how they function,” he said.
The race to reach an agreement comes as negotiators are facing a series of challenges: diminishing support for aid to Ukraine in the Republican Party, calls from some on the left to attach conditions on Israel aid and a warning from GOP presidential frontrunner Donald Trump not to agree to anything unless it’s everything Republicans are looking for on the border.
Even if a deal is finalized, House Republicans have already warned they would be prepared to reject a compromise measure they deem inadequate.
Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, another top Senate negotiator on the immigration and foreign aid package, told reporters the next major hurdle is figuring out how to pay for the legislation without making too many changes to the bill.
“Our work is largely done. We just need the appropriators to help us fund it rather than rewrite it,” he told reporters.
“We don’t have a deal until we have final text, until we have agreement from the appropriators to fund it, to fund the agreement,” Murphy said.
Murphy told reporters that “it’s possible” they will put the bill on the floor this week.  “I’m saying it’s possible. I don’t know whether that will happen, but it’s possible,” he said.
Thune noted that negotiators still have more work to do to finish text and warned that he’s “not real” optimistic a vote on the package will happen this week.
“There isn’t text yet. We gotta have text. Our members are gonna need time to review it so we’ll see,” he said.
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell had said last week that he hoped they could begin voting on a package this week.
On Monday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said while negotiators are getting ever closer, “there are a handful of issues that have not yet been agreed to” and it’s “not a done deal yet.”
“If presented with the opportunity to pass a national security supplemental here on the floor, we intend to act as quickly as possible. We’re not there yet. We’ll keep going,” he said. “We remain hopeful, but it’s certainly not a done deal yet.”
As the 2024 White House race increasingly looms large over the political landscape, lawmakers have had to contend with presidential politics as negotiations over a border package continue, a factor that threatens to make the effort even more fraught as Trump has openly criticized the idea of any compromise. “I do not think we should do a Border Deal, at all, unless we get EVERYTHING needed to shut down the INVASION of Millions and Millions of people,” he wrote on Truth Social last Wednesday.
Pressed on Trump’s position and how that could affect support for their final product, Lankford replied, “I don’t have any doubt he is supportive of trying to be able to secure the border. Where he is on this particular package, I don’t know, but there’s no question that he’s supportive of trying to secure the border and this is going to have a lot of new tools for any administration to be more effective at actually securing the border.”
Lankford noted that he has not spoken directly with the former president about the negotiations. “There may be a time for that,” he acknowledged.
Immigration policy is a notoriously difficult political issue, a major reason why efforts at compromise have failed in the past.
Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin was skeptical on Monday about proposals to alter the president’s ability to grant parole to immigrants, something that is a key demand of Republicans in the border security negotiations and may be a major part of their emerging deal.
“It’s too important at critical moments in history for the president to have that authority,” Durbin said.
Asked if he is open to changing or limiting parole or asylum,” Durbin said: “I have not seen a specific proposal, but I am skeptical of any diminution of the president’s power in this area.”
“I don’t want to prejudge it until it’s done,” he added.

That could spell trouble for other species","By Ayurella Horn-Muller, CNN","5 minute read Updated 9:24 AM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/23/world/flower-self-fertilization-pollinator-decline-scn/,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.
An ancient, interdependent relationship that contributes to food systems and ecosystem stability across the globe could be changing.
Many flowering plants can self-pollinate, or transfer pollen between their own blossoms for seed generation and propagation, but most of these plants have relied on pollinators such as butterflies and bees to reproduce.
Now — amid declines reported in many pollinator populations — a new study on the evolution of one flower species’ mating system has revealed a remarkable shift that  could exacerbate the challenges faced by the plants’ insect partners.
The flowers’ reproductive evolution may be linked to environmental changes such as habitat destruction and rapid ongoing decreases in pollinator biodiversity, according to Samson Acoca-Pidolle, who led the study published December 19 in the journal New Phytologist.

Comparing seeds of wild field pansies collected decades ago in France with the plants’ modern descendants, Acoca-Pidolle and his colleagues discovered that today’s flowers are smaller and produce less nectar as a result of increased self-pollination, which has direct impacts on pollinator behavior. The pansies of the past self-fertilized less and attracted far more pollinators than those of the present, according to the study.
“It seems that it’s only traits that are involved in plant-pollinator interaction that are evolving,” said Acoca-Pidolle, a doctoral researcher at the University of Montpellier. The changes could constrain the plants’ ability to adapt to future environmental changes and have implications for “all of floral biodiversity” — potentially diminishing flowering plants’ genetic, species and ecosystem variation.
“This may increase the pollinator decline and cause a vicious feedback cycle,” study coauthor Pierre-Olivier Cheptou told CNN. If plants produce less nectar, there will be less food available to pollinators, which will in turn accelerate the rate at which the animals’ numbers dwindle, he explained.
“The major message is that we are currently seeing the evolutionary breakdown of plant pollinators in the wild,” said Cheptou, an evolutionary ecologist at the French National Centre for Scientific Research and professor at the University of Montpellier.
Using a method called “resurrection ecology” to conduct the research, the study team germinated the seeds of four populations of wild field pansies, scientifically known as Viola arvensis, that were collected in the 1990s and early 2000s in the Paris region.
Some propagules, or parts of a plant that can be used to grow a new plant, can stay in a seed stage for a “very long time,” Acoca-Pidolle explained. They are living, but at a very low metabolic rate. “It’s like a long nap,” he said.

In 2021, the team sourced field pansies from the exact spot the ancestral seeds were collected 20 to 30 years earlier. The scientists then conducted a population genetic analysis that looked at self-pollinating rates and changes in heterozygosity, or genetic variability, as well as changes in floral traits that are associated with pollinator attraction.
In a sample of 4,000 flowers, rates of self-fertilization went from around 50% for the flowers collected two to three decades beforehand to roughly 80% for their naturally occurring descendants, the authors found. Meanwhile, the “resurrected” flowers’ surfaces were 10% bigger, produced 20% more nectar and were frequented by more bumblebees than their modern counterparts.
An increase in a flowering plant species self-pollinating, or “selfing,” isn’t always a bad thing, said Gretchen LeBuhn, a professor of biology at San Francisco State University who has studied interactions between pollinators and plants.
“The way to think of (selfing) is it’s sort of like a holding-on strategy,” said LeBuhn, who was not involved with the study. Although increasing selfing does often lead to a decline in genetic variation in a population, among several other negative consequences, it also can maintain the population, she added. “Like an insurance policy.”
Declining genetic variation within a plant population matters because those with a reservoir of genetic variation can better respond to major environmental changes, effectively reducing extinction risk.

But when reading the new paper, part of her “actually thought an increase in selfing means that the population is going to be preserved,” LeBuhn said. “If plants can persist through time, and pollinator populations increase again, it would say that this is a mechanism for preservation of species.”
It’s unclear whether that evolutionary shift can be reversed, however — although the new research suggests there is an expectation for a depletion in a plant population’s genetic diversity at term, according to Acoca-Pidolle.
“Some scientists believe there may be a tipping point after which a plant cannot go back,” he noted, adding that the evolutionary transition is classically considered to be “irreversible.” Investigating whether these wild pansies have the ability to recover from the impacts of selfing is the next big question, Acoca-Pidolle said.
In the meantime, it’s important to acknowledge that the authors don’t really have the data on what was happening with pollinators 20 to 30 years ago, LeBuhn said. “The one thing that they can’t document is the magnitude of difference in pollinators in these sites in that time and now,” she said — which stems from gaps in historic widespread pollinator monitoring.
“(The study) is a really important demonstration of the tight linkages between plant and pollinator communities,” LeBuhn said. “I think the next step in the research is understanding what the implications are for pollinators.”
Other recent studies have found that declining pollinator populations, an offshoot of harmful human activities, threaten the future of food crops and the survival of the many species that depend on them.
The growing body of research bolsters the case for urgent conservation measures — like developing and protecting flower-rich habitats that act as floral and nesting resources — to help stymie global pollinator declines, according to Acoca-Pidolle.
“Our impact is not only killing some individual plants … we are putting them on an evolutionary path that could be bad for them,” Acoca-Pidolle told CNN. “And even after we disappear, for a long time, we will have a footprint on this evolutionary trajectory of many species, of the biodiversity of the planet.”

HWFZ4E2A9K_9GVUZZA52AKAA64,"Icy conditions make for hazardous travel across central US, but warmer air is on the horizon","By Elizabeth Wolfe, Robert Shackelford and Mary Gilbert, CNN","5 minute read Updated 6:32 PM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240122,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/21/weather/rain-ice-storm-central-us-monday/,"Icy conditions are making for hazardous travel as freezing rain pelts large sections of the central US Monday. The freezing rain is being made possible by a large push of milder air slowly starting to overspread much of the winter-weary US.
A barrage of back-to-back winter storms this month have left at least 90 people dead in 13 states as severe conditions have left people crushed under fallen trees, trapped in tornadoes or tangled in snowy car accidents. Tennessee has experienced the brunt of the fatalities, with 34 storm-related deaths.
Now people from the southern Plains to the Great Lakes are seeing accumulating ice and freezing rain Monday. Weather officials and several local transportation departments have warned drivers to exercise caution – or stay off the roads entirely.
“Icy roads will make driving hazardous. Use extra caution and drive slowly!” the Weather Prediction Center said.
Morning commuters in parts of Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas discovered slick sidewalks and icy roadways Monday. At least a glaze of ice was reported in each state, according to National Weather Service data.
Even small amounts of ice are enough to cause significant issues on untreated, paved surfaces like roads and sidewalks. Areas that receive greater amounts of ice are more likely to endure tree damage and power outages.
Several school districts across the region have canceled classes Monday, including in Tennessee, Missouri, Arkansas and Oklahoma.
Meanwhile, parts of eastern Texas and the Lower Mississippi Valley have been showered with rain and thunderstorms as a wave of warm air engulfs the region. Unseasonably warm air will go on to overrun more of the US as the week progresses.
Moisture from the Gulf of Mexico began pushing northward over the weekend and into Monday, colliding with the cold air still hovering over parts of the central US to create ice and freezing rain conditions over the Plains and Midwest.
More than 50 million people from Arkansas to the Great Lakes are under winter weather alerts Monday, prompting road hazard warnings in several states.

Ice began to build up on bridges and overpasses in the area Sunday night, the weather service in Tulsa said in a forecast message. The forecasters warned drivers to use “extreme caution” if they have to travel and leave ample distance for stopping.
“Please slow down and use caution as rain may freeze to your vehicle while driving and roads that appear wet may actually be icy!” the Tulsa weather service said in a post.
In Missouri, videos on social media showed cars losing control traveling down an ice-covered hill. Elsewhere in the state, emergency responders literally spun out in any icy development.
Air travel was also hampered by the icy conditions. By Monday afternoon at least 850 flights were canceled in the US with more than 3,300 delayed. Cancellations jumped early Monday for Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport and the St. Louis Lambert International Airport due to freezing rain in the vicinity of each airport.
In Memphis, Tennessee, cold temperatures caused water mains to break, leaving thousands with their service interrupted over the weekend, Memphis Light, Gas, and Water CEO Doug McGowen said Sunday. Most should have their service restored by Monday, and a boil water advisory could be lifted by Thursday, McGowen said.
Separate from the early-week ice, brutal winter cold triggered time-sensitive rescues in Vermont. Twenty-three skiers and snowboarders were rescued after getting lost Saturday in the backcountry, according to the Killington Police Department, which deployed a team that “hiked, snowshoed and skinned approximately 5 miles, in frigid temperatures” to guide them to safety.
Significantly above-average temperatures will spread across the East by later in the week as a series of fronts and low-pressure systems usher in warmer air and tropical moisture.
After shivering through a frigid weekend, some cities will see daily high temperatures soar by nearly 30 degrees in the coming days.
Daily high temperatures across the region will tick up a few degrees each day through midweek before some of the warmest air arrives Thursday.
Thursday’s highs are set to hit the upper 60s and 70s in the Southeast and the 50s as far north as New York. More than 140 records for warmest daily lows could be broken by Friday in parts of the Southeast, where overnight lows will soar into the 60s.
The significant warm-up will not be confined only to the East. A large swath of the central US will also finally recover from the bone-chilling cold that persisted much of January.
“Temperatures thaw out this week & will stay well above normal through the end of January,” the weather service office in the Twin Cities posted on X, later adding a future of near-record highs “certainly looks possible, stay tuned!”
Though the rush of warm air will shake off the arctic blast that dominated much of the country’s weather through the weekend, it could usher in hazardous rain and flooding.
Heavy rain will bring a threat of flooding along the Gulf Coast and western portions of the Southeast until late in the week.
Approximately 37 million people across the affected areas are under threat of flash flooding and excessive rainfall through Thursday morning. As many as 5 to 6 inches of rain could fall by the end of the week, with some areas seeing even more.
Here’s a glimpse of where the heaviest rainfall is expected across the South through throughout the week:
• Monday – eastern Texas, western Louisiana and southwestern Arkansas• Tuesday – eastern Texas to Mississippi and southwestern Tennessee• Wednesday – Texas-Louisiana border to central Tennessee and northern Alabama• Thursday to Friday morning – Eastern Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama to the far western corner of North Carolina
Some areas will be under a Level 2 of 4 risk of excessive rainfall for several days in a row.

HXO1YEUVOE_HZ31ADQ2H3E6KSL,These Japanese beef croquettes are so popular there’s a 43-year waitlist,"By Maggie Hiufu Wong, CNN","6 minute read Published 8:42 PM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/japanese-kobe-beef-croquettes-43-year-wait-list-intl-hnk/,"If you order a box of frozen Kobe beef croquettes from Asahiya, a family-run butcher shop in Takasago City in western Japan’s Hyogo Prefecture, it’ll take another 43 years before you receive your order.
That isn’t a typo. Forty. Three. Years.
Founded in 1926, Asahiya sold meat products from Hyogo prefecture – Kobe beef included – for decades before adding beef croquettes to the shelf in the years following WWII.
But it wasn’t until the early 2000s that these deep-fried potato and beef dumplings became an internet sensation, resulting in the ridiculously long wait buyers now face.
CNN Travel spoke to Shigeru Nitta, third-generation owner of Asahiya, in 2022. At that time, the wait for the croquettes was a mere 30 years.
The highly coveted “Extreme Croquettes” are one of four types of Kobe beef croquettes available at Asahiya. Can’t wait nearly four decades? The shop’s Premier Kobe Beef Croquettes currently have a more palatable four-year waitlist.
“We started selling our products through online shopping in 1999,” Nitta said. “At that time, we offered Extreme Croquettes as a trial.”
Growing up in Hyogo, Nitta has been visiting the local ranches and beef auctions with his father since he was young.
He took over the shop from his father in 1994 when he was 30 years old.
After experimenting with e-commerce for a few years, he realized customers were hesitant to pay a hefty sum for prime beef online.
That was when he made a bold decision.
“We sold Extreme Croquettes at the price of JPY270 ($1.80) per piece… The beef in them alone costs about JPY400 ($2.70) per piece,” Nitta explained.
“We made affordable and tasty croquettes that demonstrate the concept of our shop as a strategy to have customers enjoy the croquettes and then hope that they would buy our Kobe beef after the first try.”
To limit the financial loss in the beginning, Asahiya only produced 200 croquettes in their own kitchen next to their shop each week.
“We sell the beef raised by the people we know. Our shop only sells meat that was produced in Hyogo Prefecture, whether it’s Kobe beef, Kobe pork or Tajima chicken. This has been the style of the shop since before I became the owner,” said Nitta.
In fact, Nitta’s grandfather used to ride to Sanda – another famous Wagyu-breeding area in Hyogo – by bike with a handcart to pick up the produce himself.
“Since around that period our shop had connections with local beef producers, so we did not have to get them from outside the prefecture,” Nitta added.

The cheap price tag of the Extreme Croquettes flies in the face of the quality of the ingredients. They’re made fresh daily with no preservatives. Ingredients include three-year-old female A5-ranked Kobe beef and potatoes sourced from a local ranch.
Nitta said that he has encouraged the ranch to use cow manure to grow the potatoes. The stems of the potatoes will then be fed to the cows, creating a cycle.
Eventually, his unique concept caught the attention of locals and media. When a report about Asahiya’s croquettes came out in the early 2000s, their popularity skyrocketed.
“We stopped selling them in 2016 because the waiting time became over 14 years. We were thinking of stopping orders, but we got many calls requesting to keep offering them,” Nitta said.
Asahiya resumed accepting orders for these croquettes in 2017 but raised the price.
“At that time, we raised the price to JPY500 ($3.40)-JPY540 ($3.65) with consumption tax. But since the export of Kobe beef began, the prices of beef have doubled, so the fact that the production of croquettes makes a deficit has not changed,” said Nitta.
Production has also been boosted from 200 croquettes a week to 200 per day.
“In reality, the Extreme Croquettes got way more popular than other products,” Nitta chuckled, laughing at his own money-losing business idea.
“We hear that we should hire more people and make croquettes more quickly, but I think there is no shop owner who hires employees and produce more to make more deficit… I feel sorry for having them wait. I do want to make croquettes quickly and send them as soon as possible, but if I do, the shop will go bankrupt.”
Fortunately, Nitta said that about half of the people who try the croquettes end up ordering their Kobe beef, so it’s a sound marketing strategy.

Each box of Extreme Croquettes, which includes five pieces, sells for JPY2,700 ($18.20).
The shop sends a regular newsletter to waiting customers updating them on the latest shipping estimate.
A week before the delivery date, the shop will confirm the delivery with the patient customers once again.
“Of course, some people have changed their email addresses. For those people, we call them directly and let them know the delivery date. They can change their address themselves through our website or when we call them, they can let us know,” explained Nitta.
Customers receiving croquettes these days placed their orders about 10 years ago. There are currently 63,000 people in ‘line’ as of January 2024.
Having a 40-plus-year list of unprofitable orders to fulfill can be stressful, especially as the price of Kobe beef and labor continues to rise.
But something more important has encouraged Nitta to keep going.
“When I started selling croquettes on the internet, I got many orders from remote isolated islands. Most of them had heard of Kobe beef on TV but had never had them because they had to go to cities if they want to try it. I realized that there were so many people who have never had Kobe beef.
“For that reason, I continued offering croquettes as a trial and get more orders for Kobe beef if they liked it. That was why I started it in the first place, so I didn’t really care if it was a deficit,” said Nitta.
One of the most memorable moments was when they got an order from a cancer patient who was about to go through surgery while waiting for their Extreme Croquettes.
“I heard that our croquettes were the patient’s motivation to go through surgery. That surprised me the most,” said Nitta.
The patient survived and has placed multiple orders since then.
Nitta received a call from the patient who told him “I hope to live long without reccurrence of cancer” after sampling his croquettes.
“I still remember that. I was moved by the comment,” said Nitta.
By letting more people enjoy Kobe beef, he hopes that the fame of these croquettes will help promote the local industry.
“I’m grateful. By becoming famous, I think I can help the whole industry, not just my shop, by making people who have not been interested in Kobe beef get interested. I want to have as many people as possible eat Kobe beef – not just from my shop,” said Nitta.

Asahiya now has two locations: their original store at Takasago City and a shop in Kobe city. Its frozen beef croquettes are only shipped domestically.
Though Asahiya primarily operates as a butcher, Nitta says travelers can visit their Kobe shop, where they sell two types of ready-to-eat takeaway snacks, called “Tor Road” and “Kitanozaka” croquettes, named after nearby streets.
“Kitanozaka” uses lean beef and is priced at JPY360 ($2.40) each. “Tor Road” uses short loin and chuck, and costs JPY460 ($3.10)."
HXRC823J33_FBWF8U126ZHZ6WA,Washington authorities have identified the last known remains tied to the ‘Green River Killer’,"By Joe Sutton and Aya Elamroussi, CNN","2 minute read Updated 4:22 AM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/23/us/washington-authorities-identify-last-remains-green-river-killer/,"Investigators in Washington state have identified the last known set of human remains connected to the so-called “Green River Killer” as those of a woman who was determined to be a victim more than 30 years ago, officials said Monday.
Tammie Liles’ partial remains were found in King County in 2003 and were labeled by authorities as “Bones 20” because authorities could not confirm the identity at the time, the King County Sheriff’s Office said in a news release.
Related article For decades, human remains tied to the ‘Green River killer’ were known only as Bones 17. Now, DNA testing has revealed a name
In 2022, the sheriff’s office began working with Texas-based forensic lab Othram on the case. The following year, the lab built a DNA profile and reached a preliminary identification of the remains as those of Liles, the sheriff’s office said.
Detectives collected a DNA sample from Liles’ mother, which was a positive match.
“With this identification, there are no other unidentified remains associated with the Green River Case,” the sheriff’s office said in the news release.
Liles was last seen in June 1983 working as a prostitute in the Seattle area. Her family reported her missing in March 1988, and a separate set of remains was identified as hers using dental records.
Liles is one of dozens of victims of the serial killer Gary Ridgway, known as the “Green River Killer.” The moniker came from a river south of Seattle where he began dumping his victims in 1982.
Authorities spent years investigating his killings. It wasn’t until November 2001 that Ridgway was arrested after DNA evidence linked him to some of the earliest victims in the string of unsolved killings in the Seattle area.
Ridgway pleaded guilty to 48 counts of aggravated murder in 2003, making him one of the most prolific serial killers in US history. He pleaded guilty to a 49th murder charge in 2011.
All but two of his victims’ bodies were found near Seattle. The others were found in Oregon.
Last month, King County authorities announced they identified the remains of Lori Anne Razpotnik, another of his victims. Razpotnik’s family had last seen her alive in 1982, before she ran away from her family’s home in Lewis County, south of Seattle. Her remains were referred to as “Bones 17” when they were found in 1985.
Ridgway, 74, is being held at the Washington State Penitentiary in Walla Walla."

The Liberty Policy Foundation, a conservative advocacy group, plans on launching an aggressive ad campaign in S﻿outh Carolina to see whether it can sway some public opinion against Biden and Democrats, according to a Republican strategist working with the group.
The ads rolled out on digital platforms Wednesday morning.
The ad campaign is targeting three groups, the strategist said: African Americans who disapprove of Biden and think he has been ineffective as president, small business owners and young Americans who lean independent.
The Liberty Policy Foundation sees the ads as a “high priority because we can test how or if it moves voters for the primary,” the strategist told CNN.
Republicans and conservative groups are trying to determine whether leveraging this issue can influence voter behavior and reduce the president’s vote count. Republicans are seeking to capitalize on what polls show is a dip in Biden’s support and enthusiasm among Democratic voters by potentially turning the proposed ban into a wedge issue in the 2024 election.
The strategist said the group is launching a mid-six-figure ad campaign in South Carolina followed by four other states a week later: North Carolina, Virginia, Nevada and Michigan, which are seen as potential swing states in a general presidential election.
Biden has yet to decide on whether to approve the FDA’s proposed ban on menthol cigarettes, which health advocates say would save hundreds of thousands of Black lives, but which could also be unpopular with some Black voters.
Menthol cigarettes are the preferred cigarette among many Black smokers after the tobacco industry heavily marketed menthols in the Black community for decades. Menthol cigarettes continue to be widely available and priced cheaper in Black communities, according to the nonprofit advocacy group, The Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.
CNN viewed the ad that’s set to run in the South Carolina market, which features a woman in a voiceover. “President Biden keeps talking about uniting Americans, bringing us together, so why is he pushing policies that continue to divide us? Like his proposal to criminalize menthol cigarettes. Community leaders have warned Biden about the unintended consequences of banning menthol cigarettes.” The ad shows headlines related to Eric Garner, who died after police held him in a chokehold. Police initially confronted Garner for allegedly selling cigarettes illegally.
Some civil rights leaders with ties to the tobacco industry have raised concerns with the White House that a ban would criminalize menthol cigarettes and lead to an increase in deadly police interactions.
The proposed menthol ban explicitly states it would solely be aimed at cigarette manufacturers and retailers, not individuals.
Other groups, such as the NAACP and the Congressional Black Caucus, support the proposed menthol cigarette ban.
In a report issued on Wednesday, the American Lung Association called for the Biden administration to act “swiftly” on the proposed ban.
“Menthol cigarettes make it both easier to start and harder to quit by reducing the harshness of the smoke and cooling the throat,” notes the association’s annual State of Tobacco Control report. Researchers estimate that a regulation banning menthol cigarettes would save about 654,000 lives over the next 40 years, especially those of Black smokers, who are disproportionately more likely to smoke menthols."
HZNDT75OOT_2U9WTT2VO17OQFN,GM’s self-driving car division is under investigation by DOJ and SEC after pedestrian dragging incident,"By Peter Valdes-Dapena, CNN","3 minute read Published 8:14 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/25/cars/gm-self-driving-car-unit-criticized/,"Cruise, General Motors’ self-driving vehicle unit, disclosed today that it is the subject of two federal investigations regarding its actions after a severe accident involving a Cruise “robotaxi.”
In just the latest setback in the auto industry’s attempt to perfect driverless cars, the company is being investigated by the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission, according to a Cruise blog post.
An investigation and report commisioned by Cruise and GM and released today found no evidence that Cruise staffers or executives lied to or misled regulators about the 2023 accident involving a pedestrian, but that they also did not volunteer details about what happened.
In meetings with regulators after the October 2 incident, Cruise officials attempted to show a full video of the impact, shot from the car. But “technical issues” prevented the regulators from seeing all of it clearly, according to the report. Cruise did not, then, point out to regulators the details of what actually happened.
When California regulators found out, later, that a Cruise vehicle had dragged a woman  20 feet across the asphalt following the impact, causing grievous injuries, Cruise’s permits to test fully autonomous vehicles in California were suspended.
Cruise later stopped all testing throughout the United States and has not resumed those operations.
Cruise’s chief executive and other executives also resigned and the company laid off nearly a quarter of its workforce shortly after the 2023 incident.
Cruise commissioned the law firm of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan to investigate the incident and Cruise’s response to it. The report is a result of that investigation.
The investigation concluded that “The reasons for Cruise’s failings in this instance are numerous: poor leadership, mistakes in judgment, lack of coordination, an ‘us versus them’ mentality with regulators, and a fundamental misapprehension of Cruise’s obligations of accountability and transparency to the government and the public,” Cruise posted in a summary of the report.
Before the accident, Cruise had been a leader in developing self-driving cars. It planned to expand its so-called “robotaxis” to a dozen or more cities in 2024. Mary Barra, the CEO of GM, has said she remains focused on the self-driving future. But the incident functioned as a major setback.
Immediately after the incident, Cruise employees were not, themselves, aware that the woman had been dragged, according to the report. Initially, Cruise staffers were focused on correcting stories in the media that implied the Cruise veihicle was the first to strike the woman. Actually, the pedestrian was struck by a human-driven Nissan car first and that impact propelled her into the path of the Cruise car.
Even after people in the company became aware the woman was then dragged by the Cruise car, Cruise did not update its press statements or present the full video to reporters, according to the report.
The report attributed its failures in communication to a “myopic focus” in clearing Cruise of fault in the initial impact.
“We acknowledge that we have failed to live up to the justifiable expectations of regulators and the communities we serve,” Cruise wrote in its blog post on the report. “In doing so, we also fell woefully short of our own expectations.”
Cruise told CNN it is cooperating fully with the federal investigations but cannot comment on them."
I0W56F79ZH_PJ5JMMEKTU3OBQS,6 people were killed when a plane headed to a diamond mine crashed in Canada’s Northwest Territories,"By Sara Smart and Chris Boyette, CNN","3 minute read Updated 2:23 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/23/world/canada-northwest-plane-crash/,"Four passengers and two crew members were killed when a plane headed to a diamond mine crashed in Canada’s Northwest Territories, authorities said Wednesday.
The lone survivor of Tuesday morning’s crash was initially taken to Fort Smith Health Centre and then transported by medevac to Stanton Territorial Hospital in Yellowknife, the Northwest Territories Coroner Service said in a statement. The survivor’s condition was not publicly released.
The plane was “en route from Fort Smith to the Diavik Diamond Mine” when the crash happened, the coroner’s office said. The global mining company Rio Tinto said it had employees on the aircraft.
“We have been informed by authorities that a plane on its way to our Diavik mine, carrying a number of our people, crashed near Fort Smith, Northwest Territories, Canada, resulting in fatalities,” the company said in a statement Wednesday.
Fort Smith is on the border with Alberta.

“As a company we are absolutely devastated by this news and offering our full support to our people and the community who are grieving today,” Rio Tinto Chief Executive Jakob Stausholm said in the statement. “We are working closely with authorities and will help in any way we can with their efforts to find out exactly what has happened.”
CNN has reached out to Rio Tinto for more information.
The Northwest Territories Coroner Service said its representatives are working with local authorities to access the crash site and start the recovery process.
“The NWT Coroner Service would like to express our condolences to the families and community of Fort Smith during this very tragic and difficult time,” the statement said.
On Tuesday morning, the Canadian Rangers and the Royal Canadian Air Force responded to a report of lost contact with an aircraft outside of Fort Smith, an RCAF spokesperson in Winnipeg, David Lavallee, told CNN Canada news partner CBC News.
Visibility was poor during the early hours Tuesday morning but improved by around 10 a.m., according to CNN’s weather team.
The Fort Smith Health Centre activated its mass casualty protocol around 8:50 a.m. on Tuesday, according to the Northwest Territories Health and Social Services Authority.

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the Canadian Rangers and the Royal Canadian Air Force also responded. Investigators with the Transportation Safety Board were also sent to Fort Smith following the crash.
The aircraft involved is a British Aerospace Jetstream registered to Northwestern Air Lease, according to the Transportation Safety Board of Canada, which said it is investigating the crash. The aircraft can carry up to 19 passengers, according to Northwestern Air Lease’s website.
The coroner’s office said the two crew members worked for Northwestern Air Lease. CNN has reached out to Northwestern Air Lease for comment.
R.J. Simpson, the premier of the Northwest Territories, released a statement extending his condolences to the families, friends and loved ones of those who were aboard the airplane. He also encouraged affected residents to seek support and use mental health resources provided by the government.
“The impact of this incident is felt across the territory,” Simpson said. “The people we lost were not just passengers on a flight; they were neighbors, colleagues, friends, and loved ones. Their stories and contributions to our communities will not be forgotten.”

“Everything burned down,” Acting Minister of Culture Dinara Smyr said, according to the region’s Apsnypress news agency. “This is an irreparable loss for the national culture of Abkhazia. I am choking with tears. It is difficult for me to speak.”
Apsnypress reported that the gallery’s collection included around 300 works by Alexander Chachba-Shervashidze, an exiled painter whom the breakaway republic considers to be the “first professional Abkhazian artist.” None of his pieces are thought to have survived, said Smyr.
The National Art Gallery is in Sukhumi, the separatist republic’s capital city. Abkhazia has declared its own government and is propped up by Russia, but is not officially recognized as a state by most countries or by the United Nations. According to Abkhazia’s State Committee for Statistics, the region’s population was around 244,000 in 2021.
Picasso, Rembrandt and Goya works feared lost following fire at Seattle art gallery
The National Art Gallery’s Central Exhibition Hall caught fire overnight, and emergency services were called to the scene early Sunday morning, according to state media. By 7 a.m. local time the flames were contained, and by 11 a.m. the blaze was extinguished, Apsnypress said, adding that 11 fire brigades were called to the site from surrounding areas.
“The death of the works of art that made up the fund of the National Art Gallery is an irreparable loss for the cultural heritage of our state,” Abkhazia’s Parliament said in a statement posted on state media.
Around 150 paintings by Abkhaz artists survived the fire, Apsnypress reported, citing Smyr. The news agency also said that Abkhazia’s Prosecutor General’s Office has opened an investigation into the cause of the blaze.
In a social media post, Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili called the fire a “tragedy for us all.”  She also criticized the region’s leadership, saying, “I deplore what is a direct consequence of the neglect of cultural identity both by the de-facto leadership and the Russian occupants.”

I3GULWPUQA_TBQ5EQRP8P3I073,Trump joins effort to get Fulton County DA dismissed from 2020 election case over affair allegations,"By Holmes Lybrand, CNN","2 minute read Updated 9:02 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/25/politics/trump-willis-fulton-county-2020-election-case/,"Donald Trump’s attorneys are joining calls for the dismissal of Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis in the 2020 election subversion case against the former president and his co-defendants in Georgia, pointing to alleged misconduct between Willis and her lead prosecutor.
In a filing in Fulton County Superior Court on Thursday, Trump’s attorneys joined an effort to dismiss the case brought by one of his co-defendants, who alleged in a previous court filing that Willis was engaged in a romantic relationship with the special prosecutor on the case and has benefitted financially when he took her on vacations.
The filing also points to public comments Willis recently made defending her choice to select the lead prosecutor, Nathan Wade, arguing that she violated Georgia rules for prosecutors.
“The motion filed today on behalf of President Trump seeks to hold District Attorney Willis legally accountable both for the misconduct alleged in a motion filed by Mr. Roman as well as her extrajudicial public statements falsely and intentionally injecting race into this case,” Trump’s attorney, Steve Sadow, wrote in a statement.
In comments Willis made at Atlanta’s Big Bethel A.M.E. Church earlier this month, the DA defended her team of prosecutors in the case, calling into question why only one of the three prosecutors was being attacked.
“Is it that some will never see a Black man as qualified – no matter his achievements? What more can one achieve? The other two have never been judges, but no one questions their credentials,” Willis remarked.
The district attorney’s office declined to comment on the latest filing.
Trump’s attorneys claim that Willis made a “calculated effort to foment racial bias” against the defendants with her comments, which run the risk of prejudicing the public and prospective jurors.
“The DA’s comments directly ran afoul of Georgia Rules of Professional Conduct,” Trump attorneys wrote in the filing, adding that the maximum penalty for the alleged violation is disbarment.
“Her attempt to foment racial animus and prejudice against the defendants in order to divert and deflect attention away from her alleged improprieties calls out for the sanctions of dismissal and disqualification,” Sadow said in his statement."
I4L5Y27813_MISKRRYFVQIL6O2,US carries out airstrikes on Iranian-backed militias in Iraq,"By Oren Liebermann, Haley Britzky and Natasha Bertrand, CNN","5 minute read Updated 11:54 AM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/23/politics/us-strikes-iran-backed-militia-iraq/,"The US carried out airstrikes in Iraq targeting facilities used by Iranian-backed militias in the country on Tuesday following repeated attacks on US forces, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced in a statement.
The strikes targeted three facilities used by Iranian-backed Kataib Hezbollah and other Tehran-affiliated groups in Iraq.
Austin said in the statement that the strikes “are in direct response to a series of escalatory attacks against US and coalition personnel in Iraq and Syria” by Iranian-backed militia groups.
US Central Command also released a statement on Tuesday saying US forces “conducted unilateral airstrikes” targeting “KH headquarters, storage, and training locations for rocket, missile, and one-way attack UAV capabilities.”
According to a US defense official, the strikes were carried out in two sites in western Iraq, including Al-Qa’im near the Syrian border, as well as Jurf al-Sakhar south of Baghdad.
“I am grateful for both the skill and professionalism with which our personnel planned and conducted these strikes and the continued efforts of our troops on the ground as they work with regional partners to further dismantle and degrade ISIS,” Austin said in Tuesday’s statement.
“The President and I will not hesitate to take necessary action to defend them and our interests. We do not seek to escalate conflict in the region. We are fully prepared to take further measures to protect our people and our facilities. We call on these groups and their Iranian sponsors to immediately cease these attacks,” Austin added.
The airstrikes killed up to seven Kataib Hezbollah fighters, according to to US defense officials, who on Wednesday cited the US’ preliminary battle damage assessment.
The strikes also destroyed two headquarters buildings and an intelligence facility used by the Iran-backed militant group and associated groups, the officials said.
At least one Kataib Hezbollah fighter was killed and two were injured following the US airstrikes, according to a statement from the Popular Mobilization Front operation command.
Jafar al-Hussaini, the military spokesman for Kataib Hezbollah, wrote on X that the group will “continue to strike the strongholds of the enemies, in support of our people in Gaza until the brutal killing machine backed by America stops, and the complete siege is lifted. This is the promise of the free people.”
The strikes come just days after US personnel at Al-Asad Air Base in Iraq were injured in a ballistic missile and rocket attack on the base. While most missiles and rockets were intercepted by the base’s air defenses, some projectiles made impact, US Central Command said over the weekend.
The initial assessment is that Kataib Hezbollah was responsible for the ballistic missile attack, the defense official said.
Pentagon spokesman Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said Tuesday that a total of four US troops were diagnosed with traumatic brain injury as a result of the attack, and all had since returned to duty.
The strikes on Tuesday are the first in Iraq since the beginning of the month, when the US targeted a member of an Iranian proxy group operating in the country who one US official said had “US blood on his hands.” They also come after multiple strikes against the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen over the last week and a half, as the US looks to rein in the aggressive actions of Iranian-backed groups in the Middle East amid heightened tensions in the region.
US forces in Iraq and Syria have come under attack at least 151 times since attacks began on October 17, according to a US official — 10 days after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7. And while officials have not directly connected the two situations, the ongoing attacks on US forces have fed into heightened tensions and concerns about broader conflict breaking out in the region, particularly when coupled with the regular attacks on commercial shipping by the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen.
“We’ve continued to see attacks on our forces since October 17th in Iraq and Syria. The attack that we saw over the weekend was just a larger scale attack,” Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh said Monday. “But again, we don’t seek conflict, we don’t want to see this widen out to a regional war, we don’t want … to continue to see our forces being put at risk.”
The US’ actions against the Iran-backed militias in Iraq have appeared to strain tensions between the US and the Iraqi government. Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani told Reuters this month that that there should be a “quick” time frame for the US-led coalition’s exit from the country. The US has maintained that it is in Iraq at the invitation of its government, as part of the ongoing mission to defeat ISIS.
“There is a need to reorganize this relationship so that it is not a target or justification for any party, internal or foreign, to tamper with stability in Iraq and the region,” Sudani said. Ryder said at the Pentagon on Tuesday that he was not aware “of any official notifications” to the Pentagon regarding a withdrawal of US forces.
The US has carried out a number of strikes in Iraq and Syria in response to the attacks on coalition forces, placing blame squarely on Iran for supporting the militia groups carrying out the attacks.
In October, following US airstrikes on facilities linked to Iranian-backed militias, a senior defense official said Tehran was “the center of gravity” for the attacks, and that “Iranian fingerprints are all over this.”
“Tehran and Iranian senior leaders are funding, arming, equipping, training and directing a whole plethora of militia groups across the region, and they have escalated attacks against US forces since October 17, which is why we took self-defense action,” the official said.
While the attacks in Iraq and Syria have been ongoing, the US has also been managing regular attacks by the Houthis in Yemen on commercial shipping. The strikes on Tuesday followed strikes on the Houthis on Monday, carried out by the US and UK, which a senior official said were successful in striking weapons storage sites, drone systems, and missiles.
The US also conducted strikes Tuesday evening against two Houthi anti-ship missiles that were aimed into the Southern Red Sea and were prepared to launch, according to US Central Command.
“U.S. forces identified the missiles in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen and determined that they presented an imminent threat to merchant vessels and the U.S. Navy ships in the region. U.S. forces subsequently struck and destroyed the missiles in self-defense,” CENTCOM said in a statement.

I65ANBY8UO_C8PCQ2M3EO77009,Chinese stocks are having their worst start to a year since 2016,"By Anna Cooban and Laura He, CNN","4 minute read Updated 1:23 PM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240122,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/22/business/china-stock-market-falls-2016-crash/,"China’s stock market had a rough 2023 and the rout has accelerated in the first few weeks of the new year, after Beijing dashed hopes that it might do more to support the struggling economy.
Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index fell 2.3% Monday, closing at its lowest level since October 2022. The index has lost more than 12% so far this month, nearly as much as it lost in all of 2023.
Mainland China’s Shanghai Composite Index tumbled 2.7% in its biggest daily drop since April 2022. The Shenzhen Component Index, a tech-heavy benchmark, had its worst day in nearly two years, plunging 3.5%. The indexes have tanked 4.8% and 7.7% respectively in the first trading days of 2024.
It’s the worst start to a year for Chinese stocks since 2016, when investors were ditching their holdings following a market crash in 2015. A bubble popped as the economy showed signs of strain and share prices got way ahead of company profits.
In recent months, a real estate crisis, the slowest growth (outside the pandemic) in decades, and a crackdown on some businesses have all combined to undermine investor confidence.
Ken Cheung, chief Asian foreign exchange strategist for Mizuho Bank, said Monday that foreign investors were continuing to “reduce their risk exposure” to China and had “bearish expectations” for business conditions in the country.
“The Chinese government has not yet introduced effective measures to resolve the property turmoil and drive the economic recovery,” he wrote in a note.
Investors were left disappointed on Monday after China’s central bank decided to keep its benchmark lending rate steady. A cut to the rate would lower the cost of borrowing for people and businesses taking out loans or paying down interest, and therefore help stimulate economic activity.

The heavy market losses in 2024 come hot on the heels of a bruising run last year, when the CSI 300 index, comprising 300 major stocks listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen, fell more than 11%.
By contrast, the United States’ benchmark S&P 500 index climbed 24% in 2023, while Europe’s grew almost 13%. Japan’s Nikkei 225 soared 28% last year and is still going strong, notching gains of nearly 10% so far this month.
Demographic data released last Wednesday confirming that China’s population is getting older and smaller hasn’t helped quell investors’ anxieties. They were also perturbed that a speech delivered by Chinese Premier Li Qiang last week at the World Economic Forum failed to mention any new government stimulus measures to help juice the country’s ailing economy.
Brian Martin & Daniel Hynes, analysts at ANZ Research, wrote in a Friday research note that Li’s speech had “doused” expectations of further support measures. “(He) trumpeted the nations’ ability to hit its 5% growth target without flooding the economy with massive stimulus,” they wrote.
In recent months, Beijing has issued $137 billion worth of government bonds, the bulk of which will fund infrastructure projects, while China’s sovereign wealth fund has bought shares to support the country’s sagging stock market.
Li’s speech appears to have dealt another blow to investors already wearied by a raft of disappointing economic data coming out of Beijing, including the ongoing crisis in its real-estate sector and a rapidly shrinking population.
The country’s economy grew by 5.2% last year. That beat government projections but is still one of China’s worst economic performances in over three decades. The International Monetary Fund forecasts the country’s economic growth to slow to 4.2% this year.
In 2023, investors had eagerly anticipated a rebound in China’s economy following Beijing’s decision to scrap its strict zero-Covid policy at the end of the previous year. That robust recovery never came and investors voted with their feet. According to China’s Commerce Ministry, foreign direct investment into the country fell 8% in 2023 compared with the prior year.
Investors have also balked at Beijing’s sweeping crackdown on private enterprise, which began in late 2020 and has included fining foreign companies and detaining their employees in the name of national security.

In his January 16 speech, Li tried to reassure international investors that China presented “not a risk but an opportunity” and pledged to create a “world-class” environment for foreign companies to do business in the country.
He noted that the number of people classed as middle-income in China is expected to double to 800 million over the next decade. “The momentum for consumption … is very strong,” he said.
“Investors who willingly take on exposure to the precarious situation in China need to know the risks or may find themselves at the mercy of an unpredictable and authoritarian financial landscape,” Stephen Innes, managing﻿ partner of SPI Asset Management, wrote in a Friday note.
“Success is contingent on buying shares that avoid government scrutiny, making the entire investment process more akin to a game of chance than an informed decision-making process.”"
I6KGDF5JF1_6MJ5U65WQYX1A7P,Opinion: We Brits don’t need tea-brewing advice from Americans,Opinion by Rosa Prince,"3 minute read Published 6:54 AM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/26/opinions/tea-salt-us-uk-prince/,"Editor’s Note: Rosa Prince, a journalist, is London Playbook editor for POLITICO. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion at CNN.
It was always going to be a sensitive subject.
Almost exactly 250 years after the Sons of Liberty dumped chests of tea into Boston Harbour, a professor from Bryn Mawr College has committed a crime against the British cuppa very nearly as grave. With scant regard to diplomatic relations, chemist Michelle Francl advised in her new book “Steeped: The Chemistry of Tea” that to create the perfect brew, a grain of salt should be added to the mix.
The response was swifter than a military scramble to a nuclear code red.
“Tea is the elixir of camaraderie, the bond that unites our nations,” the US Embassy in London stated in an official communique rushed out on X in a desperate bid to avert an international incident. “We cannot stand idly by as such an outrageous proposal threatens the very foundation of our Special Relationship.”
Battle stations might have been stood down … had the release not gone on: “The US Embassy will continue to make tea in the proper way – by microwave.”
Well. Far from calming tensions, the words doubled down on the original offense, triggering flashbacks in the soul of every Brit who ever strayed west of Iceland.
It’s downtown LA; Midtown Manhattan; Rust Bucket Indiana. In our innocence we’ve gone and ordered a cup of Rosie Lee. It arrives: a chilly bag floating atop a cup of bathwater. What purports to be a nice cuppa accompanied not by good honest cow’s milk but some kind of yellow citrus thing.
Worse is when the tea itself is some unconscionable fruit or “’erbal” flavor. Or, god forbid, arrives not in a good honest tea bag, but taking the false form of — shudder — tea leaves.
One of the highlights of my 10 years living in New York City was the day the local grocery store opened a “British section,” with Ribena, Bourbon biscuits and, most satisfying of all for a homesick limey, Tetley tea bags.
I once visited a tea factory in Sri Lanka where a lovely worker gave a whole spiel about how the finest teas came from the tips of the leaves, and that people who drank the stuff made from bags were basically consuming the sweepings from the floor.
Being British, I was too polite to point out that sweepings from the floor are what we like to drink, were raised to drink, celebrate drinking in daily, some cases hourly rituals. My mother’s best friend would give her children sweet milky tea in their bottles as soon as they were off the breast, a custom considered a little precocious, perhaps, but certainly not eccentric.

I took up the tea habit when I was about 12 or 13, and like most of my countrymen and women have had a cuppa four or five times a day ever since. It’s less edgy than coffee, cheaper than gin and generally a soothing, unifying kind of thing, particularly when shared with others. You’re offered a cuppa char if you’ve given birth, witnessed a murder, come home from a crappy day at work.
And there are definite wrongs and rights about how to brew up. Too weak, and you’ll be accused of serving “gnat’s piss”; leave the bag in too long and it’s “stew.” You’re generally considered a good egg if you prefer “builder’s,” named for the construction workers who endearingly prefer that customers provide a steady stream of cups of strong tea with only a splash of milk to the generous cash tips their American cousins favour.
As to the question of whether or not to add sugar; to my mind it seems a little immature over the age of puberty but who am I to judge?
However, salt? Salt? Whether in the seas of Boston Harbour or some mad prof’s lab in rural Pennsylvania, tea and salt do not mix and that, my Yank friends, is that."

IAOB7WIWZU_QCHW8Q4H8UT14Y6,Mammography AI can cost patients extra. Is it worth it?,"By Michelle Andrews, KFF Health News","6 minute read Published 6:00 AM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/26/health/ai-mammograms-kff-health-news/,"As I checked in at a Manhattan radiology clinic for my annual mammogram in November, the front desk staffer reviewing my paperwork asked an unexpected question: Would I like to spend $40 for an artificial intelligence analysis of my mammogram? It’s not covered by insurance, she added.
I had no idea how to evaluate that offer. Feeling upsold, I said no. But it got me thinking: Is this something I should add to my regular screening routine? Is my regular mammogram not accurate enough? If this AI analysis is so great, why doesn’t insurance cover it?
I’m not the only person posing such questions. The mother of a colleague had a similar experience when she went for a mammogram recently at a suburban Baltimore clinic. She was given a pink pamphlet that said: “You Deserve More. More Accuracy. More Confidence. More power with artificial intelligence behind your mammogram.” The price tag was the same: $40. She also declined.

In recent years, AI software that helps radiologists detect problems or diagnose cancer using mammography has been moving into clinical use. The software can store and evaluate large datasets of images and identify patterns and abnormalities that human radiologists might miss. It typically highlights potential problem areas in an image and assesses any likely malignancies. This extra review has enormous potential to improve the detection of suspicious breast masses and lead to earlier diagnoses of breast cancer.
While studies showing better detection rates are extremely encouraging, some radiologists say, more research and evaluation are needed before drawing conclusions about the value of the routine use of these tools in regular clinical practice.
“I see the promise and I hope it will help us,” said Etta Pisano, a radiologist who is chief research officer at the American College of Radiology, a professional group for radiologists. However, “it really is ambiguous at this point whether it will benefit an individual woman,” she said. “We do need more information.”
The radiology clinics that my colleague’s mother and I visited are both part of RadNet, a company with a network of more than 350 imaging centers around the country. RadNet introduced its AI product for mammography in New York and New Jersey last February and has since rolled it out in several other states, according to Gregory Sorensen, the company’s chief science officer.
Sorensen pointed to research the company conducted with 18 radiologists, some of whom were specialists in breast mammography and some of whom were generalists who spent less than 75% of their time reading mammograms. The doctors were asked to find the cancers in 240 images, with and without AI. Every doctor’s performance improved using AI, Sorensen said.
Among all radiologists, “not every doctor is equally good,” Sorensen said. With RadNet’s AI tool, “it’s as if all patients get the benefit of our very top performer.”
But is the tech analysis worth the extra cost to patients? There’s no easy answer.

“Some people are always going to be more anxious about their mammograms, and using AI may give them more reassurance,” said Laura Heacock, a breast imaging specialist at NYU Langone Health’s Perlmutter Cancer Center in New York. The health system has developed AI models and is testing the technology with mammograms but doesn’t yet offer it to patients, she said.
Still, Heacock said, women shouldn’t worry that they need to get an additional AI analysis if it’s offered.
“At the end of the day, you still have an expert breast imager interpreting your mammogram, and that is the standard of care,” she said.
About 1 in 8 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer during their lifetime, and regular screening mammograms are recommended to help identify cancerous tumors early. But mammograms are hardly foolproof: They miss about 20% of breast cancers, according to the National Cancer Institute.
The FDA has authorized roughly two dozen AI products to help detect and diagnose cancer from mammograms. However, there are currently no billing codes radiologists can use to charge health plans for the use of AI to interpret mammograms. Typically, the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services would introduce new billing codes and private health plans would follow their lead for payment. But that hasn’t happened in this field yet and it’s unclear when or if it will.
CMS didn’t respond to requests for comment.
Thirty-five percent of women who visit a RadNet facility for mammograms pay for the additional AI review, Sorensen said.
Radiology practices don’t handle payment for AI mammography all in the same way.
The practices affiliated with Boston-based Massachusetts General Hospital don’t charge patients for the AI analysis, said Constance Lehman, a professor of radiology at Harvard Medical School who is co-director of the Breast Imaging Research Center at Mass General.
Asking patients to pay “isn’t a model that will support equity,” Lehman said, since only patients who can afford the extra charge will get the enhanced analysis. She said she believes many radiologists would never agree to post a sign listing a charge for AI analysis because it would be off-putting to low-income patients.
Sorensen said RadNet’s goal is to stop charging patients once health plans realize the value of the screening and start paying for it.
Some large trials are underway in the United States, though much of the published research on AI and mammography to date has been done in Europe. There, the standard practice is for two radiologists to read a mammogram, whereas in the States only one radiologist typically evaluates a screening test.
Interim results from the highly regarded MASAI randomized controlled trial of 80,000 women in Sweden found that cancer detection rates were 20% higher in women whose mammograms were read by a radiologist using AI compared with women whose mammograms were read by two radiologists without any AI intervention, which is the standard of care there.
“The MASAI trial was great, but will that generalize to the U.S.? We can’t say,” Lehman said.

In addition, there is a need for “more diverse training and testing sets for AI algorithm development and refinement” across different races and ethnicities, said Christoph Lee, director of the Northwest Screening and Cancer Outcomes Research Enterprise at the University of Washington School of Medicine.
The long shadow of an earlier and largely unsuccessful type of computer-assisted mammography hangs over the adoption of newer AI tools. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, “computer-assisted detection” software promised to improve breast cancer detection. Then the studies started coming in, and the results were often far from encouraging. Using CAD at best provided no benefit, and at worst reduced the accuracy of radiologists’ interpretations, resulting in higher rates of recalls and biopsies.
“CAD was not that sophisticated,” said Robert Smith, senior vice president of early cancer detection science at the American Cancer Society. Artificial intelligence tools today are a whole different ballgame, he said. “You can train the algorithm to pick up things, or it learns on its own.”
Smith said he found it “troubling” that radiologists would charge for the AI analysis.
“There are too many women who can’t afford any out-of-pocket cost” for a mammogram, Smith said. “If we’re not going to increase the number of radiologists we use for mammograms, then these new AI tools are going to be very useful, and I don’t think we can defend charging women extra for them.”

ICECBTH1VR_NXEPUPASIYP8LB5,New Hampshire is poised to answer the GOP’s existential question,"Analysis by Stephen Collinson, CNN","8 minute read Published 6:00 AM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240122,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/22/politics/new-hampshire-haley-trump-analysis/,"“Can you hear that sound?” a jubilant Nikki Haley asked a jazzed-up crowd as she strode onstage Sunday night.
“That’s the sound of a two-person race.”
The former South Carolina governor had just got what she wanted for months – a one-on-one clash with Donald Trump for the Republican nomination.
But she must still prove she can make a head-to-head duel with the ex-president last through Tuesday’s New Hampshire primary and beyond, after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis suddenly shelved his White House bid.

Trump’s critics have long argued that if he ever faced a one-on-one fight for the Republican nomination against a single candidate who united all the party’s opposition against him, he’d lose.
The theory is about to be put to its ultimate test.
Haley will never have a better chance than in New Hampshire, among an electorate in which moderate and independent voters play a crucial role, to beat Trump in a single contest and to prove she can mount a nationwide challenge against him. A victory, or very close runner-up spot, will be vital to the former South Carolina governor’s capacity to run through her home state’s primary next month and into the Super Tuesday major-state primaries at the beginning of March.
“There’s two people in this race. That’s what we wanted all along,” Haley told CNN’s Dana Bash on the trail Sunday, moments after DeSantis quit the campaign.
But Haley faces an existential question for her own campaign Tuesday. Is the front-running ex-president, who is hugely popular among GOP base voters after turning his unprecedented legal morass into a rallying call, simply too strong at this point for anyone in the party to beat him? And if there is a consolidation of the Republican pack, it seems to be around Trump, not her, as three of the ex-president’s defeated rivals – DeSantis, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy – have endorsed him in the last week. “They’re all all coming with us,” Trump noted with satisfaction at a rally in Rochester, New Hampshire, on Sunday night.

But the chief proponent of the idea that a head-to-head contest could imperil Trump and open the way for a prolonged duel for delegates has been New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu. The popular Republican seemed ecstatic that his preferred scenario had come true as he rallied for Haley in Exeter on Sunday night.
“A little while ago, there were 13 candidates in the race, and now there are only two,” he roared to the crowd. “They said that couldn’t be done, but then Nikki Haley came along and wiped them all out. For years we have been waiting for something where the Republicans could galvanize together.” Sununu’s remarks underscored how Haley’s race has become part of a long battle for the soul of the GOP, even if she has trodden carefully in criticizing Trump for fear of alienating party voters who like him. Still, Sununu has also been downplaying expectations for Haley in recent days, arguing she only needs to start winning states on Super Tuesday.
Practically, the DeSantis departure came late for Haley – giving her only one full day to make her case that she’s a genuine contender in an one-on-one battle with Trump before voters go to the polls in New Hampshire. But she quickly tried to capitalize on her new status, presenting herself as the antidote to Trump’s “chaos” – her code word for his criminal problems, impeachments and tumultuous first term – and as a far surer bet to beat President Joe Biden in November’s general election.
The news sent a jolt of energy through Haley and her crowd. She’s had a rocky few days, despite the withdrawal of former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, whom her team had feared would split the anti-Trump vote in New Hampshire. She came third in the Iowa caucuses last week, a showing that dented a narrative of momentum surrounding her campaign. And in a CNN poll released Sunday, Trump led Haley by 11 points in the state. If anything, she might have benefited from DeSantis staying in until Wednesday. When his small slice of the vote in the CNN poll was reallocated based on voters’ second preferences, Trump led by 13 points since the Florida governor’s voters are likely a better fit for his coalition.

Yet the signature unpredictability and fabled history of the New Hampshire primary means there’s a chance that the late-in-the race narrowing of the GOP field could justify Sununu’s euphoria and give Haley the shock win she needs.
While most polls show a solid Trump lead, a complication in New Hampshire is that no one can be sure how many undeclared voters – the name for independents in the Granite State – will show up on Election Day to vote in the GOP primary. An unexpectedly high turnout of undeclared voters powered late Arizona Sen. John McCain to a shock victory in the 2000 GOP primary against George W. Bush. The state has also sprung shocks on the other side of the aisle: In 2008, Democrat Hillary Clinton won New Hampshire days after losing the Iowa caucuses to Barack Obama, in a result that turned his march to the nomination into a monthslong slog.
“The New Hampshire polling is all over the place – one reason – and that is the proportion of the undeclared voters that can vote in the Republican primary,” Republican pollster Whit Ayers said in a Brookings Institution briefing last week. “It is very difficult to anticipate what proportion they will make of the final turnout.”
Trump has long had to endure arguments that his shock capture of the Republican nomination in 2016 was only possible since party heavyweights such as Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Christie and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush all vainly believed they were the only candidate who could beat him – and thus divided the anti-Trump vote among them.
There is some truth to this version of history. Bush only quit in February 2016 after a fourth place in the South Carolina primary proved what Trump was saying – that his campaign was a “low energy” failure. Rubio, whose soaring vision of 21st century Reaganism was destroyed by Trump, only pulled out in March of that year after losing his home state to the future president. Cruz survived as the last opponent standing and stayed in the race until May, but by then, Trump was too far ahead. Had the Texas senator been the lone challenger from New Hampshire onward, perhaps the outcome may have been different.
In many of the races in the last competitive GOP nominating season, Trump benefited from a fractured opposition, and the first-past-the-post rules of many contests meant he was able to harvest all the delegates on offer even without a majority of votes. In the South Carolina primary, for instance, Trump won 32.5%, ahead of Rubio with 22.5%, Cruz with 22.3% and Bush with 7.8%. Had there been a single unified anti-Trump Republican challenge, the future president would almost certainly have lost the race. Instead, he walked away with all the state’s 50 bound convention delegates. Even in New Hampshire last time, Trump won a relatively close race in a packed field with only 35% of the vote but won all 11 delegates.

Eight years later, Trump has changed the Republican Party beyond recognition. He’s remade it in his populist, nationalist image. This time last year, the former president looked vulnerable after his attempts to push his favored candidates in the midterm elections may have cost the GOP the Senate. But he successfully leveraged his 91 criminal charges, including over his attempt to overturn democracy to stay in power after losing the 2020 reelection, into a foundation for a revived campaign. Millions of Americans now believe his falsehoods about a stolen election. His expected appearance in a New York courtroom Monday in a civil defamation case is another example of how he has used his legal dramas to fuel his campaign. And Trump has driven out Republican lawmakers who still oppose him – such as former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, who lost a primary in 2022, and 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney, who is not running for a second term as a Utah senator.
That transformation of the GOP – and Trump’s extraordinary bond with voters – has often been reflected in polls of this race, which have shown Trump with greater popularity in key states than all of his rivals combined. This was borne out in Iowa last week when Trump got just over 50% of the vote in the widest victory in the GOP contest in the state’s history. While the magnitude of that result is unlikely to be repeated in New Hampshire, given the state’s demographic makeup, Haley’s path becomes far more complicated going forward even if she notches a win in the Granite state.
Take South Carolina. While she twice won gubernatorial battles, Haley hasn’t been on the ballot there in a decade. And now, the state is one of the most fervent pro-Trump bastions, a point the ex-president tried to make by inviting Gov. Henry McMaster, Lt. Gov. Pamela Evette and other top state Republicans who have endorsed him to join him on stage in New Hampshire on Saturday night. Scott delivered another blow to Haley on Friday by endorsing the former president, and argued on CNN on Sunday that Trump would be a much stronger commander in chief than Haley.
In Exeter, Haley pitched a vision of a deeply conservative presidency on issues including immigration reform, deficit reduction and foreign policy. But her demeanor and plans also offered a promise of a return to calm, steady governance instead of Trump’s tumult and the “retribution” he’s promising for a second term. There’s no suggestion, even from Democrats, that Haley would threaten democracy from the Oval Office or turn decades of US foreign policy values upside down. Hypothetical matchup polls showing Haley defeating Biden in many cases suggest that’s a campaign many Americans could get behind.
But Haley’s problem is that most Republican voters may not want what she’s offering.
“Republicans set all the issues aside,” CNN commentator and Republican consultant Scott Jennings said Sunday. “(They said) the only way for us to get euphoric vindication for all the wrongs that have been done to Donald Trump is to nominate him again, and I think that’s what they are going to do.”
In this race, being the last candidate standing against “the fellas,” as Haley calls her rivals, may not mean much or last very long. It might simply be a passport to be the last candidate who gets rolled over by Trump."
IHR4AV55UV_O27SSME144F7K8W,Jon Stewart’s return to ‘The Daily Show’ could shake up 2024 politics,"Analysis by Oliver Darcy, CNN","3 minute read Published 7:08 AM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/25/media/jon-stewart-daily-show-return-2024-politics/,"Editor’s Note: A version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here.
Jon Stewart is returning to his old home at “The Daily Show” — but the neighborhood in which the comedic house resides has dramatically changed since he last signed off from host chair.
Stewart, who hosted the iconic program for 16 years, decamped Comedy Central in 2015 — just as Donald Trump ascended to power and as the seams of American politics tore apart. While there is never a shortage of material pouring out of Washington for comedians to use as punchlines, Stewart returns to the cable lineup in an environment battered by an ill-tempered information monsoon.
Misinformation, conspiracy theories, and outright lies saturate the 2024 public discourse in a way that stands in stark contrast to the pre-Trump era in which Stewart previously operated. Trump and his stable of MAGA political allies have at their disposal a powerful media machine that pumps propaganda into the national conversation and sends it viral on a daily basis.
Back when Stewart helmed “The Daily Show,” he was needling much more establishment figures, such as conservative news personality Bill O’Reilly or Republican President George W. Bush. When he returns to Comedy Central after the Super Bowl next month to begin hosting the network’s signature show each Monday, Stewart will be confronted with a new, far more insidious breed of media and political figures, such as the radicalized Tucker Carlson and the twice-impeached, four time-indicted, election-denying, insurrection-inciting Trump.
That means that not only is Stewart going to have plenty of fodder to work with, but his voice may very well be more important than ever.
While the cable platform he once helmed, and its massive audience reach, is a mere shadow of its former glory, the show still carries significant weight. That is perhaps evidenced by the fact that when Stewart launched an Apple TV+ show — “The Problem with Jon Stewart” — in 2021, it failed to gain a foothold in the public consciousness and establish the cultural cachet he enjoyed from his more accessible cable perch.
Stewart’s talent has always been using humor to disarm dishonest politicians and expose the absurdities of their arguments in a highly entertaining way. He is uniquely talented at drawing on his sharp comedic wit to cut through the political noise and separate fact from fiction for audiences. And during the 2024 election year, that work will be vital.
Stewart also reenters the scene at a time when traditional newsrooms are being pummeled by layoffs and contracting at an alarming pace. The number of journalists and media figures holding the morally bankrupt accountable has slimmed considerably — a service much of the country is thirsting for.
Meanwhile, the mechanisms in which media are distributed have also undergone a revolution. Far fewer people are reading ever-shrinking newspapers and watching the decaying linear television lineups. Instead, they’re being algorithmically-fed information that conforms to their existing viewpoints, regardless if such viewpoints are consistent with the facts.
Stewart has the potential to break through these digital barriers. His stinging political monologues appeal not only to D.C. politicos, but to mass audiences. It’s without a doubt that in the months ahead, social media feeds will be rife with clips of his tongue-in-cheek, truth-based narration of the circus that is American politics.
Of course, Stewart’s comedy returns in a far more challenging environment with a smaller direct audience on cable. He will have an impact, unquestionably, but also won’t single handedly keep the dark forces at bay.
But at this particular moment in American society, when antidemocratic forces are actively poisoning the public information well in their bids to seize power, not only does the reality-dwelling public hunger for spine-possessing, clear-eyed soldiers like Stewart, it arguably demands it."
II0CIRK4OO_MFKVIGNFP8LYLE5,Colombia declares a disaster due to wildfires as it calls for international help,"By Michael Rios, Tara John, Taylor Ward, Veronica Calderon, Ana Melgar Zuniga and Mauricio Torres, CNN","2 minute read Published 5:54 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/25/americas/colombia-disaster-wildfires-el-nino-intl-latam/,"Colombia declared a disaster situation on Thursday due to wildfires raging across several parts of the country, as the president warned the conditions could get worse.
Colombia’s President Gustavo Petro declared a “situation of disaster and calamity,” telling reporters that funds previously approved for other purposes are being redirected to deal with the crisis.
The government is also seeking international help, he said, adding that the United States, Chile, Peru and Canada, “which has enormous experience [fighting fires],” have responded to the call. Petro said he’s also seeking the cooperation of the United Nations and the European Union.
The fires are the result of hot and dry conditions linked to the El Niño weather phenomenon, according to officials. El Niño is expected to continue for the next few months before ending during the Northern Hemisphere spring.
Petro warned that the situation, which he described as a “climate crisis,” will get worse. “We are going toward an increasingly difficult stage,” he said.
Temperatures across much of the country have been 5 to 10 degrees Celsius above normal in recent days and weeks. Many locations are in the mid to even upper 30s C (upper 90s to low 100s F) and are coming on the heels of above-average temperatures across the region in recent months.
At least 25 active fires were reported on Thursday by the National Disaster Risk Management Unit. Ten are under control and 217 have been extinguished, the agency said.
Billowing smoke has overwhelmed some areas in the country and led to flights being cancelled in the capital Bogota.
The city’s El Dorado airport operated with restrictions Thursday morning due to low visibility from smoke and fog.
“We estimate that the phenomenon is composed of 70% fog and 30% smoke,” the Civil Aviation Authority of Colombia said on X.
At least 138 flights were affected, 48 were canceled and 16 were rerouted to other airports, the authority reported."
IIQM3ZKF44_UH9JVBMJJWCZZCF,Exclusive: House ethics probe of Gaetz seeks information from DOJ and woman who allegedly had sex with congressman as a minor,"By Paula Reid and Annie Grayer, CNN","4 minute read Updated 6:55 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/24/politics/house-ethics-matt-gaetz/,"The House Ethics Committee investigating Rep. Matt Gaetz has reached out to the woman whom the congressman allegedly had sexual relations with when she was a 17-year-old minor, according to a source familiar with the committee’s work.
The outreach, which has not previously been reported, is a sign that the GOP-led committee’s investigation into the Florida Republican has recently expanded to include questioning around allegations of sex crimes.
Sources said the committee also has reached out to the Justice Department requesting materials from its investigation into Gaetz, which included allegations of lobbying violations, sex-trafficking and possible obstruction of justice. The federal probe, which also included allegations he had sex with a minor, concluded in 2023 with no charges brought against the congressman.
Gaetz has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, including ever having sex with a minor or paying for sex.
“Those allegations were not true, have never been true, and the people who spread those lies have been exposed, indicted, and imprisoned,” Gaetz said in response to CNN Wednesday.
The Ethics Committee’s outreach to the young woman and the Justice Department comes amid a new flurry of activity in the probe, including outreach to multiple other witnesses and starting to conduct witness interviews. The increased activity under Republican leadership is notable given the committee probe was started by House Democrats in 2021.
Gaetz, who led the charge to oust former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, has privately blamed McCarthy for the committee restarting its probe under the California Republican’s watch.
But McCarthy has repeatedly denounced those accusations and has said Gaetz worked to oust the former speaker because of the ethics probe.
“I don’t believe them to be conservatives,” McCarthy said in November, referring to the eight Republicans who voted to oust him. “It’s driven by Gaetz, and it was all based upon an ethics complaint that happened in the last Congress. He would throw his country away to try to protect himself for what would come out as the truth.”
The Ethics Committee and Department of Justice declined to comment.
The Justice Department does not have to comply with a voluntary request from the House Ethics Committee, said Norman Eisen, who served as counsel to House Democrats in former President Donald Trump’s first impeachment.
“If a request seems merited, as part of the usual accommodation process between the legislative and executive branches, DOJ will sometimes provide some information,” Eisen said, “but they tend to be withholding of sensitive investigative materials.”
Even when the House issues a subpoena, the Justice Department typically holds back much of their internal investigative materials, Eisen said. “They will sometimes provide a specific piece of evidence when the House shows a strong need and is not otherwise able to obtain it,” he added.
In late 2020, under Trump-appointed Attorney General Bill Barr, the Justice Department opened an investigation into allegations Gaetz may have had sexual contact with a minor. The probe expanded over the years before the Justice Department officially decided last year not to charge the congressman.
As part of the sprawling investigation, Joel Greenberg, a former Florida tax collector and close confidant of Gaetz, pleaded guilty in 2021 to six federal charges, including soliciting and paying the minor in the Gaetz allegation for sex.
The Ethics Committee, controlled at the time by Democrats, originally opened its Gaetz investigation in 2021, publicly announcing that it was examining a range of allegations including that Gaetz violated sex trafficking laws, shared inappropriate images or videos on the House floor, used illicit drugs, converted campaign funds to personal use and accepted a bribe, among other claims.
The committee deferred its investigation at the request of the Justice Department, which was simultaneously probing the allegations, but resumed its work in after the DOJ concluded its investigation without bringing charges.
A source familiar with the House panel’s work previously told CNN that the Justice Department’s decision not to bring charges against Gaetz does not impact what the committee will and won’t investigate. The committee plans to examine the same allegations they were looking into when they opened the investigation in 2021, the source told CNN."
IIQSBPMT8X_2PBDBPHWXB39513,The deepfake era of US politics is upon us,"Analysis by Zachary B. Wolf, CNN","8 minute read Published 12:00 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/24/politics/deepfake-politician-biden-what-matters/,"A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.
One distressing headline out of New Hampshire as voters prepared to cast in-person primary ballots was that a fake version of President Joe Biden’s voice had been used in automatically generated robocalls to discourage Democrats from taking part in the primary.
It’s not distressing because of the message, per se – Democrats had penalized New Hampshire for insisting on holding its primary Tuesday. Biden was not even on the ballot, although a write-in campaign was launched on his behalf.
The distressing thing is that while the audio appears to be fake, it sounds just like the president and even uses his trademark “malarkey” catchphrase. Listen to it here.
Who created the audio? Who is behind the robocall? There have been warnings for years about a new era of deepfakes being used to manipulate US elections, from within or outside the country. That era is undeniably here.
I talked to Donie O’Sullivan, CNN’s correspondent covering both politics and technology, who has been on this story for years. Excerpts of our conversation are below.
WOLF: You cover this stuff every day. What crossed your mind when you saw this headline?
O’SULLIVAN: It’s probably one of the first of many, many, many headlines and stories like this that we are going to be seeing this year.
If we’re not already in it, we’re on the precipice of an explosion of AI-generated disinformation.
It’s most likely that this audio was created using artificial intelligence. I think we’ve all kind of become familiar with the fact that this technology is out there, but I think we’re ready to kick into gear with this current election campaign.
Importantly, there’s been a lot of focus on fake videos over the past few years.
But from the experts and other folks we’ve been speaking to, I think there’s a big concern about audio.
WOLF: Terms like “deepfake” are probably new to a lot of people. What is the basic glossary people need to know to stay on top of things?
O’SULLIVAN: “Deepfake” normally refers to a fake video that has been created using artificial intelligence. It is basically a fake video that looks very realistic.
Over the past few years, artificial intelligence has made the creation of fake images, videos and audio way easier.
AI makes fake videos, images and audio differently than how it has been done traditionally, which was by slicing audio together or by Photoshop. This is the machines, the computers themselves, making the images and audio.
This is a fundamentally different type of technology, and it is a lot more realistic.
WOLF: What do we know about who might be behind this? Not this specific instance, because we don’t know, but what do we know about who is doing this type of thing?
O’SULLIVAN: Anybody and everybody. The challenge we’re going to have in 2024 is that really anybody can make these pretty convincing deepfakes.
A few years ago we did stories about the threat of this type of technology. But then it might only be the likes of a nation-state, Russia or China or somebody else who really has access to this technology.
I think we’ve all seen over the last 14 months or so with ChatGPT that now we all tend to have access to this crazy and powerful technology.
I will give an example for this time last year:
I tried out fake audio creation software, which is widely available online, and then called my parents back in Ireland with my fake voice, and my dad fell for it. My mom kind of knew something was up, but she wasn’t quite sure what was going on. My dad fell for it and had a full conversation with my AI voice.
We were able to make that just by taking a few minutes of a recording of my voice. So basically, you can take anybody’s voice, you can pick up all the clips online of candidates, and you can essentially get him to say anything.
WOLF: I don’t think anybody expects this robocall to change the outcome of an election where Biden isn’t even on the ballot. What is the ultimate threat?
O’SULLIVAN: We’re seeing underlying reporting already about how this type of technology is being used in scams, particularly to target people making it sound like a loved one is calling them and getting them hand to over money. Things like that.
I think if you just look back at political campaigns – 2012 and Mitt Romney’s 47% comment (when he argued that nearly half of Americans were dependent on the government), which was caught on audio. Donald Trump of course, with the “Access Hollywood” tape back in 2016.
All throughout modern American political campaign history, audio and tapes have played fundamentally important roles in campaigns. The concern is that tapes start emerging online that make it sound like Biden or Trump have said something that they didn’t really say, maybe something that’s quite incriminating.
Now, obviously, we have checks and balances in place for that. We consult AI experts and other digital forensic experts that can say, well, this doesn’t sound quite right here. There’s also some technology that’s been developed to try and detect these fakes.
We all know that now in this modern era of mis- and disinformation, even when something is fact checked, millions or tens of millions of people can hear a piece of fake audio before that happens, and it can still place doubts in people’s minds.
WOLF: So what is your advice to people? How should they approach something they see?
O’SULLIVAN: Especially since 2016, over the past decade, I think a lot of us, particularly people who are more and more clued into politics, we’re getting used to this era of mis- and disinformation and knowing that you can’t trust everything you read on the internet.
But now you can’t trust everything you physically hear or watch on the internet or elsewhere either.
That is easier said than done. It is just a general, absolute – being diligent, getting your information from reliable sources, etc. Here’s the thing: I do think that this type of technology allows for a profoundly different form of disinformation.
Because it’s one thing to read something, but if you hear a tape or you watch a video, I think that resonates in a very different way.
There is a lot of disinformation particularly on the political right, but anybody can fall for this stuff, and particularly if it’s playing into an existing narrative.
We all have people in our families who are one way politically inclined, and we like to think it’s the other side who is getting misinformed, but I don’t think that’s the case. And especially with this kind of technology.
WOLF: Have we seen the other side of things where someone created a deepfake to essentially lie about themselves in their own interest?
O’SULLIVAN: I haven’t really seen an example of that.
What I will say is the most mind-bending, dystopian element of all of this is that we all need to be aware that this technology is out there – so we’re living in this kind of new reality, or unreality, as people become more aware that this technology exists, that gives politicians and others the ability to deny something that might really have happened.
For instance, you can imagine that if the “Access Hollywood” tape arrived in 2024, Trump could say that’s a deepfake.
In addition to creating the possibility of fake scenarios, it also allows people the space to deny real scenarios.
There is a tape that is now being investigated by some federal authorities of (pro-Trump political operative) Roger Stone allegedly speaking about assassinating members of Congress.
He denies that he ever said that. So you can already see this kind of defense being utilized.
WOLF: The next-generation version of “my Twitter account was hacked” when it wasn’t.
WOLF: The frightening thing to me is that we only know what we know. We know this particular robocall exists, but we don’t really know what else is out there. We can’t say for sure where it came from or who is behind it.
You described a lag time of being able to verify something when people are exposed to it. And that’s an important thing. We assume it was to push down turnout for a write-in campaign for Biden, but we don’t know that to be true. It’s a mystery. And the more of these things that are out there, we won’t have any idea.
O’SULLIVAN: I think because this stuff is so easy to make, especially when it comes to audio, this is not just going to happen on a presidential level. This can happen all the way to dogcatcher.
If something happens involving Biden and Trump, there are going to be lots of eyeballs and people calling it out.
But I think it’s going to be at every level – state, county, township, city – and that’s going to be harder to catch.
If you want a visual example to point to, there was a lot of disinformation on the elections in Taiwan a few weeks back. There is a video of a US congressman that turned out to be a deepfake where he’s saying he’s soliciting votes for Taiwan’s presidential candidate.
WOLF: This has been a very depressing conversation. Is there an optimistic note you can leave us on?
O’SULLIVAN: You can take some bit of comfort from the fact that my mom was able to figure out that something was up with the deepfake.
I think people are also becoming more aware. Don’t trust everything you read on the internet. And I’d like to think as a society we’re getting a bit better at being a bit more skeptical.
The fact that we’re having these conversations now in January is better than all of us learning about this technology in September or October of this year."
IJ7LVP96XD_US9DOYDOHOGTVGW,Boeing faces new safety alert over earlier generation of 737s,"By Gregory Wallace and Hanna Ziady, CNN","3 minute read Updated 5:09 AM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240122,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/22/business/boeing-737-earlier-generation-faa/,"(CNN) — The US Federal Aviation Administration has urged airlines to inspect so-called door plugs on an earlier version of Boeing 737 airplanes, after one blew out of the side of the newer Max model during an Alaska Airlines flight earlier this month.
The FAA on Sunday said airlines operating the Boeing 737-900ER model should “visually inspect mid-exit door plugs to ensure the door is properly secured,” referring to the panel that plugs the hole where a mid-plane exit would be.
“The Boeing 737-900ER is not part of the newer Max fleet but has the same door plug design,” the US aviation regulator added in what is known as a safety alert for operators.
Boeing’s shares fell almost 3% in premarket trade Monday. The safety alert on a plane that has been in service for almost two decades will deal a fresh blow to the company, which has faced repeated quality and safety issues with its aircraft in recent years, leading to the long-term grounding of some jets and delayed deliveries of others.
The planemaker’s stock has declined about 14% since a door plug on one of its Max 9 airplanes shot out from the side of the fuselage only a few minutes into a flight from Portland, Oregon, to Ontario, California, forcing the pilot to make an emergency landing.
In a statement shared with CNN, Boeing said it “fully” supports the FAA and its own customers in the regulator’s latest action.
Since the terrifying incident just over two weeks ago, some airlines have inspected the earlier-built Boeing planes and observed “findings with bolts” holding the door plugs in place, according to the FAA. The regulator did not specify what the findings were.
After recent inspections of the newer Max 9s, United Airlines and Alaska Airlines have also both found loose bolts.
United, Delta Airlines and Alaska Airlines told CNN Monday that they had already started inspections of their Boeing 737-900ER aircraft and did not anticipate any disruptions to operations. “We have had no findings to date,” Alaska Airlines said.
According to data on Boeing’s website, it has delivered a total of around 500 of these airplanes to carriers that also include Turkish Airlines.
Alaska said in a statement it began inspecting its 737-900ER planes several days ago and had “no findings” so far. It expects to complete the remainder of its 737-900ER inspections without pulling the planes from service.
The FAA notice does not ground the earlier generation of plane. Instead, it recommends that airlines inspect the door plugs and the bolts “as soon as possible.”
The newer Max 9 aircraft continue to be grounded in the United States. The agency said it continued to review data collected from inspections of 40 sample aircraft as it considered how to determine if the planes were safe to fly again.

IPDERBIFJU_JL68UAIW5DMB05A,Who invented butter chicken? Indian judge to rule on dispute over global favorite,Story by Reuters,"2 minute read Published 9:42 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/travel/butter-chicken-inventor-india-dispute/,"Butter chicken – one of India’s best-known dishes globally – is delicious and apparently also contentious, with two Indian restaurant chains doing battle in court over claims to its origins.
The lawsuit – which has become a hot topic in India – was brought by the family behind Moti Mahal, a famed Delhi restaurant brand that has counted late US President Richard Nixon and India’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru among its guests.
It claims restaurant founder, Kundan Lal Gujral, created the curry in the 1930s when the restaurant first opened in Peshawar before it moved to Delhi. In a 2,752-page court filing it has sued rival chain Daryaganj, accusing it of falsely claiming to have invented the dish as well as dal makhani, a popular lentil dish that is also laden with butter and cream.
The Gujral family is seeking $240,000 in damages, also alleging that Daryaganj has copied the layout of Moti Mahal’s website and “the look and feel” of its restaurants.
“You cannot take away somebody’s legacy … The dish was invented when our grandfather was in Pakistan,” said Monish Gujral, managing director at Moti Mahal.
Inventor of the UK’s ‘true national dish’ dies at 77
Daryaganj – which was established relatively recently in 2019 – counters that its late family member, Kundan Lal Jaggi, had partnered with Gujral to open the Delhi restaurant in 1947, and the dish was invented there. That gives it the right to also lay claim to the creation of the dish, it argues.
Daryaganj shared with Reuters a faded, hand-written partnership document registered in 1949 to back its argument.
The dispute has captured the nation’s attention with Indian TV broadcasters running segments on the history of the dish and debate raging on social media.
“It’s an offbeat, unique case. You really don’t know who created the first dish of butter chicken. The court will be hard pressed and will need to rely on circumstantial evidence,” said Ameet Datta, an intellectual property lawyer at India’s Saikrishna & Associates.
Testimonies of people who can link the brand to the dish they consumed decades ago could be critical proof, Datta added.
Made with tandoor-cooked chicken pieces mixed in a tomato gravy with dollops of cream and butter, the dish was ranked 43rd in a list of world’s “best dishes” by TasteAtlas as rated by nearly 400,000 users.
It was the second-ranked Indian food after butter garlic naan bread. The two are often paired together.
The case was first heard by the Delhi High Court last week and the next hearing is scheduled for May."
IQUZULESQM_AVM9SI3PBZLHTKE,Trump makes history again as he powers toward Republican nomination,"Analysis by Stephen Collinson, CNN","7 minute read Published 1:40 AM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/24/politics/trump-new-hampshire-gop-nomination/,"Nothing seems to be stopping Donald Trump as he surges toward his third consecutive Republican nomination.
The ex-president on Tuesday became the first modern-era non-incumbent Republican to win the first two presidential nominating contests, adding the New Hampshire primary to his Iowa caucuses landslide from last week, and reached the brink of a rematch with President Joe Biden.
Trump has all but cleared the GOP field at an astonishing clip. Despite a crush of criminal liability and the memory of his assault on democracy on January 6, 2021, he is consolidating his party around him at a rate unprecedented in modern primary elections.

And yet, Trump spent Tuesday night seething, sources told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, because his sole remaining GOP rival, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, isn’t dropping out. Despite failing to land a win against the ex-president in the state perhaps most suited to her candidacy, she insisted she would go on, resisting heavy pressure from Trump’s camp to bow out and promising to engage in what looks like an uphill battle in her home state – which holds the next big primary next month. Trump criticized Haley publicly and privately and urged his political aides to up their attacks on her, Collins reported.
While his reaction to his New Hampshire win was far less jubilant than his Iowa triumph, the twin victories represent a stunning act of political survival. Three years ago, Trump left Washington stung by his second impeachment after trying to overturn the result of an election that he lost. There’s also a possibility he could be a convicted felon by November’s election given that he’s facing 91 criminal charges and more trials — civil and criminal — than can be counted on one hand. His wins underscore his success in leveraging his legal problems to paint a narrative of political persecution that’s bolted his political base ever closer to his side. And exit polls on Tuesday showing that roughly 8 in 10 of Trump’s voters denied the legitimacy of Joe Biden’s election in in 2020 highlight how Trump has successfully used election denialism as an engine of his political comeback.
The former president is in a unique political position. In some senses, he’s effectively an incumbent since he never relinquished his hold on the GOP even after losing — a fate that normally sends ex-presidents into ignominious retirement. But even while in office, Trump never lost sight of his core political formula — his reputation as an insurgent outsider.
So while Haley is trying to portray him — and his stack of endorsements — as a figure of the “establishment,” it’s a tactic that works more in theory than practice. In fact, Haley, who is pushing hawkish foreign policies and deficit reduction, is trying to revive the establishment policies of the pre-Trump Republican Party. Trump, who is vowing a second term of “retribution,” is sending every signal he wants to go back to Washington to tear it all down.
There is also no sign in the first two contests that Republican voters are worried that Trump can’t beat Biden, which is the core argument of the Haley campaign and of her erstwhile rival, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who folded his White House bid after finishing second in Iowa. The former president has probably been helped in this regard by Biden’s own low approval ratings and a blizzard of conservative media coverage of the 81-year-old president’s age and perceived mental frailty, which may have convinced many voters he’ll be a pushover in November.
“We had one hell of a night tonight,” Trump said in his victory speech in Nashua at an election night party that saw his supporters in red “Make America Great Again” hats cheering as networks called his win.

But Haley’s decision not to pull out of the race irked the former president after he said at his closing rally on Tuesday night that he expected she would be knocked out.
“Ron came in second and he left. She came in third and she’s still hanging around,” Trump said of DeSantis’ and Haley’s performances in Iowa. “She had a very bad night.”
Trump was joined on stage Tuesday by his other one-time rivals for the nomination, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, whom he described as “the only person more angry than, let’s say me, but I don’t get too angry, I get even.”
The ex-president’s victory party also welcomed another guest – disgraced ex-congressman George Santos, who became one of the few people ever expelled from the House of Representatives over ethics allegations.
At her own election night event, Haley congratulated Trump on his win, but said that the race was far from over – even though it’s hard to pick a primary state where she might win if she couldn’t win New Hampshire.
“In the next two months, millions of voters in over 20 states will have their say. We should honor them and allow them to vote,” Haley told her crowd at the election watch party, as several supporters chanted, “Trump is a loser.” The former US ambassador to the UN advised her old boss to take a mental competency test and suggested he was afraid to climb on a debate stage alongside her.
Had the former president chosen to be magnanimous, he might have ended the primary race in all but name. But instead, he gave the Haley team a new seam to mine. Her campaign issued a quick response to his speech, which it termed a “furious and rambling rant” against her, asking, “If Trump is in such good shape, why is he so angry?”
His bitter demeanor may have reminded suburban and women voters whom he alienated in past elections why they soured on him. And his outbursts will have delighted Biden’s campaign, which declared Trump all but clinched the GOP nomination on Tuesday night and fired up their general election attack machine against him. In another sign of urgency, two of his top White House aides are moving to Wilmington, Delaware, soon to take the reins of his reelection.
Unfortunately for Haley, New Hampshire did not, as she told its voters it would, “correct” the result of last week’s Iowa caucuses, where she came a distant third to Trump. Whether she got “smoked” in the Granite State — as her former opponent Chris Christie predicted she would on a hot mic — depends on whose spin you accept.
With 88% of the vote in from the primary, Haley trailed Trump by about 11 points. That’s short of the huge win some of the ex-president’s supporters had expected but still a handsome victory margin for Trump, even if his problems with suburban voters were reflected in his rival’s strong performance in large population areas in southern New Hampshire – a potential alarm bell for his prospects in a general election.
The problem for Haley is that as the race now turns toward her home state, and big southern state primaries on Super Tuesday in March, she’ll be up against Trump in his strongholds and her chances to pick off wins and convention delegates seem slim.
Still, her campaign is arguing that every time she takes on Trump she is improving. And her supporters insisted that her difficult road ahead did not mean she should be forced out of the race.
And there’s no reason why Haley shouldn’t stay in if she has the money. After all, it’s a democratic process and voters – not rival candidates – get to decide the result. Trump’s rush to declare victory in the primary race may even be a sign of political malpractice since he’s only leaving Haley and her supporters more determined not to be pushed out.
“The more she runs, the more support she’s getting,” said Lisa Kent, a Haley supporter from Connecticut who attended the election watch night party in Concord. “It’s like an avalanche.”
But unless the former South Carolina governor can pull off a miracle next month in a state where she was elected governor twice – but that is now a Trump bastion – her shaky rationale for continuing her campaign may face a terminal reality.

Before his death, Tatarsky was one of Russia’s most outspoken and ultranationalist military bloggers, known for his ardent pro-war commentary and occasional criticism of Moscow’s battlefield failures.
He was killed in the April 2023 blast, which came during an event at the cafe.
Trepova was arrested soon after on suspicion she had handed over the explosive device, hidden in a statue, to Tatarsky, state media Tass reported at the time.
Trepova’s husband, Dmitry Rylov, told an independent Russian publication that he is convinced she was set up.
Tatarsky supported the war in Ukraine and had gained popularity by providing analysis and commentary on Telegram, much of which advocated for a harsher approach towards Ukraine.
Tatarsky, whose real name is Maxim Fomin, created his Telegram channel in 2019, naming it in honor of the protagonist of Victor Pelevin’s novel “Generation ‘P,’” according to Russian state news agency Vesti. He had since written several books and previously fought among Russian forces in Donbas, eastern Ukraine, in 2014.

IWMPCW8KDF_ULALJ6P6A5IDU2O,GOP senators seethe as Trump blows up delicate immigration compromise,"By Manu Raju, Melanie Zanona, Lauren Fox and Ted Barrett, CNN","7 minute read Updated 8:52 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/25/politics/gop-senators-angry-trump-immigration-deal/,"Senior Senate Republicans are furious that Donald Trump may have killed an emerging bipartisan deal over the southern border, depriving them of a key legislative achievement on a pressing national priority and offering a preview of what’s to come with Trump as their likely presidential nominee.
In recent weeks, Trump has been lobbying Republicans both in private conversations and in public statements on social media to oppose the border compromise being delicately hashed out in the Senate, according to GOP sources familiar with the conversations – in part because he wants to campaign on the issue this November and doesn’t want President Joe Biden to score a victory in an area where he is politically vulnerable.
Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell acknowledged in a private meeting on Wednesday that Trump’s animosity toward the yet-to-be-released border deal puts Republicans in a serious bind as they try to move forward on the already complex issue. For weeks, Republicans have been warning that Trump’s opposition could blow up the bipartisan proposal, but the admission from McConnell was particularly striking, given he has been a chief advocate for a border-Ukraine package.
Now, Republicans on Capitol Hill are grappling with the reality that most in the GOP are loathe to do anything that is seen as potentially undermining the former president. And the prospects of a deal being scuttled before it has even been finalized has sparked tensions and confusion in the Senate GOP as they try to figure out if, and how, to proceed – even as McConnell made clear during party lunches Thursday that he remains firmly behind the effort to strike a deal, according to attendees.
“I think the border is a very important issue for Donald Trump. And the fact that he would communicate to Republican senators and congresspeople that he doesn’t want us to solve the border problem because he wants to blame Biden for it is … really appalling,” said GOP Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, who has been an outspoken critic of Trump.
He added, “But the reality is that, that we have a crisis at the border, the American people are suffering as a result of what’s happening at the border. And someone running for president not to try and get the problem solved. as opposed to saying, ‘hey, save that problem. Don’t solve it. Let me take credit for solving it later.’”
GOP Sen. Todd Young of Indiana called any efforts to disrupt the ongoing negotiations “tragic” and said: “I hope no one is trying to take this away for campaign purposes.”
“I would encourage (chief Senate GOP negotiator) James Lankford and other conservatives to produce a work product with which they will shortly allow conservatives like myself to review it and take heart that there are a number of us who won’t be looking to third parties and assessing the propriety of passing this bipartisan proposal,” Young said.
It’s an all-too-familiar dynamic for the Republicans who served while Trump was in office, where he could easily derail legislative action on Capitol Hill with the blast of a single tweet or stir up a new controversy that Republicans were forced to respond to. And with Trump now marching toward the presidential nomination, Republicans are once again bracing for life with him as the nominee.
Underscoring just how damaging Trump’s comments and campaign to kill the border deal have been in the Senate, one GOP senator on condition of background told CNN that without Trump, this deal would have had overwhelming support within the conference.
“This proposal would have had almost unanimous Republican support if it weren’t for Donald Trump,” the Republican senator said.
GOP Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina – who has also been involved in the talks – said he didn’t know if anyone could convince Trump to not kill the deal. But he acknowledged that it would take some “courage” for members to be able to press ahead at this point in defiance of Trump – though Tillis argued it would ultimately be beneficial for Trump for them to pass a border security deal and help address the flow of migrants trying to enter the country.
“I think this is when members of the Senate have to show some courage and do something that at the end of the day will be very helpful for President Trump,” Tillis said.
Asked whether it was a mistake for Trump to be assailing this deal, Tillis said: “I’ll leave it to him to figure out how he needs to get into office. I hope you’ll leave it to some of us who would support that effort to give him the tools he needs to really manage the border and the abuse and the dangerous situation we have today.”
For his part, McConnell – who has had zero relationship with Trump since the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack – downplayed Trump’s opposition saying, “It’s not anything new,” and insisting they were not abandoning the talks.
“We’re still working,” McConnell said. “Trying to get an outcome.”
Sen. John Thune, the no. 2 Senate Republican, said the discussions have reached a critical moment but acknowledged they may need to turn to a “plan B.”
“If we can’t get there, then we’ll go to plan B,” Thune said. “But I think for now at least, there are still attempts being made to try and reach a conclusion that would satisfy a lot of Republicans.”
In the latest sign that the emerging border deal faces an uphill climb, a senior leadership aide to House GOP Leader Steve Scalise told a group of Senate Republican chiefs of staff on Thursday that it was dead on arrival in the House, according to a source familiar.
Senate Republicans on the fence about the proposal may be less inclined to back it, knowing it’s going nowhere in the House and knowing Trump wants a border deal killed.
Frustration reigned inside the Senate GOP on Thursday amid lingering confusion over the status of a deal.
While McConnell has said the talks are still proceeding, Young warned Republican leadership against pulling the plug before they’ve taken a thorough temperature check inside the conference, where a contingent of Republicans are still fighting for a deal.
“I think leadership needs to count noses before they make any impulsive decisions,” he said.
Pressed on whether it was realistic to pass a border deal with Trump opposing it, Young said: “It may be possible. Listen, I’m very much attuned to the political realities, but I think before you make these consequential decisions on behalf of this conference, you’ve got to consult with the conference.”
Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who has been openly critical of McConnell, said he was “puzzled” by the leader’s comments during the closed-door meeting on Wednesday, which was supposed to be focused on Ukraine.
“I mean, we were talking about funding for Ukraine and all of the sudden he brings up the border and then, again, lays out what I consider a pretty lame excuse, trying to shift blame to President Trump for, I would say, his failed negotiation, not James Lankford,” Johnson said. “James Lankford has worked his tail off. It’s McConnell that took away the leverage by not tying Ukraine funding to actually securing the border.”
Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who has made no secret of her frustration with Trump over the years, said members need to remember how big this moment is for the border and for Ukraine and put their own politics aside.
“I’m not giving up. This is not about Trump and this is not about me. This is about our country. This is about democracy around the world. This is about security for our own country and so let’s keep pushing to get this border deal,” she said. “Let’s stand by the commitments that we have made for our friends and our allies so that our word actually means something.”
This is the second time in six years Trump killed or was actively trying to kill a bipartisan immigration deal as it emerged. Back in 2018, Murkowski was part of bipartisan talks over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. The bill got 54 votes in the Senate, but not enough to get it over the finish line.
Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, one of the Democrats involved in the border talks, expressed frustration about Trump seeking to inject chaos into the situation.
“I think over the next 24 to 48 hours, they are going to make a decision as to whether they want to do this, or whether the forces surrounding Donald Trump – who want to keep chaos at the border – win,” Murphy said. “So they have a decision to make. I hope they make that decision very quickly. We have an agreement that is 95% written and is ready to get to the floor if Republicans decide that they actually want to solve the problem.”

Writing on X, Raesian said he received a notification from the Tehran General and Revolutionary Court that Mohammad Ghobadlou’s death sentence will be carried out on January 23, 2024.
Ghobadlou was sentenced to death by Iranian judge Abolqasem Salavati two years ago. Salavati has previously been sanctioned by the US for the notoriously harsh sentences he issued to activists, journalists, and political prisoners, CNN previously reported.
Iranian authorities allege Ghobadlou ran over a local official during a protest in Robat Karim, Tehran province, in September 2022, according to rights group Amnesty International.
He received two death sentences in relation to the death, according to Amnesty. The first death sentence was issued by a Revolutionary Court for “corruption on earth” on November 16, 2022 and upheld by the Supreme Court the following month, the rights group said. A second death sentence was issued by a criminal court in Tehran province for “murder” at the end of December 2022, it added.

But Amnesty criticized the death sentences for following what it described as “grossly unfair sham trials, marred by torture-tainted ‘confessions’ and failure to order rigorous mental health assessments despite (Ghobadlou’s) mental disability.”
Ghobadlou has been under the supervision of a psychiatric hospital for bipolar disorder since the age of 15, according to Amnesty. International law and standards prohibit using the death penalty against people with mental disabilities, according to Amnesty International.
Executions surged in Iran as the government cracked down on nationwide protests in 2022 after the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini while in the custody of the country’s so-called morality police.
Authorities violently repressed the months-long movement that posed one of the biggest domestic threats to Iran’s ruling clerical regime in more than a decade. Rights groups noted last year that the marked rise in executions reflected an effort by Tehran to “instill fear” among anti-regime protesters."

“Poor Things” star Emma Stone gave a shout-out to her fellow nominees and called the movie’s 11 nominations “a surreal dream.”
“I am beyond grateful to the Academy for including me as both an actress and producer among this group of exceptional nominees and for recognizing our film in so many categories,” she said in a statement provided to CNN. “The team of artists who contributed to ‘Poor Things’ gave it everything and I am forever thankful for the opportunity to play Bella and see the world through her eyes. She has shown me that life is so much more than just sugar and violence.”
“Poor Things” was the second-most nominated film, behind “Oppenheimer.”
Netflix received 18 nominations across 10 films, including nods for “Nyad,” Maestro,” and “El Conde.”
Annette Bening, nominated for best actress for “Nyad,” said in a statement she was “thrilled and over the moon with excitement” to be nominated for an Academy Award. This is the “American Beauty” star’s fifth nomination. Bening’s “Nyad” costar Jodie Foster also scored a nomination.
One of Stone and Bening’s competitors for lead actress, Carey Mulligan, said she was “brimming with gratitude today” after scoring her nomination, her third in the category after 2009’s “An Education” and 2020’s “Promising Young Woman.” This year, she’s up for her role in Bradley Cooper’s “Maestro,” and said in her statement shared with CNN that she feels “huge pride for the rest of the Maestro team! Thank you to Bradley for handing me this gift of a role and an experience.”
“Maestro” creator Bradley Cooper, nominated for best picture, best original screenplay and best actor said, “We are all so grateful to be recognized along all of these incredible works of art this year. And the performances from every actor who I so admire. Thank you to Jamie, Alex & Nina Bernstein for allowing their parents’ story to be out there in the world and thank you to the Academy. We are very honored to be included.”
Colman Domingo, who made history on Tuesday as only the second out LGBTQ+ actor nominated for playing a real-life LGBTQ+ character (in the film “Rustin”), said in a statement shared with CNN, “To be amplified for my work for portraying this American Hero is everything to me. When my name is called, so is BAYARD RUSTIN’s. What an extraordinary honor. My heart is bursting with joy.”
Musician Jon Batiste’s “It Never Went Away” from the film “American Symphony,” that in part chronicles his wife’s battle with cancer, was nominated for best original song.
“Making music is an act of survival. There was a stretch of time during which my wife Suleika was in the hospital and we weren’t sure she’d make it,” Batiste said in a statement to CNN. “This song began as a lullaby, so she could have a restful aura in the hospital room…We are grateful to be surrounded by love.”
Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt, nominated for their song “I’m Just Ken” from “Barbie,” said in a joint statement they were “excited and grateful beyond words.”
“This really is the highest honour to be recognized by our peers and heroes from the Academy. And in a year of so many extraordinary songs - including those from our incredible fellow Barbie contributors,” the statement said. “It’s a testament to Greta Gerwig’s power to inspire and bring out the very best in everyone around her. Thank you so much.”
Billie Eilish and her brother Finneas, who previously won in the best original song category for “No Time to Die,” said, “As lifelong fans of film, music in film and the Academy Awards, this means everything to us.”
Celine Song, who scored her first nomination in the best original screenplay category for “Past Lives,” said she is “overwhelmed” by the recognition.
“Some of the experience working on a debut film is secretly questioning if you belong, if people will support your vision. It has been equal parts scary and rewarding to make this film and release it into the world,” she wrote in a statement. “It is with immense gratitude to those who championed my vision that I now get to be among these giants of screenwriting.”
She added: “There’s an Eastern concept in our film called In-Yun, which is the miraculous connection and love we have with each other just by being in the same place at the same time. It’s the result of thousands of lives we’ve shared before this one. Our entire filmmaking team felt this deeply while making Past Lives. Today’s news makes me feel like many of our filmmaking peers felt the same way. Thank you.”"
IYQQYH4H0S_LIA1MUR44DAKHF3,"Venmo and other payment app theft is ‘skyrocketing,’ Manhattan DA warns","By Mark Morales, CNN","4 minute read Updated 7:26 PM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/23/business/venmo-payment-app-theft/,"Venmo, Cash App, PayPal, Zelle and other payment apps may be convenient ways to send cash with a few taps of your smartphone, but they’re a breeding grounds for theft, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg tells CNN.
Culprits range from savvy swindlers, who trick their way into victims’ locked cell phones, to violent offenders who either drug their targets and then take advantage or bark out commands while threatening physical harm, Bragg said in an interview.
The issue has gotten so out of hand in New York that Bragg has sent a letter to the popular apps demanding that they put in more security measures, including lower transfer limits, additional password security, additional wait times for large transactions and increased monitoring for unusual activity.
In the letter, Bragg cited a 2022 letter from Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s office that was sent to the banking industry where they said fraud claims had tripled between 2020 and 2022, costing consumers hundreds of millions of dollars. The investigation centered around Zelle and indicated not only was fraud rampant, but was getting worse. And banks have often been unwilling to make customers whole, even if they were victims of fraud.
As a solution, Bragg asked for more safety measures, such as lowering the limit of daily transfers, requiring wait times on larger transfers, and for a confirmation when suspicious transfers occur. Even something as small as canceling a transaction would help, Bragg said
“A failure to take proactive steps in the name of your consumers will lead to further illegal behavior and countless unsuspecting victims,” Bragg wrote in the letter.
Venmo and its parent company PayPal said they take safety and security seriously.
“In addition to proactively leveraging sophisticated fraud detection tools, manual investigations, and partnering closely with law enforcement agencies to protect our customers against common scams, we have several options in place to enable enhanced layers of security and protection directly within our apps,” a PayPal spokesperson said in a statement.
In a statement, Zelle said it was “aware of isolated criminal incidents described in the Manhattan District Attorney’s letter.”
“Providing a safe and reliable service to consumers is the top priority of Early Warning Services, LLC, the network operator of Zelle, and our 2,100 participating banks and credit unions,” the company said. “As a result of our continued efforts to build on Zelle’s strong foundation of security, less than one tenth of one percent of transactions are reported as fraud or scams, and that percentage keeps getting smaller.”
CashApp did not respond to requests for comment.
Consumers should be protected by fraudulent electronic fund transfers, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
But they often are not covered, Warren’s office found in its investigation, despite regulations that are designed to cover unauthorized access to customers’ accounts. The bank data reviewed by Warren’s office suggest the bulk of unauthorized cases are going unpaid.
Bragg says he’s seen so many instances of criminals using payment apps as a crime of opportunity.
This past year, one man was arrested several times after targeting drunk victims in the early morning hours, either asking to borrow their phone or outright snatching it, prosecutors said.
In one instance in 2022, the alleged thief grabbed his victim’s phone and slashed them on the ear, shoulder and forearm with what appeared to be a knife when the victim tried to get it back, according to court records in Manhattan. When he was asked by a detective why he kept robbing people like this, he replied “because it’s easy,” records show.
In another instance, a team of thieves worked together to steal roughly $6,500 from as many as 50 Lyft drivers in 2020, court records show. The passenger would ask to put in a new address into the Lyft driver’s phone and once inside, they would transfer the in-app earnings to their own bank accounts using Cash App, the records show.
Last January, two men were charged after one held a gun to the victim’s chest and the other held a knife to the same victim’s throat, demanding their unlocked mobile device, court records show. Once in custody, investigators found that the pair has sent themselves $1,749 using Cash App, the records show.
These offenses aren’t just happening in New York. Other major cities are seeing this trend increase as well.
In Los Angeles, a 23-year-old man pleaded guilty to charges stemming from a scheme where he met other men from a dating app and then used their phones to send himself money, federal prosecutors said.
In Boston, a man who thought he was meeting up for an online date was forced to unlock his phone at knifepoint when masked robbers ordered him to Vemno them $1,000, according to local prosecutors.
Bragg said his team has been trying to get the word out in recent years and have heard from victims who never came forward during outreach campaigns about cash app thefts.
“It’s sobering and disconcerting,” Bragg said. “Preventing this is what we need to be focused on as well and that’s what this initiative is all about.”"
J4OF701798_LH01XA8UZMLIHPN,Jon Stewart’s return to ‘The Daily Show’ could shake up 2024 politics,"Analysis by Oliver Darcy, CNN","3 minute read Published 7:08 AM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/25/media/jon-stewart-daily-show-return-2024-politics/,"Editor’s Note: A version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here.
Jon Stewart is returning to his old home at “The Daily Show” — but the neighborhood in which the comedic house resides has dramatically changed since he last signed off from host chair.
Stewart, who hosted the iconic program for 16 years, decamped Comedy Central in 2015 — just as Donald Trump ascended to power and as the seams of American politics tore apart. While there is never a shortage of material pouring out of Washington for comedians to use as punchlines, Stewart returns to the cable lineup in an environment battered by an ill-tempered information monsoon.
Misinformation, conspiracy theories, and outright lies saturate the 2024 public discourse in a way that stands in stark contrast to the pre-Trump era in which Stewart previously operated. Trump and his stable of MAGA political allies have at their disposal a powerful media machine that pumps propaganda into the national conversation and sends it viral on a daily basis.
Back when Stewart helmed “The Daily Show,” he was needling much more establishment figures, such as conservative news personality Bill O’Reilly or Republican President George W. Bush. When he returns to Comedy Central after the Super Bowl next month to begin hosting the network’s signature show each Monday, Stewart will be confronted with a new, far more insidious breed of media and political figures, such as the radicalized Tucker Carlson and the twice-impeached, four time-indicted, election-denying, insurrection-inciting Trump.
That means that not only is Stewart going to have plenty of fodder to work with, but his voice may very well be more important than ever.
While the cable platform he once helmed, and its massive audience reach, is a mere shadow of its former glory, the show still carries significant weight. That is perhaps evidenced by the fact that when Stewart launched an Apple TV+ show — “The Problem with Jon Stewart” — in 2021, it failed to gain a foothold in the public consciousness and establish the cultural cachet he enjoyed from his more accessible cable perch.
Stewart’s talent has always been using humor to disarm dishonest politicians and expose the absurdities of their arguments in a highly entertaining way. He is uniquely talented at drawing on his sharp comedic wit to cut through the political noise and separate fact from fiction for audiences. And during the 2024 election year, that work will be vital.
Stewart also reenters the scene at a time when traditional newsrooms are being pummeled by layoffs and contracting at an alarming pace. The number of journalists and media figures holding the morally bankrupt accountable has slimmed considerably — a service much of the country is thirsting for.
Meanwhile, the mechanisms in which media are distributed have also undergone a revolution. Far fewer people are reading ever-shrinking newspapers and watching the decaying linear television lineups. Instead, they’re being algorithmically-fed information that conforms to their existing viewpoints, regardless if such viewpoints are consistent with the facts.
Stewart has the potential to break through these digital barriers. His stinging political monologues appeal not only to D.C. politicos, but to mass audiences. It’s without a doubt that in the months ahead, social media feeds will be rife with clips of his tongue-in-cheek, truth-based narration of the circus that is American politics.
Of course, Stewart’s comedy returns in a far more challenging environment with a smaller direct audience on cable. He will have an impact, unquestionably, but also won’t single handedly keep the dark forces at bay.
But at this particular moment in American society, when antidemocratic forces are actively poisoning the public information well in their bids to seize power, not only does the reality-dwelling public hunger for spine-possessing, clear-eyed soldiers like Stewart, it arguably demands it."
J6O79FT7NB_RVTU3GSDWUU58M2,Fact check: Trump makes false claims in New Hampshire victory speech,"By Daniel Dale, CNN","4 minute read Updated 12:10 AM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/23/politics/fact-check-donald-trump-new-hampshire-victory-speech/,"Former President Donald Trump made several false claims in a speech Tuesday night after CNN and other media outlets projected that he would win the Republican presidential primary in New Hampshire.
CNN also watched rival candidate Nikki Haley’s Tuesday night speech in New Hampshire; Haley’s claims were either accurate or too general to fact check. Here is a fact check of some of Trump’s assertions.
Trump repeated some of his familiar lies about the 2020 presidential election.
At one point, he claimed, as he has repeatedly in the past, that “they used Covid to cheat.” At another point, he claimed that in addition to winning in 2016, “we also won in 2020 – by more. And we did much better in 2020 than we did in 2016.” He dismissively said, “But as they said, we lost by a whisker.”
Facts First: Trump’s claims are false. He lost the 2020 election fair and square to Joe Biden, by a 306 to 232 margin in the Electoral College, and also lost New Hampshire in that election. There remains no evidence of any fraud even close to widespread enough to have changed the outcome in any state.
Trump Tuesday night said, “Do they hate our country? They must hate our country. Because there’s no other reason that they can be doing the things they do. Take a look – the taxes, they want to raise your taxes times four.”
Facts First: This is false. Neither Biden nor other top Democrats are proposing anything close to quadrupling people’s taxes.
CNN previously fact-checked a similar Trump claim that “they want to double, triple everything.”
Howard Gleckman, senior fellow in the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center at the Urban Institute think tank, said in a November email: “I don’t know what ‘they want to double, triple everything’ means. But if he’s suggesting that Biden would ‘double, triple’ federal income taxes, he’s just making up numbers. There is no evidence to support that claim.”
Gleckman said his organization’s analysis of Biden’s budget proposal for fiscal 2024, which included his most recent tax plan, found that the major tax provisions would “would raise taxes by an average of $2,290, or reduce taxable income by 2.3 percent.”
Trump claimed that he has always won the state – not only in Republican primaries but in general elections.
“You know we won New Hampshire three times now three. We win it every time. We win the primary. We win the generals. We won it and it’s a very, very special place to me.” Trump said.
Facts First: Trump’s claim is false. He lost New Hampshire to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the 2016 general election and to Democratic candidate Joe Biden in the 2020 general election, though he did win the Republican primary each time.
Criticizing Republican New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, a supporter of Haley, Trump said that because of Sununu’s incompetence, “in the Republican primary, they accepted Democrats to vote. In fact, I think they had 4,000 Democrats – Democrats before October 6 – they already voted. Now, they’re only voting because they want to make me look as bad as possible.”
Facts First: Trump’s claims are misleading at best. People registered as Democrats were not allowed to vote in New Hampshire’s Republican primary. Only registered Republicans and independents (people registered as “undeclared”) were allowed to cast ballots in that primary. While it’s true that nearly 4,000 people who had been registered as Democrats switched their affiliation to either undeclared or Republican by October 6, the last day to switch in time to potentially cast a ballot in the GOP primary, it’s not yet clear how many of these people actually ended up voting. And it’s important to note that New Hampshire made its primaries open to independents decades before Sununu became governor in 2017.
Also, while Trump was complaining about people formerly registered as Democrats being permitted to vote in the Republican primary, it is standard for states to allow people to switch affiliations by a certain date in order to participate in another party’s primary – and some states have switching deadlines closer to an election day than New Hampshire does. In Trump’s state of Florida, to name one, voters can switch from Democratic to Republican by February 20 and cast a ballot in the Republican primary in the early voting window that begins less than three weeks later or in person a month later on the March 19 election day. (Unlike in New Hampshire, independents can’t cast Republican primary ballots there.)
Finally, the motivations of the recent New Hampshire affiliation-switchers are not nearly as clear as Trump suggested. While some might have indeed switched with the sole intention of opposing him, some others might have sincerely decided that they no longer saw themselves as Democrats. There was all kinds of affiliation-switching before October 6. For example, the New Hampshire Bulletin reported that 719 people switched from Republican to undeclared and 132 people switched from undeclared to Republican."

Tammie Liles’ partial remains were found in King County in 2003 and were labeled by authorities as “Bones 20” because authorities could not confirm the identity at the time, the King County Sheriff’s Office said in a news release.
Related article For decades, human remains tied to the ‘Green River killer’ were known only as Bones 17. Now, DNA testing has revealed a name
In 2022, the sheriff’s office began working with Texas-based forensic lab Othram on the case. The following year, the lab built a DNA profile and reached a preliminary identification of the remains as those of Liles, the sheriff’s office said.
Detectives collected a DNA sample from Liles’ mother, which was a positive match.
“With this identification, there are no other unidentified remains associated with the Green River Case,” the sheriff’s office said in the news release.
Liles was last seen in June 1983 working as a prostitute in the Seattle area. Her family reported her missing in March 1988, and a separate set of remains was identified as hers using dental records.
Liles is one of dozens of victims of the serial killer Gary Ridgway, known as the “Green River Killer.” The moniker came from a river south of Seattle where he began dumping his victims in 1982.
Authorities spent years investigating his killings. It wasn’t until November 2001 that Ridgway was arrested after DNA evidence linked him to some of the earliest victims in the string of unsolved killings in the Seattle area.
Ridgway pleaded guilty to 48 counts of aggravated murder in 2003, making him one of the most prolific serial killers in US history. He pleaded guilty to a 49th murder charge in 2011.
All but two of his victims’ bodies were found near Seattle. The others were found in Oregon.
Last month, King County authorities announced they identified the remains of Lori Anne Razpotnik, another of his victims. Razpotnik’s family had last seen her alive in 1982, before she ran away from her family’s home in Lewis County, south of Seattle. Her remains were referred to as “Bones 17” when they were found in 1985.
Ridgway, 74, is being held at the Washington State Penitentiary in Walla Walla."

Video clips showing people consuming the deep-fried starch toothpicks with seasoning such as powdered cheese have racked up thousands of likes and shares on TikTok and Instagram.
“Their safety as food has not been verified,” the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety said in a posting on Wednesday on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter. “Please do not eat (them).”

Videos of the toothpicks, a sanitary product, being fried in oil and eaten were going viral, it added.
Food coloring is used to impart a green hue to the toothpicks, made from sweet potato or corn starch, which are seen as being environmentally friendly and biodegradable.
Often used in restaurants in South Korea, they can also be used to pick up finger foods.
A genre of online videos called “Mukbang,” which often show people eating an excessive amount of food or unusual dishes, are popular in South Korea.

Writing on X, Raesian said he received a notification from the Tehran General and Revolutionary Court that Mohammad Ghobadlou’s death sentence will be carried out on January 23, 2024.
Ghobadlou was sentenced to death by Iranian judge Abolqasem Salavati two years ago. Salavati has previously been sanctioned by the US for the notoriously harsh sentences he issued to activists, journalists, and political prisoners, CNN previously reported.
Iranian authorities allege Ghobadlou ran over a local official during a protest in Robat Karim, Tehran province, in September 2022, according to rights group Amnesty International.
He received two death sentences in relation to the death, according to Amnesty. The first death sentence was issued by a Revolutionary Court for “corruption on earth” on November 16, 2022 and upheld by the Supreme Court the following month, the rights group said. A second death sentence was issued by a criminal court in Tehran province for “murder” at the end of December 2022, it added.

But Amnesty criticized the death sentences for following what it described as “grossly unfair sham trials, marred by torture-tainted ‘confessions’ and failure to order rigorous mental health assessments despite (Ghobadlou’s) mental disability.”
Ghobadlou has been under the supervision of a psychiatric hospital for bipolar disorder since the age of 15, according to Amnesty. International law and standards prohibit using the death penalty against people with mental disabilities, according to Amnesty International.
Executions surged in Iran as the government cracked down on nationwide protests in 2022 after the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini while in the custody of the country’s so-called morality police.
Authorities violently repressed the months-long movement that posed one of the biggest domestic threats to Iran’s ruling clerical regime in more than a decade. Rights groups noted last year that the marked rise in executions reflected an effort by Tehran to “instill fear” among anti-regime protesters."

Rep. Virginia Foxx, the Republican chairwoman of the Committee on Education and the Workforce, is requesting that UPenn respond to the document request by no later than February 7.
The committee is seeking a wide range of documents, including reports of antisemitic activity on campus since early 2021; how UPenn responds to hate crimes; disciplinary actions against staff and students related to alleged targeting of Jews; documents and financial information linked to a Palestinian literature festival held on campus last year; and information on foreign donations, including donations from Qatar.
“We have grave concerns regarding the inadequacy of Penn’s response to antisemitism on its campus,” Foxx wrote in the letter to Larry Jameson, UPenn’s interim president, and Ramanan Raghavendran, the chair of the board of trustees.
Lawmakers launched a formal investigation into UPenn, Harvard University and MIT last month following disastrous testimony about antisemitism from the leaders of the three schools.
Liz Magill stepped down last month as UPenn’s president in the wake of her testimony on Capitol Hill. Scott Bok, the chair of the board of trustees, also stepped down.
A UPenn spokesperson told CNN in a statement that the university has received the document request and “will respond after we complete a review of the request.”
Foxx slammed Harvard on Tuesday evening for an “unacceptable” response to the committee’s document request and suggested lawmakers could issue a subpoena if the university does not comply.

JEJ76GYSII_G41C9RAEK0NEJHX,How much aid Gaza needs to survive: A visual guide,"By Rachel Wilson, Krystina Shveda and Alex Newman, CNN","7 minute read Updated 4:39 PM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240122,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/22/middleeast/gaza-foreign-aid-dg/,"Less than a week into the Israel-Hamas war, the United Nations appealed to the world asking for nearly $300 million in aid to assist Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Within a month, the figure nearly quadrupled as the entire Gaza Strip plunged into a humanitarian catastrophe.
Three months into the war, international donors, mostly governments, have provided just over half of the requested funds through the UN’s plan, according to data from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs’ (OCHA) Financial Tracking Service.
The figures reveal that only four-fifths of the emergency funding needed to ensure food security and roughly a quarter of what’s needed for shelter, water and sanitation have been provided.
Aid organizations say that nearly the entire population of the Gaza Strip faces a humanitarian crisis. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, a UN-backed food security agency, reported on December 21 that “virtually all households are skipping meals every day” in Gaza. The spread of diseases, including hepatitis, diarrhea and respiratory infections, is putting more lives at risk, according to the World Health Organization.
The UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East (UNWRA) is reporting that nearly 80% of Gaza’s civilian population of roughly 2.2 million has been displaced since Israel launched its military operation in response to Hamas’ assault on October 7, when militants killed around 1,200 people and took more than 200 others hostage, according to Israeli authorities.
Many are sheltering in tents or overcrowded accommodations in Rafah in southern Gaza, after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told people to flee both northern Gaza and Khan Younis in the south. Displaced Palestinians, many of whom left their homes with little or nothing, say they are struggling to stay dry and warm as winter temperatures and rains set in.
Meanwhile, the UN agency which provides services to more than half of Gaza’s civilians is on the verge of collapse, its leader said in a letter to the President of the UN General Assembly on December 7. As of January 12, more than 150 staff members have been killed — more than in any other conflict — and at least 70% of the remaining staff are displaced, according to the UNRWA.
The IDF has begun pulling its soldiers out of Gaza, but has said it expects fighting to continue throughout 2024. On December 22, the UN Security Council passed a resolution calling for further extended humanitarian pauses to allow more aid into Gaza. There has been no pause in fighting since a seven-day span at the end of November which was negotiated as part of an Israel-Hamas hostage release deal.
Gaza’s long dependence on aid
Gaza has been among the world’s top recipients of aid per capita for years. Before the war, four in five people depended on international help and as many as 1.84 million people were food insecure, according to the World Food Program.
The unemployment rate for Gaza was as high as 45% in 2022, according to the Palestinian Bureau of Statistics. In 2022, according to the World Bank, South Africa had the highest unemployment rate in the world at 29.8%, and Gaza and the West Bank together were third at 25.7%.
In 1993, Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) signed the Oslo Accords. Under the agreement, the PLO gave up armed resistance against Israel in return for promises of an independent Palestinian state. The accords also established the Palestinian Authority (PA) as the limited self-rule government for Gaza and the West Bank. Hamas, an Islamist organization established in 1987, opposed the accords. Its charter calls for the destruction of Israel and the group sees Israel as an illegitimate state occupying the West Bank.
Rising frustration with the PA on a number of fronts, including the lack of change, led to Hamas winning the majority of seats in the 2006 Palestinian Legislative Council election. Fatah, the political party forming the backbone of the PA, and Hamas formed a short-lived coalition government. The latter forcefully took control of Gaza in June 2007. Since then, the PA only exercises limited self-rule in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
“From mid-1990s to early 2000s, Palestine is in this state-building project and a lot of (development) aid goes towards that,” said Yara Asi, an assistant professor at the University of Central Florida who studies Palestinian health and human rights. “In the early 2000s, you start seeing disillusionment — the promises of Oslo did not come to fruition.”
In 2007, Hamas militants seized control of Gaza from forces loyal to the PA. Within months, Israel’s security cabinet would designate Gaza as “hostile territory.”
Israel then instituted an ongoing blockade, severely limiting the movement of people and goods by land, sea or air, which it argues is essential to prevent Hamas from arming itself. Restrictions extend to goods the Israelis consider as having a dual civilian and military use, such as concrete, agricultural fertilizer compounds and some medical equipment.
“Lots of everyday goods and especially building materials could not enter the Gaza Strip because they are on the so-called ‘dual-use material’ list,” said René Wildangel, an adjunct fellow at the International Hellenic University in Thessaloniki, Greece, and a former human rights expert for the Middle East at Amnesty International.
This makes reconstruction difficult, Wildangel said.
The UN said in a 2022 report that the restrictions have had a “profound impact” on daily living conditions in Gaza and “undermined Gaza’s economy, resulting in high unemployment, food insecurity and aid dependency.”
In the wake of the blockade, trade stalled, jobs disappeared, and more and more families fell into poverty, while the population in Gaza grew by nearly 60%, according to an analysis of Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics data.
With Hamas classified as a terrorist organization by the United States and European Union, most of the international community cut off direct investment to Gaza after 2007.
But the magnitude of need in Gaza meant emergency and humanitarian assistance had to keep coming. Data published by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) shows total foreign aid to the Palestinian territories has been notably higher since the Hamas takeover compared with the post-Oslo era.
But even as foreign aid to Gaza rose in the wake of the Hamas takeover, the amount of aid fluctuates annually, OECD data shows.
“Aid to Palestinians is adhoc, it depends on who the (US) president is, depends on who is in charge in Europe; Qatar may wake up one day and decide they want (to help),” Asi told CNN. “So, Palestinians are not given any ability to plan things for the future.”
After 2007, the US bolstered its economic assistance to strengthen the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank.
In 2018, the Trump administration cut about $200 million in Palestinian aid and halted contributions to UNRWA. Though Biden reinstated assistance in 2021, the amounts have never returned to Obama-era levels, which reached as high as $1 billion in 2009.
Qatar has also been a major donor to Gaza, contributing about $1.3 billion since 2019, according to OECD data. The country has even provided cash to pay civil servants’ salaries and shipped fuel to help with generating electricity since at least 2018 with Israel’s approval.
The PA opposed the funding of its rival, and the Israeli intelligence community didn’t back it, according to a former senior defense ministry official, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at the time that he supported the Qatari payments, “to return calm to (Israeli) villages of the south, but also to prevent a humanitarian disaster (in Gaza).” Israeli and international media reported Netanyahu hoped that an emboldened Hamas and divided Palestinian factions would prevent efforts to create a Palestinian state, CNN has reported.
Qatar maintains close ties with both Hamas and Western states, including the United States.
Qatar’s funding has been “a lifeline to the Hamas government” ever since its takeover in 2007, Wildangel said, but added that these funds — some of which have been delivered in suitcases full of cash — have been very hard to track.
Israeli leadership fought over post-war plans for Gaza during a security cabinet meeting on January 4, CNN reported, and ministers have outlined conflicting plans for its future governance.
Meanwhile, civilians in Gaza continue to face desperate hardship. The UN emergency relief chief said earlier last week that the “great majority” of 400,000 Gazans at risk of starving “are actually in famine, not just at risk of famine” while the enclave faces a continuing near-total communications blackout. Medicine for Israeli hostages and Palestinians entered Gaza last Wednesday after Qatar brokered a deal with Israel and Hamas. For every box of medication given to a hostage, Palestinians in Gaza would receive 1,000 boxes.

Jerri Roby, who also goes by the last name Israel, is facing one count of first-degree murder after authorities found the body of her 42-year-old son, John Allen Gaither, behind the wall in her Gulfport home, Gulfport Police Department spokesman Jason DuCré told CNN Sunday.
Authorities started investigating on December 22, 2023, after one of Gaither’s out-of-state relatives called to report him missing, DuCré said, noting the last known contact anyone had made with Gaither was on December 10.
Police started investigating, conducted several follow-ups and “began noticing discrepancies in statements provided by Isreal [sic]. Throughout the course of the investigation, Isreal [sic] became increasingly uncooperative and changed her statements multiple times,” a news release from Gulfport police reads.

Roby had previously been convicted of murder in Florida around 1995, and “made several attempts to dump the deceased subject at different locations throughout Florida,” authorities said in the news release. Police then say they obtained a search warrant.
Detectives and crime scene technicians conducted the search of her home on January 18, the release said. As detectives walked into her home, Roby ingested a handful of unspecified pills, which prompted the need for her to be transported to a hospital for medical treatment, DuCré said.
“During the search of the residence, a wooden box containing a deceased subject, later identified as John Allen Gaither, was located behind a false wall,” the news release states.
DuCré said Roby attempted to cover up the crime by writing notes to family members, where she posed as her son, saying he was OK. Multiple homemade wooden boxes were found at the house and in the garage, DuCré said.
Roby was arrested on Saturday after she was released from the hospital and is now being held in Harrison County Detention Center without bond, according to DuCré, who said due to her past criminal record, she has been deemed a flight risk.
Information about an upcoming court appearance and Roby’s legal representation was not available Sunday."
JJEO6Z8057_Y2Q2IQUO0OYN0L3,What E. Jean Carroll must show to prevail in the defamation trial against Trump,"By Jeremy Herb, Lauren del Valle and Kara Scannell, CNN","4 minute read Published 5:00 AM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240122,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/22/politics/carroll-trump-trial-preponderance-of-evidence/,"The civil defamation trial of Donald Trump returns on Monday with a verdict likely this week on how much more he owes to former magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll.
Carroll has to prove that she is entitled to damages from Trump for defamation by a preponderance of the evidence, a standard used in civil cases that’s lower than what’s required in criminal trials.
That evidence standard was used in Carroll’s civil defamation case last year, in which a jury found that Carroll proved Trump had sexually abused and defamed her by a preponderance of the evidence, but that she did not prove Trump had raped her, as that crime is narrowly defined by New York’s criminal laws. Trump has appealed the verdict.
Carroll’s case last year, in which she was awarded $5 million for battery and defamation, focused on comments Trump made about Carroll in 2022. The current case is about Trump’s statements when he was president in 2019. Carroll is seeking over $10 million in damages.
Trump is expected to be in court when the trial resumes Monday.
After the jury was sworn sworn in last week, Judge Lewis Kaplan compared the preponderance standard in the case to a scale.
“What a preponderance of the evidence means is that the plaintiff has to produce evidence which, considered in light of all of the facts, leads you to believe that what the plaintiff claims is more likely correct or true than not,” Kaplan said.
“To put it differently, if you were to put the plaintiff’s and the defendant’s evidence on opposite sides of metaphorical scales, the plaintiff has the burden to make the scales tip, even if only slightly, in the plaintiff’s favor,” the judge continued. “If they tip slightly for the plaintiff or heavily for the plaintiff, then the plaintiff has prevailed by a preponderance of the evidence. If they tip even slightly for the defendant or heavily for the defendant, then the defendant prevails on that issue.”
Carroll testified at the trial last week that Trump’s statements after she went public about his allegedly having sexually assaulted her shattered her reputation and led to an onslaught of threatening messages.
“I was attacked on Twitter. I was brutally attacked on Facebook. I was attacked in news blogs. I was attacked in messages,” Carroll testified. “As I said, it was a new world. I had left the world of facts, a lovely world, and I was living in a new universe.”
This current trial is not considering whether Carroll proved the sexual abuse allegations, as Kaplan ruled ahead of trial that the verdict in the first trial — that she proved Trump had sexually abused her by a preponderance of the evidence  — will also carry over to this case.
Trump could still testify in the case after Carroll’s attorneys wrap up their case, though it’s not clear if he will do so. His testimony would be limited, as Kaplan has ordered restrictions that Trump will not be allowed to testify that he didn’t assault Carroll or that she lied about the rape allegation — since those questions are not before the jury.
Outside of court, Trump has continued to deny Carroll’s allegations, while in court his lawyers have argued that Carroll’s reputation was not damaged by Trump’s statements in 2019, and that she faced a negative backlash from her story even before Trump commented.
In last year’s trial, Carroll also had to prove by “clear and convincing evidence,” which is a higher standard of proof than preponderance of the evidence, that Trump’s 2022 statement was false and that Trump made the statement with “actual malice.” The jury found Carroll proved both claims.
Kaplan told the jury in this trial that some questions in this case may also have a higher evidentiary standard.
“Typically, the plaintiff in a civil case has the burden of proving her case by what we refer to as the preponderance of the evidence. On some issues, the burden of proof is higher. Should it become necessary, I’ll explain that to you in this case, too,” Kaplan told the jurors Tuesday."

February 2, 2023 - For the third year in a row, Punxsutawney Phil sees his shadow on Groundhog Day, predicting six more weeks of winter.
February 2, 2022 - Punxsutawney Phil sees his shadow, predicting six additional weeks of winter.
The groundhog emerges from its burrow on February 2.
If the groundhog sees its shadow when it emerges, there will be six more weeks of winter.
If it does not see its shadow, spring will arrive soon.
This tradition started in Europe as Candlemas Day. Germans who settled in Pennsylvania in the 1700s brought the custom to America.
Pennsylvania’s Punxsutawney Phil is the most well-known, but more than a dozen states celebrate with their own groundhogs, such as Georgia’s General Beauregard Lee and Buckeye Chuck in Ohio.
His full name is “Punxsutawney Phil, Seer of Seers, Sage of Sages, Prognosticator of Prognosticators, and Weather Prophet Extraordinary.”
February 2, 1886 - The Punxsutawney Spirit newspaper proclaims this date as Pennsylvania’s first official Groundhog Day celebration.
Phil has correctly predicted the beginning of spring 100% of the time, according to his owners. However, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the groundhog’s record isn’t perfect.
1986 - Phil travels to Washington, DC to meet with President Ronald Reagan.
1993 - Columbia Pictures releases the movie, “Groundhog Day,” starring Bill Murray. In the years following the release of the movie, crowds numbering as high as 30,000 have visited Gobbler’s Knob in Punxsutawney.
1995 - Phil appears on the Oprah Winfrey show.
January 27, 2010 - The animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals suggests using a robotic groundhog in place of Punxsutawney Phil.
February 2, 2010 - For the first time, fans can register for a text message alert of Phil’s prediction.
January 28, 2020 - PETA calls again on the keepers of Punxsutawney Phil to let him retire – and to be replaced by an animatronic groundhog."
JNUM4ORKJK_316E3NKXNHDTP2E,"These small male marsupials give up sleep for sex, then die after intense mating season, study finds","By Hafsa Khalil, CNN","4 minute read Published 11:09 AM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/25/australia/male-marsupials-sleep-sex-intl-scli-scn/,"For some, happiness is getting enough sleep. But for a small marsupial in Australia, sex is a higher priority than getting some shut-eye — and it is willing to sacrifice hours of it daily to reach its happy ending.
Scientists based in Australia have found that mouse-sized male antechinus trade sleep to leave more time for reproductive activities during mating season, with one male who was monitored halving his sleep time during that period.
The study, published Thursday in the journal Current Biology, is the first to show direct evidence for this type of “extreme” sleep restriction in any land-dwelling mammal, according to the researchers.
“Animals need to reproduce to pass on their genes, but they also need to sleep to survive,” Erika Zaid, lead author and animal behavior researcher at La Trobe University in Melbourne, told CNN.
“Animals that are long-lived like humans and elephants don’t have this pressure to reproduce in a short period of time. They have the luxury of being able to sleep as long (as) they want (and) need each day,” she said.
Males antechinus, unlike their female counterparts, are semelparous, which means they can only breed once during their lifetime, making lengthy sleep a luxury that could cost them their opportunity to pass on their genes, Zaid explained. Non-breeding dusky antechinus spend an average of 15.3 hours of the day asleep, according to the researchers.
“Sleep restriction in breeding male antechinus is likely to be an adaptive behavioral response driven by strong sexual selection,” the paper said. This drives them to compete with other males to reproduce with as many females as possible, before dying shortly after their first — and last — mating season.
To study the semelparous marsupials, researchers examined two antechinus species: dusky antechinus (Antechinus swainsonii) and wild agile antechinus (Antechinus agilis) both captive and wild.

Researchers found that males from both species were not only more active during mating season, but also slept less during the same period.
Data showed that males were sleeping three hours less per night, every night, for three weeks — approximately the length of the mating period. Males, which only live for 11 months, reproduce once in their lifetime before dying while females can reproduce more than once, Zaid said.
Sleep is “an essential and seemingly universal behavior in the animal kingdom,” said John Lesku, associate professor of zoology at La Trobe University and a sleep scientist, who was involved in the study.
“Sleeping three hours less per night impacts waking performance in humans, (while) antechinus did this for three weeks. Therefore, antechinus may be resilient to sleep loss and have an unknown mechanism to thrive on less sleep during this time, or they may accept the physiological costs of staying awake to secure paternity before they die,” Lesku told CNN.
The paper suggests that sleep reductions were due to the reproductive pressures on the males during their only breeding season, with increased sexual activity positively related to increases in testosterone, the male sex hormone, during the same length of time.
Using accelerometers — instruments used to measure the acceleration of a moving body — the researchers tracked the movement of 15 dusky antechinus (10 male) before and during mating season.
Researchers took blood samples to measure any changes in hormones and took electrophysiological recordings from four males to measure how much they were sleeping.
Blood samples were also taken from 38 wild agile antechinus (20 male) to see if oxalic acid, a biomarker for sleep loss, similarly decreased during the mating period.
While the decrease in oxalic acid suggests the agile antechinus were sleep deprived during mating season, the results show that the difference between males and females was not significantly different, which Zaid points out may suggest that females in the wild are similarly sleep deprived due to male harassment during the mating period.
“Our study is the first to compare male and female activity levels before, during, and after the breeding season, and to reliably relate restfulness with sleep using accelerometry, electrophysiology, and metabolomics,” researchers said in the paper.
Volker Sommer, a professor of evolutionary anthropology at University College London, told CNN: “It rather seems that this is some pre-breeding stale-mate in not letting one’s guard down: males are forced to stay awake because their competitors also do.” Sommer was not involved in the study.
While the results don’t pinpoint a reason for the post-breeding male die-off, there are multiple possibilities, such as elevated corticosteroids — steroid hormones — and sleep deprivation.
Lesku said researchers would next like to examine how male antechinus deal with restricting their sleep for three weeks.

“We have removed this ad,” the Swedish fashion giant told CNN. “We are deeply sorry for the offense this has caused and we are looking into how we present campaigns going forward.”

The ad, screenshotted by a number of social media users before it was removed, featured two elementary schoolgirls dressed in school uniform, with the slogan “Make those heads turn in H&M’s Back to School fashion.”
It prompted a backlash on social media, where users called it “creepy,” “disturbing,” and recalled their own stories about “being ogled” while still at school.
Australian writer Melinda Tankard Reist, who says her work addresses sexualization and the harms of pornography, was among the first on social media to oppose the ad.
“What is your intention with this sponsored Facebook ad?” she posted on X, formerly known as Twitter.
“Little schoolgirls generally don’t want to ‘turn heads.’ The large numbers I engage with in schools want to be left alone to learn and have fun and not draw unwanted attention to their appearance.”"

Virginia Foxx admonishes Harvard for ‘unacceptable’ response to antisemitism investigation,"By Matt Egan, CNN","3 minute read Updated 9:17 PM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/23/business/virginia-foxx-harvard-response/,"House Education Committee Chairwoman Rep. Virginia Foxx blasted Harvard University on Tuesday evening for failing to turn over all the documents lawmakers demanded in their antisemitism investigation into the Ivy League school.
Foxx, a Republican from North Carolina, described Harvard’s initial production of documents as “woefully inadequate” and warned of consequences if the university does not comply with the committee’s requests.
Harvard faced a 5 pm ET deadline on Tuesday to respond to a demand from lawmakers for a mountain of documents relating to antisemitism on campus.
“Rather than answering the Committee’s request in a substantive manner, Harvard has chosen to provide letters from nonprofits and student handbooks, many of which are already publicly available,” Foxx said in a statement. “This is unacceptable. Harvard must produce the remaining documents in a timely manner, or risk compulsory measures.”
Nick Barley, a spokesperson for the House committee, told CNN compulsory measures means the panel is “prepared to subpoena Harvard.” He added that the documents were received by the committee around 5pm ET on Tuesday.
“Harvard is committed to cooperating with the Committee’s inquiry and providing information, including the submission made today, which addresses important questions raised by the Committee,” a Harvard spokesperson told CNN in a statement. “We denounce any form of antisemitism in the strongest possible terms and are committed to the safety and well-being of our students. We intend to continue to engage with the Committee in a dialogue to respond to their ongoing requests.”
Last week, Alan Garber, Harvard’s interim president, unveiled two presidential task forces aimed at fighting antisemitism and Islamophobia.
“Reports of antisemitic and Islamophobic acts on our campus have grown, and the sense of belonging among these groups has been undermined,” Garber said in the announcement. “We need to understand why and how that is happening—and what more we might do to prevent it.”
Earlier this month, Foxx wrote a letter to Harvard leaders with a wide-ranging request listing 24 separate categories of documents to be turned over, including all reports of antisemitic incidents and related reports since early 2021; documents on how the university responds to such incidents; settlements by Harvard in response to discrimination, harassment or free speech violations since early 2018; and communications linked to Harvard’s response to an October anti-Israeli student organization letter.
Lawmakers also requested that Harvard produce information on the school’s diversity office and foreign donations, including all donations from Qatari sources since early 2021.
The House investigation is separate from a probe by the same committee into how Harvard responded to plagiarism allegations against its former president, Claudine Gay. Harvard turned over documents last Friday on the plagiarism investigation.
Another House panel, the powerful Ways and Means Committee, recently threatened to reassess the lucrative tax-exempt status of Harvard and three other universities amid concerns about how they have handled antisemitism on campus.
The Department of Education has also launched an unprecedented number of Title VI investigations into colleges, including Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania and Cornell University."
K04ZICBDQB_NEQIOW7LKBKLDGM,‘Our tents were drowned.’ Torrential rain adds to the misery of Gaza’s displaced,"By Mohammad Al Sawalhi, Abeer Salman, Sana Noor Haq and Celine Alkhaldi, CNN","6 minute read Published 12:30 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/25/middleeast/torrential-rain-gaza-israel-khan-younis-offensive-intl/,"Men with rolled up trousers wade through floods, trying to salvage makeshift tents submerged in dirty water and floating plastic.
Nearby, toddlers make toys out of garbage, pressing their bare feet into the wet sand.
Torrential rain in Gaza is making an already brutal existence even harder for the tens of thousands of people displaced and camping in the open air.
CNN video from Deir Al-Balah in central Gaza, shows dozens of people searching for their belongings after torrential rain washed away mattresses, food and clothes overnight Wednesday.
“Today, our tents were drowned,” Jamal Ramadan told CNN. “All the nylon flew away. We slept under the rain. Everyone drowned. The children were in the water. Our food and drinks are all gone.”
Israel’s bombardment and besiegement of Gaza has obliterated huge parts of the strip, crushed the medical system and triggered a humanitarian crisis marked by food, fuel and water shortages. More than 2.2 million Palestinians face widespread hunger, dehydration and deadly disease.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) launched its offensive aiming to eliminate Hamas, after more than 1,200 people were killed and another 250 abducted in the militant group’s October 7 attacks on southern Israel.
At least 1.7 million people in Gaza have since been internally displaced, many multiple times, according to the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
Israeli attacks on Gaza since October 7 have killed at least 25,700 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health. CNN cannot independently verify the figures due to the difficulty of reporting from the war zone.

In the past week, the IDF has pressed its campaign further into central and southern Gaza, forcing hundreds and thousands of people into tiny patches of territory without basic sanitation or drinkable water.
With winter winds and heavy rainfall lashing the Palestinian enclave, parents in Deir Al-Balah told CNN they cannot sleep because they are trying to comfort their children.
“We were all asleep, and at midnight, we woke up when all those tents were drowned in water. We started carrying our children,” said Ahmad Al Rebai.
Another civilian, Um Muhammad, said she and others no longer have clothes for their children. “We pulled our children from the water. No one cares about us.”
Gaza sits in the Mediterranean Basin, which is highly vulnerable to climate change. While the region is experiencing less rainfall annually — making it susceptible to drought — some parts are also seeing more frequent and intense extreme rain events that are expected to worsen the more the Earth warms, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
January is traditionally the rainiest month in southern Israel and Gaza, generally seeing around 100 mm of rainfall on average. Totals this week could approach these monthly averages in some locations. A temperature drop of 5-8 degrees Celsius will be felt over the next few days as the weather system moves through the region, which will make for unseasonably cold conditions, according to the Israel Meteorological Service.
“All we say is enough with all this. We want to go back to our homes in Gaza. We are tired of this life,” one man said. “It has been three and a half months. Enough with this life. It’s better that we die than live like this.”
Humanitarian workers in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, meanwhile described mass bombardment, heavy tank fire and air raid alerts in recent days, as Israel intensified its military campaign in the city.
Raging flames engulfed the walls of a UN shelter west of Khan Younis, after the facility was shelled on Wednesday. At least 12 people were killed and another 75 injured, according to Thomas White, director of the UN’s relief agency for Palestine refugees (UNRWA).
Part of the UNRWA training center, hosting thousands of people, was hit by two shells and caught fire, added White.
UN staff managed to reach the location on Wednesday evening, after being denied access multiple times, the director said. “Persistent attacks on civilian sites in Khan Younis are utterly unacceptable and must stop immediately.”
The IDF said in a statement that it “currently” ruled out an aerial or artillery strike carried out by Israeli forces hit the UN facility. A “thorough review of the operations of the forces in the vicinity is underway,” according to the IDF, adding it is “examining the possibility that the strike was a result of Hamas fire.”
Further north, Gaza’s Civil Defense said on Thursday they dealt with “unbelievable” injuries, including loss of limbs, after an attack on civilians waiting for aid in Gaza City.
Crews were trying to reach the injured, but are being “blocked” by Israeli forces, Gaza Civil Defense Mahmoud Basal spokesperson said from the local Al Shifa Hospital, adding that there are areas they have not been able to get to.
Civilians were “targeted” by Israeli forces at the Kuwaiti roundabout in Gaza City, where they were gathered to pick up bags of flour, according to Basal.
Mohammed Al-Rifi, who sustained injuries in his arm and leg after the shelling incident by the Kuwaiti roundabout, said he and others there were “shelled four times.”
CNN asked the IDF earlier Thursday for comment on any military operations in the vicinity of the roundabout.
Earlier in the week, hospital workers reported dire conditions inside facilities including the Nasser Medical Complex, Al Amal Hospital and the Palestine Red Crescent Society headquarters, where displaced staff and patients were trying to shelter.
On Thursday, Al Amal hospital in Khan Younis was targeted for a fourth consecutive day, according to the Palestine Red Crescent Society.
The PRCS also alleged that Israeli forces imposed “a complete curfew around the hospital since yesterday afternoon, restricting the movement of ambulance crews to and from the hospital. Thousands of displaced individuals live in constant fear and anxiety due to the ongoing siege and bombardment.”
The IDF said on Wednesday they were pursuing “military targets, outposts, infrastructure and command and control centers,” in Khan Younis, adding their campaign there will continue for “several days.”
“The manoeuver will continue against military targets that are in the area, outposts, infrastructure, and command and control centers,” the IDF said.
The IDF regularly asserts that it does not target hospitals but that Hamas uses them as cover for its military operations. CNN cannot independently verify operational details reported by the IDF.
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) warned “concrete actions” are needed to preserve “life saving” medical services in war torn Gaza.
The ICRC highlighted the deficiencies in the current healthcare system in Gaza where only two referral hospitals – Nasser Medical Complex and the European Gaza Hospital – providing advanced medical services are operational.
Dr. Ashraf Al-Qidra, the spokesperson for the Hamas-run Ministry of Health in Gaza, described the situation at Nasser Hospital as “extremely catastrophic.”
“The hospital is operating at 10% of its capacity. Operating rooms have run out of anesthesia and painkillers for patients and the wounded,” Al-Qidra said in a statement to CNN.
Fears are also mounting regarding supplies, with Al-Qidra warning that food supplies have run out and there are only enough fuel reserves for five days.
The ICRC added that if the Nasser Medical Complex and the European Gaza Hospital “cease to function,” the “world will bear witness to untold thousands of preventable deaths given the size of the population, the current extreme living conditions, a collapsing health system, and the intensity of the fighting.”

The views expressed in these commentaries are their own.
This isn’t the Olympics. This is the GOP contest for the presidential nomination — and there are no medals for second place. Although former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley is the last contender standing between former President Donald Trump and the Republican nomination, the results in New Hampshire do not bode well for her future.
Haley cast herself as a reasonable alternative to Trump, a traditional Republican who could attract “Never Trump” GOP voters and Independents. The problem with this approach is that most Republican voters do not want an alternative to Trump; they overwhelmingly back him. Polling shows Trump even leads Haley in her home state of South Carolina.
Haley’s campaign suffers from an identity crisis. She presents herself as a moderate, and yet on issues like immigration, she echoes Trump’s hardline positions, including mass deportations of undocumented migrants and finishing the border wall.
She declared that “America has never been a racist country,” despite recounting discrimination that she experienced growing up. While she called for a “national consensus” on abortion, her vague stance on reproductive rights confused voters.
She questioned whether Trump was mentally fit for office and criticized him for “too many lies.” Yet she also suggested that, if elected, she would pardon him. And despite Trump’s bigoted attacks on her heritage (like calling her by a mangled version of her birth name), Haley told CNN’s Dana Bash that she would vote for him if he became the Republican nominee.
How does any of this add up to a coherent message?
Over the last few months, Haley has alternated between being a principled conservative and a Trump sycophant. In the process, she lost herself and any viable shot at the White House. On a broader level, Haley’s failure to launch in the Granite State is more evidence that the GOP is becoming less of a political party and more of a cult of personality.

This primary isn’t over. At least that’s what the Nikki Haley campaign said after finishing second to former President Donald Trump in the New Hampshire primaries on Tuesday.
While conventional wisdom, political analysts, talking heads and the Trump campaign insist this race is over, and that former Trump is the inevitable Republican nominee, it bears pointing out that nearly half of New Hampshire voters chose someone other than Trump. In Iowa last week, 49% of voters in Iowa chose someone other than Trump.
The only accurate way of describing the state of this race is that the voters in the Republican primary are divided, and have not, in fact, coalesced around Trump as he’d have us believe. That’s not a great way to go into a general election, with so many voters explicitly saying, as they did to CNN field reporters, that they were over Trump. That might change over the course of the primary, but if New Hampshire offers us a snapshot in time, the picture is of a fairly weak frontrunner. As the Haley campaign told me earlier on Tuesday, it’s almost as if a bunch of Republicans have left the party because of Trump … and Nikki is bringing them home.
Can the former South Carolina governor bring them all the way home? The map gets harder for her from here. But Haley has a $4 million ad buy starting Wednesday in South Carolina, and the campaign is looking ahead to Michigan, which votes a few days after her home state, as another place she can give Trump a run for his money.
For independents, moderates and disaffected Republicans, Haley represents an all-too-important candidate in this race: the woman standing between Trump and the White House. For everyone – including the Biden campaign – declaring this race over, she owes it to those voters to stay in and not succumb to Trump’s inevitability posturing, or Biden’s eagerness to face a weaker candidate. She’s earning votes to stop Trump, and that’s what she must continue to do.

There are two very different storylines that emerged from New Hampshire: The first is former President Donald Trump’s cult-like support among diehard Republicans. The more important story, though, is his stunning weakness among independents.
Trump lost a stunning two-thirds of New Hampshire voters who are not in either political party, according to initial results from a CNN exit poll. In Iowa, 43% of former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s supporters said they would vote for President Joe Biden against Trump.
That the Republican Party is now one more Trump property is news from nowhere. In the eight years since he slithered down that escalator in Manhattan’s Trump Tower, he has remade the party. Where Reagan-Bush Republicans stood for limited government, strong national defense, and traditional family values, Trump added about $8 trillion to the national debt, disdains NATO, and has been found by a jury of his peers to be civilly liable for sexual abuse (which he has denied).
Trump’s challenge, now that the nomination fight is effectively over, will be to appeal to voters who are turned off by his cult of personality. His angry, bitter speech Tuesday night was a terrible beginning for the general election. Did the grievance-filled rant against Haley sound like a winner to you? No, it sounded like a guy who is in deep doo-doo with independents.
This is a potential disaster for Trump. To attend this year’s Iowa GOP caucuses in the freezing cold, you had to be a very committed Republican. (Unlike New Hampshire, Iowa does not allow independents to vote in the GOP caucus.) And yet nearly half of the loyal Republicans who supported Haley in Iowa say they cannot support Trump in November; Biden wins them by a margin of 20 points.
Trump’s team should have a well-deserved drink. But the hangover is going to be brutal.
Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist and CNN political commentator, was a political consultant for Bill Clinton’s presidential campaign in 1992 and served as a counselor to Clinton in the White House.
No matter how you feel about former President Donald Trump’s decisive victory in New Hampshire, there is bad news: Our country is now in general election mode, and it will be for 285 more days. Almost a full year. Even if the names at the top of the ticket change (which is still within the realm of possibility), the die is cast for the rest of the contest.
I am uncertain as to how the country survives the sensory assault of a prolonged presidential campaign — the ads; the endorsements; the controversies, real and imagined — and lives to vote about it. Remember how the monotony of the pandemic — hearing the same thing on the news every day, the same background sense of enormity — warped our sense of time? This could be like that, but louder.
What American will still feel like voting after nine months of being asked to? Nagging someone just encourages tuning out. We have lost the patience to watch television on a week-to-week basis; to keep us engaged, someone (the campaigns or the media covering them) will have to come up with cliffhangers far beyond the traditional questions of vice-presidential choices and debate performances.
If so, what could those stakes be? I fear the campaigns could become an ever-escalating war of even more extreme statements, on both sides, though I cannot imagine how we go more apocalyptic than we already are. President Joe Biden has said to voters, “Your freedom is on the ballot.” Trump … well, Trump finds the apocalypse in everything from the presence of immigrants to windmills. He warns constantly that the country itself may come to an end.
But Trump’s ego cannot abide any subsiding of attention; his word salad will get spicier every time he senses the nation’s eyes wandering. Then Biden will have to alert his voters to Trump’s extremism, his warning amping up the emotional charge even more.
Potentially, it becomes a contest as to whose base is more terrified of the other.
Trump — and Trumpism, or whoever represents it — is dangerous. Raise alarms! But the relentlessness of what’s to come troubles me. I have trouble picturing a high voter turnout if our experience of democracy is a series of campaign ads stomping on a human face, forever.

Getting a primary challenger is usually the harbinger of doom for a president. Often, that challenge has roots in an ideological critique. Not so for Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips. His challenge to President Joe Biden is rooted in chronology, not policy.
President Jimmy Carter faced a challenge from the left by Senator Edward Kennedy in 1980. Kennedy was a liberal icon. Carter won the nomination but suffered a devastating loss in the general election against Republican Ronald Reagan that year.
President George H.W. Bush was challenged by conservative columnist and ideological pitchfork holder Pat Buchanan in 1992. Democratic nominee Bill Clinton and third-party candidate Ross Perot exploited that division in the Republican Party against Bush in the fall. Bush lost that campaign.
Biden’s main intraparty challenger, however, isn’t attacking him for being out of touch with the party or the country. His main line of attack is that the president is too old.
That’s not insignificant. Voters care. It comes up in just about every survey. But agism isn’t an alternative vision for the future. It’s process. If most Democrats agree that Biden’s strengths are more important than his advanced years, the president should be okay. Time will tell.
More worrying would be an anti-war candidate running on Biden’s embrace of Israel in the war against Hamas after its brutal October 7 attack on Israel. There’s real ideological sand out there that could help a challenger get traction. Young people and many people of color reject Biden’s Israel policy. It was Eugene McCarthy’s anti-Vietnam campaign that undid President Lyndon Johnson in 1968.
Marianne Williamson is running that campaign in the Democratic primary but with no success. In an alternate universe, more prominent progressives such as US Sen. Bernie Sanders or Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal might. Not this year.
Instead, Democrats are wrestling with whether an 81-year-old Biden is up to the job. Tuesday night in New Hampshire we had the first answer to that question, and it appears Biden is passing the test.
Jamal Simmons is a longtime Democratic political and communications advisor. He was most recently communications director for Vice President Kamala Harris at the White House and is currently a CNN political commentator.
Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley had everything going for her in the New Hampshire primary. This is a state that often rewards moderates and mavericks: where John McCain beat former President George W. Bush by 18 points in 2000. With President Joe Biden not even appearing on the New Hampshire Democratic ballot this time, liberal-leaning independents who wanted to participate in an exciting race had an easy excuse for voting in the Republican primary. They could show their disapproval for former President Donald Trump by voting for Haley.
It wasn’t enough. Trump has comfortably won New Hampshire, and the Republican race that looked like it was already over after the Iowa caucuses is unquestionably finished now. The next big contest is in her home state, South Carolina, but she polls worse there than she has in the Granite State. South Carolina looks like a safe state for Trump — the only question is what his margin of victory will be.
Haley knows this, and so does her campaign staff. So do her donors. Will they stay in the fight for another month, just to lose to Trump by a bigger margin than Tuesday night? As Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis showed in the days between his second-place finish in Iowa and his withdrawal from the race, it’s agony to keep campaigning when you know you only face humiliation in the races to come.
The Republican Party is united behind Trump, and with optimal conditions for an opponent like Haley, Trump was still unstoppable. Now he’s weighing vice presidential picks, and the ultimate contest — the rematch between him and Biden — begins.

The results Tuesday night, while not awarding any delegates to the current president, only confirmed what many of us liberal Democrats suspected: The Democratic Party no longer gives a fighting chance to candidates other than establishment neoliberals, so we must look elsewhere.
That President Joe Biden will be the winner of the nomination seems a foregone conclusion, even though I think author Marianne Williamson, who represents more traditional liberal values, could have made a bigger impact if she was given a chance.
Williamson might have picked up the pro-peace contingent if she hadn’t been mostly ignored by the traditional media and other Democrats. She was one of the few peace candidates, calling for a ceasefire early on in Gaza, and even wrote that rather than bombing the Houthis in Yemen, we might resolve the Red Sea shipping crisis by stopping the bombing of Gaza, the stated reason for the Houthis’ attacks on merchant vessels – a principled liberal stance that no other mainstream candidate seems willing to say out loud. Biden’s stance on both Gaza and Ukraine seem to align more with neoliberal and neocon values.
After liberal stalwart Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator, criticized Biden for failing to address working-class voters’ concerns, Williamson pointed out that there was a Democrat who was already doing so (herself), but was largely ignored by Sanders and the media.
Even failed 2020 candidate Andrew Yang, who suffered a similar fate to Williamson in the Democratic primaries, encouraged Williamson to step aside in favor of Minnesota Rep. Dean Philips just a few days before the New Hampshire primary. Williamson’s response to Yang should make traditional liberals beam: “The days of a woman stepping aside on the assumption that a man can do a better job are over.”

It’s all over but the shouting – former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley may have barely mustered a close enough showing in the New Hampshire primary Tuesday to justify a push toward her home state, but for all intents and purposes, the Republican Party has chosen to nominate former President Donald Trump for a third time.
The roster of those whom Trump defeated on his way to victory in 2016, 2020 and 2024 shows the deep bench of possible presidential contenders that Republicans had prided themselves on during the presidency of Barack Obama.
Dozens took their shot and lost: Successful governors who turned out to be paper tigers, like former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis; self-described compassionate conservatives like former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott; principled conservative senators like Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio; business-friendly moderates like former Ohio Gov. John Kasich and, of course, Haley. All of them, plus many more, proved more out of touch with the base of the party than the twice-divorced former reality TV star from New York.
There’s little doubt, now, that Trump has remade the party in his own image. In so doing, he cleared out an entire bench of those who would have offered a different path to the White House. Even if the likes of Cruz or DeSantis were to run again, they would do so as a Trump product, not a tea party one.
The next time there’s a meaningful Republican primary election, it will be a question of which of the post-Trump figures can best channel his energy — not which of his contemporaries can best present an alternative.

After the results of the Iowa caucuses, too many considered the trailblazing former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley dead in the political water. It turns out she wasn’t. Finishing third in Iowa to former President Donald Trump and Florida’s Gov. Ron DeSantis, many thought Haley seemed a long shot to be competitive in a two-person race with Trump at the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday night after DeSantis dropped out of the presidential primary this past weekend. And yet, she held her own on Tuesday.
But the real news coming out of New Hampshire is the ugly gender war in the GOP. Nearly all the fellas came to Trump’s rescue, including South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, who owes his political rise to Haley after she appointed him to the US Senate in 2012. At a time when the women of America feel under assault when it comes to reproductive rights and the Biden-Harris team centered an event Tuesday night in Virginia around reproductive rights, the Republicans seem badly out of touch with the women of America.
Case in point: once-rising Republican star Haley. At age 51, she was the only woman to go toe-to-toe with the guys on the debate stage, and by some accounts, she won every single time. And yet, the men of the Trump Party just do not get it from where this former moderate Republican woman of color sits.
They do not understand how vulnerable they are with women voters, and I expect 2024 will showcase that. As for Haley, I hope she stays in the race and finally finds the courage to call Trump out for the threat to American democracy that he is. Regardless, she should not under any circumstance be his running mate; she needs to run again in 2028, when the GOP and America will finally be free of Trump.

Overshadowed by the contentious GOP primary between former President Donald Trump and former UN Ambassador and South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, Tuesday’s New Hampshire Democratic primary was unique in its own right.
The outcome for Democrats was only symbolic since none of the votes translated to delegates for the presidential nomination after New Hampshire rejected the Democratic National Committee’s decision to take away its first-primary-in-the-nation status.
That made Tuesday’s vote more of a referendum on the strength of President Joe Biden. Indeed, the DNC’s decision to disregard the New Hampshire primary forced the state’s Democratic establishment to organize an 11th-hour write-in campaign for Biden – since he wasn’t on the ballot given the DNC’s move – to avoid a possible embarrassment by upstart challenger Dean Phillips, a third-term congressman from Minnesota, whom I have known since he launched his promising political career back in 2018.
Phillips’ hoped that the incumbent president’s absence from New Hampshire would provide an opening for testing his thesis that rank-and-file Democrats are keen on having an alternative to Biden and that the Democratic establishment is “sleepwalking towards disaster” with the 81-year-old president as its nominee, but that hypothesis met a somewhat icy reception in New Hampshire.
Sure, Biden might fail to hit the same 80%+ threshold that Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton achieved in the New Hampshire primary as they ran for second terms in 2012 and 1996, respectively. But the fact that Biden’s results were strong despite being a write-in candidate who spent basically zero time campaigning in the state speaks volumes about the power he still commands among the party faithful.
Phillips, for his part, is undeterred, telling me Tuesday night that he vows to fight on. “We’re taking our message to South Carolina and then Michigan and then maybe all the way to the finish line. We’re just getting started,” he told me. “Democrats deserve options, and it’s not clear at all that President Biden can beat Donald Trump. And once Americans become more familiar with the daylight that exists between me and the president on a host of issues from Israel to the southern border to Medicare for all – I am confident our campaign will only grow in support.”
Kudos to Phillips for sticking to his guns, but the road ahead won’t be getting any easier. With Biden on the ballot in future states and his campaign machine operating at full speed, Phillips’ reception in the next few primaries will likely be even more frigid than in New Hampshire.

Sometimes the biggest story of a New Hampshire primary is the thing that didn’t happen.
Heading into the evening, there were already rumblings that Donald Trump would not just win New Hampshire, but win by a landslide.
Meanwhile, on the Democratic side, it was unclear how Joe Biden would fare as a write-in candidate – and in a state which he just demoted from its prized first-in-the-nation status.
In short, it seemed reasonable to wonder: What would the political consequences be for the Democratic incumbent if he failed to get a larger percentage of the Democratic vote than Trump did in the GOP primary?
But none of that happened.
Trump earned a solid victory, with about 55% of the vote. But while he retained his blue-collar base, he trailed Haley among White voters with a college degree by an 18% margin.
In New Hampshire and other swing states, he may well face continued skepticism among suburban voters.
Meanwhile, it appears that more than 60% of Democratic voters supported Biden, even though voters had to write-in his name.
Gone are the comparisons to Lyndon Johnson and 1968. Dean Phillips is no Gene McCarthy.
2024 will go down in New Hampshire primary history as rather forgettable. But only if you forget what didn’t happen.

Intensity. Identification. Anger. The results from New Hampshire show persistent strengths for former President Donald Trump with Republican voters that President Joe Biden can’t ignore as both look past the remaining primaries toward a general-election rematch.
Almost three in four of Trump’s backers in exit polls expressed “strong” support for him; Biden can’t match that right now in his own party.
It seems that Trump’s zeal to fight and his supporters’ perceptions that he shares their values are more important to them than temperament or electability — especially those without college degrees and with negative perceptions of the economy and mistrust of the 2020 election results.
Dissatisfaction with the economy and direction of the country seem top of mind for voters this year. But on top of that, Trump’s backers appear to be disproportionately dissatisfied, another factor that may keep them engaged.
New Hampshire’s results do carry some real warnings for Trump in terms of the general election. Nikki Haley’s closer-than-expected New Hampshire loss shows many independents and a significant minority of Republicans don’t want Trump back in the White House.
They include moderates who want to preserve women’s access to abortion and institutionalists who dislike Trump’s past conduct, legal troubles, hardline immigration or foreign policy approaches.
Haley’s backers said they were driven more by their quest for a Trump alternative than devotion to her. But Trump’s back-to-back hold on his party in two very different states, Iowa and now New Hampshire, shows how formidable he may still be.

K1IRVSP9AD_RZ5C3MUFG3V5V2N,"As Trump dominates nomination race, major GOP donors who backed Haley shift focus to Congress","By Fredreka Schouten and Alayna Treene, CNN","8 minute read Updated 7:08 AM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/26/politics/republican-donors-trump-haley-senate/,"As former President Donald Trump marches closer to the Republican presidential nomination, some conservative outside groups and donors opposed to his candidacy say they now must redouble their efforts to win the Senate in November.
And some fret that with Trump at the top of the ticket – a scenario growing more likely with his decisive back-to-back victories in Iowa and New Hampshire – the task of holding the House and flipping the Senate will grow harder, even in a year when the Senate electoral map strongly favors the GOP.
“If Trump ultimately is the nominee, the threat of a repeat of the last three elections and a Democrat sweep increases dramatically – making the Senate and the House that much more important,” said Bill Riggs, a spokesman for Americans for Prosperity Action.
The group, aligned with billionaire industrialist Charles Koch, has spent millions promoting former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley as the best GOP candidate to defeat Trump in the primary, since endorsing her in late November. AFP Action leaders, who will discuss their political plans with the network’s donors at a Southern California gathering this weekend, say they continue to support Haley – despite her bruising loss Tuesday in New Hampshire and the “steeper road” she faces in her home state. Polls show Trump with a big lead in the Palmetto State’s February 24 primary.
But the Koch officials say the group’s biggest 2024 investment will come in Senate contests, with a prime focus on flipping Democratic-held seats in six states: Michigan, Montana, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. It’s already endorsed in three of those primaries with more announcements to come.
In a recent AFP Action memo that appeared to hedge its bet on Haley, Emily Seidel, a top official, said the Senate represented the organization’s “highest probability play” to guard against what she called “One Party Progressive rule” in Washington.
Eric Levine, a New York-based donor who has backed Haley and plans upcoming fundraisers for GOP Senate candidates, said a day after Trump’s New Hampshire win: “It’s all hands on deck for the Senate.”

He said he holds out little hope of Republicans retaining the House after a court ruling last month ensured New York Democrats will have ultimate control over the redrawing of New York’s 26-seat congressional map ahead of this year’s elections. (A court-drawn Empire State map in 2022 helped Republicans flip four seats in the midterms – victories that allowed the GOP secure its current, narrow majority in the House.)
“The Senate is absolutely critical to saving the republic,” Levine said.
For his part, Trump is threatening to blacklist donors who continue to support Haley, writing on social media that anyone who contributes to her moving forward “will be permanently barred from the MAGA camp.”
Art Pope, a Republican from North Carolina and a longtime Koch donor, is backing Haley’s candidacy and said Trump’s threat only “emboldens” him to further support her.
“I and most Americans do not respond well to a bully,” Pope told CNN.
Doug Deason, a Republican donor from Texas who also will join the Koch conclave over the weekend, has donated to several GOP candidates – including Haley, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Trump – this election cycle.
But he thinks Haley has reached the end of the road.
“I really like Nikki,” Deason said. “But I just think she’s kind of painted herself in the establishment role that most Republicans just don’t want.”
Despite his early dominance, Trump’s critics point to troubling signs for the party in the general election should he become the GOP’s standard-bearer – including his angry rhetoric Tuesday night in New Hampshire that mocked Haley’s post-election speech and her “fancy dress.”
In another warning for some Republicans, CNN’s exit polls show Haley won by a wide margin the third of the New Hampshire GOP electorate that identified as moderate or liberal – a bloc with whom the eventual nominee will need to make inroads. Additionally, 42% of the electorate said Trump – who faces criminal charges in four separate cases – would be unfit for the presidency if convicted of a crime.
“It’s every man for himself,” one Republican member of Congress said this week of the prospect of sharing a ballot with Trump.  “It is going to be chaos and mayhem and a free-for-all. You have to look after you.”
“You’re going to have to make (the campaign) about what you’ve done or what you’re going to do locally,” added the lawmaker, who requested anonymity to speak freely about Republicans’ electoral challenges this fall.
Democrats, of course, face an enormous risk of their own this year with the top of their ticket. CNN’s most recent Poll of Polls shows President Joe Biden with an average 60% disapproval rating.
Democrats and allied independents currently control the Senate 51-49.
Republicans, however, have the big advantage in this year’s Senate races – defending just 11 seats compared with 23 held by the other side. Three of those Democratic seats are in states Trump won easily in 2020.
But, in the 2022 midterms, a favorable map blew up for Republicans, in part, because some Trump-backed candidates flamed out in the general election.
This time around, Republican Senate leaders worked to forge close ties with Trump.
Montana Sen. Steve Daines, the head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, was the first member of Senate GOP leadership to back Trump’s presidential bid. Several other prominent Republicans have recently begun to close ranks behind the former president.
“The NRSC is being smart to work with Trump and instead of against him since he has proven he can torpedo our Senate races,” said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist. “Looking at our map, there’s absolutely no reason Republicans shouldn’t win the Senate.”
But given the polling showing Trump’s underperformance among independents, that “makes candidate quality in the Senate races even more important,” he added.
Trump has privately told many of his advisers and allies that he believes he made too many endorsements during the 2022 midterm elections and is planning to stay out of many of the upcoming congressional fights, three sources familiar with the discussions said. That decision is in part due to his preoccupation with his own campaign, the sources said, but he also doesn’t want to alienate key blocs of conservative voters by engaging too deeply in Republican primaries.
Yet Trump has not removed himself entirely from the process and has chosen to put his finger on the scale in a series of crucial races for candidates he believes in personally and thinks could help Republicans secure the Senate majority, assist him on the campaign trail or prove useful in the Senate, post-2024, if he were to reclaim the White House.

Arizona Senate candidate Kari Lake, a fierce Trump ally who has stumped for the former president this year, is a prime example. He delivered an early endorsement in October for Lake, who ran unsuccessfully for Arizona governor in 2022.
Of the three Trump-won states where Democrats are defending Senate seats – West Virginia, Montana and Ohio – the former president has taken sides in two of those races.
He endorsed Ohio Senate candidate Bernie Moreno in December, following encouragement from a top ally –the state’s junior senator, JD Vance –  to get behind behind the wealthy businessman during a meeting at Mar-a-Lago, CNN previously reported.
In the case of Moreno, who is running in a crowded GOP primary, Trump views his endorsement as something that will help narrow the field in a meaningful way, a source familiar with the former president’s thinking told CNN.
Trump also endorsed West Virginia Senate candidate Jim Justice, someone he likes personally, the sources said. Justice, a second-term governor, faces US Rep. Alex Mooney, who is backed by the conservative Club for Growth — a group Trump has battled with in past years. The stakes are lower in West Virginia, a state Trump won by nearly 40 points in 2020 and where Republicans are expected to pick up the seat now held by outgoing Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin.
Trump, however, has steered clear so far of wading into Montana’s Senate race, despite the efforts of hard-line GOP Rep. Matt Rosendale to attract his endorsement.
This year, Senate leaders also have made clear that they will take a more hands-on approach in GOP primaries than they have in the past.
Top GOP Senate recruits include retired Army Capt. Sam Brown in Nevada, businessman Tim Sheehy in Montana and former hedge fund executive Dave McCormick in Pennsylvania – who lost the 2022 GOP primary for the state’s other Senate seat to Trump’s pick, celebrity physician Mehmet Oz. All three have been endorsed by AFP Action.
In the 2022 midterms, Oz went on to lose to John Fetterman as Democrats flipped the seat and retained control of the Senate.
This year, the Keystone State will once again be awash in campaign money and advertising as part of the crucial “blue wall” of Rust Belt states – including Michigan and Wisconsin – that Biden flipped from Trump on his way to winning the White House in 2020.
Even as the GOP coalesces around McCormick in his bid to oust three-term Democratic Sen. Bob Casey, he and other Republicans on the Senate ballot this year will have to “walk a fine line,” said Pennsylvania Republican strategist Vince Galko.
“He’ll need to make this race about the Biden-Casey record and not about the Trump rhetoric,” he said, “which is easier said than done.”

K1STNC4LOX_U881EN9KYE1Z9U6,Trump comes out against draft RNC resolution from supporter declaring him presumptive nominee,"By Daniel Strauss, Kristen Holmes and Kaitlan Collins, CNN","4 minute read Updated 8:57 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/25/politics/rnc-trump-presumptive-nominee-resolution/,"A Republican National Committee draft resolution that would have formally declared Donald Trump the Republican Party’s 2024 presumptive nominee was withdrawn Thursday amid pushback from the former president.
David Bossie, the RNC committeeman from Maryland who recently endorsed Trump and introduced the resolution, withdrew it, according to two sources familiar with the matter.
The Trump campaign had initially approved going forward with the resolution and the former president himself was also on board until a backlash began, a source familiar told CNN.
Trump said on his social media platform Thursday that the RNC should not move forward with the resolution, saying he appreciated the effort but was opposing it “for the sake of Party unity” and wanted to “finish the process off AT THE BALLOT BOX.”
His statement came amid concerns from Trump allies that the resolution could anger Republicans because of the perception that Trump was trying to stack the deck against former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, a source close to the former president said.
While the former president would have still needed to reach the delegate requirements necessary to win the nomination, if the resolution had been approved and the RNC had shifted to a general election mode, he would have access to the RNC’s data operation, benefit from fundraising with the RNC, and have the support of all of the committee’s ground operations. It would also have meant the committee would have been supporting Trump and effectively opposing Haley – an unprecedented break from the party’s past approach to the nominating process.

The resolution, which was being reviewed by the RNC earlier Thursday, was first reported by The Dispatch on Thursday. A draft copy of the resolution was obtained independently by CNN.
“RESOLVED that the Republican National Committee hereby declares President Trump as our presumptive 2024 nominee for the office of President of the United States and from this moment forward moves into full general election mode welcoming supporters of all candidates as valued members of Team Trump 2024,” the resolution reads.
An RNC spokesperson said in a statement earlier Thursday that this resolution was still just a resolution and not the stance of the committee.
“Resolutions, such as this one, are brought forward by members of the RNC. Chairwoman McDaniel doesn’t offer resolutions,” communications director Keith Schipper said in the statement. “This will be taken up by the Resolutions Committee and they will decide whether to send this resolution to be voted on by the 168 RNC members at our annual meeting next week.”
The Haley campaign brushed off the resolution and said GOP Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel should organize a debate ahead of the South Carolina primary at the end of February.
“Who cares what the RNC says? We’ll let millions of Republican voters across the country decide who should be our party’s nominee, not a bunch of Washington insiders,” Haley spokeswoman Olivia Perez-Cubas said in a statement. “If Ronna McDaniel wants to be helpful she can organize a debate in South Carolina, unless she’s also worried that Trump can’t handle being on the stage for 90 minutes with Nikki Haley.”
But her campaign was soon fundraising off of the draft resolution. “The RNC is leveraging the establishment to try and crown Trump the presumptive nominee,” Haley wrote in a fundraising email. “Well I have news for them: I’m in this to win it and I’m not going anywhere.”
The resolution comes just a few days after Trump defeated Haley in New Hampshire by more than 30,000 votes, following his decisive win in the Iowa caucuses. Those victories have led many prominent figures in the Republican Party to coalesce around Trump and call on Haley to exit the race. Earlier this week, McDaniel told Fox News, “We need to unite around our eventual nominee, which is Donald Trump.”
Current RNC rules require Trump to secure 1,215 delegates to officially become the party’s nominee. As of Thursday, CNN estimates Trump has 32 delegates while Haley has 17.
Some RNC members were discussing the resolution during a conference call Wednesday night, according to a Republican with knowledge of that call.

K2G29X57FA_RJVBXSVEQZEN4RF,Opinion: We Brits don’t need tea-brewing advice from Americans,Opinion by Rosa Prince,"3 minute read Published 6:54 AM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/26/opinions/tea-salt-us-uk-prince/,"Editor’s Note: Rosa Prince, a journalist, is London Playbook editor for POLITICO. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion at CNN.
It was always going to be a sensitive subject.
Almost exactly 250 years after the Sons of Liberty dumped chests of tea into Boston Harbour, a professor from Bryn Mawr College has committed a crime against the British cuppa very nearly as grave. With scant regard to diplomatic relations, chemist Michelle Francl advised in her new book “Steeped: The Chemistry of Tea” that to create the perfect brew, a grain of salt should be added to the mix.
The response was swifter than a military scramble to a nuclear code red.
“Tea is the elixir of camaraderie, the bond that unites our nations,” the US Embassy in London stated in an official communique rushed out on X in a desperate bid to avert an international incident. “We cannot stand idly by as such an outrageous proposal threatens the very foundation of our Special Relationship.”
Battle stations might have been stood down … had the release not gone on: “The US Embassy will continue to make tea in the proper way – by microwave.”
Well. Far from calming tensions, the words doubled down on the original offense, triggering flashbacks in the soul of every Brit who ever strayed west of Iceland.
It’s downtown LA; Midtown Manhattan; Rust Bucket Indiana. In our innocence we’ve gone and ordered a cup of Rosie Lee. It arrives: a chilly bag floating atop a cup of bathwater. What purports to be a nice cuppa accompanied not by good honest cow’s milk but some kind of yellow citrus thing.
Worse is when the tea itself is some unconscionable fruit or “’erbal” flavor. Or, god forbid, arrives not in a good honest tea bag, but taking the false form of — shudder — tea leaves.
One of the highlights of my 10 years living in New York City was the day the local grocery store opened a “British section,” with Ribena, Bourbon biscuits and, most satisfying of all for a homesick limey, Tetley tea bags.
I once visited a tea factory in Sri Lanka where a lovely worker gave a whole spiel about how the finest teas came from the tips of the leaves, and that people who drank the stuff made from bags were basically consuming the sweepings from the floor.
Being British, I was too polite to point out that sweepings from the floor are what we like to drink, were raised to drink, celebrate drinking in daily, some cases hourly rituals. My mother’s best friend would give her children sweet milky tea in their bottles as soon as they were off the breast, a custom considered a little precocious, perhaps, but certainly not eccentric.

I took up the tea habit when I was about 12 or 13, and like most of my countrymen and women have had a cuppa four or five times a day ever since. It’s less edgy than coffee, cheaper than gin and generally a soothing, unifying kind of thing, particularly when shared with others. You’re offered a cuppa char if you’ve given birth, witnessed a murder, come home from a crappy day at work.
And there are definite wrongs and rights about how to brew up. Too weak, and you’ll be accused of serving “gnat’s piss”; leave the bag in too long and it’s “stew.” You’re generally considered a good egg if you prefer “builder’s,” named for the construction workers who endearingly prefer that customers provide a steady stream of cups of strong tea with only a splash of milk to the generous cash tips their American cousins favour.
As to the question of whether or not to add sugar; to my mind it seems a little immature over the age of puberty but who am I to judge?
However, salt? Salt? Whether in the seas of Boston Harbour or some mad prof’s lab in rural Pennsylvania, tea and salt do not mix and that, my Yank friends, is that."
K65ZT01SP6_SE2U7DCUCA2JG15,Senate GOP offers cautious embrace of Trump amid fears over his electability,"By Manu Raju and Melanie Zanona, CNN","6 minute read Updated 5:32 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/24/politics/senate-gop-trump-new-hampshire-reaction/,"Sen. John Cornyn has long been skeptical about Donald Trump’s 2024 chances, telling reporters last June that the former president’s “basic problem” is that he “hasn’t yet figured out how to expand his appeal beyond his base” – something he said is a recipe for a general election loss.
On Tuesday night, the Texas Republican endorsed Trump and called for GOP unity after the New Hampshire primary. But on Wednesday morning, Cornyn’s concern about Trump’s electability remained unchanged.
“After a primary there needs to be a broader appeal than just to primary voters,” Cornyn told CNN. “You can’t win with just your own base.”
As Republicans steadily fall in line behind Trump as their party’s likely standard bearer, there are deep-seated reservations about his polarizing candidacy – particularly within the Senate GOP. Many still have fresh memories of the 2021 Capitol attack and had hoped he wouldn’t return to the national scene. Others blame him for their 2022 failure to take back the majority in the midterms and had stayed quiet as the 2024 presidential primary unfolded.
Yet now Trump is on a glide path to the nomination and remains the most dominant force in GOP politics – something they’re trying to reconcile as they fear that his penchant for controversy and four criminal indictments will sink their chances at keeping the House and taking back the Senate.
“For him to win the general election, he’s got to start running a general election campaign, which will mean his message is going to have to appeal to those independent voters and moderate Republicans,” said Senate GOP Whip John Thune, the No. 2 Republican who has yet to endorse Trump but said he would back the eventual nominee.
CNN’s exit poll of New Hampshire’s GOP primary underscores much of that concern. While Trump dominated with GOP voters, winning about three-quarters of them, he struggled with independents and more moderate Granite Staters who voted in the primary – with 64% of undeclared voters backing former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, compared to just 35% for Trump. Nearly 9 in 10 Haley voters in the state said they would not be satisfied if Trump were the nominee.

Trump’s performance with that swing voting bloc was a far cry from 2016 when he first burst into presidential politics — something not lost on many in his party.
Republicans now fear that Trump would put off those types of independent voters who will be essential to winning battleground House and Senate seats – and that could cost them control of Congress.
“Yes,” one swing-district House Republican said, when asked if he believes Trump will cost their party the House.
“Twenty percent of GOP voters will not vote for him,” the Republican member said. “Independent voters think Biden is weak, but they hate Trump. And Dems — he motivates them to vote.”
The concerns come as numerous Republican holdouts have jumped on board with Trump’s candidacy following his back-to-back victories in Iowa and New Hampshire, with more expected to soon follow suit. On Tuesday night, Trump picked up endorsements from GOP Sen. Deb Fischer of Nebraska and Rep. Brandon Williams of New York, who represents a swing district carried by President Joe Biden.
Despite Trump’s lackluster showing with more moderate voters, a number of Republicans believe that will change in the general election – especially given Biden’s poor approval ratings and dissatisfaction with his presidency.
“If you look at the battleground states, people would have to be incompetent not to go after and try and go after the right of center, in our state unaffiliated voters, that’s obviously where you would go for it. And that’s exactly what Trump’s going to do,” Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, told CNN. “The races are not won by the parties. They’re won in the middle and I think both campaigns are going to target that.”
Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a staunch Trump supporter, added: “I think when you look at the structural problems of President Biden with the electorate versus that of Trump, I think Trump has a better hand. But there’s a long way to go.”
Sen. Mike Rounds, a South Dakota Republican who has yet to endorse Trump, said that “other candidates have shown in polls that they would have had a higher percentage of support than the former president.  It doesn’t mean that he can’t win in the next election.”
And Fischer, who endorsed Trump on Tuesday night, said: “I think people will pay attention to President Trump and the policies he’s going to offer, and they’re going to support him for those polices.”
Asked if he should moderate, the Nebraska Republican said: “President Trump needs to be who he is.”
Yet there are some key Republicans who are keenly aware of who Trump is. That includes Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell, whose relationship with Trump soured after he blamed the former president for being responsible for the January 6, 2021, attack.
Asked Tuesday if he will need to endorse Trump if he continues to do well in primaries, McConnell once again refused to take a stand.
“I don’t have any announcement to make on the presidential election,” McConnell said. “In fact, you all may recall, I’ve stayed essentially out of it. And when I change my mind about that, I’ll let you know.”
Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who was one of the seven Senate Republicans who voted to convict Trump in his impeachment trial on a charge of inciting the January 6 insurrection, went even further, saying she doesn’t see herself endorsing Trump – even if he becomes the eventual Republican nominee.
“I do not at this point, no,” Collins said Wednesday when asked if she’d eventually offer her endorsement.
Collins also said she supports Haley staying in the race, a position that puts her at odds with Trump allies.
“I’m glad to hear last night that Nikki Haley is determined to stay in. And I think the more people see her for her, particularly since she appears to be the only alternative to Donald Trump right now, the more impressed that they will be,” Collins said.
Yet Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio, a top Trump ally, said that Haley’s continued candidacy will only hurt Trump’s chances – and the party at large.
“What’s going to happen here is that we’re going to spend another 30, 50, maybe 100 million dollars attacking Donald Trump, who will be our nominee, weakening him in the process,” Vance told CNN. “I think it’s a huge mistake, and it will siphon money away from needed things on a failing presidential campaign.”
But even those who have been most resistant to Trump are coming to grips with the fact that the movement inside the GOP to stop the former president might be over.
“I think my wing has been wounded for a long time, and I don’t know that it’s going to be coming back anytime soon,” said retiring Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, who voted to convict Trump in both of his impeachment trials.
Many senators are still grappling with Trump’s resurgence within the party after he left Washington in disgrace in 2021. Asked to explain Trump’s comeback within the GOP, multiple Republicans pointed to the weakness of Biden and the belief among the GOP base that he is a needed force to “disrupt” Washington.
“You think the grass is greener on the other side, and all of the sudden you get over there, you realize that pasture isn’t better, you want to go back to the pasture you were in,” said Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma.
For Cornyn, he said that he “underestimated the anger voters have in both parties” towards Washington.
“And I think President Trump, in many people’s minds, is the answer to that status quo,” he said.

K8SKNVYFMI_YJ1NVVNC4BL9YEE,Why both South Africa and Israel are welcoming the UN court’s ruling in a landmark genocide case,"Analysis by Nadeen Ebrahim and Abbas Al Lawati, CNN","4 minute read Updated 10:13 AM EST, Sat January 27, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/26/middleeast/israel-genocide-case-icj-ruling-analysis-mime-intl/,"Editor’s Note: A version of this story appears in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here.
A historic ruling by the United Nations’ top court in a genocide case against Israel on Friday was welcomed by the three main parties it involved: Israel, South Africa and the Palestinians. But at the same time, no one got what they asked for.
The International Court of Justice in The Hague, the Netherlands, ordered Israel to “take all measures” to prevent genocide in Gaza after South Africa accused Israel of violating international laws on genocide in its war in the territory.
It rejected Israel’s request for the case to be thrown out, but it also stopped short of ordering Israel to halt the war as South Africa has asked.
“I would have wanted a ceasefire,” said South African foreign minister Naledi Pandor after the ruling in The Hague. She said that she was still satisfied with the outcome.
Israel went to war with Hamas in Gaza after the Palestinian militant group launched a brutal attack on the country on October 7, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 people hostage.
The war has resulted in the death of more than 26,000 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, and left much of the enclave in ruins. Israel has pledged not to stop its campaign until all the remaining hostages are released and Hamas is destroyed.

The case at the ICJ marks  the first time Israel has been brought before the court on accusations of violating the 1948 UN Genocide Convention, which was drafted in part due to the mass killings of Jewish people in the Holocaust during the Second World War.
Still, many Israelis hailed the ruling on Friday as a win for the Jewish state. Eylon Levi, an Israeli government spokesperson, said the court “dismissed (South Africa’s) ridiculous demand to tell Israel to stop defending its people and fighting for the hostages.” Avi Mayer, the former editor in chief of the Jerusalem Post called it “a devastating blow to those accusing the Jewish state of ‘genocide’.”
“The most dramatic thing is that no ceasefire was ordered,” Shelly Aviv Yeini, head of the international law department at the Hostages and Missing Persons Families Forum, told CNN, adding that a potential ceasefire order was Israel’s biggest fear, especially as it would have come as over a hundred hostages remain in Gaza.
The discourse in Israel has so far focused on only ending the war once the hostages are freed, she said, adding that Israel would have “struggled to live” with a ceasefire order that doesn’t guarantee the return of the captives.
“So, I think this is quite (an) expected outcome, and something that Israel will be able to comply with,” she said, adding that the court’s order for Israel to deliver humanitarian aid and report back to the ICJ on its actions is “doable.”
Despite the outcome being perceived by some as being in Israel’s favor, experts warned of the reputational damage faced by the Jewish state.
“I would not call it a win, but I would say it could have been worse,” Robbie Sabel, professor of international law at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, told CNN. “The fact that in public eyes there’ll be an association that Israel’s acts could have led to genocide, clearly this is harmful public relations.”
Friday’s measure was an interim measure by the ICJ as the court considers a full ruling on whether Israel is guilty of violating the Genocide Convention. That ruling could take years.
Sabel said that while he is “absolutely convinced” that the ICJ will eventually find Israel not guilty of genocide, he worries that by that time “the public may have forgotten that.”
“If they had asked us to stop defending ourselves, we would have had a problem, and at least we don’t have that problem,” he said.
Yeini said it was nonetheless a “a very dark day” in Israel’s history.
For some Palestinians, however, the court’s ruling didn’t go far enough.
Mohammed el-Kurd, a Palestinian activist from Jerusalem, said the ICJ failed on South Africa’s “most important request” to suspend the military operations. “Not shocking, but stings nonetheless,” he said on X, formerly Twitter.
“Until the Israeli regime’s genocidal assault on Gaza stops, we should keep protesting and disrupting in every way possible. This is today’s lesson,” he said.

BFMTV reported that the boy had been left to live alone in the family’s apartment in the town of Nersac in the Charente region for two years, from 2020 to 2022, and appeared to survive on cake, canned goods, and stolen tomatoes.
According to BFMTV, the child’s mother lived with her partner in another apartment five kilometers (3.1 miles) away and would only visit the child from “time to time.”
The Mayor of Nersac, Barbara Couturier, as reported by BFMTV, said the child often did not have hot water or heating. Nevertheless, he continued attending school during this time and was a good student, Couturier also stated.
Couturier said she alerted the local and national police about the situation after the mother asked social services to help buy food.

“I met his mom on May 2022. She came to tell us that she had financial problems, and we gave her four vouchers for food, but she took some processed food products instead so that got me suspicious. Some residents told me that there was a child living alone, so I connected the two things and I called the local police and the national police,” Couturier explained.
Couturier stated that the child had been under the care of social services since September 19, 2022.
This is a developing story."
KBGLL72CC2_GXKCBD0SNJS3YW7,Opinion: It’s frightening to imagine what Donald Trump could do with the CIA in a second term,Opinion by Douglas London,"7 minute read Published 4:34 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/24/opinions/donald-trump-second-term-cia-london/,"Editor’s Note: Douglas London is the author of “The Recruiter: Spying and the Lost Art of American Intelligence.” He teaches at Georgetown University’s School of Foreign Service and is a nonresident scholar at the Middle East Institute. London served in the CIA’s clandestine service as a Russian-speaking senior operations officer for more than 30 years, mostly in the Middle East, South and Central Asia and Africa, including three assignments as a chief of station and as the CIA’s counterterrorism chief for South and Southwest Asia. The views expressed here are his own. He tweets @douglaslondon5. Read more opinion at CNN.
Could a reelected former President Donald J. Trump use the CIA’s unique authorities, capabilities and insulation from public scrutiny to take action against his political enemies?
The answer was “yes” well before Trump’s lawyer argued that he would be immune from prosecution for directing SEAL Team 6 to assassinate a political rival — unless first impeached and convicted by Congress. In fact, it would be even easier for Trump to turn the CIA into his own Praetorian Guard.
Last March, the former president told supporters at a political rally, “I am your warrior. I am your justice. And for those who have been wronged and betrayed: I am your retribution.” What could be better than a powerful and elite secret organization insulated from public scrutiny, whose rules he can rewrite with near impunity to defile the Constitution?
The CIA’s operating guidelines have been primarily set by executive orders which can be changed with the stroke of a pen — and for good reason. As the nation’s first line of defense and collector of last resort, its size and flexibility facilitates innovation and the authority to quickly realign resources.
This structure enabled the CIA to deploy personnel to Afghanistan well ahead of the military after 9/11 and to respond to the 2014 threat posed by the Islamic State. Albeit with less public notoriety, the CIA has been at the forefront of US national efforts to support Ukraine and deter China’s possible invasion of Taiwan.
While the CIA is subject to oversight, neither the Senate nor House can approve or disapprove their activities and at most, can deny funding. Moreover, the president’s communications with the CIA are classified and protected by executive privilege. Although appropriately cleared members of Congress are apprised of presidential findings through a Memorandum of Notification, they are not at liberty to publicly debate or countermand such sensitive covert action programs.
There’s also little likelihood Trump’s fellow GOP leaders would push back. Despite the indictments Trump faces for inciting violence on January 6, mishandling classified documents and fraud, his 2024 candidacy has been endorsed by 19 Republican senators as well as the House leadership and 7 governors. (Trump denies wrongdoing.)
Frankly, no foreign threat I ever encountered across four decades as a CIA operations officer frightened me as much as GOP Representative Elise Stefanik, the fourth-ranking member of the House leadership, parroting Trump’s reference to those being prosecuted for beating police officers with fire hydrants and American flags on January 6th — after dragging them down the Capitol steps — as “hostages.”
The CIA offers a wide array of collection, investigative, surveillance, technical and kinetic capabilities that mirror those of the country’s larger defense, diplomatic, security and law enforcement agencies but with flatter management and without the public footprint. And therein lies the temptation for abuse.
Related article Opinion: What’s really working for Trump
As illustrated by the 1970’s Church Committee hearings and by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Study of the CIA’s Detention and Interrogation Program, the agency’s capabilities have too often been used to serve a president’s political interests, rather than the nation’s security.
It was not until President Ronald Reagan issued Executive Order 12333 (E.O 12333) in 1981 that a framework was established for the country’s national intelligence efforts to safeguard Americans’ privacy and civil liberties. President George W. Bush revised and reissued the order in 2008 to better align it to the 2004 Intelligence Reform and Terrorist Prevention Act that established the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI).
The agency’s capabilities have too often been used to serve a president’s political interests, rather than the nation’s security.

The revisions expanded privacy rights and the definition of a “United States person,” but more significantly transferred the Director of Central Intelligence’s authorities for setting policy and lanes across the US Intelligence Community to the DNI.
E.O. 12333 prohibits the CIA from spying on US persons or even soliciting one’s voluntary cooperation without making its true affiliation and intentions clearly known. That includes both at home and abroad, and covers everything from hacking, bugging, break-ins and shadowing, to use the colloquial terms, or collecting and storing personal information on Americans without higher-level and Justice Department approvals.
Unlike the FBI, CIA officers cannot operate undercover to penetrate domestic organizations, not even those which carry out or advocate violence. And American journalists, clergy, and US Peace Corps personnel are among the prohibited categories from which the CIA can’t recruit, even abroad. Likewise, the agency can’t use such occupations as operational cover given the risk to those in these professions who might be suspected of being CIA.
While the CIA is prohibited from conducting assassinations, American or foreign, the US Justice Department approved America’s targeted killing of al Qaeda terrorist and American citizen Anwar al-Awlaki in 2011 without the benefit of legal due process.
Related article Opinion: Listen to what Trump’s own officials have to say about him
In fact, the White House, under Democratic President Barack Obama, acknowledged in 2015 that the US had killed a total of six other Americans, including one accidentally who was being held hostage, Warren Weinstein. Five other American citizens, including the more notorious Adam Gadahn and Ahmed Farouq, who were both killed in Pakistan while serving in senior al Qaeda positions, were struck incidentally without the benefit of the same Justice Department process afforded al-Awlaki.
Beyond E.O. 12333, there are still more restrictions and guidelines memorialized in internal DNI and DCIA policies and authorities which set the legal requirements, ethical standards and its tradecraft. These policies address everything from interrogation, the use of force, dealing with agents and foreign partners suspected of human rights abuses to information sharing that enables lethal consequences and the duty to warn of potential targets of violence.
As an example, reforms addressing the CIA’s use of “black sites,” renditions and enhanced interrogation were aligned to Executive Order 13491, issued on January 22, 2009, by Obama, requiring compliance with US domestic law, and its international agreements, in its treatment of captives. And the Biden White House walked back Trump-era policies which reportedly liberalized and delegated targeted killing and capture operations outside of conflict zones in its own revised Presidential Policy Memorandum. But all of this is subject to change should the President, the DNI or the DCIA choose — Congressional authorization is not required.
Still, weaponizing the CIA requires enablers who might come from among Trump’s sycophantic followers like former DNI John Ratcliffe, former acting DNI Richard Grenell or former Chief of Staff to the then-Acting Secretary of Defense Kash Patel. It was Patel, more recently, who told former Trump adviser Steven Bannon during a podcast that “We will go out and find the conspirators, not just in government but in the media.”
Related article Opinion: In victory, Trump loses it
Toward the end of his administration, Trump directed that Patel be installed as the CIA’s or the FBI’s deputy director until CIA Director Gina Haspel threatened to resign. Her resistance thwarted what the CIA workforce expected to be the former president’s plan to have Patel replace Haspel as acting director in order to execute a “deep state” loyalty purge.
Such a goal would be facilitated by Trump’s plans, should he win another term, to reintroduce an executive order known as Schedule F which would empower him to reclassify some 50,000 or more civil service positions as political appointees whom he can fire and replace at will.
None of this even begins to consider how Trump could use a new term to transform the CIA into a rubber-stamp echo chamber. Trump’s resentment of agencies like the CIA is well known: The former president’s lawyers filed a 68-page discovery motion reflecting plans to defend Trump against charges accusing him of illegally holding onto classified documents after he left office by painting the intelligence community as biased against him.

Besides previously embracing Russian President Vladimir Putin’s word over his intelligence community’s, Trump publicly chided its 2019 Worldwide Threat Assessment, observing that the agencies should “go back to school.”
And how might the CIA workforce respond? The reality is that officers are required to obey lawful orders. Some might follow their conscience and walk, but how many could afford to? Moreover, Trump is not without his supporters at CIA, particularly among the older, White, male circle of senior officers who may feel threatened by the agency’s generational changes and greater focus on diversity, inclusion, and equity.
Still, handcuffing the CIA by turning relevant executive orders into law might not be politically feasible nor would it be in the nation’s best interests. But the real prospects for a president’s abuse of the agency’s unique authorities and capabilities merit an a la carte review of those most applicable to domestic issues, privacy and civil liberties and of how to install further guard rails."
KDMUP0RH7Y_1X6TDYEG9CTSV7S,Pakistan accuses India of extrajudicial killings on its territory,"By Sophia Saifi, Sania Farooqui, Michael Rios and Rhea Mogul, CNN","2 minute read Published 10:08 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/26/asia/pakistan-accuses-india-extrajudicial-killing-intl-hnk/,"A top Pakistan official on Thursday accused India of killing two Pakistani nationals on its soil, citing what he called “a pattern” of alleged Indian assassination plots overseas and raising tensions between the two nuclear-armed rivals.
In a news conference, Pakistani Foreign Secretary Muhammad Syrus Sajjad Qazi claimed Islamabad has “credible evidence” linking Indian agents to the killing of Muhammad Riaz in Pakistan-administered Kashmir on September 8 last year and of Shahid Latif in the city of Sialkot, near Kashmir, a month later.
“These were killings-for-hire cases involving a sophisticated international setup spread over multiple jurisdictions,” Qazi said.
He accused two Indian agents of recruiting assassins to kill the men – both slain in the vicinity of mosques – but did not provide further information about the victims or suggest why New Delhi might have targeted them.
India has long accused Pakistan of harboring terrorists, particularly in the disputed and heavily militarized region of Kashmir, which both countries claim in its entirety. A de facto border called the Line of Control divides it between New Delhi and Islamabad. The dispute has led to three wars between the two nations.
Qazi on Thursday compared the alleged killings in Pakistan to other purported recent Indian assassination plots in North America.
“They fit the pattern of similar cases which have come to light in other countries including Canada and the United States,” Qazi said. “Clearly the Indian network of extrajudicial and extraterritorial killings has become a global phenomenon.”
India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) rejected Qazi’s allegations, calling them “Pakistan’s latest attempt at peddling false and malicious anti-India propaganda.”
“As the world knows, Pakistan has long been the epicenter of terrorism, organized crime, and illegal transnational activities. India and many other countries have publicly warned Pakistan cautioning that it would be consumed by its own culture of terror and violence,” MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.
“Pakistan will reap what it sows.”
Last November, the US accused an Indian government official of being involved in a conspiracy to kill an American citizen on its home soil.
The revelation came a little over a month after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau publicly alleged that India may have been involved in the murder of a Canadian national on its territory, prompting a furious response from New Delhi and a diplomatic fallout between the two countries.
The Indian government has denied involvement in the American and Canadian cases and has set up a high-level committee to investigate the accusations in the US."

Nearby, toddlers make toys out of garbage, pressing their bare feet into the wet sand.
Torrential rain in Gaza is making an already brutal existence even harder for the tens of thousands of people displaced and camping in the open air.
CNN video from Deir Al-Balah in central Gaza, shows dozens of people searching for their belongings after torrential rain washed away mattresses, food and clothes overnight Wednesday.
“Today, our tents were drowned,” Jamal Ramadan told CNN. “All the nylon flew away. We slept under the rain. Everyone drowned. The children were in the water. Our food and drinks are all gone.”
Israel’s bombardment and besiegement of Gaza has obliterated huge parts of the strip, crushed the medical system and triggered a humanitarian crisis marked by food, fuel and water shortages. More than 2.2 million Palestinians face widespread hunger, dehydration and deadly disease.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) launched its offensive aiming to eliminate Hamas, after more than 1,200 people were killed and another 250 abducted in the militant group’s October 7 attacks on southern Israel.
At least 1.7 million people in Gaza have since been internally displaced, many multiple times, according to the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
Israeli attacks on Gaza since October 7 have killed at least 25,700 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health. CNN cannot independently verify the figures due to the difficulty of reporting from the war zone.

In the past week, the IDF has pressed its campaign further into central and southern Gaza, forcing hundreds and thousands of people into tiny patches of territory without basic sanitation or drinkable water.
With winter winds and heavy rainfall lashing the Palestinian enclave, parents in Deir Al-Balah told CNN they cannot sleep because they are trying to comfort their children.
“We were all asleep, and at midnight, we woke up when all those tents were drowned in water. We started carrying our children,” said Ahmad Al Rebai.
Another civilian, Um Muhammad, said she and others no longer have clothes for their children. “We pulled our children from the water. No one cares about us.”
Gaza sits in the Mediterranean Basin, which is highly vulnerable to climate change. While the region is experiencing less rainfall annually — making it susceptible to drought — some parts are also seeing more frequent and intense extreme rain events that are expected to worsen the more the Earth warms, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
January is traditionally the rainiest month in southern Israel and Gaza, generally seeing around 100 mm of rainfall on average. Totals this week could approach these monthly averages in some locations. A temperature drop of 5-8 degrees Celsius will be felt over the next few days as the weather system moves through the region, which will make for unseasonably cold conditions, according to the Israel Meteorological Service.
“All we say is enough with all this. We want to go back to our homes in Gaza. We are tired of this life,” one man said. “It has been three and a half months. Enough with this life. It’s better that we die than live like this.”
Humanitarian workers in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, meanwhile described mass bombardment, heavy tank fire and air raid alerts in recent days, as Israel intensified its military campaign in the city.
Raging flames engulfed the walls of a UN shelter west of Khan Younis, after the facility was shelled on Wednesday. At least 12 people were killed and another 75 injured, according to Thomas White, director of the UN’s relief agency for Palestine refugees (UNRWA).
Part of the UNRWA training center, hosting thousands of people, was hit by two shells and caught fire, added White.
UN staff managed to reach the location on Wednesday evening, after being denied access multiple times, the director said. “Persistent attacks on civilian sites in Khan Younis are utterly unacceptable and must stop immediately.”
The IDF said in a statement that it “currently” ruled out an aerial or artillery strike carried out by Israeli forces hit the UN facility. A “thorough review of the operations of the forces in the vicinity is underway,” according to the IDF, adding it is “examining the possibility that the strike was a result of Hamas fire.”
Further north, Gaza’s Civil Defense said on Thursday they dealt with “unbelievable” injuries, including loss of limbs, after an attack on civilians waiting for aid in Gaza City.
Crews were trying to reach the injured, but are being “blocked” by Israeli forces, Gaza Civil Defense Mahmoud Basal spokesperson said from the local Al Shifa Hospital, adding that there are areas they have not been able to get to.
Civilians were “targeted” by Israeli forces at the Kuwaiti roundabout in Gaza City, where they were gathered to pick up bags of flour, according to Basal.
Mohammed Al-Rifi, who sustained injuries in his arm and leg after the shelling incident by the Kuwaiti roundabout, said he and others there were “shelled four times.”
CNN asked the IDF earlier Thursday for comment on any military operations in the vicinity of the roundabout.
Earlier in the week, hospital workers reported dire conditions inside facilities including the Nasser Medical Complex, Al Amal Hospital and the Palestine Red Crescent Society headquarters, where displaced staff and patients were trying to shelter.
On Thursday, Al Amal hospital in Khan Younis was targeted for a fourth consecutive day, according to the Palestine Red Crescent Society.
The PRCS also alleged that Israeli forces imposed “a complete curfew around the hospital since yesterday afternoon, restricting the movement of ambulance crews to and from the hospital. Thousands of displaced individuals live in constant fear and anxiety due to the ongoing siege and bombardment.”
The IDF said on Wednesday they were pursuing “military targets, outposts, infrastructure and command and control centers,” in Khan Younis, adding their campaign there will continue for “several days.”
“The manoeuver will continue against military targets that are in the area, outposts, infrastructure, and command and control centers,” the IDF said.
The IDF regularly asserts that it does not target hospitals but that Hamas uses them as cover for its military operations. CNN cannot independently verify operational details reported by the IDF.
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) warned “concrete actions” are needed to preserve “life saving” medical services in war torn Gaza.
The ICRC highlighted the deficiencies in the current healthcare system in Gaza where only two referral hospitals – Nasser Medical Complex and the European Gaza Hospital – providing advanced medical services are operational.
Dr. Ashraf Al-Qidra, the spokesperson for the Hamas-run Ministry of Health in Gaza, described the situation at Nasser Hospital as “extremely catastrophic.”
“The hospital is operating at 10% of its capacity. Operating rooms have run out of anesthesia and painkillers for patients and the wounded,” Al-Qidra said in a statement to CNN.
Fears are also mounting regarding supplies, with Al-Qidra warning that food supplies have run out and there are only enough fuel reserves for five days.
The ICRC added that if the Nasser Medical Complex and the European Gaza Hospital “cease to function,” the “world will bear witness to untold thousands of preventable deaths given the size of the population, the current extreme living conditions, a collapsing health system, and the intensity of the fighting.”

KF9FPJQ080_D3JLOKP26HFNUIC,Colorado voters emphasize January 6 violence as they urge Supreme Court to keep Trump off the ballot,"By Joan Biskupic, Devan Cole and Marshall Cohen, CNN","4 minute read Updated 12:57 PM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/26/politics/colorado-trump-supreme-court-filing/,"The Colorado voters trying to disqualify Donald Trump from the state ballot told the Supreme Court on Friday that the violence the former president provoked on January 6, 2021, qualifies as an insurrection under the terms of the Constitution and bars him from holding future office.
Lawyers for the group of voters filed their brief several days before their deadline of next week, seeking to forcefully respond to Trump’s legal arguments that the President is excluded from the disputed section of the 14th Amendment.

“The most violent attack on our nation’s Capitol since the War of 1812 — an attack which obstructed the peaceful transfer of presidential power for the first time in American history — meets any plausible definition of ‘insurrection against the Constitution,’” the challengers wrote.
Specifically responding to Trump’s leading argument in his brief filed last week, that the president is not an “officer” under the terms of the Constitution, the voters’ lawyers wrote, “Section 3 does not give a free pass to insurrectionist Presidents; they are ‘officers’ because they hold an ‘office.’ And states’ broad authority to regulate presidential elections allows them to exclude constitutionally ineligible candidates from the ballot.”
Section 3 bars certain elected officials, including an “officer of the United States,” from holding “any office” in the future if they have “engaged in insurrection” or aided a rebellion.
In the early pages of their 60-page filing, they also countered Trump lawyers’ warning of the “bedlam” that could follow if the justices were to allow states to block his name from upcoming primary ballots.
“He not-so-subtly threatens ‘bedlam’ if he is not on the ballot,” the lawyers, led by Jason Murray, wrote. “But we already saw the ‘bedlam’ Trump unleashed when he was on the ballot and lost. Section 3 is designed precisely to avoid giving oath-breaking insurrectionists like Trump the power to unleash such mayhem again.”
The challengers also largely reframed the case toward Trump’s “insurrectionist” actions. They showed the justices photos from January 6 and Trump tweets, as they described how Trump “incited a violent mob” that injured more than 140 police officers and forced lawmakers to “flee for their lives.”

He testified in-person at the Colorado disqualification trial about his experience on January 6, including the wounds he suffered during the hours-long battle at the Lower West Terrace of the Capitol.
The voters’ lawyers wrote that the mob “infiltrated the (US Capitol) building through shattered windows” and “erected gallows” outside, while chanting “Hang Mike Pence.” They noted that video of the day was on file at the court.
The challengers said Trump zeroed in on January 6 after his election-related lawsuits failed, “including in this Court.” That reference was to his ill-fated and short-lived Supreme Court case in December 2020 – Texas v. Pennsylvania – which sought to throw out Joe Biden’s legitimate victories in several battleground states.
Oral arguments in the Colorado case are scheduled for February 8.
The Supreme Court agreed earlier this month to hear the case of Trump v. Anderson, accepting the former president’s appeal of the Colorado Supreme Court decision that removed him from that state’s ballot.
Returning repeatedly to Trump’s conduct, the challengers in their brief even compared Trump to a “mob boss” while arguing that his fiery words at the January 6 rally at the Ellipse weren’t protected by the First Amendment.
“The idea that Trump’s words were unlikely to incite imminent lawlessness, even though Trump intended them to do so and even though they in fact did so, fails even the most forgiving of red-face tests,” the challengers wrote. “For obvious reasons, the First Amendment does not protect mob bosses who deliberately incite violence through thinly veiled language they know their audience will understand.”
Trump’s lawyers claim his speech was shielded by longstanding First Amendment precedents because it wasn’t trying to incite imminent violence. The Colorado trial judge disagreed, and her findings were upheld by Colorado’s high court, which concluded that he “intended that his speech would result in the use of violence.”"
KICKKFL0DT_H4GFSPRLZRDIZL2,Even Jenna Ortega can’t save the icky ‘90s throwback ‘Miller’s Girl’,"Review by Brian Lowry, CNN","3 minute read Published 7:00 AM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/25/entertainment/jenna-ortega-millers-girl-review/,"Between “Wednesday” and her previous forays with the “Scream” franchise, Jenna Ortega might be enjoying a pop-culture moment, but even that star power can’t overcome the flaws in “Miller’s Girl,” a sort-of psychological, semi-erotic drama that, despite its literary pretensions, possesses roughly the intellectual heft of a perfume ad. Dated and creepy in all the wrong ways, it’s a movie that might have escaped derision in the 1980s but deserves to get slapped around today.
Indeed, more than anything, this debut feature from writer-director Jade Halley Bartlett feels like a modern version of “The Crush” – one of those icky ‘90s artifacts that really didn’t age well – with a teenage Alicia Silverstone seeking to seduce a much older Cary Elwes and lashing out when he doesn’t fully succumb to her charms.
Here, the filmmakers make a point of noting that the protagonist, Ortega’s Cairo Sweet, has turned 18, but she’s still a high-school student when she develops a strangely intense relationship with her teacher, Jonathan Miller (Martin Freeman), who frequently sees her tromping through the woods from the mansion she occupies while her absentee parents are traveling.
“I’m the scariest thing in there,” she says, when he asks her about walking that path alone.
Alas, Jonathan doesn’t have the good sense to listen to that warning, dazzled as he is by Cairo’s writing talent and engagement, as well as the fact that she read his largely ignored book. At first blush the thrill of that discovery proves understandable, sort of, but it’s clear the teacher is sorely lacking inspiration as he sleepwalks through life, dealing with an alcoholic, work-obsessed wife (“Succession’s” Dagmara Domińczyk) who barely tolerates him.
Set in a remote corner of Tennessee (which explains the Southern accents that drop in and out), the story plays off Cairo’s off-the-charts potential and burning desire to get out, citing Yale as a goal, juxtaposed with Jonathan’s sense of entrapment. That unfolds, alas, against a gender and power dynamic that’s a mixture of fantasies run amok, though it’s frankly hard to tell if the writing is consciously provocative or simply tone-deaf.
Everyone in the cast deserves better, but for Ortega, the role provides one of those overt signals she’s no longer the girl people watched on the Disney Channel, a message that seems particularly unnecessary given her abundant media exposure. Nor does it help that the film saddles her with a running narration designed to sound literary in style (while namechecking authors like Henry Miller) that just feels like an especially pretentious episode of “Gossip Girl.”
While the age gap has served as the focus of advance coverage, the most uncomfortable aspect of “Miller’s Girl” involves portraying Cairo and her friend Winnie (Gideon Adlon) as the vaguely predatory pursuers of their much-older teachers. The latter brazenly flirts with Jonathan’s best pal (“Top Gun: Maverick’s” Bashir Salahuddin), who, by not backing away immediately, appears to be playing with fire as well, just on a slightly lower setting.
The film is produced by, among others, Seth Rogen, so there were some adults in the room enabling its questionable decisions. “No excuses to be made for your choices,” Cairo muses in voiceover near the end. At least she, and the filmmakers, got that part right.
“Miller’s Girl” premieres January 26 in US theaters. It’s rated R."
KKNGJ90AKC_7T31DV7QBAYLQB6,Australia sanctions Russian national accused of hacking in Medibank data leak,"By Jessie Yeung and Hilary Whiteman, CNN","3 minute read Updated 2:58 AM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/23/tech/medibank-attack-australia-sanction-revil-intl-hnk/,"Australia has publicly named and imposed cyber sanctions on a Russian national for his alleged role in a 2022 ransomware attack, in the country’s first use of the penalty.
The attack stole sensitive personal data from 9.7 million customers of Medibank, one of Australia’s largest private health insurers: including names, dates of births, medical information and Medicare numbers. Some of these records were published on the dark web, according to Australian authorities.
At the time, the Australian Federal Police said investigators knew the identity of the attackers but declined to name them. On Tuesday, the Australian government revealed the name of the individual sanctioned — Russian national Aleksandr Ermakov, 33, an alleged member of the Russian ransomware gang REvil.
The sanctions make it a criminal offense to provide assets to Ermakov, or to use or deal with his assets, including through cryptocurrency wallets or ransomware payments, according to a government news release.
The offense is punishable by up to 10 years’ imprisonment. The government has also imposed a travel ban on Ermakov.
Australian authorities have “worked tirelessly over the past 18 months to unmask those responsible for the cyberattack on Medibank Private,” Richard Marles, deputy prime minister and defense minister, said in the release.
Related article Australia blames cyber criminals in Russia for Medibank data breach
The investigation included collaboration between federal intelligence agency Australian Signals Directorate, the Australian Federal Police, the FBI and National Security Agency (NSA) in the United States, and the United Kingdom’s cyber agency GCHQ — as well as with companies including Microsoft (MSFT) and Medibank, Marles said at a news conference Tuesday.
Cybersecurity experts said at the time of the data breach that it was likely linked to REvil, which had previously launched large attacks on targets in the United States and elsewhere. One such attack on international meat supplier JBS Foods in 2021 shut down the company’s entire US beef processing operation and prompted the company to pay an $11 million ransom.
At the request of the US, Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) intelligence agency detained multiple people associated with REvil in January 2022, seized millions of dollars and raided the homes of 14 people.
When the Medibank attack took place later that year, experts said it could have been perpetrated by a REvil member — which Australian authorities confirmed on Tuesday.
“REvil is only one of many Russian cyber-criminal syndicates, and those gangs we know are dynamic and have multiple partners. So a disruption of REvil at one point in time doesn’t cease its business,” Abigail Bradshaw, head of the Australian Cyber Security Center, said at the news conference.
However, she said, “cyber criminals trade in anonymity” — so publicly naming Ermakov “will most certainly do harm” to his activities, on top of the financial blow of the sanction.
Marles added that with this announcement, “his identity now being completely plain is on display for every agency around the world, but also anybody who is seeking to operate with him, so this will have a very significant impact on Aleksandr Ermakov.”
Investigations into other individuals linked to the attack are ongoing, Marles said.
The stolen data belonged to not only Australian customers but 1.8 million international customers. An initial ransom demand was made for $10 million (15 million Australian dollars). It was later lowered to $9.7 million, which Medibank refused to pay.
Australian authorities have repeatedly urged businesses and individuals not to pay ransoms to cyber criminals, arguing that paying does not guarantee the recovery of data or prevent further attacks — and makes the country a bigger target."
KLE7WBJA3B_95WRX6WDL6Q1U3Q,The man who captured images of a long-forgotten Ghana,"By Zoe Whitfield, CNN","4 minute read Published 1:02 AM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/23/style/jk-bruce-vanderpuije-archive/,"While visiting London to see the work of her grandfather, the late Ghanaian photographer J.K. Bruce-Vanderpuije, at the 2023 contemporary African art fair “1-54,” Kate Tamakloe was surprised to discover another of his images, uncredited, in the collection at the British capital’s Victoria and Albert Museum.
“I asked how they got the photo and was told it was in the library,” she recalled in an interview with CNN. “We have the original (in our archives), but somehow a copy got taken to the UK, and along the line, its history got lost.”
One of West Africa’s foremost documentarians of the 20th century, Bruce-Vanderpuije created a prolific record of life in pre- and post-independence Ghana, illustrating the country’s changing fashions and cultural practices with portraits of young couples getting married, newborn babies and everyday life for over 70 years. He also encountered a number of important community leaders and political figures throughout his career, among them Kwame Nkrumah, the first president of Ghana following its independence from Britain in March 1957.
For more than a decade — since Tamakloe began managing the Deo Gratias Photo Studio, which her grandfather set up in the Jamestown area of Accra, Ghana in 1922 — she has overseen an archive of some 50,000 images. Championing them and rectifying oversights in international collections has become a vital part of her job.
Spellbinding photos capture the ‘mermaid’ divers of South Korea
In collaboration with Efie Gallery in Dubai, the Ethiopian photographer Aïda Muluneh has curated a new exhibition titled “Unveiling the Shadows of the Past: J.K. Bruce-Vanderpuije — The Hidden Icon of Photography in Africa” that highlights images from the 1920s and 1930s, when Ghana was still a British colony (then called the Gold Coast).
“When I look at Bruce-Vanderpuije’s work, I think about the responsibility we bear (for) preserving the changing faces of the continent,” Muluneh told CNN.
“His dedication to the field and the amassed body of work is a diary of a country and its people,” she added, alluding to the significant events Bruce-Vanderpuije captured, including the moment three ex-servicemen protesting unpaid war allowances were fatally shot. The incident sparked the 1948 Accra riots and would inform constitutional changes that shaped the country’s eventual independence.
“Photographers of that generation were not capturing images for recognition or with the aim of being showcased in an exhibition,” explained Muluneh. “It was a necessity to preserve a moment in history.”
Born in March 1899, James Kobla (J.K) Bruce-Vanderpuije studied at the Accra Royal School and enjoyed photography as a hobby in his teens. Later, he trained with J.A.C Holm (another Ghana-based photographer) for three years before establishing his own studio aged just 23.
Despite growing up privy to the studio and her grandfather’s practice, Tamakloe’s involvement was almost happenstance; after an accident caused her to move her cybercafé business to the studio, she began supporting her father — Isaac Hudson Bruce-Vanderpuije, also a photographer and an earlier custodian of the studio — when his eyesight started to deteriorate.
“Once, a photographer from South Africa visited and said, ‘You guys are sitting on a goldmine,’” she explained. “That’s when I paid more attention and realized that I needed to do this. I needed to sort out the archive.”
For the past 12 years, Tamakloe has been digitalizing her grandfather’s pictures. “I’m still making a lot of discoveries, which is very exciting,” she added, recounting how some of Bruce-Vanderpuije’s subjects were identified decades later — including Miss Ghana 1958 and Seth Anthony, the first Black African to be commissioned as an officer in the British army, who were both recognized in pictures by their grown-up children.

“I have always been fascinated to see the reaction of the young generation when they see images of people from the past,” noted Muluneh, who has worked on a number of archive-building projects in Ethiopia. “The magic of photography, for me, is that it can bring us back to a time and moments that offer a unique perspective of not only understanding our people, but also ourselves. I believe that a bigger discussion is needed as it relates to the preservation, publication and promotion of the visual archives of Africa.”
Tamakloe is similarly engaged in pursuing this conversation, and keen to export her grandfather’s work more broadly. Ultimately, she said, “I would like to tell the Ghanaian story, truthfully.”
Today, nearly two years after celebrating its centenary, Deo Gratias is widely considered to be the oldest operational photo studio in West Africa, and is still largely used as it was in its early years (albeit with a different, smaller crowd), said Tamakloe. “It’s in a very densely populated area and we have a lot of festivals happening around us — we’re also surrounded by churches — so people still come and have their photograph taken all dressed up,” she explained.
With a shift in new technologies and the way we interact with photography evolving, however, Tamakloe acknowledged that most people now look elsewhere for their mementos. “People do come and have passport pictures taken, but it’s not as busy as it used to be,” she said. “These days, people take photographs on their phones. Those who do come in though, want a print to keep and probably frame.”
“Unveiling the Shadows of the Past: J. K. Bruce-Vanderpuije — The Hidden Icon of Photography in Africa” runs until Feb. 20, 2024 at Efie Gallery, Dubai."
KLOLS9Q158_Y4VGQZUHSH0SAHJ,CBS newsman Charles Osgood dies at 91,"By Andy Rose and Christina Zdanowicz, CNN","3 minute read Updated 12:38 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/23/us/charles-osgood-death/,"Former CBS journalist Charles Osgood, an award-winning newsman known for his work on radio and television, died Tuesday at his home in New Jersey, CBS News reported. He was 91.
Osgood was the anchor of the network’s venerable “CBS Sunday Morning” program from 1994 to 2016, succeeding original host Charles Kuralt. For decades, he also hosted a daily news commentary series for CBS News Radio called “The Osgood File.”
Osgood said he never liked to think of TV being just for the ratings – it was sharing in something that people love.
“I think that ‘CBS Sunday Morning’ has been successful because the people who watch it don’t tune in to see how much you can shock them or distress them, but they tune in to see what – you know, what would be fascinating, interesting and possibly even inspiring, and that’s what we try to do,” Osgood told CNN in a previous interview.
In his nearly 50-year run at CBS – 22 years on “CBS Sunday Morning” alone – Osgood cemented his legacy by carrying on the tradition of oral storytelling and his predecessor, Kuralt, called him “one of the last great broadcast writers.” Osgood’s published books and poems, his gift for playing music and his signature bowties conjure memories beyond his days in the news business.
The show was the highest-rated Sunday morning news program on TV when Osgood stepped down, with its growth being a marvel when many other shows were shrinking.
While his time on TV brought him great fame, Osgood maintained that he considered himself a radio man. His famous sign-off line was proof of that: “As for me, I will see you on the radio.”
“I never considered myself a television guy who happened to do radio. I was a radio guy who happened to do a television show,” Osgood said.
Osgood took his love of poetry and sometimes delivered the “The Osgood File” in rhyming verse. His unique style earned him the title of poet in residence at CBS News.
“I never took a broadcasting course or a journalism course when I went to school,” Osgood once said. “At Fordham, I majored in economics, so in a way, I sort of learned on the job, and since I don’t know how to do it right I just do it in whatever way I can think of.”
His creative style of storytelling earned Osgood accolades, including five Emmy Awards, one for lifetime achievement in 2017, the George Foster Peabody Award and many more.
Beyond being a man on the air, Osgood had another major passion: music. Osgood, who would sometimes play piano on the show, owned three Steinway pianos, he told audiences on his final “CBS Sunday Morning.”
And he even had a top 40 hit in 1967, “Gallant Men.” It reached No. 29, one spot above “Wild Thing.”
In addition to the piano, Osgood could play the organ, banjo and violin. He also found success as a composer and a lyricist.
He shared the stage, whether at CBS or elsewhere, with The New York Pops, The Boston Pops and The Mormon Tabernacle Choir, according to CBS.

In a filing in Fulton County Superior Court on Thursday, Trump’s attorneys joined an effort to dismiss the case brought by one of his co-defendants, who alleged in a previous court filing that Willis was engaged in a romantic relationship with the special prosecutor on the case and has benefitted financially when he took her on vacations.
The filing also points to public comments Willis recently made defending her choice to select the lead prosecutor, Nathan Wade, arguing that she violated Georgia rules for prosecutors.
“The motion filed today on behalf of President Trump seeks to hold District Attorney Willis legally accountable both for the misconduct alleged in a motion filed by Mr. Roman as well as her extrajudicial public statements falsely and intentionally injecting race into this case,” Trump’s attorney, Steve Sadow, wrote in a statement.
In comments Willis made at Atlanta’s Big Bethel A.M.E. Church earlier this month, the DA defended her team of prosecutors in the case, calling into question why only one of the three prosecutors was being attacked.
“Is it that some will never see a Black man as qualified – no matter his achievements? What more can one achieve? The other two have never been judges, but no one questions their credentials,” Willis remarked.
The district attorney’s office declined to comment on the latest filing.
Trump’s attorneys claim that Willis made a “calculated effort to foment racial bias” against the defendants with her comments, which run the risk of prejudicing the public and prospective jurors.
“The DA’s comments directly ran afoul of Georgia Rules of Professional Conduct,” Trump attorneys wrote in the filing, adding that the maximum penalty for the alleged violation is disbarment.
“Her attempt to foment racial animus and prejudice against the defendants in order to divert and deflect attention away from her alleged improprieties calls out for the sanctions of dismissal and disqualification,” Sadow said in his statement."
KONGNMQVPT_8YOPGNQHA46GVSF,Exclusive: House ethics probe of Gaetz seeks information from DOJ and woman who allegedly had sex with congressman as a minor,"By Paula Reid and Annie Grayer, CNN","4 minute read Updated 6:55 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/24/politics/house-ethics-matt-gaetz/,"The House Ethics Committee investigating Rep. Matt Gaetz has reached out to the woman whom the congressman allegedly had sexual relations with when she was a 17-year-old minor, according to a source familiar with the committee’s work.
The outreach, which has not previously been reported, is a sign that the GOP-led committee’s investigation into the Florida Republican has recently expanded to include questioning around allegations of sex crimes.
Sources said the committee also has reached out to the Justice Department requesting materials from its investigation into Gaetz, which included allegations of lobbying violations, sex-trafficking and possible obstruction of justice. The federal probe, which also included allegations he had sex with a minor, concluded in 2023 with no charges brought against the congressman.
Gaetz has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, including ever having sex with a minor or paying for sex.
“Those allegations were not true, have never been true, and the people who spread those lies have been exposed, indicted, and imprisoned,” Gaetz said in response to CNN Wednesday.
The Ethics Committee’s outreach to the young woman and the Justice Department comes amid a new flurry of activity in the probe, including outreach to multiple other witnesses and starting to conduct witness interviews. The increased activity under Republican leadership is notable given the committee probe was started by House Democrats in 2021.
Gaetz, who led the charge to oust former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, has privately blamed McCarthy for the committee restarting its probe under the California Republican’s watch.
But McCarthy has repeatedly denounced those accusations and has said Gaetz worked to oust the former speaker because of the ethics probe.
“I don’t believe them to be conservatives,” McCarthy said in November, referring to the eight Republicans who voted to oust him. “It’s driven by Gaetz, and it was all based upon an ethics complaint that happened in the last Congress. He would throw his country away to try to protect himself for what would come out as the truth.”
The Ethics Committee and Department of Justice declined to comment.
The Justice Department does not have to comply with a voluntary request from the House Ethics Committee, said Norman Eisen, who served as counsel to House Democrats in former President Donald Trump’s first impeachment.
“If a request seems merited, as part of the usual accommodation process between the legislative and executive branches, DOJ will sometimes provide some information,” Eisen said, “but they tend to be withholding of sensitive investigative materials.”
Even when the House issues a subpoena, the Justice Department typically holds back much of their internal investigative materials, Eisen said. “They will sometimes provide a specific piece of evidence when the House shows a strong need and is not otherwise able to obtain it,” he added.
In late 2020, under Trump-appointed Attorney General Bill Barr, the Justice Department opened an investigation into allegations Gaetz may have had sexual contact with a minor. The probe expanded over the years before the Justice Department officially decided last year not to charge the congressman.
As part of the sprawling investigation, Joel Greenberg, a former Florida tax collector and close confidant of Gaetz, pleaded guilty in 2021 to six federal charges, including soliciting and paying the minor in the Gaetz allegation for sex.
The Ethics Committee, controlled at the time by Democrats, originally opened its Gaetz investigation in 2021, publicly announcing that it was examining a range of allegations including that Gaetz violated sex trafficking laws, shared inappropriate images or videos on the House floor, used illicit drugs, converted campaign funds to personal use and accepted a bribe, among other claims.
The committee deferred its investigation at the request of the Justice Department, which was simultaneously probing the allegations, but resumed its work in after the DOJ concluded its investigation without bringing charges.
A source familiar with the House panel’s work previously told CNN that the Justice Department’s decision not to bring charges against Gaetz does not impact what the committee will and won’t investigate. The committee plans to examine the same allegations they were looking into when they opened the investigation in 2021, the source told CNN."

The town of Chatham announced Thursday that Gov. Maura Healey ordered the American flag and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts flag to fly at half-staff from sunrise to sunset in honor of Petty Officer Second Class Merle Chester Joseph Hillman, who was 25 at the time of the attack.
Hillman was onboard the USS California on December 7, 1941, when two torpedoes and a bomb struck the ship during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, according to the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, which is part of the US Department of Defense.

The ship slowly sank over the next three days, claiming the lives of over 100 sailors and Marines.
According to the agency, Hillman’s remains, although unidentified, were recovered after the attack, and he was given an anonymous burial at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu.
In 2018, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency exhumed 25 unknown remains associated with the ship, according to a news release.
Officials said scientists from the agency and the Armed Forces Medical Examiner System used techniques, including anthropological and mitochondrial DNA analysis, to identify Hillman’s remains.
Hillman, a pharmacist, had served in the US Navy for six years at the time of his death, according to an article included in the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency’s news release.
Hillman was identified on October 20, 2023, and will be buried on Saturday."

As she stood outside her hometown’s opera house, where Trump held one of his final Granite State campaign rallies earlier this week, the 33-year-old said she was “relieved” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis dropped out and that she didn’t know former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley existed until that evening. Though Trump wasn’t necessarily “presidential material,” she said he was braver than anyone else running and felt he was robbed of a second term in 2020.
“I voted for Trump the last time and I’ll keep voting for him, unless there’s somebody that is right there and has the same morals and values of Trump, trying to make America great again,” she said.
With the help of voters like Cote, Trump won the New Hampshire primary Tuesday, reinforcing what months of polls, political endorsements, focus groups and the results of the Iowa caucuses have shown: Many GOP voters aren’t interested in an alternative to the former president.
His win, and the thoughts and feelings that motivated the voters that gave it to him, offer sobering lessons to his last remaining major GOP rival.
Related article Five takeaways from the New Hampshire primary
In more than a dozen interviews, Trump’s backers here described his first term in office as a time of economic prosperity and global peace, dismissed the four criminal indictments against him as attacks from Democrats and, at times, expressed the unfounded view that the 2020 presidential election was stolen due to widespread voter fraud. Many acknowledged his behavior wasn’t what they would like, but he was a known and proven entity, unlike his rivals, they said.
Despite months of campaigning and millions spent on ads, mailers and door knocking in the Granite State, some Trump supporters said they were unfamiliar with Haley. Some were turned off by the little they had heard. And many never even considered voting for anyone else.
Adrienne Kirwin, a 74-year-old from Derry, said most of her exposure to Haley came from items stuffed into her mailbox. First, she backed South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, but then he dropped out and backed Trump. Then she liked DeSantis, until he did the same.
“I was thinking of Nikki Haley but then when everybody, like I said, started endorsing Trump,” she said outside her polling place, where she voted for the former president. “Everybody came out for Trump, Trump, Trump… so, why not go for Trump?”
Kirwin said she thought Trump was “a little crazy” and his found his personality “awful,” but she also recalled watching him in the first 2016 general election debate against Hillary Clinton.
“Everything he said, it was like he was saying it to me,” she recalled during an interview in the parking lot of her polling place Tuesday afternoon. “And I said, ‘This man loves the country.’”
Her husband, 85-year-old Raymond Kirwin, was less conflicted.
“I didn’t consider anyone else,” he said. “He did more than any president in my life, and I was gonna come back and hope he’d do the same thing again.”
Christy Piper, a 38-year-old from Dover, said that while she was open to other candidates, the former president was always her top choice. “It’s always been Trump,” she said outside the Trump rally in Rochester Sunday. “Trump’s messaging resonates the most, and I feel like he can just make the most difference out of any viable candidate running.”
Piper predicted Trump would win and said she believed he had a large pool of quiet support.
“It’s not really politically correct or safe to say that you’re a Trump supporter. So most people just keep their mouth shut,” she said. “His messaging resonates with so many people who are sick and tired of what’s going on in this country.”
Both Trump and Haley ratcheted up their attacks on each other heading out of New Hampshire. Flanked by former rivals, including Scott and biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, Trump railed against Haley for remaining in the race despite his two first place finishes.
“I don’t get too angry, I get even,” he told supporters in Nashua.
Haley highlighted his legal troubles and a recent a moment in which he confused her for former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
“With Donald Trump, you have one round of chaos after another,” she said Tuesday night during a post-primary speech in Concord. “This court case, that controversy, this tweet, that senior moment. You can’t fix Joe Biden’s chaos with Republican chaos.”
She has also tried to make the argument for electability. She has pointed to national and swing state general election polls that show her beating Biden by wider margins than Trump. On the trail and in fundraising emails, she told supporters there would be “no recounts, no lawsuits, and no doubts” about the election results if she took on Biden, and Republican ranks would swell in the House and Senate.
“We’ll rebuild our economy and secure our border,” her campaign said in a fundraising pitch the day before the election. “And make no mistake, we will restore our national pride.”
It’s an argument that has worked on some former Trump voters. Mike Condor, a 59-year-old from Derry, said he voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020. In the last election, he saw Trump as the lesser of two evils. This time, he said he would hope for a viable third party candidate if there is another Trump vs. Biden rematch, and backed Haley in the primary.
“I don’t want any chaos,” he said as he left his polling place with his wife Laura, 49, and daughter Mira, 18, both of whom also voted for Haley.
Laura, who voted for Republicans like John McCain and Mitt Romney before backing Democrats over Trump, said she hoped Haley would stay in even if she lost Tuesday’s election. Even if she trailed Trump with delegates, she thought the party needed a viable alternative to Trump.
“When we’re talking about people of this age and cognitive awareness, health things could happen,” she said. “So, I think that she makes a stronger case by having as many delegates as she can get.”
While Haley’s supporters are itching for a contest, the former president’s backers are hoping for a coronation.
Robert Stacy, a 26-year-old from Rochester said he hoped the nomination process would wrap up soon in Trump’s favor – and noted that he didn’t want the race to drag out, as it had in 2016.
“I think it would be a mistake for Nikki Haley to pull a Ted Cruz,” Stacy said."
KX0VLQBX2G_YN54QI6PNLNRHVB,Minnesota state trooper charged with second-degree murder in death of man during traffic stop in Minneapolis,"By Andy Rose, CNN","2 minute read Updated 3:50 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/24/us/minnesota-minneapolis-trooper-shooting-ricky-cobb/,"A Minnesota State Patrol trooper was charged Wednesday with second-degree murder in the shooting death of Ricky Cobb II during a traffic stop in Minneapolis last year.
State Trooper Ryan Londregan also faces charges of first-degree assault and second-degree manslaughter, according to a criminal complaint filed in court.
“State troopers may only use deadly force when it is necessary to protect a person from a specific identified threat of great bodily harm or death that was reasonably likely to occur. That did not exist in this case,” Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty said at a news conference. “Ricky Cobb II should be alive today.”
Investigators said Cobb was pulled over July 31 on Interstate 94 by three troopers for not having taillights turned on at night, and troopers determined he was wanted for violating a protective order in Ramsey County. Body camera video showed that Cobb – who is Black – refused to leave his vehicle after being told that he was not facing an arrest warrant.

Londregan – who is White – and another trooper, are seen trying to physically remove Cobb from the car, and the vehicle appears to move forward slowly. The criminal complaint says Londergan shot Cobb twice, and the vehicle sped up and crashed into a concrete barrier a quarter-mile away. Cobb was pronounced dead at the scene.
“This County Attorney has provided sweetheart deals to murderers and kidnappers, and now, today, she charges a hero. This County Attorney is literally out of control. Open season on law enforcement must end. And it’s going to end with this case,” Londregan’s attorney Chris Madel said Wednesday.
The “(Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association) will vigorously defend our trooper who is unjustly charged as a result of acting in accordance with his legal responsibilities,” MPPOA Executive Director Brian Peters said in a statement.
Moriarty said Londregan is expected to make his first court appearance later this week or next week, and they will recommend that he be released on his own recognizance. “We are not requesting bail in this case because it is not consistent with Minnesota’s law on bail and the risk assessment used by Hennepin County.” Moriarty said they would request that Londregan be ordered to surrender his passport and any firearms.
“Ryan Londregan stole my son from me,” said Cobb’s mother Nyra Fields-Miller in a statement released Wednesday by her attorneys. “He gunned Ricky down - for no reason while he was defenseless. Nothing can ever make up for that. But today’s decision is the first step toward closure and justice.”"
KXF8RBI6UN_6Z58217SZF6BOYG,Seoul police chief indicted for negligence over Itaewon Halloween crush,"By Yoonjung Seo, Gawon Bae and Heather Chen, CNN","2 minute read Published 4:34 AM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240122,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/22/asia/south-korea-itaewon-halloween-crowd-crush-intl-hnk/,"Seoul’s police chief has been indicted for negligence over the 2022 crowd crush that killed more than 150 people during Halloween festivities in the popular Itaewon neighborhood that left the nation reeling.
South Korean police on Monday confirmed that Kim Kwang-ho, head of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency (SMPA), had been indicted in connection with the tragedy – the most senior police officer charged over the incident.
A statement released on Friday said Kim was charged with “professional negligence resulting in injury or death,” Reuters reported.
According to police emergency call logs from the night of October 29, 2022, multiple calls from members of the public were made about overcrowding as early as four hours before the situation gravely worsened.
Four police dispatches were sent out to Itaewon, which had hosted Halloween celebrations in Seoul for years.
But crowds had already swelled and the streets became so packed that partygoers were unable to move. Some slipped below the feet of others, unable to breathe. Most who died that night were young South Koreans – largely in their teens and early 20s.
In the aftermath of the crush, South Korean authorities maintained that they had no guidelines to handle the huge crowds that gathered for the Halloween festivities – stirring anger among survivors and families of the deceased.
Public outrage turned toward South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and his government – survivors and families of the victims remain strongly critical about what they see as a continuing lack of accountability on the part of South Korean authorities over the disaster.
Kim has not been dismissed from his position following the indictment, according to Seoul police.
His indictment comes after the arrest of two former officers in December on charges of destroying evidence relating to the disaster, authorities said.
The trauma of that night still haunts some survivors and bereaved families.
One survivor, who wanted to be known only by her last name Lee, told CNN in October that she had not been back to Itaewon and she doubted whether lessons from the disaster had “truly been learnt” by authorities.
“For me, Halloween and the Itaewon tragedy are (inextricably) linked,” she said. “It’s impossible to see reminders everywhere and not think about the death of friends that night.”"
KYKSJI9E1Y_XU47Y0AH6SLJBKR,The conservative legal world lines up behind Donald Trump at the Supreme Court,"By Joan Biskupic, CNN Senior Supreme Court Analyst","7 minute read Published 5:00 AM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/26/politics/supreme-court-trump-colorado-mitchell-analysis/,"As Donald Trump wages a Supreme Court battle to stay on state presidential ballots, a potent contingent of the conservative legal world has united behind him.
His new principal attorney for the case, Jonathan Mitchell, is a former Supreme Court clerk connected to the right-wing elite who devised the 2021 Texas abortion ban that helped lead to reversal of the Roe v. Wade landmark decision. The Texas law, which included a shrewd mechanism impeding judicial review, prompted liberal Justice Elena Kagan to refer disparagingly to its masterminds as “some geniuses.”
Also backing Trump, with “friend of the court” briefs, are the Republican National Committee and GOP establishment forces, similarly represented by elite appellate advocates who’ve worked for the justices and speak their language. They include former Trump Solicitor General Noel Francisco, George W. Bush-era legal adviser John Yoo and other ex-clerks of conservative Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas.
The leading Republican presidential candidate appears to be benefitting from ideological kinship, and perhaps personal loyalty, in the case that arose in Colorado but will have nationwide implications for the November general election.
The new filings in the case of Trump v. Anderson also reinforce the tight world of Supreme Court lawyering. From the start, the Colorado voters trying to keep Trump off the ballot, and who won at the state Supreme Court level, have been represented by former US Supreme Court clerks who’ve become prominent advocates.
The arguments tied to an anti-insurrectionist safeguard in the Constitution are scheduled for February 8 and bound to be hard fought and high energy. Given the GOP-appointed conservative dominance of the bench, the Trump side could find more allies in the give-and-take.

In his brief, Mitchell cited Thomas, whose influence has grown with the addition of more conservative colleagues in recent years. Mitchell highlighted what he insisted was the proper textualist reading of the disputed constitutional provision. Lawyers for the Republican National Committee similarly emphasized textualist arguments, repeatedly citing the late Justice Scalia, a prominent disciple of the textualist mode of legal interpretation.
At the lectern opposing Mitchell, who clerked for Scalia two decades ago, will be Jason Murray, a more recent law clerk to Justice Kagan. Murray’s partners in the case, Eric Olson and Sean Grimsley, who argued in Colorado lower courts, served as law clerks to the late Justices John Paul Stevens and Sandra Day O’Connor, respectively.
They, and their side’s “friend of the court” briefs, have until January 31 to respond to the Trump arguments. Based on the Colorado challengers’ preliminary submission to the high court, they will likely try to turn the justices’ attention to what happened on January 6, 2021, when Trump sought to overturn the election results that legitimately gave Joe Biden the White House.
Referring to the findings of a Colorado trial court judge, the lawyers wrote that Trump caused “the insurrection on January 6, 2021, having intentionally incited the mob to violence in a desperate ploy to cling to power.”
The former president is urging the justices to overturn the Colorado Supreme Court decision that said he should be disqualified from the state ballot for his role in the attack on the US Capitol based on the Constitution’s 14th Amendment.
Adopted after the Civil War and aimed at former Confederate leaders, Section 3 says, “No person shall … hold any office … under the United States … who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States … to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.”
Mitchell opened his arguments with the assertion that the president is not an “officer” of the United States, as the term is used in the Constitution, and therefore not covered by Section 3. (This theory was adopted by the Colorado trial judge but rejected by the state Supreme Court, which found it “inconsistent with the plain language and history of Section 3.”)
Mitchell highlighted oaths that are separately delineated in the Constitution and taken by the president and other top officials. “The president swears a different oath set forth in Article II, in which he promises to ‘preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States’ — and in which the word ‘support’ is nowhere to be found,” Mitchell wrote.

Focusing on the specific words of the text, he told the justices, “Section 3’s disqualification can apply only to those who have ‘previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States.’ It is undisputed that President Trump never took such an oath.”
Trump’s lawyers also are arguing that Section 3 applies only to a person who would “hold” office, not “run” for office. That contention has been endorsed in court brief by Francisco on behalf of the National Republican Senatorial Committee.
A group of former Republican attorneys general, which includes William Barr, Michael Mukasey and Edwin Meese, is also emphasizing that Section 3 does not cover the president, even as the group subtly acknowledges the national divisions arising from the attack on the Capitol.
In their interpretation of Section 3, they say, “The text speaks to a hierarchy of public offices in descending rank order, and its reference to an ‘officer of the United States’ low in that hierarchical list cannot include a President because an office ‘under the United States’ and ‘officer of the United States’ did not include the presidency as those terms were historically understood.”
The former attorneys general add, “Whatever one thinks of President Trump’s behavior on January 6, 2021, the stakes in this case are much larger than any one candidate or election. The overriding question is whether the Court will interpret Section 3 in a way that would henceforth empower partisan officials to unilaterally disqualify their political opponents from the ballot, especially the presidential ballot.”
Mitchell was already scheduled to make an appearance at the high court in February.
He will argue on behalf of a gun owner on February 28 in a dispute over government-banned bump stocks, devices that augment semiautomatic rifles to fire hundreds of bullets a minute.
After his clerkship, Mitchell became a lawyer in the George W. Bush administration’s Office of Legal Counsel and taught law school, including at the University of Chicago, where he had earned a law degree. He served as Texas state solicitor general from 2010 to 2015.
Recalled by colleagues over the years as smart but somewhat eccentric, Mitchell, now 47, seemed destined to become a solo operator. He opened his own firm in 2018. Mitchell has gravitated to culture-war issues, notably against reproductive rights and LGBTQ interests.
During the Colorado proceedings, Trump was represented by Scott Gessler, a Republican lawyer and former Colorado secretary of state, and the Dhillon Law Group, which has shepherded other Trump litigation related to January 6.
As Mitchell has taken over the Supreme Court appeal, he has focused Trump’s legal attack, eliminating some arguments and leading with the claim that the president is simply not an “officer of the United States” covered by the anti-insurrectionist provision.
For Supreme Court justices, reviewing the Trump arguments and soon-to-be-filed responses from the Colorado challengers, they are likely in only the first chapter of litigation related to the former president this election year.
Among the other controversies on the near horizon is whether Trump can claim immunity from criminal prosecution for election subversion related to the 2020 presidential contest.
Special counsel Jack Smith had tried to persuade the court to hear arguments related to the immunity claim, well in advance of a scheduled March trial for Trump. The justices spurned the December request, and as a result a US appellate court heard arguments on January 9 over whether Trump should be shielded for alleged crimes while in office.
A decision could come any day, and when that happens, the case of United States v. Trump would, no doubt, return to the justices."
L41EPK2PWH_OXC562YCOQGHMHV,Harris pins the blame on Trump for Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade,"By Kevin Liptak, CNN","5 minute read Updated 11:15 PM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/22/politics/kamala-harris-cnntv/,"Vice President Kamala Harris on Monday pinned blame squarely on Donald Trump for the reversal of Roe v. Wade, saying the former president is “proud that women are silently suffering” without a guaranteed right to abortion.
“The previous president expressed his intentions quite clearly. And fast forward to just recently, says he’s proud of what he did,” Harris told CNN’s Laura Coates during an exclusive interview in Wisconsin, where the vice president was launching a national tour in support of reproductive rights.
She said the likely Republican nominee relishes his role in new, restrictive abortion laws that have emerged in the aftermath of the high court ruling.
“By inference, he is proud that women have been deprived of fundamental freedoms to make decisions about their own body; by inference, proud that doctors are being penalized and criminalized for providing health care, proud that women are silently suffering because they don’t have access to the health care they need,” Harris added. “So, let’s understand that the stakes are so very high.”
It was a preview of a central reelection argument in a rematch between Trump and President Joe Biden, a contest that will be shadowed by the former president’s multiple courtroom trials, including one related to Trump’s role in events that led to the January 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol.
The vice president rejected outright Trump’s assertions that his legal issues amount to political persecution undertaken by the Biden administration: “What he’s saying is not factual, period,” she said. “And that would not be new for him, would it?”
And Harris said it was imperative Americans remain watchful for signs of democratic erosion in the lead-up to this year’s contest.
“I think everyone is right to be vigilant in demanding that we maintain our democracy. And we uphold its pillars, which includes the integrity of a free and fair election system,” Harris said in the CNN interview, listing intimidation of poll workers as an example of what to watch out for in the coming months as the election gets underway.
“It is important that we all remember that a hallmark of a democracy is civic participation. Which means let’s all vote – I’m not telling you who to vote for, but please, in the midst of all that you’ve got going on, take the time to fill out a ballot if you can vote by mail and send it in,” she said.
Harris spoke a day ahead of the New Hampshire primary, where Trump maintains a sizable lead against his remaining GOP rival, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley.
As part of her campaign pitch, Haley has made Harris a frequent target, claiming that because of his age, a vote for Biden would amount to a vote for Harris – and suggesting the vice president wasn’t up for the job. Harris said that type of criticism wasn’t unique for powerful women.
“I think that most women who have risen in their profession, who are leaders in their profession, have had similar experiences,” she told Coates. “I was the first woman to be elected district attorney. I was the first woman to be elected attorney general in the state of California, and I’m the first woman to be vice president. And I love my job.”
As she and Biden gear up for what could be the imminent start of the general election, Harris worked to underscore the stakes of the upcoming contest – stakes many Democrats worry haven’t registered yet with enough voters.
She said those who committed acts of violence on January 6, 2021, “need to be taken into account and held accountable for those acts.”
And Harris accused Republicans of “playing politics” with immigration, as she and Biden come under criticism for not doing more to stem the flow of migrants coming across the southern border.
Still, for Democrats, no issue better illustrates the choice in November than abortion, which the party has seized upon in the wake of the court’s 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.
Trump’s role in gutting abortion rights – his three conservative Supreme Court picks all voted to overturn Roe v. Wade – is emerging as a core theme for Harris and Biden as they seek reelection. Reproductive rights have galvanized Democrats and proven a winner at the ballot box in the 19 months since the high court overturned the ruling.
Harris plans to travel to several other states to speak about the issue on her national “Fight for Reproductive Freedoms Tour,” which is expected to last through March. And she will appear at a joint rally with Biden on Tuesday – the same day as the New Hampshire primary – to draw more attention to abortion rights.
“I am going to do exactly what I’m doing here in Wisconsin, which is traveling in the country to remind people of not only what is at stake and the harm that is occurring every day, so many women silently suffering, but also remind them of the connection between their vote and an outcome that puts back in place the protections of Roe. So these months are going to matter,” Harris said Monday.
On Sunday, the Biden campaign unveiled a new television ad that features an emotional direct-to-camera testimonial from Dr. Austin Dennard, a Texas OB-GYN and mother who traveled out of her state, which has a strict abortion ban, to terminate her pregnancy after learning her fetus had a fatal condition. The campaign said the spot would run during this week’s season premiere of ABC’s “The Bachelor” as it targets young female voters.
At the White House on Monday, Biden met with his administration’s task force on reproductive rights, criticizing Republicans for trying to ban abortion and announcing new steps the White House is taking to expand access to contraception and other reproductive care.
Still, Biden and Harris have acknowledged that fully restoring the protections included in Roe will be impossible without congressional action.
“President Joe Biden has been very clear, when Congress puts the protections of Roe back into the law, he will sign it,” Harris told Coates in Wisconsin. “Similarly, President Joe Biden has been very clear if these extremists achieve their other goal, which is to have a national ban, which means state by state by state. Joe Biden will veto that.”
“The stakes are high,” she said.

Our baby girl is crawling now,Opinion by Lishay Lavi,"5 minute read Updated 10:15 AM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240122,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/22/opinions/wife-letter-israeli-hostage-husband-lavi/,"Editor’s Note: Editor’s note: Lishay Lavi’s husband Omri Miran, father of their two daughters Roni and Alma, was kidnapped by Hamas on October 7 and remains captive in Gaza. Her letter has been translated from Hebrew by her brother, Moshe Lavi. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. Read more CNN Opinion.
Dear Omri, my Omri,
Alma began crawling soon after you were taken from us. She now sits and stands as well and tries to eat on her own. She smiles and reaches for the space you once occupied as if trying to grasp a memory that slips through her tiny fingers.
I wonder, will you be free to see her walk for the first time?
I have been writing daily to you, myself and the world. Writing about our pain, our agony, our despair. I hope that you’ll return to Roni, Alma and me.
We heard that one of the released hostages told you we survived October 7 against all odds; we were rescued from the house of horrors that saw the death of loved ones, our hours-long abuse and your violent abduction.
We hope that news is true. We hope that the knowledge we are here waiting for you helps you persevere through your captivity, just as the hope of your return is what helps me persevere.
I think of Penelope’s words about Odysseus: “How I long for my husband – alive in memory, always.”
Roni has been both a beacon of light and a mirror reflecting the pain in my heart. She speaks so much now, my love, with a wisdom that transcends her years.
Her words are bittersweet, a constant reminder of your absence. She asks every night where you are, why you are still lost. She speaks of the bad people who took you away in front of our eyes. She draws you every day. And her smile reminds me of you.
Her eyes search mine for reassurance, and I try to give her the certainty she craves. But real comfort can only come when you are returned to us.
Roni’s resilience is both inspiring and heartbreaking. She found hope when Mojo, your dog, returned injured but wagging his tail. He too longs to see you!
Alma is too young to understand what is happening; her laughter echoes through the hall of our temporary housing in Kibbutz Kramim. It’s a haunting reminder of the joy that once permeated our home.
Yes, I forgot to say. We are no longer in Nahal Oz. There’s no more Nahal Oz, at least not in the way we remember it, and at least not until this painful war ends.
The Nahal Oz community and spirit, however, live on through us, the survivors who are rallying in support of each other and fighting for your and (fellow hostage) Tsaci Idan’s release.
We also found a community and support system in Kramim, people who care and love us and give us the strength to wake up every morning and work for your release.
Your friends visit, supporting and loving us more than I could have wished.
The last time we saw each other, I told you that I love you, that I’ll care for the girls, and that you should not try to be a hero. You told me that you love me, and then Roni tried to run to you. Thankfully, I managed to stop her in time.
Your captivity, with all its unknowns, has been all-encompassing. Are you injured? Do you eat? Do you need any medication? Are you being tortured or abused?
The not-knowing is a torment that wraps around my heart and squeezes it.
Some of those who returned from captivity shared their horrifying stories; others might share more in the coming days and weeks.
But for now, parts of the world seem to have turned their backs on us – and most of all, on you – in our most difficult time. The United Nations, the International Committee of the Red Cross, some of those we viewed as friends and allies.
The international community’s corridors of power and palaces of justice resonate with a silence that is deafening. Meanwhile streets and public spaces around the world have become places of hateful discourse; extending the violence of October 7 with people ripping down posters bearing your name, your photo, your story. Leaving me with a sense of abandonment that cuts deep.
How did we arrive at a place where the humanitarian pleas of families are met with indifference and mockery, where the principles that should guide us are overshadowed by political posturing?
Lishay Lavi
How did we arrive at a place where the humanitarian pleas of families are met with indifference and mockery, where the principles that should guide us are overshadowed by political posturing?
There are times we feel that our government, too, has forsaken us. Though I truly believe it is committed to bringing about your, and all the hostages, release.
But do know that while some are silent, and some are hateful, many others are loud and full of love.
You are not alone; we are not alone.
Omri, in the face of despair, I choose hope. I believe in the power of love and the resilience of the human spirit to win the fight for your freedom.
Our families tirelessly advocate for you in Israel and worldwide. Your face and name appear everywhere – and we demand others to say your name, share your story and call for your release.
There are moments when I imagine crossing into Gaza, holding Roni and Alma close, marching in and looking into the eyes of your captors as we did in Nahal Oz.
In that daydream, I bring you home with us.
But the reality is darker, more complex. Love and humanity, as much as they define us, do not always triumph.
I remain hopeful that we will get to hug you again; that Roni will run to you just as she tried to run to you that day, and this time I will not hold her back. Alma will be crawling behind her. And those first steps will come before we know it.

Omri, my love, know that you are missed and fiercely fought for.
Until that day we bring you home, I will continue to write, speak and fight for the life we built together for our daughters.
I will continue to love you like Penelope loved Odysseus during his 20 years of absence.
I refuse to believe you will not return to me.
Lishay"

Chunli Zhao, the accused gunman, was indicted by a grand jury on Friday on the charges, prosecutors announced. He was also charged with the special circumstance allegation of multiple murder, according to a news release from the San Mateo County District Attorney’s Office.
Authorities have said Zhao, a Chinese citizen, shot five people at a mushroom farm in Half Moon Bay where he worked – killing four – and fatally shot three more at a farm about 2 miles away on January 23, 2023. Five of the seven killed were Chinese citizens, China’s consulate in San Francisco said.

After the killings, Zhao was charged with seven counts of murder and one count of attempted murder and pleaded not guilty in February. That case was set for a preliminary hearing in March, but this month’s grand jury indictment supersedes the initial felony complaint against Zhao and the preliminary hearing will no longer be necessary, the district attorney’s office said.
In court Tuesday, Zhao was appointed an attorney. He is expected to enter a plea at his next court date, set for February 29.
Zhao’s attorney Jonathan McDougal did not comment on the indictment following the hearing, saying only, “We look forward to coming back in February.”
Tuesday’s hearing came exactly one year from the date of the shooting. District Attorney Stephen Wagstaffe called the timing a symbolic coincidence.
“It’s a coincidence that I think serves a good purpose of reminding everybody the horror of what occurred,” Wagstaffe said.
The mass shooting became the deadliest attack in the county’s history, the district attorney said last year.
Zhao was a coworker or former coworker of the victims at each shooting site, and evidence indicated the attack was an instance of workplace violence in which specific people were targeted, San Mateo County Sheriff Christina Corpus said at the time.
Zhao admitted to the killings and said he wasn’t in his right mind and didn’t know “what was happening mentally” when the shootings occurred, according to NBC Bay Area News. He also expressed remorse and said he regrets the attacks, according to the outlet.
Zhao had legal possession of a semi-automatic weapon that was registered to him, Corpus told CNN."

“I think everyone is right to be vigilant in demanding that we maintain our democracy. And we uphold its pillars, which includes the integrity of a free and fair election system,” Harris said in the CNN interview, listing intimidation of poll workers as an example of what to watch out for in the coming months as the election gets underway.
“It is important that we all remember that a hallmark of a democracy is civic participation. Which means let’s all vote – I’m not telling you who to vote for, but please, in the midst of all that you’ve got going on, take the time to fill out a ballot if you can vote by mail and send it in,” she said.
Harris spoke a day ahead of the New Hampshire primary, where Trump maintains a sizable lead against his remaining GOP rival, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley.
As part of her campaign pitch, Haley has made Harris a frequent target, claiming that because of his age, a vote for Biden would amount to a vote for Harris – and suggesting the vice president wasn’t up for the job. Harris said that type of criticism wasn’t unique for powerful women.
“I think that most women who have risen in their profession, who are leaders in their profession, have had similar experiences,” she told Coates. “I was the first woman to be elected district attorney. I was the first woman to be elected attorney general in the state of California, and I’m the first woman to be vice president. And I love my job.”
As she and Biden gear up for what could be the imminent start of the general election, Harris worked to underscore the stakes of the upcoming contest – stakes many Democrats worry haven’t registered yet with enough voters.
She said those who committed acts of violence on January 6, 2021, “need to be taken into account and held accountable for those acts.”
And Harris accused Republicans of “playing politics” with immigration, as she and Biden come under criticism for not doing more to stem the flow of migrants coming across the southern border.
Still, for Democrats, no issue better illustrates the choice in November than abortion, which the party has seized upon in the wake of the court’s 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.
Trump’s role in gutting abortion rights – his three conservative Supreme Court picks all voted to overturn Roe v. Wade – is emerging as a core theme for Harris and Biden as they seek reelection. Reproductive rights have galvanized Democrats and proven a winner at the ballot box in the 19 months since the high court overturned the ruling.
Harris plans to travel to several other states to speak about the issue on her national “Fight for Reproductive Freedoms Tour,” which is expected to last through March. And she will appear at a joint rally with Biden on Tuesday – the same day as the New Hampshire primary – to draw more attention to abortion rights.
“I am going to do exactly what I’m doing here in Wisconsin, which is traveling in the country to remind people of not only what is at stake and the harm that is occurring every day, so many women silently suffering, but also remind them of the connection between their vote and an outcome that puts back in place the protections of Roe. So these months are going to matter,” Harris said Monday.
On Sunday, the Biden campaign unveiled a new television ad that features an emotional direct-to-camera testimonial from Dr. Austin Dennard, a Texas OB-GYN and mother who traveled out of her state, which has a strict abortion ban, to terminate her pregnancy after learning her fetus had a fatal condition. The campaign said the spot would run during this week’s season premiere of ABC’s “The Bachelor” as it targets young female voters.
At the White House on Monday, Biden met with his administration’s task force on reproductive rights, criticizing Republicans for trying to ban abortion and announcing new steps the White House is taking to expand access to contraception and other reproductive care.
Still, Biden and Harris have acknowledged that fully restoring the protections included in Roe will be impossible without congressional action.
“President Joe Biden has been very clear, when Congress puts the protections of Roe back into the law, he will sign it,” Harris told Coates in Wisconsin. “Similarly, President Joe Biden has been very clear if these extremists achieve their other goal, which is to have a national ban, which means state by state by state. Joe Biden will veto that.”
“The stakes are high,” she said.

LA2KG52I1U_WF0UBF07Y57KAJ6,These Japanese beef croquettes are so popular there’s a 43-year waitlist,"By Maggie Hiufu Wong, CNN","6 minute read Published 8:42 PM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/travel/japanese-kobe-beef-croquettes-43-year-wait-list-intl-hnk/,"If you order a box of frozen Kobe beef croquettes from Asahiya, a family-run butcher shop in Takasago City in western Japan’s Hyogo Prefecture, it’ll take another 43 years before you receive your order.
That isn’t a typo. Forty. Three. Years.
Founded in 1926, Asahiya sold meat products from Hyogo prefecture – Kobe beef included – for decades before adding beef croquettes to the shelf in the years following WWII.
But it wasn’t until the early 2000s that these deep-fried potato and beef dumplings became an internet sensation, resulting in the ridiculously long wait buyers now face.
CNN Travel spoke to Shigeru Nitta, third-generation owner of Asahiya, in 2022. At that time, the wait for the croquettes was a mere 30 years.
The highly coveted “Extreme Croquettes” are one of four types of Kobe beef croquettes available at Asahiya. Can’t wait nearly four decades? The shop’s Premier Kobe Beef Croquettes currently have a more palatable four-year waitlist.
“We started selling our products through online shopping in 1999,” Nitta said. “At that time, we offered Extreme Croquettes as a trial.”
Growing up in Hyogo, Nitta has been visiting the local ranches and beef auctions with his father since he was young.
He took over the shop from his father in 1994 when he was 30 years old.
After experimenting with e-commerce for a few years, he realized customers were hesitant to pay a hefty sum for prime beef online.
That was when he made a bold decision.
“We sold Extreme Croquettes at the price of JPY270 ($1.80) per piece… The beef in them alone costs about JPY400 ($2.70) per piece,” Nitta explained.
“We made affordable and tasty croquettes that demonstrate the concept of our shop as a strategy to have customers enjoy the croquettes and then hope that they would buy our Kobe beef after the first try.”
To limit the financial loss in the beginning, Asahiya only produced 200 croquettes in their own kitchen next to their shop each week.
“We sell the beef raised by the people we know. Our shop only sells meat that was produced in Hyogo Prefecture, whether it’s Kobe beef, Kobe pork or Tajima chicken. This has been the style of the shop since before I became the owner,” said Nitta.
In fact, Nitta’s grandfather used to ride to Sanda – another famous Wagyu-breeding area in Hyogo – by bike with a handcart to pick up the produce himself.
“Since around that period our shop had connections with local beef producers, so we did not have to get them from outside the prefecture,” Nitta added.

The cheap price tag of the Extreme Croquettes flies in the face of the quality of the ingredients. They’re made fresh daily with no preservatives. Ingredients include three-year-old female A5-ranked Kobe beef and potatoes sourced from a local ranch.
Nitta said that he has encouraged the ranch to use cow manure to grow the potatoes. The stems of the potatoes will then be fed to the cows, creating a cycle.
Eventually, his unique concept caught the attention of locals and media. When a report about Asahiya’s croquettes came out in the early 2000s, their popularity skyrocketed.
“We stopped selling them in 2016 because the waiting time became over 14 years. We were thinking of stopping orders, but we got many calls requesting to keep offering them,” Nitta said.
Asahiya resumed accepting orders for these croquettes in 2017 but raised the price.
“At that time, we raised the price to JPY500 ($3.40)-JPY540 ($3.65) with consumption tax. But since the export of Kobe beef began, the prices of beef have doubled, so the fact that the production of croquettes makes a deficit has not changed,” said Nitta.
Production has also been boosted from 200 croquettes a week to 200 per day.
“In reality, the Extreme Croquettes got way more popular than other products,” Nitta chuckled, laughing at his own money-losing business idea.
“We hear that we should hire more people and make croquettes more quickly, but I think there is no shop owner who hires employees and produce more to make more deficit… I feel sorry for having them wait. I do want to make croquettes quickly and send them as soon as possible, but if I do, the shop will go bankrupt.”
Fortunately, Nitta said that about half of the people who try the croquettes end up ordering their Kobe beef, so it’s a sound marketing strategy.

Each box of Extreme Croquettes, which includes five pieces, sells for JPY2,700 ($18.20).
The shop sends a regular newsletter to waiting customers updating them on the latest shipping estimate.
A week before the delivery date, the shop will confirm the delivery with the patient customers once again.
“Of course, some people have changed their email addresses. For those people, we call them directly and let them know the delivery date. They can change their address themselves through our website or when we call them, they can let us know,” explained Nitta.
Customers receiving croquettes these days placed their orders about 10 years ago. There are currently 63,000 people in ‘line’ as of January 2024.
Having a 40-plus-year list of unprofitable orders to fulfill can be stressful, especially as the price of Kobe beef and labor continues to rise.
But something more important has encouraged Nitta to keep going.
“When I started selling croquettes on the internet, I got many orders from remote isolated islands. Most of them had heard of Kobe beef on TV but had never had them because they had to go to cities if they want to try it. I realized that there were so many people who have never had Kobe beef.
“For that reason, I continued offering croquettes as a trial and get more orders for Kobe beef if they liked it. That was why I started it in the first place, so I didn’t really care if it was a deficit,” said Nitta.
One of the most memorable moments was when they got an order from a cancer patient who was about to go through surgery while waiting for their Extreme Croquettes.
“I heard that our croquettes were the patient’s motivation to go through surgery. That surprised me the most,” said Nitta.
The patient survived and has placed multiple orders since then.
Nitta received a call from the patient who told him “I hope to live long without reccurrence of cancer” after sampling his croquettes.
“I still remember that. I was moved by the comment,” said Nitta.
By letting more people enjoy Kobe beef, he hopes that the fame of these croquettes will help promote the local industry.
“I’m grateful. By becoming famous, I think I can help the whole industry, not just my shop, by making people who have not been interested in Kobe beef get interested. I want to have as many people as possible eat Kobe beef – not just from my shop,” said Nitta.

Asahiya now has two locations: their original store at Takasago City and a shop in Kobe city. Its frozen beef croquettes are only shipped domestically.
Though Asahiya primarily operates as a butcher, Nitta says travelers can visit their Kobe shop, where they sell two types of ready-to-eat takeaway snacks, called “Tor Road” and “Kitanozaka” croquettes, named after nearby streets.
“Kitanozaka” uses lean beef and is priced at JPY360 ($2.40) each. “Tor Road” uses short loin and chuck, and costs JPY460 ($3.10)."
LEF58KBKV2_FA3C98OC0H276AJ,"Philadelphia authorities arrest man suspected of helping escaped juvenile homicide suspect, who remains at large","By Danny Freeman and Aya Elamroussi, CNN","5 minute read Updated 7:54 PM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/25/us/philadelphia-suspect-escape/,"An 18-year-old has been arrested in connection with the Philadelphia killing suspect who escaped custody during a medical transport, the city’s police department announced Friday.
Authorities say they arrested Michael Diggs for allegedly picking up Shane Pryor, 17, after Pryor ran from two Philadelphia Juvenile Justice Services Center counselors in the driveway of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.
Pryor, who is suspected of killing a woman in 2020, escaped just before noon Wednesday while he was being transported to the hospital in the University City neighborhood for a hand injury, police said.
Police said Diggs picked up Pryor in a “cream-colored Ford” shortly after his escape, and officers were able to find the car and Diggs the same day.
Diggs is being charged with hindering apprehension, escape, use of a communication facility and criminal conspiracy, according to authorities.
“The arrest marks a significant step forward in the ongoing efforts to bring all those involved in the incident to justice,” according to a news release from police.
CNN was unable to determine whether Diggs has an attorney.
Pryor remained on the loose, authorities said. The US Marshals Service announced a $5,000 reward Thursday for information leading to the capture of Pryor, who authorities have described as dangerous.
The US Marshals Service said it believes Pryor may be receiving other help as he continues to evade custody.
“One hundred percent, he’s being helped by someone out there on the street,” Supervisory Deputy Marshal Rob Clark said at a news conference Friday afternoon.
Clark said Pryor has been in jail since he was 14, so “he surely has help aiding his flight,” adding, “how much of the city does he really know?”
Clark emphasized that, like Diggs, “anyone (else) helping him, no questions asked, you’re going to be prosecuted.”
As Pryor was getting out of a vehicle in the driveway of the hospital, he escaped from detention center staff, Frank Vanore, deputy commissioner of investigations for Philadelphia police, said in a news conference Wednesday afternoon.
Five minutes after his escape, Pryor was seen on video in the lobby of the hospital’s Hub for Clinical Collaboration building asking an employee to use the phone, and he left the building after being denied, the US Marshals Service said in a statement Thursday.

Pryor ran from the hospital, and he was seen on surveillance video entering various buildings trying to get resources, police said.
When Pryor left the vehicle, he did not appear to have any handcuffs or restraints on him, Vanore said. Investigators believe he wasn’t restrained during the transport either, a law enforcement source close to the manhunt told CNN.
Philadelphia police are investigating if Pryor broke free of his restraints, or if restraints were not used in transporting the 17-year-old to hospital, according to Sgt. Eric Gripp, a spokesperson for the Philadelphia Police Department.
Gripp told CNN it is standard practice for suspects to be handcuffed and shackled when transported. There were two juvenile services counselors in the medical transport vehicle with Pryor, which also is standard practice, Gripp said.
On Friday, US Marshals shed light on the moments immediately after Pryor escaped and the pursuit that followed.
The two counselors who were in charge of escorting Pryor to the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia chased after him and were “extremely close,” according to Clark, but they “may have slipped,” allowing Pryor to get away.
“Wherever he’s going, we’re going to pursue him,” Clark said.
Investigators believe Pryor injured himself to prompt the trip to the hospital and are “highly confident” he has received help from an accomplice to evade police, a source said.
He weighs about 180 pounds, and he’s about 5 feet, 7 inches tall, Vanore said, adding that he was wearing a dark blue sweatsuit when he fled.
Pryor was being held on a murder charge in the 2020 killing, and has been in the juvenile detention center awaiting trial since he was 14, Vanore said.
CNN has contacted the Philadelphia Department of Human Services, which runs the juvenile justice center, for comment.

“We are looking in parking garages, which are very, very large – they’re multiple levels – just to see if he’s still in the area,” Vanore said. However, officials did not believe he was in the area of the hospital as of Wednesday afternoon, the deputy commissioner said.
No lockdown was in effect Wednesday in connection with the escape. But Pryor is considered dangerous, and the public should call 911 if he is seen, police said.
“Obviously we don’t want anyone to approach him,” Vanore said. “We’re hoping that if somebody sees an individual walking without a coat – because he doesn’t have one at this point – and a blue sweatsuit, they give us a call.”
In a phone interview Thursday afternoon, defense attorney Paul DiMaio told CNN his juvenile client has “always maintained his innocence” in the murder charges he’s facing.
“He said, ‘I didn’t do this,’ and he said it over and over again,” DiMaio said. “I have no idea why he ran.”
DiMaio told CNN neither he nor Pryor’s family have heard from Pryor since he escaped, but DiMaio said he thinks Pryor may have run because of a December court ruling that kept his murder case out of juvenile court.
“The only thing I can speculate is I know from talking to his mother and talking to him (that) he was really scared and really frustrated that the system kind of failed him (by trying him as an adult),” Pryor’s attorney said.
DiMaio said while he found Pryor to be “mild mannered” and not “dangerous,” he would still advise him to turn himself in. “It could be that this fear, this frustration might have driven him – with no one really watching him – to walk away,” he said.

LFD6FAL9Q9_LLTV3OHVG2G1VC0,"In blow to Fox Corp., judge rules Smartmatic case over 2020 election lies can proceed","By Marshall Cohen, CNN","4 minute read Published 7:05 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/24/media/fox-corporation-smartmatic/,"The voting technology company Smartmatic can move forward with its defamation lawsuit against Fox Corporation, a New York judge ruled Wednesday, dealing a blow to the parent company of Fox News, which is already fighting the massive lawsuit over its repeated airing of 2020 election lies.
The decision from Manhattan Supreme Court Judge David Cohen represents a significant setback to Fox’s corporate leadership, including the powerful Murdoch family, who will now face more scrutiny in the litigation. Cohen already let the case proceed against Fox News — and on Wednesday, he rejected a request by Fox Corporation to throw out the claims against the parent company.
The lawsuit was filed in the wake of the 2020 election, when Fox repeatedly gave airtime to far-right figures who promoted outrageous and debunked claims that Smartmatic rigged the presidential election by flipping millions of votes from Donald Trump to Joe Biden. They did this even though on-air anchors, top producers and executives privately admitted that the election wasn’t stolen.
The judge said Smartmatic’s case was strong enough to proceed against the parent company because it has “sufficiently alleged that (Fox) Corp. employees acted with malice by purposely and deliberating publishing knowingly false stories about (Smartmatic) in order to benefit (Fox) Corp.’s financial interest.”
Smartmatic has “sufficiently alleged in their amended complaint that (Fox) Corp. employees played an affirmative role in the publication of the defamation at issue,” Cohen concluded.
The parent corporation had argued that it shouldn’t be involved in the defamation case because it only had general oversight of Fox News itself. Further, Fox Corp. argued there wasn’t proof that any corporate employees “directed” the allegedly defamatory statements to be aired.
Fox denies defaming anyone and claims that the lawsuit is an assault on the First Amendment.
“We will be ready to defend this case surrounding extremely newsworthy events when it goes to trial, likely in 2025,” a Fox spokesperson said in a statement after the ruling. “As a report prepared by our financial expert shows, Smartmatic’s damages claims are implausible, disconnected from reality, and on their face intended to chill First Amendment freedoms.”
Smartmatic sued Fox News and its parent corporation in 2021 for defamation and is seeking more than $2 billion in damages. A New York appeals court previously dismissed the case against Fox Corp. but gave Smartmatic a chance to refile the allegations with more evidence. Cohen said Wednesday that the refiled claims against Fox Corp. are sufficient enough to move forward.
“We look forward to proceeding and holding Fox Corporation, as well as Fox News, responsible for the damage they did to Smartmatic,” the company’s lead attorney Erik Connolly said.
The case is still in the discovery phase, with some major depositions taking place in the past month, including former Fox Corporation chairman Rupert Murdoch.
The decision boosts Smartmatic’s case against the right-wing media behemoth. A similar 2020-related lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems was also allowed to proceed against Fox and its parent company. That case unearthed tranches of internal emails that described in devastating detail how top Fox officials cravenly allowed Trump allies like Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell to lie about the election on its shows.
The judge also on Wednesday gave Fox News a greenlight to continue its counterclaims against Smartmatic. The right-wing network is alleging that Smartmatic’s massive $2.7 billion request for damages is a legally baseless attempt to silence the network’s free-speech rights.
Fox filed its counterclaims against Smartmatic last year, in a bid to push back against the company and recover the money it’s spending on high-priced attorneys to defend itself.
“(Fox’s) argument here is that (Smartmatic’s) alleged damages are so extenuated from their actual lost profits that they were pleaded and/or sought in order to chill (Fox’s) free speech rights. That argument has not yet been adjudicated in any court,” Cohen said, paving the way for Fox to continue its fight against the $2.7 billion figure.
Smartmatic had asked Cohen to dismiss the counterclaims, on the basis that of Fox’s arguments were already shut down in Dominion’s similar defamation case that the right-wing network settled last year, and that they shouldn’t be relitigated now.
In the Smartmatic case, Fox has previously argued that the Florida-based voting company couldn’t have lost billions of dollars due to the airing of election lies because it was already unprofitable and scandal-plagued before anyone accused the company of rigging votes against Trump.
“While the recovery of fees and costs will not undo all the damage this First Amendment-defying lawsuit has wrought, at least it may cause the next plaintiff to think twice before trying to penalize the press to the tune of billions of dollars in non-existent damages for ensuring that the people can hear perspectives from all sides of the most pressing controversies of the day,” Fox wrote in a filing last year."
LIGC11IERJ_YHY5ZAXBASC7TOS,Biden campaign watching Nikki Haley’s New Hampshire performance closely,"By MJ Lee, Kevin Liptak and Arlette Saenz, CNN","5 minute read Published 5:00 AM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/23/politics/haley-biden-new-hampshire-trump/,"The unofficial start of the general election for President Joe Biden’s campaign could commence late Tuesday evening – but that all hinges on what kind of a night Nikki Haley has.
Following Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ suspension of his presidential campaign over the weekend, Haley now stands as the last remaining Republican attempting to dethrone Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential campaign. The Biden campaign is keenly aware that a strong showing for the former South Carolina governor Tuesday night could delay the informal start of the Biden-Trump match-up, which plenty of Biden campaign officials and allies are eager to kick off sooner rather than later.
The Biden campaign and the Democratic National Committee have been closely tracking the former South Carolina governor’s performance in the GOP race, following her ups and downs since she jumped into the contest almost a year ago to challenge her former boss.
As the Republican field began to narrow – and, in particular, as DeSantis’ political star seemed to fall in recent months – some Democrats close to the Biden campaign increasingly speculated that Haley appeared to be the sole candidate with anything resembling a realistic shot at defeating Trump.
Now, with only the former president and Haley competing in the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday, some Democrats are hoping Trump sews up the GOP presidential nomination sooner rather than later so the Biden campaign can fully turn its attention to the former president. Some polls have shown Haley with a more formidable edge against Biden in a general election that other Republican contenders, including Trump. Haley has sought to use that argument on the trail, claiming she’s best positioned to defeat the incumbent Democrat in November’s election.
“The sooner they can make it about Trump, and Nikki Haley falls away, that’s going to be a successful moment for the campaign,” said a senior Democrat in close touch with the campaign.
That desire to eliminate any ambiguity about who Biden’s general election rival is, is in no small part about trying to jolt voters whom the campaign says are still not paying close attention to the campaign. As CNN first reported earlier this month, the Biden campaign’s internal research shows that most of the undecided voters that the campaign is targeting – nearly three-in-four of them – do not appear to believe that Trump is likely to be the Republican presidential nominee. That biggest reason, they say: Voters are still not tuned in.
That would shift once the narrative becomes abundantly clear Trump is, in fact, the man for Biden to beat – even if that transition doesn’t happen overnight.
Officially, the Biden campaign says they remain ready to run against any GOP candidate – and that includes Haley, whose surrogates insist that New Hampshire is not a “must-win” state for her. Unlike running against Trump, campaign officials say, a Biden-Haley face-off would require the Biden reelection operation to freshly define the former United Nations ambassador.
At the top of their ammunition against Haley: Her staunchly anti-abortion views, and a bill she signed as governor that made it illegal for a woman in the state to obtain an abortion after their pregnancy reaches 20 weeks, without exceptions for rape and incest.
She has also sought to lump Biden and Trump together, telling CNN’s Dana Bash on Sunday that they were “equally bad.”
“If either one of them was good, I wouldn’t be running,” she said. “I don’t think we need to have two 80-year-olds sitting in the White House when we basically got to make sure that we can handle the war situation that we’re in. We need to know they’re at the top of their game.”
The Biden team is also closely watching how Haley’s performance plays in fundraising circles after these early contests. One Democratic source close to the campaign argued some donors looking for a GOP alternative to Trump could swing from Haley to Biden if the campaign heads towards a 2020 rematch, especially those nervous about what a second Trump term could look like.
“Nikki Haley might have survived the longest in this primary but not because she’s some kind of moderate,” one campaign official said.
One recent Haley flub has drawn the attention of Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. The two Democrats pushed back after the former South Carolina governor didn’t mention slavery as a cause of the Civil War.
“Let me be clear for those who don’t seem to know: Slavery was the cause of the Civil War,” Biden said speaking at Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, earlier this month. “There is no negotiation about that.”
For now, Biden is largely training his political fire on Trump, beginning with speeches at the start of the year casting his predecessor as a threat to democracy and, this week, accusing Trump of orchestrating the overturning of Roe v. Wade.
Online, most of his campaign’s attention has been focused on the former president rather than Haley – or before he dropped out, DeSantis. Rapid response accounts for the campaign and the DNC post clips in near real-time from Trump’s rallies, seeking to portray him as either extreme or incoherent.
There have been far fewer posts about Haley. In fact, Biden himself sought to amplify Haley’s criticisms over the weekend of Trump’s verbal flub confusing her and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi – one of the first times Biden’s own social media accounts have cast attention, however obliquely, on Trump’s mental fitness.
Toward the end of last year, Biden’s campaign had been criticized by some Democrats and allies of the president for not being forceful enough in going after Trump as it became increasingly clear he would be the GOP nominee.
Now, as Biden does ramp up his attacks, the challenge is in convincing voters to pay attention."
LIOXYTKOHK_5KCB9PSKPYQI9KQ,"Alabama inmate Kenneth Smith executed with nitrogen gas, marking the emergence of a wholly new method of capital punishment","By Dakin Andone, Isabel Rosales and Christina Maxouris, CNN","7 minute read Updated 12:47 AM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/25/us/kenneth-smith-nitrogen-gas-execution-alabama/,"Alabama on Thursday night executed Kenneth Smith, the first death row inmate known to die by nitrogen gas, marking the emergence of a wholly new method of execution in the United States that experts have said could lead to excessive pain or even torture.
Smith, who was sentenced to death for his role in a 1988 murder for hire, had survived the state’s initial attempt to execute him by lethal injection in 2022. Earlier Thursday, the US Supreme Court denied his last-minute appeal to halt the execution, after declining the same request on Wednesday.
Smith’s time of death was 8:25 p.m. local time, officials announced. In a news conference after the execution, Alabama Department of Corrections Commissioner John Hamm said nitrogen was running for about 15 minutes.
In a joint report, witnesses from the media said Smith made a lengthy statement before he died, saying, “Tonight Alabama caused humanity to take a step backward,” and adding, “I’m leaving with love, peace and light, thank you for supporting me, love all of you.”
Smith appeared conscious for “several minutes into the execution,” and for two minutes after that, he “shook and writhed on a gurney,” according to the media witness report. That was followed by several minutes of deep breathing before his breath began slowing “until it was no longer perceptible for media witnesses.”
When asked at the news conference about Smith shaking during the start of the execution, Hamm said Smith appeared to be holding his breath “for as long as he could” and may have also “struggled against his restraints.”
“There was some involuntary movement and some agonal breathing, so that was all expected and is in the side effects that we’ve seen and researched on nitrogen hypoxia,” Hamm added. “So nothing was out of the ordinary of what we were expecting.” Agonal breathing is usually described as a kind of gasping seen in people who are dying.
Another witness, Smith’s spiritual adviser who’d previously expressed concern that the method could be inhumane, described the death in more graphic terms, saying it was “the most horrible thing I’ve ever seen.”
Smith, wearing a mask through which the nitrogen was administered, convulsed when the gas was turned on, “popped up on the gurney” repeatedly, and gasped and heaved, the Rev. Jeff Hood said.
“An unbelievable evil was unleashed tonight,” Hood said.
One of the sons of the victim, Elizabeth Sennett, said Smith’s death got justice for his mother.
“Nothing happened here today that’s going to bring mom back. Nothing,” Mike Sennett said at the news conference. “We’re glad this day is over. All three of the people involved in this case years ago, we have forgiven them.”
“Kenneth Smith made some bad decisions 35 years ago, and his debt was paid tonight,” he said.
In a statement, Smith’s legal team said they were “deeply saddened” by his death, adding he had found and “sincerely practiced his faith,” had become sober and helped other inmates achieve sobriety, and had earned an associate’s degree.
“Nothing can undo the tragic consequences of the actions for which he was convicted, including the pain of the Sennett family and friends. Kenny’s life, however, should be considered in its full context,” the statement added.
Little is known about how the method of execution, known as nitrogen hypoxia, was carried out because the state’s published protocol bears redactions experts say shield key details from public scrutiny. The state, in court records, indicated the redactions were made to maintain security and it believes death by nitrogen gas to be “perhaps the most humane method of execution ever devised.”

But Smith and his team were skeptical. “The eyes of the world are on this impending moral apocalypse,” the inmate and his spiritual adviser, Hood﻿, said midday Thursday in a joint statement. “Our prayer is that people will not turn their heads. We simply cannot normalize the suffocation of each other.”
Elizabeth Sennett’s sons told CNN earlier Thursday they felt it was time for Smith’s sentence to be carried out, adding they believed their mother was forgotten because of the new execution method.
“It seems like a lot of the focus today is on Smith and his nitrogen, whatever, process,” Mike Sennett said. “And that’s kind of upset us a little bit.”
“What’s going on is overshadowing what’s actually happened,” his brother, Chuck Sennett, said. “He’s gotta pay the price for what he done to our mother,” who should be remembered “as a loving, caring woman.” The two brothers were in their 20s when their mother was killed.
Before his execution, Smith accepted a final meal of steak, hashbrowns and eggs, according to information released by the Alabama Department of Corrections.
The US Supreme Court first declined to intervene in Smith’s case on Wednesday after his attorneys tried to argue a second execution attempt would violate the US Constitution’s protection against cruel and unusual punishment.
A separate federal appeals court ruling on Wednesday evening also declined to halt the execution﻿. Smith’s team had again appealed Thursday morning to the Supreme Court.
State officials on Wednesday welcomed the high court’s rejection of Smith’s earlier request, framing it as an “attempt to bar the State from executing him by any method at all,” Attorney General Steve Marshall said in a statement.
Alabama “remains confident that the execution, and long-awaited justice, will proceed as planned,” he said.
Still, Smith’s advocates and critics of the state feared the nitrogen gas execution could go awry, pointing to its novel nature, questions around its shrouded protocol and Alabama’s recent struggles to carry out lethal injections.
In 2022 alone, the state carried out or attempted three executions in a row that critics deemed “botches,” meaning they deviated from the stated protocol. In two of the cases, the inmates – including Smith – survived as officials called off the executions because they could not set an intravenous line used to deliver the fatal drugs before the death warrants expired.
Alabama on Thursday used nitrogen hypoxia, a method it adopted in 2018. It is one of just three states, along with Oklahoma and Mississippi, that has approved the use of nitrogen for executions, though no other state has used it and only Alabama has a protocol.
﻿In theory, the method involves replacing the air breathed by an inmate with 100% nitrogen, depriving the body of oxygen. Its proponents contend the process will be painless, citing nitrogen’s role in deadly industrial accidents or suicides.
Others are skeptical, including a group of United Nations experts who this month voiced concern a nitrogen gas execution will “result in a painful and humiliating death,” with no scientific evidence to the contrary.
“It’s lunacy, absolute lunacy,” Smith’s spiritual adviser said before the execution.
“The process, obviously, is designed to execute Kenneth Smith,” Hood told CNN. “But the way that they’re constructing this, the way that they’re doing it, the way that they’re being silent, the way that they’re holding back information, yes, it’s incredibly concerning. And should be incredibly concerning for everybody in the room.”
Apart from the execution method, Smith’s life should be spared based on the previous, failed attempt to put him to death, said the founder and director of the Equal Justice Initiative, a non-profit opposed to excessive criminal punishment that advocates on behalf of death row inmates. The group has assisted Smith’s attorneys in the case.
“Since that time, we’ve been arguing that the state doesn’t have the competency to carry out these executions,” Bryan Stevenson told CNN on Thursday. “They switched the method, and now they’re saying they have the skill to carry out a method that’s untested and never been used before.”
Smith was convicted and sentenced to death for the murder of Sennett, whose husband, Charles, was having an affair and had taken out an insurance policy on his wife, according to court records.

Charles Sennett recruited a man who recruited two others, including Smith, and agreed to pay each $1,000 to kill his wife and make it look like she died in a burglary, the records show. The men carried out the killing as planned in March 1988, and Smith took from the Sennett home a VCR player that he stored in his own home.
Charles Sennett killed himself a week after the murder, records state, as the investigation’s focus turned to him. Smith was ultimately arrested after authorities, based on an anonymous tip, searched his home and found the VCR player.
Smith was convicted and sentenced to die, but an appeals court overturned the initial outcome and ordered a new trial. He was again convicted in the retrial, but this time his jury voted 11-1 for a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole.
The judge in Smith’s second trial, however, essentially vetoed the jury’s vote and sentenced the defendant to death – a practice known as judicial override that’s since been repealed in Alabama.

LLAZN7RH6G_CLUEUG4S4TSK4CF,Federal appeals court lets Trump gag order stand in federal January 6 case,"By Hannah Rabinowitz, Katelyn Polantz and Devan Cole, CNN","2 minute read Updated 2:19 PM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/23/politics/gag-order-trump-appeals-court-en-banc/,"The federal appeals court in Washington, DC, declined to rehear arguments over whether former President Donald Trump can be prohibited from talking about witnesses and court staff while he awaits trial in the special counsel’s January 6 criminal case.
Trump has unsuccessfully tried to challenge the gag order placed on him by Judge Tanya Chutkan late last year through appeals.
The 11 judges from the DC Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday declined to touch the case after a three-judge panel previously upheld the gag order against Trump. There were no statements or dissents made by any of the judges.
Trump can appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court, and his attorneys have previously indicated that they would appeal the matter to the nation’s highest court if necessary.
CNN has reached out to Trump’s legal team for comment.
In a unanimous decision issued last month, the three appellate judges said that Trump can be barred from talking about witnesses as well as prosecutors, the court staff and their family members.
But the court said the gag order does not apply to comments made about special counsel Jack Smith and narrowed the prohibition Trump had regarding speaking about witnesses in the case, a change from the original gag order.
The three judges on the panel — Patricia Millett, Nina Pillard and Bradley Garcia, all Democratic appointees — found Trump’s words on the public stage could undermine the fairness of a jury trial, sway or intimidate witnesses and imperil court staff. The court said that justifies limiting Trump’s speech, even while he campaigns to return to the presidency.
“Mr. Trump’s documented pattern of speech and its demonstrated real-time, real-world consequences pose a significant and imminent threat to the functioning of the criminal trial process in this case,” the appeals court wrote.

“We have removed this ad,” the Swedish fashion giant told CNN. “We are deeply sorry for the offense this has caused and we are looking into how we present campaigns going forward.”

The ad, screenshotted by a number of social media users before it was removed, featured two elementary schoolgirls dressed in school uniform, with the slogan “Make those heads turn in H&M’s Back to School fashion.”
It prompted a backlash on social media, where users called it “creepy,” “disturbing,” and recalled their own stories about “being ogled” while still at school.
Australian writer Melinda Tankard Reist, who says her work addresses sexualization and the harms of pornography, was among the first on social media to oppose the ad.
“What is your intention with this sponsored Facebook ad?” she posted on X, formerly known as Twitter.
“Little schoolgirls generally don’t want to ‘turn heads.’ The large numbers I engage with in schools want to be left alone to learn and have fun and not draw unwanted attention to their appearance.”"

Wreaths of smoke hung over the UN shelter, after a huge blaze broke out at the UNRWA Khan Younis Training Center, video obtained by CNN showed.
“Buildings ablaze and mass casualties. Safe access to and from the center has been denied for two days. People are trapped,” Thomas White, the director of UNRWA Affairs, said on X.
At least nine people were killed and another 75 injured, White said, adding that a team from his agency and the World Health Organization were trying to reach the site. He said the building shelters 800 people. UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini said on X that the entire Khan Younis Training Center, one of the largest UNRWA facilities in Gaza, was sheltering 30,000 people, and is clearly marked as a UN site.
In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had “currently” ruled out that the incident was “the result of an aerial or artillery strike by the IDF.”
It said a “thorough review of the operations of the forces in the vicinity is underway,” adding that it is “examining the possibility that the strike was a result of Hamas fire.”
In the past week, the IDF has intensified its offensive on Khan Younis, where medical facilities sheltering displaced civilians and health workers have been battered. The IDF maintains there are Hamas militants located in hospitals in the area. Relief agencies say the siege has blocked critical humanitarian operations.
The Israeli military launched its campaign in Gaza with the stated aim of eliminating Hamas, after more than 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 kidnapped during the militant group’s October 7 attacks on Israel, according to Israeli authorities.
Since then its bombardment and besiegement of the enclave has decimated swathes of the territory, diminishing food, fuel and water supplies and exposing more than 2.2 million civilians to starvation, dehydration and disease.
On Tuesday, UN Secretary-General António Guterres warned that Palestinians in Gaza “face inhumane, squalid conditions, struggling to simply make it through another day without proper shelter, heating, sanitary facilities, food and drinkable water.”
Israeli attacks on the Palestinian enclave have killed at least 25,700 people, and injured another 63,740, according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health in Gaza. CNN cannot independently verify the figures due to the difficulties of reporting from the war zone.
Palestinian health officials and paramedics have also reported Israeli tanks and attack drones firing at people trying to flee the vicinity of the Amal and Nasser hospitals in Khan Younis.
The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said Israeli forces have surrounded the Nasser Medical Complex, cutting off crucial medical, food, and fuel supplies.
“Hundreds of patients with infections and pregnant women are facing serious complications,” health ministry spokesperson Ashraf Al-Qudra said.
The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said Israeli forces are “surrounding” their headquarters and the Al-Amal Hospital and have enforced “restrictions on movement around both the building and the hospital”.
Six people were killed in attacks on Khan Younis on Wednesday, PRCS added, three of which had been “targeted” at the entrance of their headquarters.
Israeli tanks also surrounded the compound of the Al-Aqsa University in the city where thousands have been sheltering, Palestinian state news agency WAFA said. It said civilians had been targeted elsewhere in southern Gaza in the last 24 hours.
Four civilians, including a child, were killed in an Israeli attack on a “rest stop” in the coastal town of Al-Mawasi, and a man fleeing fighting in Khan Younis was struck in his car, reported WAFA.
Israeli forces conducted “numerous intense air raids, described as ‘fire belts’ to accompany its ground incursion, which has extended all the way to the west of Khan Younis,” a Geneva-based NGO advocating for human rights in the region, Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor, said on Wednesday
Euro-Med HR reported that shelters housing “tens of thousands” of displaced people in the western part of Khan Younis, and in Al-Mawasi, are under siege by the Israeli military.
The IDF said they continue to operate in Khan Younis, where they are pursuing “military targets, outposts, infrastructure and command and control centers,” and said the operation there will continue for “several days.”
“The brigade combat team is located around the [Khan Younis] camp, in the western part, and have begun to operate within it.  The manoeuvre will continue against military targets that are in the area, outposts, infrastructure, and command and control centers,” the IDF said.
“There is an area with shelters, there are several hospitals, several sensitive sites. We have seen terrorists use these sites. Almost a week ago we saw a launch from the Nasser Hospital, there are terrorists located in these hospitals.
“This operation will continue for several days until we maximize the achievements: dismantling Hamas’ military framework and Hamas strongholds, which we are required to thoroughly dismantle,” added the IDF.
CNN cannot independently verify operational details reported by the IDF. CNN has sought comment from the IDF on whether its forces have surrounded the Nasser and Amal hospitals.
As the IDF surrounded the city of Khan Younis, thousands of Palestinians moved south towards Rafah, near the border with Egypt, where 1.3 million people have been displaced, according to the UN.
A CNN video recorded on Monday shows displaced people sitting on the side of streets and in the vicinity of the seashore as they head west and south. The IDF instructed civilians to leave several districts in and around the city and head toward the coast, which it described to CNN as “safer.”
The video shows cars, trucks, and tractors transporting families and their essential belongings, such as blankets, mattresses and food. Many, however, were walking.
Hisham Sayegh said he saw four people killed, which forced him to leave with his family as shelling in the area intensifies.
“There are dead people on the ground. We left them behind. There are people killed inside the houses,” Sayegh said. “We were expecting to die at any minute.”
Jamal al Rozzi, an aid worker displaced near Khan Younis, said he was forced to flee to Rafah on Wednesday after heavy bombardment in the area.
“We had three horrible nights,” Al Rozzi, who is executive director of the National Society for Rehabilitation, told CNN in a voice message.
“We had to evacuate again … because the area where we were was under bombardment,” he said. “It was heavy bombardment and we were hardly safe there.”

LNVOCXANSS_QNT666KL9AD31GK,24 soldiers killed on deadliest day for Israeli forces in Gaza combat,"By Amir Tal and Richard Allen Greene, CNN","4 minute read Updated 4:16 PM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/23/middleeast/gaza-israeli-soldiers-deaths-intl-hnk/,"Twenty-four Israeli soldiers were killed during fighting in Gaza on Monday, the military said, in the deadliest day for its troops inside the battered enclave since the war with Hamas began.
Most of the soldiers – 21 – were killed in an attack in central Gaza “when a terrorist squad surprised our fighters and launched missiles and rockets,” said Daniel Hagari, spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).
That attack, which Hagari said happened several hundred meters from the eastern border, was the deadliest single incident for the IDF in Gaza since the ground invasion began on October 27. A further three Israeli soldiers - an IDF captain and two majors - were killed in a separate incident the same day, in southern Gaza.
The attack in central Gaza took place as the IDF soldiers were laying explosives to demolish “terror infrastructure and buildings,” according to Hagari.
A rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) hit one of the buildings and set off an explosion that led to its collapse.
“Most of our fighters died because of the collapse of that building,” Hagari said.
Another RPG hit a nearby IDF tank, killing the tank commander and another Israeli soldier, Hagari added.
On Monday, the Hamas-controlled health ministry in Gaza said the number of Palestinians killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since October 7 has risen to 25,295, with at least 63,000 injuries recorded.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is facing increasing political pressure on multiple fronts, said the deaths of the soldiers represented “one of the most difficult days since the outbreak of the war.”
“I mourn for our fallen heroic soldiers. I hug the families in their time of need and we all pray for the peace of our wounded,” Netanyahu said, adding that the IDF had launched an investigation into the incident.
The Israeli military’s large-scale bombing campaign in Gaza has been ongoing since the October 7 murder and kidnapping rampage by Hamas gunmen that saw some 1,200 people killed in Israel and more than 250 taken hostage. One hundred and thirty two hostages remain in Gaza. Of those, 104 are believed to still be alive.
The incidents in Gaza on Monday bring the number of Israeli soldiers killed since operations there began to 219.
The previous deadliest day for IDF soldiers in Gaza since the start of the conflict was October 31, when 16 Israeli troops died. That day also included the previous deadliest incident, which saw 11 troops killed in an armored personnel carrier.
In recent weeks, the Israeli military’s main focus has been in southern Gaza, with intense fighting around the city of Khan Younis.
The IDF said Tuesday that the city is now surrounded, while the Hamas-controlled Health Ministry says nearly 200 people have been killed in the past day.
In a statement Tuesday, the IDF said “dozens of terrorists” had been killed in the past 24 hours by IDF ground troops in coordination with the Israeli air force.
“Over the past day, IDF troops carried out an extensive operation during which they encircled Khan Younis and deepened the operation in the area. The area is a significant stronghold of Hamas’ Khan Younis Brigade,” the IDF said.
Hagari said Israeli soldiers continue to fight in Khan Younis, adding, “It’s a very complicated area – very crowded, with a lot of people living there.” One hundred Hamas fighters have been killed in the Khan Younis area within the last day, Hagari claimed.
A source familiar with the matter told CNN Monday that a major Israeli military offensive underway in western Khan Younis is expected to last several more days. The source said Israeli troops had encircled the Khan Younis refugee camp and were conducting raids to try and dismantle Hamas’s military capabilities in the area.
Medical facilities in the city have been battered amid an Israeli assault in the area Monday, Palestinian health officials said, as the number of people killed in Israel’s siege on Gaza continues to rise.
On Monday, the Hamas-controlled health ministry said Nasser Hospital is receiving more patients with serious injuries than it can accommodate and intensive care units have reached capacity.
This month, Israeli officials said its military will shift toward a new, less intense phase of operations in Gaza, but a humanitarian crisis in the enclave continues to deepen.
Netanyahu is facing mounting pressure both on the state of the conflict at present and on what Gaza will look like once the fighting ends.
The Israeli prime minister is being pushed by the international community – including the US, Israel’s most important ally – to allow the creation of a viable Palestinian state. Domestically, he is being pressured to guarantee Israel’s security, most notably from far-right members of his coalition.
He has also faced growing criticism inside Israel for so far failing to secure the release of all the hostages taken by Hamas during their October 7 attack.
Israel has offered a two-month ceasefire to Hamas as part of a prospective hostage deal, Axios reported Monday, citing two unnamed Israeli officials. Israeli officials are optimistic about Hamas’ response to that proposed deal, CNN foreign policy analyst Barak Ravid told CNN on Monday.

LS0AU51P03_PCGN4BYKH3JY64L,Martin Scorsese and John Williams just made Oscars history,"By Lisa Respers France, CNN","2 minute read Updated 11:45 AM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/23/entertainment/martin-scorsese-john-williams-oscars/,"Someone forgot to tell Martin Scorsese and John Williams about the often complained issue of ageism in Hollywood.
The famed director and composer both broke new Oscar records Tuesday, when the nominees for the 96th Academy Awards were revealed.
With his nomination for best director for “Killers of the Flower Moon,” 81-year-old Scorsese became the oldest nominee in the category that had previously been held by John Huston, who was 79 when he was nominated for “Prizzi’s Honor” in 1985.
It was Scorsese’s tenth nomination in that category, which puts him two behind current record-holder William Wyler, who had 12 best director nominations prior to his death in 1981.
“It’s deeply gratifying to receive this recognition from the Academy, for myself and for so many of my collaborators on ‘Killers of the Flower Moon,’” Scorsese said in a statement to CNN.
“It was a remarkable experience to make this picture, to work together with the Osage community to tell the story of a genuine American tragedy, hidden in the shadows of official culture for far too long,” the director added. “I only wish that Robbie Robertson had lived to see his work recognized—our many years of friendship and Robbie’s growing consciousness of his own Native heritage played a crucial role in my desire to get this film onscreen.”
Robertson, co-founder of The Band, who collaborated as a composer of several films with Scorsese, including “Killers of the Flower Moon,” died in August at the age of 80.
“Killers of the Flower Moon” notched 10 total nominations, including best picture, best actress in a leading role for Lily Gladstone, best actor in a supporting role for frequent Scorsese collaborator Robert De Niro, and best original score.
In that last category, Scorsese’s project is up against another record holder.
Legendary composer John Williams’ work on “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” earned him his 49th Oscar nomination for original score. With a total of 54 career Oscar nominations when including original song, Williams has more Academy Award nominations than any living person.
According to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences that is responsible for the awards show, the late Walt Disney held the overall record with 59 total Oscar nominations.
The Academy also noted that at the age of 91, Williams, who is best known for his work on the “Star Wars” franchise, is the oldest nominee in a competitive award category."

The views expressed in this commentary are her own. Read more opinion on CNN.
It’s Oscars season and “Barbie” is dominating the discourse.
Since the nominations were announced on Tuesday, fans of Greta Gerwig’s pink-tinged fantasy have been taking to social media to make it clear that they’re not happy that Gerwig and star Margot Robbie didn’t bag nominations for their respective categories in best director and best actress (though both did receive nominations, Robbie as a producer and Gerwig for best adapted screenplay).
The outrage at their perceived omissions is so widespread that even former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has weighed in. Many feel that the fact that Ryan Gosling is nominated for best supporting actor for his performance as Ken, Barbie’s lovable-but-dim boyfriend, is reflective of the patriarchal power of the world that the film supposedly rallies against.
But here’s the thing; “Barbie” is neither smart enough nor interesting enough to be inspiring this level of uproar. When I first heard about “Barbie,” I thought I would like it. I’m a huge fan of Gerwig’s other work, especially “Frances Ha” and “Little Women,” the latter of which I am convinced is the greatest example of a perfect filmic adaptation of a book (and for which Gerwig received a nomination for best adapted screenplay, though notably not for best director).
Related article Opinion: Why the ‘Barbie’ Oscars snubs are so enraging
Of “Barbie,” I thought it might be, if nothing else, a fun time at the movies. What I found, instead, was a deeply disappointing blockbuster that offered audiences a watered-down version of feminism and which often felt like a vehicle for multimillion dollar toy company Mattel to poke fun at itself whilst using the movie as a shield from real criticism. (The distributor of “Barbie” and CNN share a parent company).
There is nothing radical about the feminism that “Barbie” puts forward. In fact, I feel that it actually lets patriarchy off the hook far too easily by suggesting – through the proxy of Ken – that men’s misogyny comes from a place of idiocy rather than malice. By depicting Ken as a dumb, hapless figure, “Barbie” makes misogyny a laughing matter, instead of what it often is – a matter of life and death for women.
“Barbie” functions only as a palatable crowd-pleaser and not as an intelligent critique of sexism. In the film, audiences have a laugh at bumbling Mattel executives. But the company will continue to make a fortune from a doll that, at least at its inception, helped to uphold unrealistic beauty standards for a generation of girls and women.
Related article Opinion: ‘Origin’ brilliantly exposes America’s caste system. Here’s how we tear it down
It’s also important to remember that “Barbie” has most certainly not been ignored by the Academy Awards’ members. It has eight nominations – which is far more than many of 2023’s other women-directed films got. While “Barbie” achieved cultural phenomenon status last year, other films that took a more complicated approach to womanhood were shut out of the Oscars and the mainstream awards circuit completely.
Sofia Coppola’s “Priscilla” – a claustrophobic portrait of Priscilla Presley’s marriage to Elvis – and Molly Manning Walker’s “How to Have Sex” – a devastating story of a girls’ vacation that ends in tears – received no attention from the Academy. Nor did Ava DuVernay’s groundbreaking film “Origin.” All offer far more fascinating explorations of women’s lives and interior thoughts than “Barbie,” and all are defined by their exceptional direction and their standout performances by two rising stars in Cailee Spaeny and Mia Mckenna-Bruce, as well as veteran Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor.
“Origin” is a fascinating work inspired by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Isabel Wilkerson’s book, “Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents.” “Priscilla” was directed by one of the most famous and accomplished female directors of the 21st century and “How to Have Sex” won the prestigious prize of “Un Certain Regard” at the Cannes Film Festival.  Yet all were totally overlooked by the Oscars.
Related article Opinion: The moment ‘Priscilla’ became a horror movie for me
And, ironically, the discourse swirling around Gerwig and Robbie’s supposed lack of recognition has overshadowed a truly historic moment. Lily Gladstone is up for best actress for her role in the Martin Scorsese epic “Killers of the Flower Moon” – making her the first Native woman of American descent to be nominated in the category.
Yet, in most conversations about the Oscars in recent days, Gladstone’s achievement has become something of a footnote. Energy that could be better expended by highlighting the watershed moment for Gladstone and for Native women of American descent has instead been poured into indignation over Gerwig and Robbie missing out.
As for the categories that Robbie and Gerwig were not considered for, I don’t think it’s unfair to argue that they might’ve not landed the nominations because neither have put forward their best work here. Gerwig’s direction in “Barbie” is grand in scope, no doubt, but it’s her impeccably observed depiction of a strained mother-daughter relationship in 2017’s “Lady Bird” that broke my heart and cemented her as an astute filmmaker.

Robbie does a fine job as the titular doll in “Barbie,” but she is far more affecting in the few minutes of screentime she has in Wes Anderson’s recent “Asteroid City” and far funnier in “The Wolf of Wall Street” – where her excellent comedic timing comes across much better than it does in the hollow world of “Barbie.”
With just over a month to go before the ceremony itself, don’t expect the furor over “Barbie” to go away anytime soon. But while some of its fans flood the internet with anger, it might be worth seeking out some of 2023’s other female-directed films, from A.V. Rockwell’s “A Thousand and One” to “Priscilla” and “Origin” and “How To Have Sex,” all of which offer far more nuanced and complex studies of women and all of which haven’t had so much as a whiff of winning a seat at the Oscars’ table."
LYCCSSS4DW_1O8QJ2BGRG9ZZJE,UN agency fires staff members allegedly involved in October 7 attacks,"By Hira Humayun, CNN","4 minute read Updated 3:15 PM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/26/middleeast/unrwa-fires-staff-members-october-7-attacks-intl/,"The UN relief agency operating in Gaza said Friday that Israel had accused some of its staff of being involved in the October 7 attacks, and that their contracts would be “immediately” terminated.
The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNWRA) Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini said Israeli authorities provided the agency “with information” alleging several of its employees participated in Hamas’ murderous rampage into southern Israel, when the militant group killed at least 1,200 people and abducted more than 250 others.
An investigation is being launched into the alleged involvement of the employees and those involved will be held accountable “including through criminal prosecution,” added Lazzarini. The commissioner-general said he made the decision in order to protect the agency’s ability to deliver humanitarian aid.
Israeli Foreign Ministry told CNN on Friday that it welcomed the investigation. “It is important that UNRWA conduct a thorough in-house check on the activity of Hamas and other terrorist factors in its ranks in order to ensure the organization’s humanitarian activity is not taken advantage of,” it said.
The news came hours after the UN’s top court ordered Israel to act immediately to prevent genocide in Gaza but stopped short of calling for a ceasefire, in a ruling that was largely welcomed by the three main parties involved.

In the wake of the allegations against UNRWA, the US State Department announced it had “temporarily paused additional funding” to the agency – a move praised by Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to “emphasize the necessity of a thorough and swift investigation of this matter,” State Department spokesperson Matt Miller said in a statement on Friday.
The US has contacted the Israeli government for more details on the allegations, added Miller. They have also briefed member of Congress.
CNN has reached out to UNRWA and the Israeli authorities about the information Israel provided UNRWA and the nature of the alleged involvement of the UNRWA employees.
“These shocking allegations come as more than 2 million people in Gaza depend on lifesaving assistance that the Agency has been providing since the war began,” said Lazzarini. “Anyone who betrays the fundamental values of the United Nations also betrays those whom we serve in Gaza, across the region and elsewhere around the world”.
On Friday, Republican US Senator Jim Risch, ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, described the allegations as “unconscionable.”
“For years, I have warned the Biden Administration about resuming funding to UNRWA, which has a history of employing people connected to terrorist movements like Hamas. Today’s news is yet another example that underscores how corrupt this organization truly is.”
CNN cannot independently verify the allegations.
Israel’s relations with the UN have deteriorated in recent months, after the organization’s senior officials repeatedly condemned the country’s military approach to the war in Gaza.
In December, Israeli diplomats lashed out when UN Secretary-General António Guterres invoked a rarely used but powerful tool in his determined push for a ceasefire. At the time, Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen said the UN chief’s tenure was “a danger to world peace” and that his call for a ceasefire in Gaza amounted to supporting Hamas and the October 7 attack.
As Israel’s offensive enters its fourth month, entire neighborhoods in Gaza have been wiped out, critical supplies are dwindling and more than 2.2 million people face starvation, dehydration and deadly disease. At least 1.7 million Palestinians have been internally displaced, many of them multiple times, according to the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
Meanwhile, a growing chorus of world leaders have warned against the mounting Palestinian death toll. Israeli attacks on Gaza have killed at least 26,083 people, the vast majority of whom are women, children and the elderly, according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health. CNN cannot independently verify the figures due to the difficulties of reporting from the war zone.

M0B9F03JU8_5FLLJ6EOEMGRG85,Keep an eye on the sky for January’s full ‘wolf moon’,"By Ashley Strickland, CNN","4 minute read Updated 3:19 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/25/world/january-full-wolf-moon-scn/,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.
The first full moon of the new year, known as the wolf moon, will shine in the night sky Thursday.
January’s full moon reached peak illumination at 12:54 p.m. ET, but it will appear full through Friday evening, according to NASA.
Expect the bright orb to rise in the east around sunset Thursday and appear just about overhead around midnight, according to EarthSky.
Between Thursday evening and Friday morning, the full moon will be close to the bright star Pollux. The star will appear to rotate clockwise around the moon overnight, according to NASA.
January’s full moon is commonly called the wolf moon because wolves are active this time of year and can be heard howling on cold nights, according to the Old Farmer’s Almanac. The origin of the name stems from the Sioux language, which describes this moon as “wolves run together.”
But this wintry full moon also goes by many other monikers according to different Native American tribes: It’s known as the cold moon to the Cherokee people, the hard moon to the Lakota and the whirling wind moon to the Passamaquoddy tribe.
The full moon will be visible around the world, weather permitting, so bundle up to stay warm and enjoy the view. Here are other celestial events to look forward to this year.
Of the 12 full moons in 2024, September and October’s lunar events will be considered supermoons, according to EarthSky.
Definitions of a supermoon can vary, but the term generally denotes a full moon that is closer to Earth than normal and thus appears larger and brighter in the night sky. Some astronomers say the phenomenon occurs when the moon is within 90% of perigee — its closest approach to Earth in orbit.
Here are the remaining full moons of 2024:
February 24: Snow moon
March 25: Worm moon
April 23: Pink moon
May 23: Flower moon
June 21: Strawberry moon
July 21: Buck moon
August 19: Sturgeon moon
September 17: Harvest moon
October 17: Hunter’s moon
November 15: Beaver moon
December 15: Cold moon
Multiple eclipses will occur in 2024, including two types of lunar eclipses and two types of solar eclipses, according to the Old Farmer’s Almanac.
The most highly anticipated of these events is the total solar eclipse occurring on April 8, which will be visible to those in Mexico, the United States and Canada. A total solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between Earth and the sun, completely blocking the golden orb’s face.
Those within the path of totality, or locations where the moon’s shadow will completely cover the sun, will see a total solar eclipse.People outside the path of totality will still be able to see a partial solar eclipse, in which the moon only obscures part of the sun’s face.
A total solar eclipse won’t be visible across the contiguous US again until August 2044.
An annular solar eclipse will occur in the sky on October 2 over parts of South America. This type of eclipse is similar to a total solar eclipse, except the moon is at the farthest point in its orbit from Earth, so it can’t completely block the sun. Instead, annular solar eclipses create a “ring of fire” in the sky as the sun’s fiery light surrounds the moon’s shadow.

Meanwhile, a penumbral lunar eclipse will be visible to many across Europe, North and East Asia, Australia, Africa, North America, and South America between March 24 and 25.
A lunar eclipse, which causes the moon to look dark or dimmed, occurs when the sun, Earth and moon align so that the moon passes into Earth’s shadow. A penumbral lunar eclipse is more subtle and happens when the moon moves through the outer shadow, or penumbra, of Earth.
A partial lunar eclipse, in which Earth moves between the sun and the full moon without being perfectly aligned, will appear over Europe and much of Asia, Africa, North America and South America between September 17 and 18.
Check Time and Date’s website to see when each of these eclipses will appear.
Sky-gazers can look forward to a multitude of meteor showers this year, according to the American Meteor Society. Here are the dates when meteor events are expected to peak this year.

M29LU9KBFF_AMJUK8C94L6AHH5,Georgia state Senate approves special committee investigation into Fani Willis,"By Shirin Faqiri, CNN","2 minute read Published 1:49 PM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/26/politics/fani-willis-nathan-wade-georgia-state-senate-investigation/,"The Georgia state Senate on Friday passed a resolution creating a special committee to investigate Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis amid allegations of an improper affair with her lead prosecutor in the 2020 election subversion case against former President Donald Trump.
The resolution, which cleared the GOP-controlled state Senate 30-19, allows the special committee to subpoena people and evidence while putting witnesses under oath for their testimonies. At the end of its investigation, the committee will submit a report “that will recommend any changes to either legislation or appropriations,” according to state Sen. Greg Dolezal, who introduced the resolution.
“This resolution is about an officer of the state of Georgia, within a subdivision of the state of Georgia, and how they are using state funds,” Dolezal said on the Senate floor. “This falls squarely within what we should be talking about and what we should be addressing.”
The allegations against Willis and Nathan Wade first surfaced in a 127-page court filing earlier this month by former Trump 2020 campaign official Mike Roman, who was indicted over his role in the fake electors plot in Georgia.
Roman alleges that Wade is romantically involved with Willis and used money he billed the district attorney’s office for his work on the case to take her on lavish vacations.
Willis and Wade have not directly addressed the accusations, and the Fulton County district attorney’s office has not yet commented on the allegations specifically. The judge overseeing the case against Trump has given Willis until the end of next week to reply in writing to the allegations to the court.
In comments Willis made at Atlanta’s Big Bethel A.M.E. Church earlier this month, the DA defended her team of prosecutors in the case, calling into question why only one of the three prosecutors was being attacked.
“Is it that some will never see a Black man as qualified – no matter his achievements? What more can one achieve? The other two have never been judges, but no one questions their credentials,” Willis remarked.
The situation brings yet another twist in the multiyear effort to punish those involved in attempting to subvert the 2020 presidential election won by Joe Biden.
Legally, it is unlikely to kill the case, but this could be a big political gift to Trump, who is seeking to discredit the Georgia charges as illegitimate and politically motivated."
M4OFFZ5JXI_QT8OU75Y4ETSUFL,"Former officer who shot and killed Patrick Lyoya can stand trial for murder, appeals court says","By Chris Boyette, CNN","2 minute read Updated 2:02 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/25/us/patrick-lyoya-death-michigan-police-officer/,"The former police officer who shot and killed Patrick Lyoya, a Black man from Michigan, can stand trial for murder, an appeals court ruled Thursday.
The Michigan Court of Appeals handed down a 2-1 ruling Thursday, denying an appeal by former Grand Rapids police officer Christopher Schurr.
“We agree that there is at least sufficient evidence presented at the preliminary examination to establish probable cause that defendant’s actions did not satisfy the standards for use of deadly force in self-defense,” the opinion said.
Schurr appealed after a district court judge ruled in October 2022 that he should stand trial for one count of second-degree murder. Schurr, who pleaded not guilty, was fired days after being charged in June 2022.
Lyoya was shot to death in April 2022 by Schurr, a White police officer trying to arrest him after a traffic stop in Grand Rapids. Schurr and Lyoya had struggled over the officer’s Taser, and after Lyoya gained control of the weapon, Schurr shot Lyoya in the back of the head as Lyoya was on the ground, authorities said.
The case drew national attention because of the moments leading to the shooting and the multiple videos that show Lyoya’s final moments.
The court acknowledged that it is “uncontested” that Schurr shot and killed Lyoya during a struggle while trying to arrest him and that Lyoya did not follow Schurr’s instructions and attempted to escape. But it rejected Schurr’s arguments the lower court erred by denying his justification of use of force and self-defense.
“Defendant’s argument on its face would suggest that whenever a police officer is met with force in making an arrest, the officer is always justified in using force, including deadly force, in order effectuate an arrest. We reject this blanket rule, concluding that use-of-force in making an arrest is more nuanced than defendant’s brief suggests,” the opinion said.
The appeals court agreed with the district court, which found there “was evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that self-defense did not justify defendant’s actions.”
Schurr’s attorney, Matthew Borgula, said in a statement they are “considering our options going forward” and may appeal.
“We respectfully disagree with the majority opinion that there was sufficient evidence to bind the case over for trial, given that it is undisputed that Mr. Lyoya had disarmed Officer Schurr of his taser, which at least one of the judges held was a dangerous weapon as a matter of law,” Borgula said.

M64KLB55XV_QWM3EGSY879PGMR,Biden to host Japanese PM for official state visit in April,"By Donald Judd, Betsy Klein and Shania Shelton, CNN","3 minute read Published 1:17 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/25/politics/biden-japanese-prime-minister-state-visit/,"President Joe Biden and first lady Dr. Jill Biden will host Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and his wife, Yuko Kishida, at the White House this April for an official state visit and state dinner, the White House announced Thursday.
“The visit will underscore the enduring strength of our alliance partnership, the unwavering U.S. commitment to Japan, and Japan’s increasing global leadership role,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement announcing the visit.
Jean-Pierre said Biden and Kishida will discuss “efforts to strengthen our political, security, economic, and people-to-people ties so that our alliance is postured to address evolving challenges and advance our shared vision for a free, open, secure, and prosperous Indo-Pacific region and world.”
The two leaders last met one-one-one during November’s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in San Francisco, building on a historic trilateral summit with South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol in August.
“This will obviously underscore the importance of our alliance with Japan and our bilateral relationship, and also all the work we’re doing together to improve and strengthen, not only our bilateral cooperation but our cooperation with Japan and other allies across the Indo-Pacific, really trying to pursue a safe and secure, prosperous Indo Pacific,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters on Air Force One Thursday.
April’s state dinner will mark the fifth state dinner of the Biden administration, an opportunity for the White House to treat the visiting country’s leader to pomp and circumstance with fine attention to diplomatic details.
Biden welcomed Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese for a state dinner in October as the crisis in the Middle East was increasingly becoming an all-consuming focus for the president and his team.
He invited Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the White House in June for a state visit in an era of growing tensions between the US and China and as India surpassed China to become the most populous country on Earth.
The president has also previously hosted French President Emmanuel Macron and South Korea’s Yoon.
The visit points to the administration’s continued engagement with Indo-Pacific nations as it seeks to counter China’s influence in the region.
Biden has visited Japan twice as president. He met in May with Kishida during a visit to Japan on the eve of the G7 Summit in Hiroshima, emphasizing close US-Japan relations at a time of China’s growing military and economic ambitions, as well as Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine.
Biden, who is the second US president to visit Hiroshima, pointed to deepening cooperation between the US and Japan on emerging technologies, including new partnerships on quantum computing and semiconductors.
He made his first presidential visit to Asia in 2022, where he met with Kishida, along with the leaders of India and Australia, and used Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to send a message to China that the US would be willing to respond militarily if the country invades the self-governing island of Taiwan."
M74BYZNKXH_C4Y7SZRW6KBBQGN,Russia’s relentless ‘meat assaults’ are wearing down outmanned and outgunned Ukrainian forces,"By Joseph Ataman, Frederik Pleitgen and Daria Tarasova-Markina, CNN","7 minute read Updated 3:54 AM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/23/europe/ukraine-weapons-avdiivka-russian-assault-intl-cmd/,"Straddling the frontlines, the small town of Avdiivka has become the epicenter of the war in Ukraine. Still in Ukrainian hands – just – it’s enclosed on three sides by Russian troops and cannons.
Pounded by the Russians, the town itself is unrecognizable.
Concrete carcasses mark what were once the town’s tallest buildings, seemingly floating amid small hills of rubble. The cross atop the town’s church﻿, bent double by an explosion, points accusatorially at the Russian lines.
Amid the ruins, Russian and Ukrainian troops clash, preyed upon by drones and the occasional tank. Casualties are heavy on both sides but especially among the Russian attackers, who have thrown wave after human wave against the entrenched defenders.
“Meat assaults” is how one Ukrainian sniper, “Bess,” described these attacks to CNN. His callsign means demon in Ukrainian and the scene he recounts is hellish. The dead soldiers, “just lie there frozen,” the Omega Special Forces Group officer said from a house several miles behind the frontline in eastern Ukraine’s Donetsk region.
“Nobody evacuates them, nobody takes them away,” he said. “It feels like people don’t have a specific task, they just go and die.”
“Teren,” the commander of a Ukrainian drone reconnaissance unit in the town, said that even “if we can kill 40 to 70 servicemen with drones in a day, the next day they renew their forces and continue to attack.”
In 18 months of fighting around the town, he said, his pilots from the 110th Mechanized Brigade have killed at least 1,500 Russians. Still, they keep coming.
Ukrainian casualties are a closely guarded secret, but the battle has turned into an attritional slog, matching seemingly chaotic Russian attacks against the limited, but determined, resources and manpower of the Ukrainians.
In a surprise trip to Avdiivka in late December, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky described the battle for the town as an “onslaught,” adding that the battle could in many ways “determine the overall course of the war.”
Ukraine’s leaders appear conscious of the criticisms around the defense - but subsequent fall - of Bakhmut in 2023, acknowledging the obvious tensions between holding on to locations without huge strategic significance and protecting the lives of soldiers.
“Every piece of our land is precious to us,” army chief Valery Zaluzhny said, but in Avdiivka, “there is no need to do anything remotely reminiscent of a show.”
But those lives depend on weapons and arms.
On an ice-bitten January morning, the mercury idling at -22 degrees Celsius (-7.6 Fahrenheit), CNN watched another team of Omega special forces troops race to their firing position around Avdiivka.
Rushing to set up their Soviet﻿-era rocket launcher – bolted on to the back of an American pick-up - one of the men flicked the switch to launch a salvo.
Clicks – and curses – followed. Frozen solid, the rockets wouldn’t fire.
Reliant on the kit they have, not the Western hardware they crave, they know that each lost chance to fire back at Russians may cost Ukrainian lives.
A few days later, a supply truck chewed through the mud of a field around the nearby town of Marinka, bringing much-needed shells to a gun position.
But the cannon – a US-supplied M777 howitzer – is silent for much of the day, rationed to around 20 shells a day, 30 on a “good day” the gunners said. Last summer, supporting Ukraine’s failed counteroffensive, the gun crew would fire at least twice as many foreign rounds, many American-made, at the Russians, they said.
And in an artillery position 90 minutes north of Avdiivka, around the town of Bakhmut, that CNN visited, the ammunition compartment of a US-supplied Paladin howitzer sat cavernously empty. The crew had no shells to fire at all.
A delivery later in the day brought four shells but nothing that would do the Russians much harm: they were only smoke shells.
“Every shell that is suitable for the Paladin we use,” the gun commander “Skyba” told CNN, “It’s better than no shells.”
“10 to 1” is the difference between Russian and Ukrainian artillery supplies, the artillery commander in Ukraine’s 93rd mechanized Brigade told CNN.
“They use old Soviet systems,” Korsar said, “but Soviet systems can still kill.”
However, US support to Ukraine – including much-needed shells - no longer seems assured. Future aid packages are still mired in Capitol Hill squabbling, and the specter of a possible Ukraine-aid-averse Trump presidency on the horizon adds further uncertainty.
US National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby put it plainly this month: “The assistance that we provided has now ground to a halt. The attacks that the Russians are conducting are only increasing.”
But when they can put their Western weapons to use, the Ukrainians have much more to celebrate in Avdiivka.
The tip of the spear during last year’s ill-fated Ukrainian counteroffensive, the Bradley Fighting Vehicle - gifted to Ukraine by the US and designed to support infantry - is reinforcing its reputation blunting waves of Russian attacks.
Without the Bradley, “I doubt that we would be here talking with you,” crew commander “Barbie” told CNN from behind the Avdiivka frontline.
“The vehicle is a tough one,” he said. “It’s not afraid of anything.”
In video provided to CNN by another Bradley unit in the 47th mechanized brigade, a US-trained crew take on a Russian T-90 tank – one of the most powerful in Moscow’s army. Their fire disables the tank, its turret spinning uncontrollably, before an exploding drone slams into its side.
But the US-made Bradleys are in limited supply along the front.
Some 200 Bradleys were promised by the US and dozens have been damaged and destroyed in battle. Some of these will likely have been repaired and sent back to the frontlines.
Ukrainian crews, although admirers of the Bradley’s power, have also criticized its ability to weather the harsh Ukrainian winter and the state of some of the older vehicles shipped by the US.

Ukraine’s lack of firepower compared to its adversary is a common theme on the front line. “Teren” the commander of a nearby drone reconnaissance unit, said outright that Ukraine doesn’t have enough arms and equipment to win against Russia.
The Ukrainians are forced to be better pilots and more inventive with their limited resources, he said.
“At the beginning of the war, their advantage in drones was 10 times greater than ours,” he said. “At the moment, I think we are a worthy opponent in the drone format. We cover the sky around the clock.”
Observing their hunt for Russian troops from the unit’s command post, CNN saw multiple drones from his unit circling one Russian foxhole.
The powerful cameras on one drone caught two Russian soldiers desperately take aim at a weaving suicide drone, the smoke from their rifles and cigarettes billowing into the cold air. The Ukrainian drone dives into the narrow dugout behind them and explodes.
CNN does not know the fate of the men, but drone pilots in the area told CNN that they were unlikely to have survived given the number of drone units operating in the area.
Still, the Russian assaults continue, meaning holding Avdiivka is now a matter of numbers, said “Bess,” the special forces sniper.
“If there is a liter bottle, there’s no way you can fit a liter and a half in it,” he said.
To balance Russia’s superior numbers, Ukraine’s leadership – under pressure from the country’s top generals - is weighing a possible half a million extra troops to bolster the military’s ranks.
Life in Ukrainian cities away from the front appears relatively untouched by the fighting, at least on the surface. Although recruitment posters and military checkpoints dot highways and men in uniform are a regular sight, there’s little overt sign of wartime restrictions or changes to daily life. Supermarkets are full and cafes brim with customers.

But conscription is a touchy subject.
The Ukrainian president does have the power to enforce further mobilization – currently limited to those aged over 27 – but has chosen to seek parliamentary approval for it. The bill is slowly – and not without difficulty - making its way through lawmakers﻿’ scrutiny.
Zelensky has also questioned how to pay for the mobilization, with six taxpayers required to pay for the salary of each soldier in uniform, he said.
His reticence is a sign of the political sensitivities around public opinion in Ukraine, even as the country’s enemies make no secret of their violent ambitions for Kyiv.
“The existence of Ukraine is deadly for Ukrainians,” Russia’s former President Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council and one of the most hawkish Russian politicians, posted on Telegram on January 17.
“Why? The existence of an independent state on the historical Russian territories will now be a constant pretext for the resumption of combat actions,” he continued.
Back on the front line, morale among the troops with whom CNN spoke was high.
The soldiers, tired though rarely disgruntled, acknowledged that reinforcements would provide a welcome increase in their rotations off the front line.
For now, though, that remains a distant hope, as in Avdiivka the fight rages on.
“We are doing everything possible and impossible to hold this line,” Omega Special Forces officer “Sayer” told CNN.
“I don’t know what will happen next,” he said. “But Avdiivka is holding on. We are on our land. We have nothing to lose.”"

Romeo Nance, 23, was found Monday by US Marshals near Natalia, Texas – more than 1,000 miles from where seven victims were found shot to death Sunday in two homes in the south Chicago suburb of Joliet, according to the Joliet Police Department. Authorities believe Nance is also linked to a Sunday shooting in Will County, Illinois, that left a 28-year-old dead, Joliet Police Chief Bill Evans said Monday.
Nance shot himself with a handgun after being confronted by officials, police said.
Investigators have yet to determine Nance’s motive, but Nance was related to “if not all, a vast majority of the people” found dead in the homes, Evans said during a Tuesday news conference.
The victims have not been publicly identified. They range in age from 14 to 47 years old, Evans said.
In one residence, authorities found the bodies of two girls, aged 14 and 16, two women, aged 20 and 38, and a 38-year-old man, according to Evans. In the other residence, a 47-year-old woman and a 35-year-old man were found dead.
At a separate scene in Will County, deputies found a person “with blood coming out of his head, and upon deputy’s arrival, they located a gunshot wound,” Will County Sheriff’s Office Deputy Chief of Operations Dan Jungles said.
Jungles said the eighth victim, 28-year-old Toyosi Bakare, was taken to a hospital and died of his injuries. Bakare was from Nigeria and had been living in Will County, which includes Joliet, for three years, Jungles said.
“It is believed that the weapon used in this incident was a 9-millimeter handgun,” Jungles said in Tuesday’s news conference. He added robbery was not a motive as money was found in the area near where Bakare was located.
Nance’s car – a red Toyota Camry – was seen at the scene and the sheriff’s department began to surveil Nance’s last-known address, hoping to find the vehicle, Jungles said.
After no sign of Nance or his car, deputies knocked on the door of a home, but received no response, Jungle said at a news conference.
“When they received no response, they knew the house across the street was related to the individuals that resided at that house and they walked over there,” Jungle said.
At the second home, deputies saw blood on the door and entered to find two dead victims, he said. Five more victims were found in the first home, though it is unclear how long they had been dead, he said.
“I’ve been a policeman 29 years. This is probably the worst crime scene I’ve ever been associated with,” Evans said at the news conference.
Nance is also believed to be connected to another shooting on Sunday, according to authorities.

MC82U48LI7_ZVUYZUB8ESP5GLH,Second gentleman reflects on the personal toll of his work fighting antisemitism,"By Michael Williams, CNN","3 minute read Published 12:56 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240117,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/24/politics/doug-emhoff-cnntv/,"Second gentleman Doug Emhoff said Wednesday in an exclusive interview that his work fighting the spread of antisemitism around the country weighs on him.
“There’s some days I don’t want to do it, because it’s too hard,” he told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer in an interview from his office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. “I’m too beat up about it. But my wife, the vice president, has been so supportive, pushing me out there to continue to use my voice and this microphone to push back on the hate, the vitriol of what’s going on.”
“I know I have an obligation to our Jewish community as the first Jewish person in this role,” he added. “There’s high expectations and there’s a lot of accountability – I take that extremely seriously. So, no matter how bad I might be feeling personally, it’s not going to stop me from continuing to use my voice, this microphone, to advocate against antisemitism, against hate, and to push our coalitions back together so we can fight this thing together.”
The second gentleman has taken on an elevated role in fighting antisemitism since the October 7 attack on Israel by Hamas. In the interview, which comes ahead of International Holocaust Remembrance Day on January 27, Emhoff said he is “never going to not feel rage about what happened” during the Hamas attack - the deadliest act of violence against Jews since the Holocaust. Emhoff is the first Jewish spouse of a president or vice president.
The spread of hate and antisemitism has been pervasive, Emhoff said, vowing that he and the Biden administration are doing “everything we can” to push back on all forms of extremism.
“We’ve seen the stoking of hate and anger by so-called leaders in this country,” Emhoff said. “We’ve seen leaders who stay silent and they know better – and silence is not acceptable. Noise is required right now. We all need to come together and combat this hate.”
More than 240 people were taken hostage on October 7. Emhoff met with some of the since-released hostages and their families at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week. The trauma those hostages experienced, Emhoff said, “cannot be minimized.”
“It cannot be forgotten,” he said. “The evidence is outrageous, and we can never forget that.”
But he noted that the roots of hate far pre-date October 7, pointing to the 2017 Unite the Right rally in which tiki-torch-carrying White supremacists marched in Charlottesville, Virginia –†® some of them chanting “Jews will not replace us” – and the 2018 massacre at a Pittsburgh synagogue that killed 11 people.
Emhoff has made fighting hate and antisemitism as central focus point even before October 7. The Biden administration launched a national strategy to combat antisemitism last May, and Emhoff said that plan enabled the administration to not “start from scratch after October 7.”
That strategy included more than 100 Executive Branch actions, including bolstering research into antisemitism, conducting threat assessments and increased security funding.
“So we’ve done, in terms of keeping people safe, funds for security, education, fighting what’s happening online - but what I’m focused on is coalition building. … A lot of of our traditional coalitions are frayed, and it’s not a good thing to happen,” he said. “We need to bring these coalitions back, and so I’m doing a lot of work, a lot of public speaking, a lot of things behind the scenes, to get everyone together - to get everyone to understand this hate is all connected.”"

“Everything burned down,” Acting Minister of Culture Dinara Smyr said, according to the region’s Apsnypress news agency. “This is an irreparable loss for the national culture of Abkhazia. I am choking with tears. It is difficult for me to speak.”
Apsnypress reported that the gallery’s collection included around 300 works by Alexander Chachba-Shervashidze, an exiled painter whom the breakaway republic considers to be the “first professional Abkhazian artist.” None of his pieces are thought to have survived, said Smyr.
The National Art Gallery is in Sukhumi, the separatist republic’s capital city. Abkhazia has declared its own government and is propped up by Russia, but is not officially recognized as a state by most countries or by the United Nations. According to Abkhazia’s State Committee for Statistics, the region’s population was around 244,000 in 2021.

The National Art Gallery’s Central Exhibition Hall caught fire overnight, and emergency services were called to the scene early Sunday morning, according to state media. By 7 a.m. local time the flames were contained, and by 11 a.m. the blaze was extinguished, Apsnypress said, adding that 11 fire brigades were called to the site from surrounding areas.
“The death of the works of art that made up the fund of the National Art Gallery is an irreparable loss for the cultural heritage of our state,” Abkhazia’s Parliament said in a statement posted on state media.
Around 150 paintings by Abkhaz artists survived the fire, Apsnypress reported, citing Smyr. The news agency also said that Abkhazia’s Prosecutor General’s Office has opened an investigation into the cause of the blaze.
In a social media post, Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili called the fire a “tragedy for us all.”  She also criticized the region’s leadership, saying, “I deplore what is a direct consequence of the neglect of cultural identity both by the de-facto leadership and the Russian occupants.”

MICQPHZU75_ADJ4DCBJMILC7IB,Opinion: We Brits don’t need tea-brewing advice from Americans,Opinion by Rosa Prince,"3 minute read Published 6:54 AM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/26/opinions/tea-salt-us-uk-prince/,"Editor’s Note: Rosa Prince, a journalist, is London Playbook editor for POLITICO. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion at CNN.
It was always going to be a sensitive subject.
Almost exactly 250 years after the Sons of Liberty dumped chests of tea into Boston Harbour, a professor from Bryn Mawr College has committed a crime against the British cuppa very nearly as grave. With scant regard to diplomatic relations, chemist Michelle Francl advised in her new book “Steeped: The Chemistry of Tea” that to create the perfect brew, a grain of salt should be added to the mix.
The response was swifter than a military scramble to a nuclear code red.
“Tea is the elixir of camaraderie, the bond that unites our nations,” the US Embassy in London stated in an official communique rushed out on X in a desperate bid to avert an international incident. “We cannot stand idly by as such an outrageous proposal threatens the very foundation of our Special Relationship.”
Battle stations might have been stood down … had the release not gone on: “The US Embassy will continue to make tea in the proper way – by microwave.”
Well. Far from calming tensions, the words doubled down on the original offense, triggering flashbacks in the soul of every Brit who ever strayed west of Iceland.
It’s downtown LA; Midtown Manhattan; Rust Bucket Indiana. In our innocence we’ve gone and ordered a cup of Rosie Lee. It arrives: a chilly bag floating atop a cup of bathwater. What purports to be a nice cuppa accompanied not by good honest cow’s milk but some kind of yellow citrus thing.
Worse is when the tea itself is some unconscionable fruit or “’erbal” flavor. Or, god forbid, arrives not in a good honest tea bag, but taking the false form of — shudder — tea leaves.
One of the highlights of my 10 years living in New York City was the day the local grocery store opened a “British section,” with Ribena, Bourbon biscuits and, most satisfying of all for a homesick limey, Tetley tea bags.
I once visited a tea factory in Sri Lanka where a lovely worker gave a whole spiel about how the finest teas came from the tips of the leaves, and that people who drank the stuff made from bags were basically consuming the sweepings from the floor.
Being British, I was too polite to point out that sweepings from the floor are what we like to drink, were raised to drink, celebrate drinking in daily, some cases hourly rituals. My mother’s best friend would give her children sweet milky tea in their bottles as soon as they were off the breast, a custom considered a little precocious, perhaps, but certainly not eccentric.

I took up the tea habit when I was about 12 or 13, and like most of my countrymen and women have had a cuppa four or five times a day ever since. It’s less edgy than coffee, cheaper than gin and generally a soothing, unifying kind of thing, particularly when shared with others. You’re offered a cuppa char if you’ve given birth, witnessed a murder, come home from a crappy day at work.
And there are definite wrongs and rights about how to brew up. Too weak, and you’ll be accused of serving “gnat’s piss”; leave the bag in too long and it’s “stew.” You’re generally considered a good egg if you prefer “builder’s,” named for the construction workers who endearingly prefer that customers provide a steady stream of cups of strong tea with only a splash of milk to the generous cash tips their American cousins favour.
As to the question of whether or not to add sugar; to my mind it seems a little immature over the age of puberty but who am I to judge?
However, salt? Salt? Whether in the seas of Boston Harbour or some mad prof’s lab in rural Pennsylvania, tea and salt do not mix and that, my Yank friends, is that."
MKXJF4QP85_TACB0VQXQ018BF1,Five takeaways from the New Hampshire primary,"By Eric Bradner, CNN","6 minute read Updated 11:37 PM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/23/politics/takeaways-new-hampshire-primary/,"Former President Donald Trump took a huge step toward winning a third consecutive Republican presidential nomination Tuesday, winning the New Hampshire primary in a one-on-one matchup with his last challenger standing, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley.
Haley vowed to remain in the Republican race, saying she’ll now focus on the February 24 primary in her home state of South Carolina.
But she’ll be battling history: In modern presidential campaign history, no non-incumbent has won the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary without going on to win his party’s nomination.
Trump, who took the stage shortly after Haley spoke, seethed over her decision to continue her campaign.
“She had to win,” the former president said. “She failed badly.”
As Haley seeks to prove she remains a viable contender, President Joe Biden began preparations for a general election rematch with Trump — dispatching senior White House staffers to work on his campaign and holding an event in Virginia where he hammered Trump on abortion rights.
Here are five takeaways from the New Hampshire primaries:
In what were expected to be celebratory remarks Tuesday night in New Hampshire, Trump instead sounded annoyed that Haley had not yet dropped out of the Republican primary race.
He mocked Haley, calling her an “imposter” who had “claimed victory” despite doing “very poorly.” (Haley, in fact, had congratulated Trump for his victory at the beginning of her remarks.)
His remarks made plain that Haley’s attacks on Trump’s age, his verbal miscues and Republican losses during his time as the party’s leader have frustrated the former president.
It was a jarring contrast from Trump’s election night remarks eight days ago in Iowa, when he praised his rivals as “very smart people, very capable people” and predicted that Republicans are “going to come together. It’s going to happen soon, too.”
He invited two former 2024 GOP contenders, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, to attack Haley on stage Tuesday night.
“What we see right now with her continuing in the race is the ugly underbelly of American politics,” Ramaswamy said, blaming Haley’s decision to continue her candidacy on “megadonors” who are out of step with what Americans want. “What we saw tonight is America first defeating America last.”
Later, he gave Scott, who stood on stage behind him days after endorsing the former president, the chance to jab at Haley. He noted that Haley had appointed the South Carolina Republican to the Senate in 2013.
“Did you ever think that she actually appointed you, Tim?” Trump said. “You must really hate her.”
Scott diplomatically stepped to the microphone to interject. “I just love you,” he said.
Though Trump is eager to move past the Republican primary, and Biden’s campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said Tuesday night that Trump “has all but locked up” his party’s nomination, Haley insisted she won’t leave the race.
“New Hampshire is first in the nation. It is not the last in the nation. This race is far from over. There are dozens of states left to go,” Haley told supporters in her election night speech Tuesday in New Hampshire.
What’s not clear, though, is where Haley could actually notch a victory against Trump. She isn’t participating in the Nevada caucuses on February 8 (she will instead be on the state’s primary ballot, which won’t lead to her winning any delegates), and polls in her home state of South Carolina — where the February 24 primary will be the next major showdown — show Trump with a huge lead.
Haley is likely to face immense pressure to depart the race in coming days. She’ll face questions about whether she’ll follow a path similar to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who vowed to continue on after his second-place finish in last week’s Iowa caucuses — and then he dropped out days later.
Haley’s campaign said Tuesday it is placing $4 million in television advertising reservations in South Carolina. She has also scheduled a rally Wednesday night in North Charleston.
Mark Harris, executive director of the pro-Haley super PAC SFA Fund, told CNN the group is “on to South Carolina” and plan to spend millions on ads, mail and more.
Haley used her Tuesday night speech to make her most pointed argument yet about electability — blaming Trump for Republicans’ disappointing performances in the 2018 and 2022 midterms and the 2020 presidential election.
“With Donald Trump, Republicans have lost almost every competitive election,” she said, ticking through GOP failures during Trump’s time as the party’s leader. “The worst-kept secret in politics is how badly the Democrats want to run against Donald Trump.”
A supporter shouted: “He’s a loser!”
The former South Carolina governor called Trump “the only Republican in the country who Joe Biden can defeat.”

She also highlighted their ages. Trump will be 78 on Election Day in November; Biden will be 81. She also questioned Trump’s mental competency, and challenged him to debate her. (Trump skipped all five Republican primary debates, and has shown no indication he’d consider participating in one.)
Trump is dominating Republican primary polls. But polls also show Haley outperforms the former president in a hypothetical general election matchup with Biden — something Haley has frequently noted in recent days.
“The first party to retire its 80-year-old candidate is going to be the party that wins this election,” she said Tuesday night. “And I think it should be the Republicans that win this election. So our fight is not over, because we have a country to save.”
Though Trump’s win was a huge step toward cementing the GOP nomination, there were warning signs for his general election hopes within CNN’s exit polls of New Hampshire Republican primary voters.
Haley won the 29% of the electorate that identified themselves as moderate by a 3-to-1 margin.
On the issue of abortion, Trump was the strong favorite of those who support banning most or all abortions nationwide, but Haley edged him out among the 67% of the primary electorate that said they would oppose a ban. Biden’s campaign on Tuesday signaled its intent to make abortion rights a central focus of the general election.
“Let there be no mistake: The person most responsible for taking away this freedom in America is Donald Trump,” Biden told supporters at a rally in Manassas, Virginia.
There were other potential signs of trouble with moderate voters for Trump. Among them: 44% of the primary electorate said Trump is not fit for the presidency if he is convicted of a crime, and Haley won 84% of those voters. Haley won 79% of the votes of those who said Biden legitimately won the 2020 election — showing a potentially limited appetite among voters for Trump’s lies about widespread election fraud.
Biden won the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday night, but he had been at risk for blowback in New Hampshire after he led the Democratic push to demote the state in the party’s nominating process — elevating South Carolina’s primary to become the first contest with delegates on the line.
The Democratic National Committee had called the vote “meaningless” and had urged presidential candidates to “take all steps possible not to participate.” Still, Biden’s allies launched a low-key effort to get Democrats to write in Biden, and it paid off with an easy victory.
It was a reminder that even though Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips and author Marianne Williamson are challenging Biden, there is no drama: Biden’s path to the Democratic nomination for a second term is clear.
Biden’s campaign, meanwhile, is preparing for an early start of the general election, moving two senior aides from the White House to his reelection campaign in Wilmington. Jen O’Malley Dillon, who was campaign manager for Biden’s 2020 campaign, is poised to transition to a role as Biden’s campaign chair, while Mike Donilon, a long-time Biden messaging guru, will be chief strategist."
MM441SE4T4_SBE2SXDMUWQ1RCZ,"DeSantis, once a rising Republican star, ran a presidential campaign filled with missteps and mistakes","By Steve Contorno, Jessica Dean and Kit Maher, CNN","12 minute read Published 12:00 AM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240122,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/22/politics/desantis-campaign-what-happened/,"In the days leading up to the Iowa caucuses, top advisers to Ron DeSantis steeled themselves for a grim result. The polling that for months told them enough Republicans there were ready to move on from Donald Trump was now predicting that most of them wouldn’t, and they began to consider options for the Florida governor with his political future in mind.
They presented DeSantis with a range of potential outcomes and paths forward. In the event of a dominating performance by Trump, they pitched that DeSantis could bow out, endorse the former president, finish his second term as governor and rebuild his reputation with an eye toward 2028.
He rejected the idea outright, according to a source familiar with the exchange. That was the end of that conversation.

Or so they thought. On Sunday, less than a week after a crushing defeat in Iowa and days before New Hampshire voters are expected to deliver another one, DeSantis bowed out of the 2024 presidential race. In a scripted video statement from Florida, DeSantis endorsed Trump and looked ahead to finishing his second term as governor.
His exit marked a stunning fall for a Republican who for a time appeared singularly positioned to pull the party from Trump’s vice grip. DeSantis once seemed to have it all: money and momentum behind him, a compelling background, a generational argument and a success story to share. Some early polls actually showed him with a lead over Trump.
But what he didn’t have was room for error running up against a popular former president. And the DeSantis campaign made many of them, his advisers, allies and supporters have acknowledged to CNN in interviews.
“Every single thing that could have not gone as we had hoped or planned for went horribly wrong,” one close adviser said.
DeSantis has suggested the race would be different if Trump wasn’t facing four indictments and 91 charges in federal and state courts. Many of his advisers also believe Trump’s legal peril galvanized Republicans just as the GOP presidential contest was about to get underway, closing an opening for an alternative. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley will attempt to test how wide that opening is in the coming days and weeks.
“I would say if I could have one thing change, I wish Trump hadn’t been indicted on any of this stuff,” DeSantis told the Christian Broadcasting Network in December.
But over a campaign that stretched eight months, there is little DeSantis’ team could point to that they did right – from the disastrous, glitchy kickoff announcement on Twitter Spaces with Elon Musk to the Iowa ground operation that was supposed to overcome Trump’s popularity and arctic weather to deliver a surprise outcome that would shock the country.
It was that final miscalculation that ultimately provided the knockout blow. Not only did the result in Iowa evaporate enthusiasm for his campaign, it also sapped it of credibility. He had promised victory in the Hawkeye State, convinced that the polls hadn’t captured his 99-county tour of the state and insisted the nearly 1 million doors his supporters had touched would be rewarded.
Instead, Iowa revealed how ineffective his effort had been all along — his ground game, his message, his strategy, all exposed as a paper tiger and turning his candidacy into a punchline in Republican circles.
“Historic disaster,” said one veteran Republican fundraiser once hopeful of DeSantis’ chances. “JV team.”
Veteran GOP strategists Curt Anderson and Alex Castellanos called it the “Worst Republican Presidential Campaign Ever” in a blistering audit written for Politico that was devoured Friday by DeSantis allies and enemies alike.
It’s a title DeSantis earned as much for what he squandered as how he fared.
DeSantis’ White House bid carried more than just the weight of a political campaign.
“He thinks he’s on a mission from God,” one close confidant described DeSantis’ drive to become president.
It’s an attitude captured in the closing message of his 2022 reelection campaign: A black-and-white video posted to social media by his wife, Casey, that suggested God created DeSantis, “a fighter,” on the eighth day.
After a 19-point reelection victory that November, some in the Republican Party were at least ready to anoint him the inevitable heir to Trump.
“DeFuture,” the New York Post declared the day after, the culmination of two years of Rupert Murdoch’s media empire showering DeSantis with praise for his pandemic contrarianism and cultural battles.
Trump, already a candidate for president once again, was ready for a fight. He called his former ally “an average Republican governor” as the buzz around DeSantis reached new heights and escalated the attacks from there.
But DeSantis, who once donned a Top Gun outfit to declare he would “never back down from a fight,” opted not to punch back. He instead put his focus on the 2023 legislative session in Florida, plotting an agenda of long-sought conservative priorities – universal school choice, a near ban on abortion, fewer restrictions on guns – that would serve as the platform for a policy-oriented presidential campaign. He also escalated his fight with Disney over new state restrictions on teaching sexual orientation and gender identity by taking control of the company’s special taxing district.
He didn’t step foot in Iowa until March to sell his new book. His first earnest swipe at the former president – a dig at the hush money payments allegedly made to adult film star Stormy Daniels – was followed days later by DeSantis defending Trump in the face of an indictment in a New York case related to those payments.
“The war had begun and we were kind of sitting on our backsides,” a source close to the campaign said, describing the time when DeSantis was traveling around the country on a book tour but had yet to formally announce. It left his team unable to push back on his behalf as Trump and his allies pounded the governor, ultimately spending $21 million in ads seeking to define DeSantis when he wouldn’t punch back.
Meanwhile, an emerging super PAC, led by veteran GOP strategist Jeff Roe and Ken Cuccinelli, a former homeland security official in the Trump administration, was given the keys to the DeSantis’ financial coffers. The super PAC, Never Back Down, received $83 million from DeSantis’ former state political committee in a move that a campaign finance watchdog group flagged as potentially illegal, but nevertheless provided an unprecedented financial advantage for the Republican governor.
In an unusual arrangement, Never Back Down was asked to take on many tasks traditionally reserved for campaigns, including training paid canvassers and hosting the governor’s events. Roe and others promised a novel concept that would change presidential campaigns forever.
But Never Back Down’s team of seasoned political consultants clashed immediately with the inexperienced but scrappy Tallahassee team that had just steered DeSantis to a historic gubernatorial victory. The early squabbling, which the media quickly caught wind of, was a precursor to a summer and fall of discontent that ultimately ended with several top staff and advisers leaving acrimoniously, including Roe.
Meanwhile, the Republican donor class that rained six- and seven-figure checks on DeSantis during his reelection bid suddenly had second thoughts. Some voiced displeasure with his contentious second-term agenda and fixation with Disney. Others wanted to kick the tires on other GOP candidates after all.
The DeSantis financial team wrongly assumed the flush times wouldn’t end, and they budgeted for $200 million between the campaign and super PAC at launch with a goal of amassing half a billion dollars by the year. Instead, the super PAC had raised $130 million by June 30 – a historically large amount that nevertheless fell well short of expectations.
“Pick a name,” another fundraiser said. “Every one of them, it was expected they would keep giving.”
His fundraising team downplayed the pull back at the time, with one person telling CNN it would only be a problem if Ken Griffin, the billionaire hedge fund owner who helped bankroll DeSantis’ reelection, decided he wouldn’t donate. They expected $25 million from him.
Griffin ultimately did not give a cent toward DeSantis’ White House bid.
“If you had told me finances would be the problem, I would have hung up on you as needing a mental health check,” the fundraiser continued. “All the dynamics that Trump would be difficult to beat I expected, but I believed there was enough of a coalition of the willing to fund an opposition candidate.”
Ad spending by Never Back Down peaked in mid-April – before DeSantis had officially entered the race.
By the time DeSantis was ready to announce, his entire political operation was on edge.
“People already felt like it was an uphill battle,” the fundraiser said.
There was a “contentious” debate among DeSantis’s orbit over how best to launch the candidate, with some people pushing for a more traditional announcement from his hometown of Dunedin followed by stops in Iowa and New Hampshire, according to a source familiar with the conversations. But that approach was rejected by the woman who would be announced as DeSantis’ campaign manager, Generra Peck.
Another idea emerged to do something with Elon Musk and X, formerly known as Twitter, which ultimately snowballed into the final idea of the two appearing together on Spaces to broadcast a live announcement. The idea’s supporters argued it was a nontraditional announcement for a nontraditional campaign, according to a source familiar with the discussions.
But donors and other DeSantis allies worried after all the build-up to his candidacy there would be no visual of DeSantis actually announcing his run to air on television stations across the country. A compromise was struck with DeSantis immediately going on Fox News after the Spaces launch to talk about his campaign. An intermediary took the idea to Musk, who agreed.
Musk’s website, though, crashed repeatedly during the announcement, which quickly became the narrative of his introduction as a presidential candidate.
“It could have been cool and successful,” one source familiar with the launch told CNN, “but the glitchiness at the top was perhaps a foreshadowing of the campaign to come.”
Donors gathered in a glitzy Miami hotel for the launch were stunned, and grew more furious when Peck and others tried to spin it as DeSantis breaking the Internet.
As coverage of these early stumbles on mainstream news outlets snowballed, DeSantis stayed inside a right-wing media bubble. He spoke almost exclusively to Fox News, conservative radio stations and right-wing podcasters, ignoring some aides who pushed aggressively for DeSantis to do more with the national media from the very beginning.
DeSantis instead listened to others in his orbit, particularly Christina Pushaw and Bryan Griffin, both of whom joined his campaign from the governor’s office and encouraged him to continue to ignore the mainstream media. He now acknowledges that decision was a mistake.
“I came in not really doing as much media,” DeSantis recently told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt. “I should have just been blanketing. I should have gone on all the corporate shows. I should have gone on everything.
“We had an opportunity, I think, to come out of the gate and do that and reach a much broader folk,” he added.
The abnormalities surrounding DeSantis’ campaign continued to stack from there.
It quickly became apparent that the campaign grew too quickly for its financial situation. In mid-July, the trickle of layoffs began. Meanwhile, DeSantis pulled back plans for a national campaign and refocused his efforts almost exclusively on Iowa.
Yet, as his campaign shrunk, it spent $1.5 million on private planes through September, campaign finance reports show, and held donor retreats at posh locations, like a resort in Park City, Utah.
A bizarre series of events on July 25 illustrated the disconnect. DeSantis flew privately into Tennessee for a fundraiser. Once on the ground, his four-vehicle motorcade was involved in an accident, including the car carrying the governor. That same day, his campaign cut one-third of its staff. And Never Back Down aired its last ad in South Carolina.
Two weeks later, Peck was fired.
Yet, amid the turmoil, DeSantis’ team, led by his top pollster Ryan Tyson, assured donors and operatives that there was an opening in Iowa. Each time they went into the field, their poll numbers showed a growing pool of Republicans open to moving on from Trump. They assumed the surge of support for the former president was a sugar rush from his indictments that would eventually end.
But rather than a coherent message around his candidacy, there was a scattershot of approaches in the ads coming from the super PAC and the campaign. It was largely left up to DeSantis to win over Trump voters through appearances in the state.
Across his 99-county tour of Iowa, DeSantis struggled to articulate a coherent rationale for his candidacy and focused more often on his past accomplishments as a governor than his ideas for the future. He regularly responded to questions from Iowans with actions he took in Florida, rattling off local terms from back home and sometimes leaving crowds perplexed.
His speeches sometimes required a glossary for regular Republicans to understand: woke, ESG, DEI, CRT, Central Bank Digital Currency, social credit scores, Zuckerbucks – all words, phrases and acronyms that were staples of DeSantis’ campaign appearances, media interviews and debate responses.
Still, there were moments when it seemed DeSantis was on the cusp of gaining momentum, such as when Iowa’s popular governor, Kim Reynolds, endorsed him in November.
But that evening also offered a window into his flailing candidacy.
Her involvement represented a momentous coup for DeSantis and a striking break from a tradition from her predecessors. In a stirring speech that night inside a Des Moines event space, she defended her involvement and made an impassioned case for the like-minded conservative governor from Florida.
Yet, during his turn at the mic, DeSantis delivered a largely rote speech filled with familiar lines from his six-month tour of the state, an extended riff off his Florida accomplishments and the “woke” forces he had destroyed. There were only a few passing references to the woman who risked her political capital to back him. He said little that night to suggest he had grown as a politician during his bruising uphill fight for the nomination or had learned much about Iowa or its people despite spending hundreds of hours in the state and meeting thousands of its residents. At times, the crowd could barely muster more than polite cheering.
After stepping off the stage, he shook hands and posed for pictures for 10 minutes from behind a barrier, leaving Reynolds to mingle with his supporters.
The night laid bare the promise and the shortcomings of DeSantis as a presidential candidate. An exacting and relentless leader, DeSantis could execute a game plan as well as anyone but lacked a feel for the campaign trail and struggled to stir a room. He could summon the energy to barnstorm across the state for weeks on end but often appeared disinterested in the people who showed up to hear him.
In the end, a politician who had seemingly done everything necessary to win Iowa – shown up, spent money, secured endorsements – could not win over Iowans.
DeSantis himself acknowledged the limits of the key endorsements he often touted on the trail.
A day before suspending his campaign, he told reporters in Myrtle Beach, “Iowa Republican leadership lined up behind me, and we came in second,” in response to a question about Trump’s new support in South Carolina.
And yet, in the face of this overwhelming rejection of his pitch to Make America Florida, DeSantis refused to change gears. The contours of his stump speech stayed the same as he half-heartedly moved on to South Carolina. Vote for me, he told Republicans there, because I have already done the stuff you supposedly like.
Even in defeat, DeSantis vowed to continue to take on “woke ideology.”
“While this campaign has ended, the mission continues down here in Florida,” DeSantis said as he signed off. “We will continue to show the country how to lead.”"
MNM7IJYNUE_VWG54AJVIDV56CR,Seoul police chief indicted for negligence over Itaewon Halloween crush,"By Yoonjung Seo, Gawon Bae and Heather Chen, CNN","2 minute read Published 4:34 AM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240122,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/22/asia/south-korea-itaewon-halloween-crowd-crush-intl-hnk/,"Seoul’s police chief has been indicted for negligence over the 2022 crowd crush that killed more than 150 people during Halloween festivities in the popular Itaewon neighborhood that left the nation reeling.
South Korean police on Monday confirmed that Kim Kwang-ho, head of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency (SMPA), had been indicted in connection with the tragedy – the most senior police officer charged over the incident.
A statement released on Friday said Kim was charged with “professional negligence resulting in injury or death,” Reuters reported.
According to police emergency call logs from the night of October 29, 2022, multiple calls from members of the public were made about overcrowding as early as four hours before the situation gravely worsened.
Four police dispatches were sent out to Itaewon, which had hosted Halloween celebrations in Seoul for years.
But crowds had already swelled and the streets became so packed that partygoers were unable to move. Some slipped below the feet of others, unable to breathe. Most who died that night were young South Koreans – largely in their teens and early 20s.
In the aftermath of the crush, South Korean authorities maintained that they had no guidelines to handle the huge crowds that gathered for the Halloween festivities – stirring anger among survivors and families of the deceased.
Public outrage turned toward South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and his government – survivors and families of the victims remain strongly critical about what they see as a continuing lack of accountability on the part of South Korean authorities over the disaster.
Kim has not been dismissed from his position following the indictment, according to Seoul police.
His indictment comes after the arrest of two former officers in December on charges of destroying evidence relating to the disaster, authorities said.
The trauma of that night still haunts some survivors and bereaved families.
One survivor, who wanted to be known only by her last name Lee, told CNN in October that she had not been back to Itaewon and she doubted whether lessons from the disaster had “truly been learnt” by authorities.
“For me, Halloween and the Itaewon tragedy are (inextricably) linked,” she said. “It’s impossible to see reminders everywhere and not think about the death of friends that night.”"
MOPSLXL3SV_0YJLDH5J51A2ABN,Los Angeles Times slashes more than 20% of newsroom staff as the paper confronts a ‘financial crisis’,"By Oliver Darcy, CNN","4 minute read Updated 6:20 PM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/23/media/los-angeles-times-layoffs/,"The Los Angeles Times on Tuesday, facing what senior leadership described this week as a “financial crisis,” commenced a round of painful layoffs across the newsroom, a workforce reduction that is set to be one of the most severe in the newspaper’s 142-year history.
The cuts will impact at least 115 journalists, a person familiar with the matter told CNN, or slightly more than 20% of the newsroom. Some 94 of those cuts will be among unionized employees, union chief Matt Pearce said, meaning a quarter of the union will be laid off.
Pearce described the total number of employees being laid off as a “devastating” figure, but said it was “nonetheless far lower than the total number” expected last week.
Among those laid off Tuesday was Kimbriell Kelly, the newspaper’s Washington bureau chief, along with significant cuts to its business and sports desks.
“The LA Times Washington bureau was decimated,” Sarah Wire, a Washington-based reporter for the Times wrote on X.
“They haven’t been filling jobs for two years now and that reduced number was cut even more today. There are five reporters left covering DC.”
Brian Merchant, a Times tech columnist who said he had also been notified that he was being laid off, described the cuts as “a bloodbath.”
“My amazing editor… and the entire business desk as we know it, is gone too,” Merchant wrote.
A spokesperson for The Times, which is owned by biotech billionaire Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, did not immediately comment.
But Soon-Shiong spoke to Meg James, a media reporter at the Times, telling her that the cuts were necessary as the newspaper continues to lose $30 to $40 million each year.
“Today’s decision is painful for all, but it is imperative that we act urgently and take steps to build a sustainable and thriving paper for the next generation,” Soon-Shiong told James. “We are committed to doing so.”
In the interview, Soon-Shiong also expressed disappointment with the employees union and said a one-day walkout it staged last week “did not help” the situation.
The Los Angeles Times Guild, which represents editorial staffers, countered that its decision to go on strike “saved scores of newsroom jobs,” and pushed back on the assertions from the Times owner.
“This staffing cut is the fruit of years of middling strategy, the absence of a publisher, and no clear direction,” the union said in a statement. “But it’s clear that those entrusted to steward [the Soon-Shiong] family’s largesse have failed him — not the rank-and-file staff members with no say in editorial priorities.”
The newspaper, which houses the largest newsroom in the western US, has plunged into disarray in recent weeks as it faces a major financial shortfall, losing tens of millions of dollars a year. Its top editor, Kevin Merida, suddenly announced his departure. And two of the four members of an interim leadership team announced by Soon-Shiong have also abruptly exited in recent days.
Soon-Shiong told James on Tuesday, however, that he had lost the confidence of Merida and some high-ranking editors he had appointed. The owner also pushed back against the characterization that the newspaper is in trouble, telling James, “We are not in turmoil. We have a real plan.”
Staffers who spoke to CNN this week, however, described a different situation at the newspaper.
“I cannot overstate the level of chaos,” one staffer, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, told CNN.
The planned layoffs caught the eye of 10 Democratic members of Congress who represent California. The group on Monday wrote Soon-Shiong, expressing alarm over the planned layoffs, noting that during elections, “the role of news outlets in providing accurate and unbiased information becomes even more vital.”
“Our community relies on the newspaper to stay informed about local and national events, and a reduction in reporters could have a detrimental impact on the quality of reporting,” the congressional leaders wrote. “Preserving democracy is contingent upon a free and robust press, and the LA Times has been instrumental in upholding this democratic principle.”
“We urge you to consider alternative solutions that would allow the LA Times to navigate its financial challenges without compromising the integrity and strength of its newsroom,” they added.
In response, Soon-Shiong said he had invested hundreds of millions of dollars into the paper and suggested lawmakers should take action of their own to aid revenue-starved news organizations.
“I’d like to put the question to them: What can they do to help preserve a free and robust press, one that is instrumental in upholding our democracy?” he wrote. “All we are asking for is the opportunity for our newspaper and hardworking journalists to be fairly compensated, and for the L.A. Times to have a fair chance to become a self-sustaining institution.”
The Times is far from the only news organization struggling to keep its head above water amid a poor advertising climate, breakneck changes in consumer behavior, and technological advances that pose existential threats to the craft of journalism.
Most major newsrooms have been forced to undergo layoffs over the last year. In 2023, nearly 2,700 jobs were slashed in the journalism industry, the highest total since 2020 when the Covid-19 pandemic upended the industry.

MT5267GC8M_Q7QDFRTWA281D0F,King Charles III in London hospital for prostate procedure,"By Lauren Said-Moorhouse and Max Foster, CNN","3 minute read Updated 11:27 AM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/26/uk/king-charles-iii-hospital-prostate-procedure-intl/,"Britain’s King Charles III is “doing well” after undergoing a corrective procedure for an enlarged prostate, CNN understands.
The 75-year-old monarch was admitted to a London hospital on Friday morning for a “scheduled treatment,” Buckingham Palace said earlier in a statement.
“His Majesty would like to thank all those who have sent their good wishes over the past week and is delighted to learn that his diagnosis is having a positive impact on public health awareness,” it added.
The palace revealed on January 17 that the king was set to undergo treatment “in common with thousands of men each year” and that his condition was “benign.”
Charles arrived at The London Clinic, a private hospital near Regent’s Park, accompanied by his wife, Queen Camilla. The move was seen as unusual as the late Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip always went into hospital by themselves.
Camilla was seen leaving the hospital several hours later on Friday afternoon. As made her way to the car, well-wishers could be heard calling out, “We love you.”
The London Clinic is where Catherine, Princess of Wales remains following her abdominal surgery last week. The king visited his daughter-in-law before he went for his own treatment, a royal source told CNN.

Charles will postpone engagements for a short period while he recuperates. It was not immediately clear how long the monarch would remain in hospital.
Queen Camilla has been reassuring the public about her husband’s health during engagements over the past week, saying while in Swindon, southwest England on Monday that he was “fine,” and that he was “looking forward to getting back to work” during an art gallery visit in Aberdeen, Scotland last Thursday.
Specific medical conditions of members of the royal family are rarely divulged publicly. The palace’s perspective is that they are entitled to some level of medical privacy despite their positions as public servants.
But the king made a rare intervention and opted to share his diagnosis as he was keen to encourage other men who may be experiencing symptoms to get checked, a royal source previously told CNN.
And it would appear his approach worked. There was a surge in men seeing if they are at risk of prostate cancer, according to figures from NHS England.

Visits to its “enlarged prostate” webpage - which provides information on causes, symptoms and treatment options - saw traffic surge more than 1,000% above its daily average after the palace’s announcement.
It received 16,410 visits on the day of the announcement, compared to 1,414 visits the day before, according to the organization.
Prostate Cancer UK also said the number of individuals using its online risk checker had jumped 97%. The charity praised the monarch “for his openness that’ll inevitably raise more awareness about the condition.”
In an unprecedented double royal health shock, news of Charles’ procedure was revealed on January 17, only 90 minutes after Kensington Palace separately announced that the Princess of Wales was in hospital.
Kate, 42, is not expected to return to her royal duties until after Easter. Her husband, Prince William has also temporarily stepped away from engagements to juggle supporting Kate’s recovery and childcare.

The royal family’s health woes continued days later as Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York revealed she was also recently diagnosed with skin cancer.
Ferguson, the ex-wife of Prince Andrew, said she was “in good spirits and grateful for the many messages of love and support” following her second cancer diagnosis since the summer.
“I have been taking some time to myself,” she wrote on Instagram on Monday. “Naturally another cancer diagnosis has been a shock.”
The duchess underwent a mastectomy in June last year, followed by reconstructive surgery. Several moles were removed and analyzed at the time of her surgery, the UK Press Association reported Sunday, citing Ferguson’s spokesperson.

MVIE0COY5M_UW9GZSJE3IZNVL8,Opinion: America failed to heed Stanley Kubrick’s warnings. Trump is the proof,Opinion by Noah Berlatsky,"6 minute read Updated 2:30 PM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/26/opinions/dr-strangelove-60th-anniversary-kubrick-trump-berlatsky/,"Editor’s Note: Noah Berlatsky (@nberlat) is a freelance writer in Chicago. The views expressed here are his own. View more opinion on CNN.
“I can no longer sit back and allow Communist infiltration, Communist indoctrination, Communist subversion and the international Communist conspiracy to sap and impurify all of our precious bodily fluids.” Cigar-chomping Colonel Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) intones those classic lines of anticommunist paranoia in Stanley Kubrick’s “Dr. Strangelove, Or How I Learned To Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.” The movie was released 60 years ago this week.
Ripper’s obsessive anticommunism, and the film’s particular nuclear worries, date it to its Cold War year of release in 1964. But Kubrick’s portrait of a US government mired in fascism, incompetence and cowboy fantasies of violence still has a queasy relevance. The Soviet Union is no more, but Jack Ripper with all his precious bodily fluids and his terror of invasion by outside, feminizing forces is still a recognizable stand in for the border-obsessed, homophobic America of former President Donald Trump and his MAGA movement.
The plot of “Strangelove” riffs on, and critiques, the Cold War doctrine of Mutually Assured Destruction. The US and the USSR built up large nuclear stockpiles on the theory that as long as both sides believed that any attack would result in planetwide annihilation, no one would attack.
In Kubrick’s film, however, the mentally unstable Col. Ripper decides that nuclear war is necessary to prevent sneaky, impure Communist infiltration. He orders a wing of bombers to attack the Soviet Union—and all the safeguards designed to ensure credible deterrence make it almost impossible to call them back. The Soviet Union, for its part, has created a Doomsday device which will destroy the world if even one bomb falls on the country. Gripped by mutual fear and impelled by one rabid doofus, the world swoops and stumbles towards annihilation.
Nuclear war remains a live fear today. Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in 2022 once again raised the specter of open conflict between global nuclear powers. The worries about the Soviet Union outpacing the US in number of warheads—the “missile gap,” discussed with great bluster and mugging in the film by General Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott)—have largely been set aside. The collapse of the USSR left the US as the world’s sole superpower, and Russia and the US basically have parity in warheads. Today, even critics of US militarism tend to focus more on the potential of another pointless tragic quagmire like Vietnam, Afghanistan or Iraq rather than on the threat of nuclear apocalypse.
Strangelove’s terrors aren’t precisely our terrors. But the nightmare still has a lot of familiar contours. For example, per far right John Birch conspiracy theories of the era, Ripper believes that fluoridation of drinking water to prevent tooth decay is “the most monstrously conceived and dangerous Communist plot we have ever had to face.”
Ripper thinks public health campaigns are a threat to his moral, physical and sexual autonomy—that somehow fluoride makes him vulnerable to Communist control and, implicitly, makes him sexually impotent. Similarly, far-right extremists today have embraced Covid anti-vax conspiracy theories, claiming (falsely) that Covid vaccines cause large numbers of deaths or that they lead to infertility or change people’s DNA. You can easily see Ripper today donning a yellow star while claiming that vaccine mandates are the equivalent of the Holocaust, as many on the right have done.
The appropriation of Jewish suffering in the antivax protests also resonates with Kubrick’s morbidly funny skewering of ongoing fascist influence post-World War II. In his book, “The Anatomy of Fascism,” Robert O. Paxton defines fascism in part as “political behavior marked by obsessive preoccupation with community decline, humiliation, or victimhood and by compensatory cults of unity, energy and purity.” Ripper’s violent fear of his bodily fluids becoming corrupted and Trump’s ranting insistence that immigrants are “poisoning the blood” of our country both fit with standard fascist rhetoric of purity. Whether it’s immigrants or Communists coming over the border, the far-right frames it as a breach of bodily integrity which must be answered with violence.
Ripper’s Americanized fascism is mirrored by the film’s actual Nazi; Dr. Strangelove himself. Strangelove is based on Wernher von Braun, a Nazi rocket scientist who emigrated and worked on American military programs. Peter Sellers plays him with an Austrian accent and a manic sneer; his black-gloved hand is only partially under his control and keeps snapping up into a Nazi salute as shouts “Heil, Mein Fuhrer” when he should say “Mr. President.”
The disturbing part about Strangelove isn’t that he’s a Nazi; it’s that he fits so well into the American milieu. US generals mumble a couple disparaging remarks about “Krauts” but when Strangelove suggests that they escape fall-out radiation by moving all the most important and valuable people into mine shafts, they listen with breathless enthusiasm. They’re especially taken with Strangelove’s idea for creating a breeding program with 10 women for each man. “The women will have to be selected for their sexual characteristics which will have to be of a highly stimulating nature,” he hisses.
The plan to outbreed the Soviets echoes neo-fascist conspiracies about White genocide, otherwise known as “The Great Replacement Theory” — the fear that there’s a plot to lower White birthrates and overwhelm (supposedly) American culture with alien, non-White babies. Nearly half of Republicans agree that there’s a sinister plan to encourage immigration and replace White voters. The history of the anti-abortion movement is also rooted in worries about falling White birthrates; the fear was that abortions would reduce the White population, destroying American culture.
Getting distracted by horny fantasies while the world burns isn’t exactly indicative of great focus or competence. And in fact, Strangelove and his American admirers are farcical bumblers; the doctor can’t even conquer his own hand, much less the world. Ripper virtually boasts about his own sexual dysfunction. For Kubrick, though, this ineptness doesn’t undercut the malice. It compounds it.
The US president (also played by Sellers) doesn’t realize he’s signed orders that give power to use nuclear devices to lower officials. For its part, Russia’s Doomsday device is more dangerous because the Communist leader Kissoff foolishly didn’t let the US know it existed. (“The premier loves surprises,” his ambassador admits apologetically.) Ripper wouldn’t even attempt to destroy the world if he weren’t a self-bamboozled buffoon; his stupidity leads him to take horrific risks. Similarly, Donald Trump wouldn’t have attempted an almost sure-to-fail coup if he weren’t the most dangerous kind of fool: one who is also a demagogue. It’s not enough to want to overturn democracy; you need to have fooled yourself into thinking you can get away with it.

At the end of the film, bomber commander Major T.J. “King” Kong (Slim Pickens) manually opens his bomber doors and rides a nuclear warhead down towards its target, waving his cowboy hat and yodeling triumphantly as he ensures the end of the world. For Kubrick, that image of American patriotism, bloodthirstiness and utter foolishness encapsulated American reckless nuclear brinkmanship.
Sixty years later, the mix of terrifying violence and reckless incompetence still resonates, even if the Cold War is over. We can still see King Kong’s approach reflected in a range of issues. Today, it suggests the eagerness with which we have thrown ourselves into global warming on a great belching cloud of carbon dioxide. Or our march towards a potential second Trump term. Or our blithe refusal to embrace even moderate public health measures, like masking, in our current Covid-19 surge. Or President Joe Biden’s insistence on sending Israel weapons despite accusations that the weapons are being used for war crimes.
Kubrick in 1964 warned that American hyper-patriotism coupled with fascistic conspiracy theories and the human propensity for bumbling could result in disaster. The nuclear explosion he foresaw didn’t quite happen (at least not yet.) There are now also many other additional options for chaos and misery. We may now be learning to love greenhouse gases, or Covid, or fascist takeovers, rather than (or in addition to) the bomb. But Jack D. Ripper is still smoking that same cigar, and Dr. Strangelove is still smiling."
MX3EL80L7S_O6ZCIN33WU4PD53,Trump is already flexing strongman power in the GOP,"Analysis by Stephen Collinson, CNN","7 minute read Updated 8:30 AM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/26/politics/trump-strongman-power-gop-analysis/,"Donald Trump is moving to assert total dominance over the Republican Party in a harbinger of the strongman rule he envisages for his possible second term, following his twin triumphs in Iowa and New Hampshire.
The ex-president is trying to intimidate Nikki Haley into abandoning the GOP presidential race. He’s warning donors who contribute to the former South Carolina governor they’ll be ostracized. Trump’s supporters launched a bid to jolt the Republican National Committee to anoint him presumptive nominee after only two nominating races — until Trump backtracked amid concern from his allies it could backfire.
And the 45th president is now pressuring GOP members of Congress to kill an immigration deal to deprive President Joe Biden of a victory and to ensure he can exploit the border crisis on the campaign trail. Trump has also been browbeating former opponents and key decision makers in the GOP to quickly endorse him as he forces the party to genuflect before him as he did during four years in the White House.

Trump’s brisk assertion of his growing power as the likely nominee is a characteristic dismantling of constraints that echoes his behavior in office. He was twice impeached in his single term, which ended after he tried to overturn an election in which voters ejected him from office. It is consistent with Trump’s self-created persona as the strongest person in every room that sustained him through a life in business, reality television and as an ex-president.
Among Trump’s critics, his behavior is stirring fresh concerns that his potential second term could mean a dawn of autocracy in the Oval Office. And Trump’s desire to pressure Haley out of the race after only two contests – while he leads in the delegate count 32 to 17, out of the 1,215 needed for the GOP crown – is consistent with his disrespect for democratic processes.
The former president is not hiding his intent. He has frequently warned, for instance, that he would dedicate a second term to exacting “retribution” on his enemies. Almost every day he demands full criminal immunity for presidents, partly as an effort to avoid prosecution for his attempt to overturn the 2020 election but also to permit him to behave exactly as he pleases in a possible second term with no risk of consequences.
In a rally Saturday night in Manchester, New Hampshire, that pulsated with aggressive imagery, the ex-president praised Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán as a “great man.” Orbán has methodically eroded political freedoms, cracked down on the independent press, and discredited the electoral system, the courts and alternative sources of power. He’s regarded by many “Make America Great Again” supporters as a hero and a model. “Some people don’t like him because he’s too strong. It’s good to have a strong man at the head of a country,” Trump reflected. His comments cemented an impression that Orbán may be a better prototype for the authoritarian leader that the ex-president would like to become than the extreme 1930s European dictators to which his recent rhetoric, toward immigrants especially, has drawn comparisons.
The former president’s autocratic instincts are one reason why the coming election promises to be one of the most fateful in modern American history.
But there are also risks for Trump in his truculent approach. By throwing his weight around he could confirm Biden’s arguments that he’d endanger democracy if elected to a second term in November. And the bullying approach and sexist language he’s using toward Haley could alienate some of the more moderate, independent, suburban voters that she’s attracting in the GOP primary. These are exactly the kinds of voters that Trump alienated in his 2020 defeat. If he’s to win another term, he must at least mitigate his deficit to Biden among this group in November.
Katon Dawson, a former chairman of the South Carolina GOP, noted the potential consequences of Trump’s behavior in an interview with Kasie Hunt on “State of the Race” on CNN International and CNN Max on Thursday. Dawson, one of the few Palmetto State GOP heavyweights supporting Haley, warned that Trump would “polarize” women in South Carolina with his “seedy little comments about what Nikki had on.” He added: “Donald Trump is running more like he wants to be the President of Cuba instead of the President of the United States.”
Haley might not have beaten Trump in Iowa or New Hampshire. But she provoked him by refusing to quickly fold her campaign and endorse him like other GOP candidates, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott. Trump’s fury was revealed in a self-absorbed victory speech in New Hampshire on Tuesday night. Haley’s mockery of that performance has infuriated the former president even more.
“We did our thing and we said what we had to say and then Donald Trump got out there and just threw a temper tantrum,” Haley said in Charleston on Wednesday. “He pitched a fit. He was insulting. He was doing what he does, but I know that’s what he does when he’s insecure.”
Trump has appeared deeply frustrated that Haley is defying his calls for her to leave the race, CNN’s Kaitlan Collins has reported. During his New Hampshire speech, he mocked the dress she wore on caucus night in Iowa. He has been calling her “birdbrain” on social media. Trump has also warned that anyone who makes a financial contribution to her will be “barred from the MAGA camp” – which Haley has turned around into a fundraising pitch for her campaign.

It is not surprising that there have been calls for Haley to end her campaign, given the size of her defeats to Trump and the fact that New Hampshire, where independents can vote in the GOP primary, was her best shot at a win. Parties generally like to consolidate quickly behind a nominee to look ahead to a general election once the destiny of the primary race becomes obvious. But the disdain toward Haley from Trump world is remarkable.
For instance, even before all the polls had closed on Tuesday night, Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, one of Trump’s top supporters, issued a statement saying Haley’s campaign “must end” after the ex-president’s “monumental” victory “for the sake of the republic.” The history of past campaigns suggests that restraint and respect might be more effective in prodding Haley out of the race than threats. And while her prospects appear grim, the idea that a candidate should abandon a campaign after just two contests in a nationwide primary season just because the front-runner says so is in itself an affront to a democratic process.
Even Trump seems to have been convinced some of this has gone too far. The former president on Thursday came out against an RNC draft resolution that would have declared him the presumptive nominee — a move that would have allowed him access to the RNC’s data and fundraising operation. It would have essentially joined the party’s forces with Trump while an election involving a rival was still taking place.
But Trump wrote on Truth Social that while he appreciated the RNC’s “respect and devotion,” he wanted to win the “old fashioned way,” at the ballot box. While the campaign had initially approved of the resolution and Trump himself was on board, that changed when a backlash ensued, a source familiar told Collins. The resolution was withdrawn later Thursday.
The former president, whose business career was mythologized in “The Art of the Deal,” is more concerned currently with the art of killing a deal – one being painfully pieced together by Republican and Democratic senators to address a southern border crisis. Trump has been lobbying Republicans in both private conversations and public statements on social media to oppose the deal because he wants to campaign on the issue this year and ensure Biden doesn’t get a legislative victory that could ease pressure at the border and help his reelection, sources said.
Related article GOP senators seethe as Trump blows up delicate immigration compromise
Trump’s maneuvering has infuriated some GOP senators looking for a deliverable for their voters at a moment when Biden appears willing to accept the return of some hardline Trump-era immigration policies in a compromise. Republican Sen. Todd Young of Indiana called any efforts to disrupt the ongoing negotiations “tragic.” Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, a frequent Trump antagonist who’s not running for reelection, said that if Trump sabotaged the deal just to blame Biden, it would be “appalling.” Trump and his acolytes on Capitol Hill have also made clear their opposition to Biden’s latest $60 billion aid package for Ukraine, which is running out of bullets and ammunition.
Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, who has been heavily involved in both the immigration and Ukraine discussions, raised concerns that the looming shadow of one man – who doesn’t currently hold any governing role – could overwhelm a branch of the US government.
“I hope we don’t live in a world today in which one person inside the Republican Party holds so much power that they could stop a bipartisan bill to try to give the president additional power at the border to make more sense of our immigration policy,” Murphy told CNN’s Manu Raju.
“I would hope that one person isn’t so powerful inside the Republican Party to hand Ukraine to Vladimir Putin, but we’ll find out the answer to that.”"
MZAJ1YGJ97_5GM2HNVH5OU7ZEA,Fake Joe Biden robocall urges New Hampshire voters not to vote in Tuesday’s Democratic primary,"By Em Steck and Andrew Kaczynski, CNN","4 minute read Updated 5:44 PM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240122,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/22/politics/fake-joe-biden-robocall/,"A robocall that appears to be an AI voice resembling President Joe Biden is reaching out to New Hampshire residents, advising them against voting in Tuesday’s presidential primary and saving their vote for the November general election.
Audio of the call was reviewed by CNN from the anti-robocall application Nomorobo. Their tracking data suggests a large volume of calls. It’s unclear who is behind the call.
“Republicans have been trying to push nonpartisan and Democratic voters to participate in their primary. What a bunch of malarkey,” says the digitally altered Biden voice. “We know the value of voting Democratic when our votes count. It’s important that you save your vote for the November election. We’ll need your help in electing Democrats up and down the ticket. Voting this Tuesday only enables the Republicans in their quest to elect Donald Trump again.”
The application rates the number of calls, which were first reported by NBC News, as “severe,” among its highest rating for calls.
Nomorobo CEO Aaron Foss told CNN their data showed that 76% of the robocalls targeted New Hampshire, with 12% directed at Boston and the remaining 12% covering other areas. They estimated the number of these fraudulent calls ranged from 5,000 to 25,000.
Biden’s name will not appear on the ballot in the upcoming New Hampshire primary on Tuesday over a dispute between the state and the Democratic National Committee, which voted to move the New Hampshire primary out of its traditional first-in-the nation position. As a result, there is an organized effort to write-in Biden’s name.
“This matter has already been referred to the New Hampshire Attorney General, and the campaign is actively discussing additional actions to take immediately. Spreading disinformation to suppress voting and deliberately undermine free and fair elections will not stand, and fighting back against any attempt to undermine our democracy will continue to be a top priority for this campaign,” Julie Chavez Rodriguez, Biden’s campaign manager, said in a statement.
Aaron Jacobs, a spokesperson for Write-In Biden, said in a statement, “This is deep fake disinformation designed to harm Joe Biden, suppress votes, and damage our democracy,” adding that the group remains “focused on one goal until polls close on Tuesday: encouraging Granite Staters to write-in Joe Biden.”
At the end of the call, the voice of an unknown male directs listeners to call a local New Hampshire number to be removed from future calls.
The call uses spoofing, a common practice in fraudulent robocalling which manipulates caller ID information to display a false phone number, obscuring the true identity of the caller.
The robocall shows up on caller ID as a local New Hampshire number that belongs to Kathy Sullivan, a former New Hampshire Democratic Party chair and treasurer for the Granite for America PAC. The PAC is working to encourage voters to write in Biden’s name this Tuesday.
In a phone interview, Sullivan, who is supporting Biden in the 2024 election, said she first received calls on Sunday night and spoke with the New Hampshire attorney general’s office on Monday to file a complaint over the robocall.
“It’s very apparent that there’s someone, or someones, out there who want to suppress the primary write-in vote on Tuesday, tomorrow, by sending out this robocall saying, ‘Don’t vote for Joe Biden,’ or Joe Biden saying, ‘Don’t vote on Tuesday, save your vote until November,’” said Sullivan. “It’s voter suppression by someone who wants to hurt Joe Biden.”
Sullivan said she believes her phone was listed as a way to “jam” up her phone lines.
“It’s personally annoying, but more importantly it’s just reprehensible that someone would be trying to suppress the vote by telling people not to vote on Tuesday,” she said. “That’s an interference with our democracy. It doesn’t get much worse than that.”
The campaign of Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips, who is challenging Biden in the New Hampshire primary, found out about the call from reporter outreach last night, according to spokesperson Katie Dolan.
“Any effort to discourage voters is disgraceful and an unacceptable affront to democracy,” Dolan said in a statement. “The potential use of AI to manipulate voters is deeply disturbing.”

More than 100,000 people in the US are on the transplant waiting list, and an average of 17 die every day while waiting. Doctors have spent decades experimenting with alternatives, and many now see potential in replacing failing human organs with genetically modified pig organs.

Xenotransplantation, as cross-species organ transplantation is called, is still in the early stages. There are no human clinical trials taking place that have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, but the researchers behind a study published Thursday in the Journal of Clinical Investigation say their findings might bring human trials even closer.
For the study, doctors at the University of Alabama-Birmingham’s Marnix E. Heersink School of Medicine transplanted genetically modified pig kidneys into three people who were brain-dead and showed that they could do so using the same FDA-approved drugs used in human-to-human donations.
With any kind of transplant, whether from a human or an animal, doctors have to give the recipient medications that suppress their immune system so their body doesn’t reject the unfamiliar organ. In some cases, when patients are particularly vulnerable to infection, they might get additional therapy to offer protection from encapsulated bacteria like Neisseria meningitidis, the germ that causes meningitis.

The researchers behind the new study compared results from two pig kidney recipients who got the standard immune-suppressing drugs and an additional FDA-approved therapy called eculizumab with results from someone who got only the immune suppression drugs. The combination appeared to work best.
The study showed that doctors didn’t need to use specialty or experimental drugs for this transplant process, which would make it easier to get the work into FDA-approved human trials, said study author Dr. Jayme Locke, a professor of surgery and director of the Division of Transplantation at the Heersink School of Medicine.
“When we move this into the living, the scientist in me thinks the best way to do this is that we should change only one thing at a time, and so in this case, the only thing that we will have to change and have to be different is the organ source,” she said.
Keeping things as similar and as simple as possible would also make the process generalizable, Locke said.

“Doing this using medications that transplanters across the globe know how to use, when you start thinking about scaling this up and being able to offer this to as many people as possible, that’s also very appealing,” she added. “It just decreases the complexity of what you’re trying to do.”
The new research is limited because it was demonstrated in only three patients. As with any science, the advance shows a stepwise progression, but doctors who work on research involving transplants complimented the team for what transplant surgeon Dr. Sheri Krams called “extraordinarily innovative work.”
What the paper adds to the body of knowledge is “somewhat incremental,” said Krams, senior associate dean of graduate education and postdoctoral affairs and a professor of surgery at Stanford Medicine, who did not work on the new research – particularly compared with a study published in August that showed how to test this kind of procedure in a model using brain-dead donors, what UAB calls the Parsons Model after the first person in the study whom Locke and her team transplanted with a modified pig organ in 2021. But Krams agreed that “anything we do in transplant is great.”

Dr. Mandy Ford, scientific director of the Emory Transplant Center, agreed that the extreme need for organs makes any advance in this area important.
“There’s a critical donor organ shortage in the United States and worldwide, and xenotransplantation really has the potential to be a revolutionary permanent solution to the problem,” said Ford, who did not work on the new study but characterized it as a “major advance.”
“Using this FDA-approved regimen, I think, gets us closer to the clinical reality of being able to start clinical trials and one step closer to making xenotransplantation a clinical reality,” Ford added."

The painting had long been considered lost, according to Vienna auction house im Kinsky. However, it has now emerged that it had been privately owned by an Austrian  citizen.
“The rediscovery of this portrait, one of the most beautiful of Klimt’s last creative period, is a sensation,” the auction house said in a press statement on its website.
The intensely vivid and colorful piece had been documented in catalogues of the artist’s work, but experts had only seen it in a black and white photo.
The sitter is known to have been a member of a wealthy Austrian Jewish family who were then part of the upper class of Viennese society, where Klimt found his patrons and clients. Nevertheless, her identity is not completely certain.
Brothers Adolf and Justus Lieser were leading industrialists in the Austro-Hungarian empire. Catalogues of Klimt’s work state that Adolf commissioned the artist to paint his teenage daughter Margarethe Constance. However, new research by the auction house suggests Justus’ wife, Lilly, hired him to paint one of their two daughters.
The statement on the auctioneer’s website reveals that the sitter - whoever she was - visited Klimt’s studio nine times in April and May 1917. He made at least 25 preliminary studies and most likely began the painting in the May of that year.
“The painter chose a three-quarter portrait for his depiction and shows the young woman in a strictly frontal pose, close to the foreground, against a red, undefined background. A cape richly decorated with flowers is draped around her shoulders,” the auction house said.

It added: “The intense colors of the painting and the shift towards loose, open brushstrokes show Klimt at the height of his late period.”
When the artist died of a stroke the following February, the painting was still in his studio - with some small parts not quite finished. It was then given to the Lieser family.
Its exact fate after 1925 is “unclear,” according to the auction house.
“What is known is that it was acquired by a legal predecessor of the consignor in the 1960s and went to the current owner through three successive inheritances,” the statement said.
The painting is to be sold on behalf of its Austrian owners, who have not been named, along with the legal successors of “Adolf and Henriette Lieser based on an agreement in accordance with the Washington Principles of 1998,” the auction house said.
Established in 1998, the Washington Principles charged participating nations with returning Nazi-confiscated art to their rightful owners.
Claudia Mörth-Gasser, specialist in modern art at im Kinsky, explained the situation in an email to CNN.

She said the auctioneer checked the painting’s history and provenance “in all possible ways in Austria,” adding: “We have checked all archives and have found no evidence that the painting has ever been exported out of Austria, confiscated or looted.
But by the same token, she added: “We have no proof that the painting has not ever been looted in the time gap between 1938 and 1945.”
And this  is the reason “why we arranged an agreement between the present owner and all descendants of the Lieser family in accordance to the ‘Washington Principles,’” she said.
Klimt’s portraits of women “are seldom offered at auctions,” the press release states. It continues: “A painting of such rarity, artistic significance, and value has not been available on the art market in Central Europe for decades.
The painting will tour internationally ahead of the sale on April 24, stopping in Switzerland, Germany, Britain and Hong Kong.
The last portrait completed by Klimt became the most expensive artwork ever to sell at a European auction, when it fetched a staggering £85.3 million ($108.4 million) in London last year.
Depicting an unidentified female subject, “Dame mit Fächer” (Lady with a Fan) also established a new record for Klimt, outselling “Birch Forest,” which went for $104.6 million in a sale from the collection of the late Microsoft co-founder Paul G. Allen in 2022."
N08JLAQNND_UAG0U4QX69W5BKZ,Austin delivers virtual remarks in first public appearance since hospitalization,"By Haley Britzky, CNN","2 minute read Published 9:22 AM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/23/politics/lloyd-austin-public-appearance/,"Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Tuesday made his first public appearance since he was hospitalized over complications of a procedure to treat prostate cancer, delivering opening remarks at a virtual meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group.
Speaking from a nondescript white room with the Department of Defense seal behind him, and small American and Ukrainian flags set on what appeared to be a printer or fax machine, Austin reiterated his support for Ukraine and thanked foreign allies for their security assistance.
The meeting comes as Congress continues debating a national security supplemental aid package, which would include funding for Ukraine assistance. In his remarks, Austin called for more aid to Ukraine and said that there has been “no credible evidence of the misuse or illicit diversion of American equipment” provided to Ukraine.
“If we lose our nerve, if we flinch, if we fail to deter other would-be aggressors, we will only invite even more bloodshed and more chaos. So a sovereign and secure Ukraine is critical to global security,” Austin said. “And we must not waver in our support for Ukraine.”
Austin is working remotely from home since he was released from the hospital on January 15, where he spent two weeks being treated for complications from a prostate cancer procedure in December. A Pentagon statement earlier this month said he would have “full access” to secure communications capabilities while he was working remotely.
His doctors have said that he is expected to “make a full recovery” and that his cancer prognosis is “excellent.”
Austin’s failure to notify the White House, Congress and the media about his hospitalization for several days has resulted in a number of inquiries and probes. Lawmakers have requested answers about the notification process and Austin’s chief of staff — who was identified as the point of failure for notifying other officials because she was sick — announced an internal review of notification procedures. The Pentagon inspector general announced it will be carrying out its own review of what happened.
After it was revealed he was in the hospital, Austin said he took “full responsibility for my decisions about disclosure” and committed to “doing better.”"
N08OBLC6BT_1JWU0GZ2OZV1C0A,Gaza endgame: Inching toward a deal to end the war,"Analysis by Elliott Gotkine, CNN","5 minute read Published 1:55 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/25/middleeast/gaza-endgame-analysis-intl/,"As the Gaza war nears its fifth month, with more than 25,000 Palestinians - civilians and combatants - dead and Israel nowhere close to achieving its objective of destroying Hamas, no one seems to have come up with a concrete proposal that’s palatable to both parties to pause the conflict, let alone end it. But there are suggestions, however half-baked, from both sides, that show a willingness to talk.
Indeed, Qatar - the main go-between - says there are “serious discussions” with Israel and Hamas, and is receiving “constant replies” from both sides. They’re not “negotiations” yet, says the White House. But with indirect talks ongoing, we seem to be inching towards what Ofer Shelah, Senior Researcher with Israel’s Institute for National Security Studies (INSS), describes as a “Zopa” - a zone of possible agreement.
On Monday Axios reported Israel had proposed a two-month truce in exchange for the release of all the 100-plus hostages still held in Gaza. Later that day CNN learned that Mossad chief David Barnea had suggested allowing Hamas leaders to go into exile as part of a broader ceasefire. On Tuesday, The Wall Street Journal said Hamas was now open to releasing some of the hostages in exchange for a pause in the fighting. And Reuters reported that Israel and Hamas had agreed in principle to a one-month truce, during which abductees would be freed and Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails released.
The sticking point there appears to be that Hamas wants a “package deal” which would include a second-phase agreement to end the war. But even if Israel were to okay this, it’s unlikely to feel compelled to keep its word. “I don’t think even [Hamas leader Yahya] Sinwar is under the impression that any hostage deal would in fact end the Israel-Hamas conflict,” Shelah tells CNN. “Either they don’t want to do a deal,” he says, or it’s just posturing for domestic consumption.
So how about exile? For now, at least, that seems a non-starter. Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani reportedly told US Secretary of State Antony Blinken that it “would never work.” Hamas leaders, it’s understood, would rather go down fighting in Gaza. They know living abroad wouldn’t stop them being knocked off by the Mossad. Unlike PLO founder Yasser Arafat, who went from exile in Beirut to exile in Tunis, Gaza is home to Hamas’ senior leadership. Moreover, even Israel doesn’t seem overly keen. “The exile of Sinwar is not Israel’s position and has not been offered by Israel,” a senior Israeli government official told me.

And while emissaries are talking, and the IDF and Hamas are fighting, pressure on the Israeli government to bring the hostages home is growing. Over the weekend, protesters camped outside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s home to demand a deal to bring them home. “Right now someone is being raped in a tunnel,” former hostage Aviva Siegel told the Knesset on Tuesday. On Wednesday, they held a day of action, blocking roads. On Thursday, they blocked humanitarian aid deliveries to Gaza. It also emerged that Netanyahu had taken to blaming Qatar for slow progress in getting the hostages freed - prompting a rebuke from the emirate’s foreign ministry.
An all-for-all deal is another option that’s been mooted since October 7. In other words, freeing all Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails - including those whom Israel says have blood on their hands - in exchange for freeing all the hostages. But even if such a scenario were on the table, a survey published by the Israel Democracy Institute on Wednesday found more than half of Israelis would be against it.
For now, though, such talk remains moot, with an Israeli official telling CNN there’s no concrete deal on the table. Pummeling Hamas, says former IDF General Israel Ziv, ought to help. “There is no doubt there’s not a single Israeli who doesn’t want the hostages home,” he tells CNN. “But at the same time we can’t gamble on the future of Israel [by leaving Hamas in control of Gaza]. And to have both we need to apply the most military pressure in order to get the maximum position in negotiations.”
Ziv reckons it will take up to a month longer for the IDF to crush Hamas brigades in Khan Younis, in southern Gaza, where intense fighting has been taking place; an UNRWA shelter there was struck on Wednesday, killing at least a dozen displaced Palestinians. Any deal Israel is looking to seal, says Ziv, would be more likely to come into effect once the Khan Younis operation is complete.
Of course, the endgame in Gaza isn’t only subject to military considerations, hostage families demanding a deal, or even pressure from the United States to wind things down. There’s also politics. The latest polls spell disaster for the career of Israel’s longest-serving leader. One recent survey found more than half of all Israelis believe Netanyahu’s war policies are born of self-interest. Gadi Eisenkot, a former chief of staff who sits in the war cabinet and whose own son was recently killed in Gaza, says he doesn’t believe that’s the case, but he does say that destroying Hamas is unrealistic.
With that in mind, this round of the Israel-Hamas war probably won’t be the last. “Israel should agree to almost any kind of deal that brings the hostages home,” says the INSS’s Shelah. “Because it won’t be the end of the war anyway.”"

Gauteng police spokesperson Dimakatso Nevhuhlwi said the suspect was arrested after he confessed before the Commission of Inquiry into the building fire, and that the 29-year-old man will appear in court soon on charges of arson, 76 counts of murder and 120 counts of attempted murder, according to SABC.
The exact cause of the fire is “yet to be determined,” it added.
At least 12 children were among those killed in the blaze last year. More than 50 people were injured.
The fire affected some of the country’s most vulnerable people while also highlighting a long-standing problem regarding abandoned buildings in South Africa.
The blaze took place in what is known locally as a “hijacked building” – a property abandoned by landlords and taken over by gangs or other groups and leased out mostly to migrants and South Africans lacking the means to afford other forms of housing.
Hijacked buildings often fail to meet basic safety regulations. CNN reported at the time that local authorities said the apartments in the building, intended to house only two or three people, were partitioned into sleeping areas to accommodate multiple inhabitants.
While South Africa has seen fires devastate informal settlements before, the Johannesburg fire is widely seen as the worst in recent memory.

N1MTIIHSX4_58AXGO3TF60EXKP,Utility giant PG&E agrees to $45 million settlement related to California’s second-largest wildfire,"By Taylor Romine and Aya Elamroussi, CNN","3 minute read Published 1:39 AM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/26/us/pacific-gas-electric-settlement-dixie-fire-california/,"Pacific Gas and Electric will pay $45 million in penalties for its role in the Dixie Fire – the second-largest wildfire in California’s history – that started after a tree fell and hit the company’s equipment in 2021, state regulators said Thursday.
The massive inferno ignited on July 13, 2021, when power lines owned by PG&E came in contact with a tree, according to Cal Fire. The wildfire burned for more than 100 days, charring 963,309 acres across five counties in Northern California before it was contained on October 25, 2021, according to Cal Fire.
The fire destroyed more than 1,300 structures, including much of the small community of Greenville, about 170 miles north of Sacramento.
The settlement with PG&E allocates $40 million in shareholder funding to make hard copy records into an electronic system, which will improve “the timeliness of inspections and preventive maintenance,” the California Public Utilities Commission said Thursday in a news release.
The company will also pay $2.5 million in fines to the California General Fund and $2.5 million to tribal communities impacted by the fires, the utilities commission added.
PG&E is “committed to making it right and making it safe for our customers and hometowns” and has resolved claims with the five impacted counties and “numerous individuals and families,” the company said in a statement to CNN.
PG&E accepted Cal Fire’s conclusion that a tree falling on its powerline caused the fire, but the company believes it “acted as a prudent operator,” the company said in a statement Thursday.
Related article California’s second-largest wildfire was sparked when power lines came in contact with a tree, Cal Fire says
“There is no evidence that PG&E consciously and willfully disregarded a known risk with regard to the ignition of the Dixie Fire,” the statement said. “We followed the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) requirements when inspecting, maintain and operating our system.”
PG&E noted the settlement will not impact costs for customers as it is not requesting rate recovery, adding that the agreement doesn’t “preclude PG&E from receiving cost recovery for costs related to the fire, including from the state’s Wildfire Fund.”
The utility company has been involved in several multi-million dollar settlements related to destructive wildfires in recent years.
In 2021, PG&E was fined $125 million for its role in the 2019 Kincade Fire in Sonoma County as part of a settlement with the California Public Utilities Commission.
And in 2020, PG&E pleaded guilty to 85 counts, including involuntary manslaughter and unlawfully starting the 2018 Camp Fire. The blaze was California’s deadliest, killing 85 people and destroying thousands of structures.
Last year, the company agreed to pay $50 million in a settlement connected to the deadly 2020 Zogg Fire and had criminal charges dropped against it.
Other penalties have included $1 million over the 2019 Easy Fire and fines over inspection issues, according to the utilities commission.
PG&E said Thursday that it is focused on reducing wildfire risk and cited its preventive power shutoffs during high fire risk conditions and its program to bury 10,000 miles of its power lines to reduce the risk of starting more blazes."

But Musk conceded that he wasn’t aware until recently that antisemitism was a pervasive problem in the United States.
Musk made the comments during an interview at a conference hosted by the European Jewish Association near the site of the Auschwitz in Poland. It comes after Musk faced a firestorm of backlash over antisemitic content on X, including a post with an antisemitic conspiracy theory that Musk himself amplified (and later apologized for in the wake of condemnation.)
“It’s never going to be zero if you’ve got 600 million people on the platform, expecting it to be zero is pretty unlikely,” Musk said of antisemitism on X. He added that X has “the least amount of antisemitism” compared to other major platforms, although he cited no evidence for that claim beyond referencing “outside audits that we’ve had done.”

Musk in November agreed with a post on X that claimed that Jewish communities push “hatred against Whites,” calling it the “actual truth.” The antisemitic conspiracy theory that Jews want to bring undocumented minority populations into Western countries to reduce White majorities in those nations has been espoused by online hate groups. Musk’s post led to a rebuke from the White House and a major exodus of advertisers.
Musk later apologized for the post, but told advertisers who halted their spending on X over concerns about antisemitic content to “go f**k” themselves.
Musk has also repeatedly criticized the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), an organization that fights antisemitism around the world, and faced criticism for allowing pro-Nazi content to remain live on X. (Musk had earlier also threatened to sue the ADL, but later walked back that threat.)
The billionaire has also faced pressure for promoting other conspiracy theories on X, including the dangerous Pizzagate theory.
In the wake of pressure over his leadership of the platform, Musk in November visited Israel, meeting the country’s leaders and walking through a kibbutz destroyed by Hamas in its October 7 attack.
Musk on Monday again expressed his support for the Israeli people, calling himself “aspirationally Jewish,” and said that hate against Jewish people must be addressed. As part of Monday’s event, the billionaire appears to have made a visit to Auschwitz along with his young son.
But despite concerns about an uptick in antisemitic content on X, Musk also admitted that he had been somewhat “naive” about the recent surge in antisemitism across the United States that has been recorded since the start of the Israel-Hamas war.
“I must admit to being somewhat frankly naive. In the circles that I move, I see almost no antisemitism,” he said.
The billionaire continued to tout his “free speech” vision for X, saying that “relentless pursuit of the truth is the goal with X and allowing people to say what they want to say, even if it’s controversial provided, provided that it does not break the law.”
Musk also encouraged more world leaders to post on the platform and appeared to reference his past controversial posts as “mistakes.” But he said he thinks that more than 169 million people follow him on X because “I really try to say things that I think are interesting or funny,” although “once a while I’ll do something dumb.”
“It’s only me doing these posts. I don’t have a team or anything,” he said. He encouraged other leaders to post on social media without filtering messages through staff. “Every once in a while you make a mistake. You can’t win them all. Nobody bats 1,000.”"

Dozens of people have been killed and wounded in the latest offensive in western Khan Younis, according to the Hamas-controlled health ministry in Gaza. Medical facilities including the Nasser Medical Complex, Al Amal Hospital and the Palestine Red Crescent Society headquarters are located in the area.
“The situation here is completely catastrophic. We didn’t sleep last night. The hospital is entirely besieged,” Ahmad Al Moghrabi, a doctor at the Nasser Medical Complex said in a video shared to his Instagram page Monday.
“There is no way for us to escape the hospital and no way for evacuation. The troops are all around, and the only roads for evacuation are filled with dead bodies,” he said.
The Nasser Medical Complex is receiving more serious injuries than it can accommodate, the health ministry said, adding that intensive care units are at capacity.
Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) staff at the Nasser hospital said “there is a sense of panic among staff, patients and displaced people sheltering inside the building,” as they could feel the ground shaking during the strikes, MSF said on social media.
The hospital wards are full and exit routes are blocked, preventing the evacuation of medical staff and patients from the hospital, MSF added.
Health officials also said that Israeli forces Monday stormed the Al Khair Hospital, west of Khan Younis, and detained a number of its medical staff, amid an ongoing “siege” of the area.
The Israeli military said it was targeting Hamas outposts, infrastructure, and command and control centers in Khan Younis and the action demanded “precise operations” due to the densely populated civilian areas.
﻿The military operation, which was launched on Sunday, is being led by Israel’s 98th Paratroopers Division and is expected to last for several days, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said, without providing further details on the timeline.
“Dismantling Hamas’ military framework in western Khan Younis is the heart of the logic behind the operation,” the statement added.
The IDF said it had seen militants at “sensitive sites” such as hospitals and shelters in the tightly packed civilian areas.
The Palestine Red Crescent Society said its headquarters and the Al-Amal Hospital, located in the same neighborhood, are “under siege” by Israeli forces, and soldiers are “targeting anyone who tries to move in the area.”
A field ambulance point has been established outside the Al-Amal neighborhood, where the medical facilities are located, to ensure a continuity of operations.
But the organization said the situation remains “extremely dangerous” and around 80 percent of the entrances and exits to Al-Amal are obstructed. Ambulance teams are facing “significant difficulties in reaching the wounded and injured due to the continuous bombardment in the governorate.”
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said he is “deeply concerned” by reports of the fighting, warning that that violence near Al-Amal hospital and the raid on Al-Khair not only “put patients and people seeking safety within these facilities at risk, but they also prevent newly injured people outside the hospitals from being reached and receiving care.”
Israel’s siege in Gaza has devastated swathes of the territory, diminished food, fuel and water supplies, and crushed the enclave’s medical system. Over 1.9 million Palestinians have been forcibly displaced, many multiple times, according to the UN’s agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA).
There are 16 out of 36 hospitals partially functioning across the strip, including nine in southern Gaza and seven in the north, the UN’s humanitarian affairs office reported on Sunday.
In southern Gaza, three hospitals – Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir El-Balah, and Nasser and Gaza European hospitals in Khan Younis – are “at risk of closure due to the issuance of evacuation orders in adjacent areas and the ongoing conduct of hostilities nearby,” OCHA said.
The Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza has been functioning to a “limited degree” since mid-January, added OCHA.
The Health Ministry said Monday that the number of Palestinians killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since October 7 rose to 25,295, with at least 63,000 injuries recorded. At least 190 people were killed and 340 injured in the last 24 hours, the Ministry statement said.

CNN cannot independently verify casualty figures in Gaza due to limited access to the area.
Hamas’s militant wing, the Al Qassam Brigades, said in a statement Monday that they were fighting in the western Khan Younis area, killing a number of Israeli soldiers with anti-personnel missiles.
Ahmed Naseem, a resident of Al-Amal neighborhood in Khan Younis, told CNN Monday that “intense” shelling of the area started in the early hours of Monday.
“There was heavy shelling in the area since the early hours of Monday. I could feel it intensely from the building I live in,” Nassem said. “We don’t even dare open the windows to see where these attacks are happening,” he said.
He said that he is “terrified of filming the scenes taking place nearby” because he fears he will be shot at, if a drone catches him in the act.
“We can’t even go to the rooftop because we cannot determine if drones will fire at us,” he said. “A few days ago water tanks were damaged, after drones fired right at them. My cousin, who was filling water at the time of the strike, was close to getting hit, but survived,” he added.

N650RZGMBP_TNSLKODOO8C44YQ,‘A sneak peek into hell’: Israel’s war in Gaza has cost this young woman her closest friends,"By Zahid Mahmood and Abeer Salman, CNN. Video by Julie Zink, CNN.","7 minute read Updated 7:10 AM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/24/middleeast/gaza-young-woman-loss-israel-war-intl-cmd/,"Nowara Diab was trying to drown out the sounds of airstrikes by listening to music, but it was not enough to shake the unsettled feeling in her gut.
Then her phone rang. It was a friend, who said they had heard that Maimana Jarada - Diab’s best friend - and her family had been killed by Israeli bombardment.
Her stomach was in knots as she felt herself panicking. Diab called Jarada’s number repeatedly but when there was no answer, it dawned on her that it was true - Jarada had been killed.
The 20-year-old says she broke down in tears as she felt the walls close in around her. The pain was even more intense for Diab because she had learned only 10 days earlier that another friend, Abraham Saidam, had also been killed by Israeli airstrikes.
“Living without them is the worst thing I’ve ever felt,” Diab said. “My heart aches every single day thinking that they’re not here and they’re not going to be here for me anymore, it pains me.”
She recalls how she froze in disbelief and started crying when she received the text message about Saidam.
“My mother looked at me to ask me what was wrong. I just covered my mouth with my hands and I was silent, everything was a blur and I was in complete shock.”
Despite repeated telecommunications blackouts amid Israel’s siege, Diab has managed to speak to CNN from Gaza through voice notes, text messages and videos about the life and friendships she has lost since October 7.
As Israel’s war approaches its fourth month, sustained bombardment by Israeli forces in Gaza has had a devastating impact on civilians there. United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres condemned the “utterly unacceptable” killing of civilians, renewing calls for an “immediate humanitarian ceasefire” to relieve the suffering of Palestinians in the strip, after the death toll surpassed 25,000, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry.
Throughout Israel’s war, launched in response to the October 7 Hamas attacks, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has repeatedly said that it only targets Hamas fighters, not civilians.
The enclave is one of the most densely populated areas in the world, with about 2.2 million inhabitants.
At the outset of the war, Diab watched as bombs fell near her home in Gaza City. She and her family knew they had to leave for their own safety.
“That night was dreadful, it was so scary, I was sure I was going to die,” she said.
After fleeing multiple times, Diab and her family are now staying in Rafah, southern Gaza, and are among the nearly 1.9 million people displaced across the territory, according to data from the United Nations’ Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA).
The Israeli bombardment and the ensuing humanitarian crisis have made the situation in the enclave unbearable, with the UN children’s agency, UNICEF, saying conditions for children are a “living hell.” The UN agency has described Gaza as the most dangerous place in the world to be a child and said the ongoing violence is exposing young people to devastating emotional trauma and psychological harm.
Walking through the streets, Diab said, she looks at the faces of fellow residents of Gaza and sees nothing but sadness and pain.
She says losing her best friends and being forced to leave behind the life she’s known has impacted her own mental health.
“I’m unable to feel anything, I don’t feel happy or sad or anything,” she said. “I don’t know why but all of this has consumed my energy, I cry every now and then but not the way I used to cry before, it’s very brief.”
Before the war, Diab was in her final year of college studying English and French literature at Al Azhar University. Like most young people, she enjoyed spending time with her friends and eating tasty food in the city.
Sometimes, when Diab closes her eyes, she can still remember the faint smell of her family home in northern Gaza, destroyed by bombing since October 7. “Even the flaws hold memories,” she said. “If my little sister drew something on the walls, it made my mother mad but it still holds a memory.”
Diab says she longs for the kind of problems she had before the war, like missing the bus for college or being bored in lectures. “I’m not able to do this anymore because my college was bombed, my house was bombed and I lost my best friend,” she said.
Diab describes her situation as worse than a nightmare because she’s unable to wake up from it.
“I laugh at myself when I say ‘my life’ now, because this is not my life, this is far away from my life,” she continued. “This is a sneak peek into hell.”
There’s rarely a moment when Jarada and Saidam leave Diab’s mind, she says, and she thinks of them whenever she looks through photos on her phone or sees other people with their friends.
“I just need her (Jarada) more than ever right now, but I know that she is in a better place,” Diab said.
“And I know that Abraham is happy now, I just know it, but I miss them.”
Diab and Jarada were childhood friends, with shared humor and interests creating a bond like that of sisters. In a video shared with CNN, the pair sit next to each other, giggling and lip syncing to a viral Tik Tok sound that originated from a Saturday Night Live skit about friendship.
“How would I even begin to describe Jarada? She’s just unique, a beautiful soul and a very artistic person,” Diab told CNN, adding that Jarada had “the biggest heart ever” and would create pictures for her.
Jarada painted a sunflower for Diab’s birthday last year. Diab says she accepted it unaware that this would be her friend’s last gift to her before she died at age 20.
When Diab and her family fled Gaza City, she had to leave the painting behind.
At college, Diab’s interest in the arts drew her to participate in a theater group, where she became good friends with Saidam after initially thinking he was quiet.
“He even looked like an introvert, but then we found out he’s an extrovert and was so funny and so exceptional,” she said.
Diab recalls how they both participated in a play based on Homer’s “Odyssey.” Saidam played King Odysseus and would make everybody laugh, she said.
The day Diab learned of her 27-year-old friend’s death, she cried a lot, but resolved to be strong because there was nothing more she could do, she said.
In Rafah, all Diab tries to do is to survive another day, she said, searching for essential items like cooking gas and water, both in very short supply.
“Can you imagine if you live your life without water? The most basic thing, just to drink, just to keep living,” said Diab. “Now everyone is being killed and if you’re not going to die from (airstrikes) we’re going to die from being hungry or thirsty.”
But despite everything that is happening, she says she will never forget the generosity and kindness of neighbors where they’ve sought refuge in Rafah and Khan Younis.
A neighbor in Rafah would give them plates of food and let Diab’s family shower at her home. “To see someone giving so much like this under these circumstances is surprising and she’s so nice,” Diab said.
“(Another family) came over and offered water to shower and to charge our phones and within an hour, our phones came back fully charged,” she said – no small thing in Gaza, where fuel shortages mean electricity is hard to access.
Although aid has entered the enclave, it has done so under challenging conditions and the UN has repeatedly warned that the volume getting in remains “woefully inadequate.”
Diab says extreme thirst has driven her family to drink water suitable only for laundry or showering.
Families across Gaza are having to consume unclean water because of Israel’s siege, adding to the risk of ill health. Earlier this month, UNICEF warned that the intensifying conflict has threatened the lives of over 1.1 million children, putting them in a deadly cycle of violence, malnutrition and disease.
With airstrikes pummeling southern Gaza, Diab fears for her safety in Rafah, saying there’s not an inch in the enclave which is truly safe, despite Israel’s declaration of a safe zone and regular announcements of times when they will stop bombing so people can move safely.
And although she wishes the war to be over, she lacks hope for the future.
“We’re going to see Gaza City wiped out, we’re gonna see it with our own eyes, which will be heartbreaking,” she said of any future return to her home.
“Imagine going back, after all of this is over and there’s going to be nothing to go back to, not a college, not a house, nothing. So even when this is over, there is more agony and pain waiting for us.”"

Gauteng police spokesperson Dimakatso Nevhuhlwi said the suspect was arrested after he confessed before the Commission of Inquiry into the building fire, and that the 29-year-old man will appear in court soon on charges of arson, 76 counts of murder and 120 counts of attempted murder, according to SABC.
The exact cause of the fire is “yet to be determined,” it added.
At least 12 children were among those killed in the blaze last year. More than 50 people were injured.
The fire affected some of the country’s most vulnerable people while also highlighting a long-standing problem regarding abandoned buildings in South Africa.
The blaze took place in what is known locally as a “hijacked building” – a property abandoned by landlords and taken over by gangs or other groups and leased out mostly to migrants and South Africans lacking the means to afford other forms of housing.
Hijacked buildings often fail to meet basic safety regulations. CNN reported at the time that local authorities said the apartments in the building, intended to house only two or three people, were partitioned into sleeping areas to accommodate multiple inhabitants.
While South Africa has seen fires devastate informal settlements before, the Johannesburg fire is widely seen as the worst in recent memory.

NA1G0H1IXJ_ZG3TYFDKURLZ229,US carries out airstrikes on Iranian-backed militias in Iraq,"By Oren Liebermann, Haley Britzky and Natasha Bertrand, CNN","5 minute read Updated 11:54 AM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/23/politics/us-strikes-iran-backed-militia-iraq/,"The US carried out airstrikes in Iraq targeting facilities used by Iranian-backed militias in the country on Tuesday following repeated attacks on US forces, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced in a statement.
The strikes targeted three facilities used by Iranian-backed Kataib Hezbollah and other Tehran-affiliated groups in Iraq.
Austin said in the statement that the strikes “are in direct response to a series of escalatory attacks against US and coalition personnel in Iraq and Syria” by Iranian-backed militia groups.
US Central Command also released a statement on Tuesday saying US forces “conducted unilateral airstrikes” targeting “KH headquarters, storage, and training locations for rocket, missile, and one-way attack UAV capabilities.”
According to a US defense official, the strikes were carried out in two sites in western Iraq, including Al-Qa’im near the Syrian border, as well as Jurf al-Sakhar south of Baghdad.
“I am grateful for both the skill and professionalism with which our personnel planned and conducted these strikes and the continued efforts of our troops on the ground as they work with regional partners to further dismantle and degrade ISIS,” Austin said in Tuesday’s statement.
“The President and I will not hesitate to take necessary action to defend them and our interests. We do not seek to escalate conflict in the region. We are fully prepared to take further measures to protect our people and our facilities. We call on these groups and their Iranian sponsors to immediately cease these attacks,” Austin added.
The airstrikes killed up to seven Kataib Hezbollah fighters, according to to US defense officials, who on Wednesday cited the US’ preliminary battle damage assessment.
The strikes also destroyed two headquarters buildings and an intelligence facility used by the Iran-backed militant group and associated groups, the officials said.
At least one Kataib Hezbollah fighter was killed and two were injured following the US airstrikes, according to a statement from the Popular Mobilization Front operation command.
Jafar al-Hussaini, the military spokesman for Kataib Hezbollah, wrote on X that the group will “continue to strike the strongholds of the enemies, in support of our people in Gaza until the brutal killing machine backed by America stops, and the complete siege is lifted. This is the promise of the free people.”
The strikes come just days after US personnel at Al-Asad Air Base in Iraq were injured in a ballistic missile and rocket attack on the base. While most missiles and rockets were intercepted by the base’s air defenses, some projectiles made impact, US Central Command said over the weekend.
The initial assessment is that Kataib Hezbollah was responsible for the ballistic missile attack, the defense official said.
Pentagon spokesman Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said Tuesday that a total of four US troops were diagnosed with traumatic brain injury as a result of the attack, and all had since returned to duty.
The strikes on Tuesday are the first in Iraq since the beginning of the month, when the US targeted a member of an Iranian proxy group operating in the country who one US official said had “US blood on his hands.” They also come after multiple strikes against the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen over the last week and a half, as the US looks to rein in the aggressive actions of Iranian-backed groups in the Middle East amid heightened tensions in the region.
US forces in Iraq and Syria have come under attack at least 151 times since attacks began on October 17, according to a US official — 10 days after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7. And while officials have not directly connected the two situations, the ongoing attacks on US forces have fed into heightened tensions and concerns about broader conflict breaking out in the region, particularly when coupled with the regular attacks on commercial shipping by the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen.
“We’ve continued to see attacks on our forces since October 17th in Iraq and Syria. The attack that we saw over the weekend was just a larger scale attack,” Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh said Monday. “But again, we don’t seek conflict, we don’t want to see this widen out to a regional war, we don’t want … to continue to see our forces being put at risk.”
The US’ actions against the Iran-backed militias in Iraq have appeared to strain tensions between the US and the Iraqi government. Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani told Reuters this month that that there should be a “quick” time frame for the US-led coalition’s exit from the country. The US has maintained that it is in Iraq at the invitation of its government, as part of the ongoing mission to defeat ISIS.
“There is a need to reorganize this relationship so that it is not a target or justification for any party, internal or foreign, to tamper with stability in Iraq and the region,” Sudani said. Ryder said at the Pentagon on Tuesday that he was not aware “of any official notifications” to the Pentagon regarding a withdrawal of US forces.
The US has carried out a number of strikes in Iraq and Syria in response to the attacks on coalition forces, placing blame squarely on Iran for supporting the militia groups carrying out the attacks.
In October, following US airstrikes on facilities linked to Iranian-backed militias, a senior defense official said Tehran was “the center of gravity” for the attacks, and that “Iranian fingerprints are all over this.”
“Tehran and Iranian senior leaders are funding, arming, equipping, training and directing a whole plethora of militia groups across the region, and they have escalated attacks against US forces since October 17, which is why we took self-defense action,” the official said.
While the attacks in Iraq and Syria have been ongoing, the US has also been managing regular attacks by the Houthis in Yemen on commercial shipping. The strikes on Tuesday followed strikes on the Houthis on Monday, carried out by the US and UK, which a senior official said were successful in striking weapons storage sites, drone systems, and missiles.
The US also conducted strikes Tuesday evening against two Houthi anti-ship missiles that were aimed into the Southern Red Sea and were prepared to launch, according to US Central Command.
“U.S. forces identified the missiles in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen and determined that they presented an imminent threat to merchant vessels and the U.S. Navy ships in the region. U.S. forces subsequently struck and destroyed the missiles in self-defense,” CENTCOM said in a statement.

NB6L4FIIEA_6TK4ZC31U4NWGLQ,Kenya court blocks deployment of police officers to Haiti,"By Larry Madowo and Nimi Princewill, CNN","2 minute read Published 8:04 AM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/26/africa/kenyacourt-blocks-deployment-of-police-officers-to-haiti/,"A judge in Kenya has barred the East African nation from deploying 1,000 police officers to Haiti to lead a UN-backed multinational force to restore security in the Caribbean nation.
High Court judge Chacha Mwita ruled on Friday that President William Ruto and his National Security Council do not have the authority to send police officers to Haiti or any other country under Kenyan law.He added that the long-delayed deployment under a deal financed by the United States “contravenes the constitution and the law and is therefore unconstitutional, illegal and invalid.”
In October, the State Department pledged $100 million to support a multinational force in Haiti after the UN Security Council voted to approve it to quell gang violence in the island nation. Kenya volunteered to lead it and got necessary approvals from its cabinet and parliament.
But Kenyan politician Ekuru Aukot led a legal challenge to the planned in deployment in court, terming it unconstitutional. The high court ruling agreed with him.
“There’s no reciprocal arrangement between Kenya and Haiti and there can be no legitimate deployment of police officers to Haiti,” Judge Mwita said when he read his ruling in Nairobi.
The ruling poses a potential setback for Kenya’s peacekeeping mission to the Caribbean nation having previously supported similar initiatives by the UN and the African Union.

It is not immediately clear whether the Kenyan government would appeal the ruling or the extent to which the domestic legal battle could complicate the deployment of the multinational force to Haiti, which it spearheads alongside Haiti’s neighbors – Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, and Jamaica.
Kenya’s UN representative Martin Kimani told the Security Council Thursday that his country “has made substantial progress … including taking legal, administrative steps” in its preparation for the Haiti mission and was awaiting the outomce of today’s ruling. Kimani has yet to react to the verdict.
Gang violence rose by more than 100% in Haiti last year with over 8000 victims documented, according to UN data.
“The Haitian people have had enough of the armed gangs’ savagery,” Haiti’s foreign minister Jean Victor Geneus told the UN council while urging a speedy deployment of the multinational force.
“Every passing day that this long-awaited support has not yet arrived is one day too many,” he added."
NCYBGBVL5E_BDI5JWQUZU1AN7B,"Native American communities have the highest suicide rates, yet interventions are scarce","By Cheryl Platzman Weinstock, KFF Health News","8 minute read Updated 7:09 PM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240122,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/22/health/native-american-communities-suicide-rates-interventions-kff-health-news/,"Editor’s Note: If you or someone you know may be experiencing a mental health crisis, contact the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline by dialing or texting “988.” To reach the Native and Strong Lifeline, call “988” and press 4.
Amanda MorningStar has watched her children struggle with mental health issues, including suicidal thoughts. She often wonders why.
“We’re family-oriented and we do stuff together. I had healthy pregnancies. We’re very protective of our kids,” said MorningStar, who lives in Heart Butte, Montana, a town of about 600 residents on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation.
Yet despite her best efforts, MorningStar said, her family faces a grim reality that touches Native American communities nationwide. About a year ago, her 15-year-old son, Ben, was so grief-stricken over his cousin’s suicide and two classmates’ suicides that he tried to kill himself.
“Their deaths made me feel like part of me was not here. I was gone. I was lost,” said Ben MorningStar.
He spent more than a week in an inpatient mental health unit, but once home, he was offered sparse mental health resources.

Non-Hispanic Indigenous people in the United States die by suicide at higher rates than any other racial or ethnic group, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The suicide rate among Montana’s Native American youth is more than five times the statewide rate for the same age group, according to the Montana Budget and Policy Center. Montana ranked third-worst among states for suicide deaths in 2020, and 10% of all suicides in the state from 2017 through 2021 were among Native Americans, even though they represent only 6.5% of the state’s population.
Despite decades of research into suicide prevention, suicide rates among Indigenous people have remained stubbornly high, especially among Indigenous people ages 10 to 24, according to the CDC. Experts say that’s because the national strategy for suicide prevention isn’t culturally relevant or sensitive to Native American communities’ unique values.
Suicide rates have increased among other racial and ethnic minorities, too, but to lesser degrees.
Systemic issues and structural inequities, including underfunded and under-resourced services from the federal Indian Health Service, also hamper suicide prevention in Indigenous communities. “I worried who was going to keep my son safe. Who could he call or reach out to? There are really no resources in Heart Butte,” said Amanda MorningStar.
Ben MorningStar said he is doing better. He now knows not to isolate himself when problems occur and that “it is OK to cry, and I got friends I can go to when I have a bad day. Friends are better than anything,” he said.
His twice-a-month, 15-minute virtual telehealth behavioral therapy visits from IHS were recently reduced to once a month.
Mary Cwik, a psychologist and senior scientist at the Center for Indigenous Health at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, said the systemic shortcomings MorningStar has witnessed are symptoms of a national strategy that isn’t compatible with Indigenous value systems.
“It is not clear that the creation of the national strategy had Indigenous voices informing the priorities,” Cwik said.

The cause of high suicide rates in Indigenous communities is complex. Native Americans often live with the weight of more adverse childhood experiences than other populations — things such as emotional, physical, and sexual abuse, intimate partner violence, substance misuse, mental illness, parental separation or divorce, incarceration, and poverty.
Those adverse experiences stack upon intergenerational trauma caused by racial discrimination, colonization, forced relocation, and government-sanctioned abduction to boarding schools that persisted until the 1970s.
“There’s no way that communities shaped by these forces for so long will get rid of their problems fast by medical services. A lot of people in Indian Country struggle to retain hope. It’s easy to conclude that nothing can fix it,” said Joseph P. Gone, a professor of anthropology and global health and social medicine at Harvard University and member of the Gros Ventre (Aaniiih) tribal nation of Montana.
Most tribal nations are interested in collaborative research, but funding for such work is hard to come by, said Gone. So is funding for additional programs and services.
Stephen O’Connor, who leads the suicide prevention research program at the Division of Services and Intervention Research at the National Institute of Mental Health, said, “Given the crisis of suicide in Native American populations, we need more funding and continued sustained funding for research in this area.”
Getting grants for scientific research from NIMH, which is part of the National Institutes of Health, can be challenging, especially for smaller tribes, he said.
Officials at the NIMH and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration said that they continue to build research partnerships with tribal nations and that they recently launched new grants and multiple programs that are culturally informed and evidence-based to reduce suicide in tribal communities.
NIMH researchers are even adjusting a commonly used suicide screening tool to incorporate more culturally appropriate language for Indigenous people.
Teresa Brockie, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins School of Nursing, is one of a small but growing number of researchers, many of whom are Indigenous, who study suicide prevention and intervention strategies that respect Indigenous beliefs and customs. Those strategies include smudging — the practice of burning medicinal plants to cleanse and connect people with their creator.
Without this understanding, research is hampered because people in tribal communities have “universal mistrust of health care and other colonized systems that have not been helpful to our people or proven to be supportive,” said Brockie, a member of Fort Belknap reservation’s Aaniiih Tribe.
Brockie is leading one of the first randomized controlled trials studying Indigenous people at Fort Peck. The project aims to reduce suicide risk by helping parents and caregivers deal with their own stress and trauma and develop positive coping skills. It’s also working to strengthen children’s tribal identity, connectivity, and spirituality.
In 2015, she reported on a study she led in 2011 to collect suicide data at the Fort Peck reservation in northeastern Montana. She found that adverse childhood experiences have a cumulative effect on suicide risk and also that tribal identity, strong connections with friends and family, and staying in school were protective against suicide.
In Arizona, Cwik is collaborating with the White Mountain Apache Tribe to help leaders there evaluate the impact of a comprehensive suicide surveillance system they created. So far, the program has reduced the overall Apache suicide rate by 38.3 % and the rate among young people ages 15 to 24 by 23%, according to the American Public Health Association.
Several tribal communities are attempting to implement a similar system in their communities, said Cwik.
Still, many tribal communities rely on limited mental health resources available through the Indian Health Service. One person at IHS is tasked with addressing suicide across almost 600 tribal nations.
Pamela End of Horn, a social worker and national suicide prevention consultant at IHS, said the Department of Veterans Affairs “has a suicide coordinator in every medical center across the U.S., plus case managers, and they have an entire office dedicated to suicide prevention. In Indian Health Service it is just me and that’s it.”

End of Horn, a member of the Oglala Lakota Sioux Tribe of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota, blames politics for the discrepancy.
“Tribal leaders are pushing for more suicide prevention programs but lack political investment. The VA has strong proactive activities related to suicide and the backing of political leaders and veterans’ groups,” she said.
It is also hard to get mental health professionals to work on remote reservations, while VA centers tend to be in larger cities.
Even if more mental health services were available, they can be stigmatizing, re-traumatizing, and culturally incongruent for Indigenous people.
Many states are using creative strategies to stop suicide. A pilot project by the Rural Behavioral Health Institute screened more than 1,000 students in 10 Montana schools from 2020 to 2022. The governor of Montana is hoping to use state money to expand mental health screening for all schools.
Experts say the kinds of strategies best suited to prevent suicide among Native Americans should deliver services that reflect their diversity, traditions, and cultural and language needs.
That’s what Robert Coberly, 44, was searching for when he needed help.
Coberly began having suicidal thoughts at 10 years old.
“I was scared to live and scared to die. I just didn’t care,” said Coberly, who is a member of the Tulalip Tribes.
He suffered in private for nearly a decade until he almost died in a car crash while driving drunk. After a stay at a rehabilitation center, Coberly remained stable. Years later, though, his suicidal thoughts came rushing back when one of his children died. He sought treatment at a behavioral health center where some of the therapists were Indigenous. They blended Western methodologies with Indigenous customs, which, he said, “I was craving and what I needed.”
Part of his therapy included going to a sweat lodge for ritual steam baths as a means of purification and prayer.

Coberly was a counselor for the Native and Strong Lifeline, the first 988 crisis line for Indigenous people. He is now one of the crisis line tribal resource specialists connecting Indigenous people from Washington state with the resources they need.
“It’s about time we had this line. To be able to connect people with resources and listen to them is something I can’t explain except that I was in a situation where I wanted someone to hear me and talk to,” said Coberly.
Amanda MorningStar said she still worries about her son night and day, but he tries to reassure her.
“I go to sleep and wake up the next day to keep it going,” Ben MorningStar said. “I only get one chance. I might as well make the best of it.”

NDIPUDD5R4_G4T2Y8W0UE6IBDA,UAW endorses Biden as he prepares to fight Trump for union workers,"By MJ Lee, Jeff Zeleny, Betsy Klein, Samantha Waldenberg, Chris Isidore and Michael Williams, CNN","5 minute read Updated 4:42 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/24/politics/biden-uaw-endorsement/,"The United Auto Workers union on Wednesday endorsed President Joe Biden, a long-awaited announcement that is an important pickup for the president.
“Look, I kept my commitment to be the most pro-union president ever,” Biden said after receiving the UAW’s endorsement at the group’s conference in Washington, DC, on Wednesday afternoon. “I’m proud you have my back. Let me just say I’m honored to have your back, and you have mine.”
The endorsement comes as the Biden campaign is making a full pivot to the general election, pointing to former President Donald Trump’s victory in the Republican primary in New Hampshire Tuesday as a clear sign that he is poised to emerge as the GOP presidential nominee.
The president and union leadership have long courted each other. Although it’s a key endorsement for Biden, the backing from union leadership may not convince all of the rank-and-file to vote for the president in November. Biden won the endorsement of the UAW in the 2020 campaign, even though many rank-and-file members supported Trump.
Ahead of endorsing Biden, UAW President Shawn Fain said the choice union workers face in 2024 “isn’t about who you like. It’s not about your party. It’s not this b——- about age. It’s not about anything, but our best shot at taking back power for the working class.”
He then referred to Trump using the worst insult that can be made in front of a room full of union workers.
“Donald Trump is a scab,” Fain said. “Donald Trump is a billionaire, and that’s who he represents. … Donald Trump stands against everything we stand for as a union – as a society.”
The choice between Trump and Biden, Fain said, was clear.
“Joe Biden bet on the American worker while Donald Trump blamed the American workers,” he said. “We need to know who’s going to sit in the most powerful seat in the world and help us win as a united working class. So if our endorsement must be earned, Joe Biden has earned it.”
Trump has made appealing to union voters a key part of his political strategy, in no small part by targeting disaffected voters in parts of the Midwest who believe the Democratic Party has left them behind.
Biden, meanwhile, has continued to cast himself as the most pro-union leader. He joined members of the UAW in Michigan on the picket line last year in the middle of a strike – an unprecedented move for a sitting president.
“I will say, I was so damn proud to stand in that picket line with you,” Biden told the crowd on Wednesday, prompting cheers.
“Honest to God, I’ve always believed that the union movement in America is important because it produces the best-skilled workers in the world. That’s what happens. It’s good for everybody.”
But just because the union endorsed Biden for a second term doesn’t mean it is lockstep with the president on every issue. In December, UAW released a statement calling for a ceasefire in Israel and Gaza – a move that Biden has himself resisted. The gap between the union’s position on Israel and the president’s briefly revealed itself during his speech Wednesday, when a member of the audience unfurled a Palestinian flag and shouted, “Ceasefire now!”
The protest was brief and did not derail the president’s remarks – unlike the abortion-rights rally on Tuesday where Biden was interrupted more than a dozen times by protesters demanding a ceasefire.
The endorsement could be a factor in the battleground state of Michigan in November. Trump won the Great Lakes State in 2016 and Biden won it narrowly in 2020. The race is expected to be close again in November as Biden and the former president – should he win his party’s presidential nomination – both work to stake out their claim to be the champion of the working class.
The UAW had kept its powder dry on a potential endorsement, declining last year to join a cadre of high-profile unions in backing Biden’s reelection campaign ahead of high-stakes contract negotiations. At the time, the union cited concerns over Biden’s policies that would encourage a transition to electric vehicles.
The UAW has more than 400,000 members, and Biden – who has long relied on the political backing of unions – has touted its support in the past. The president has called American autoworkers “the most skilled autoworkers in the world.” The group’s membership is mostly concentrated in Michigan, a presidential election battleground.
Fain previously warned this cycle that “another Donald Trump presidency would be a disaster.”
While Biden took care to show his support on the picket line, the administration lacked the legal or legislative authority to act as a participant in the negotiations, which ended in late October.
Rep. Dan Kildee, a Michigan Democrat, dismissed concerns Tuesday that Biden had not yet received the union’s endorsement.
“No, it doesn’t,” Kildee told CNN’s Poppy Harlow when pressed on whether he was worried the endorsement had not yet been made.
“The UAW had other issues on its mind than injecting presidential politics into the 2023 challenges. They had an unprecedented strike. With the support of President Biden, they received an unprecedented contract. So, when I talk to auto workers, they understand that. And, you know, I’m very hopeful that organized labor generally, and the UAW specifically, will - will remember Joe Biden’s record and will stand with him as a result,” Kildee added.
Trump has found support among the rank-and-file of the UAW despite Fain’s strong criticisms and union leadership’s consistent support of Democratic candidates. On the same day that Biden visited a UAW picket line in Michigan, Trump spoke at a non-union auto shop in suburban Detroit – drawing the ire of the union.
Fain told CNN in December that he felt like the former president has never truly had the backs of UAW members.
“You go back to 2019, when he was a sitting president, and GM was on strike for, you know, 40 days. What did he say about the strikers in? What did he do to assist? What did you do show he cared about those workers, I mean, he was silent,” Fain said.
“You go back to 2015, when he was running for the presidency. And he talked about, we need to do a rotation of all these good paying jobs in the Midwest somewhere else, not out of the country, but somewhere else in the country, and have these workers begging for their jobs back. You go back to the economic recession, and he jumped on ‘The bandwagon of the UAW is to blame for everything wrong with these companies.’ And so those are facts, they’re indisputable.”

NFKDBK95E8_XI9QT6T4IIBS467,"Biden family business associate had no contact with Joe Biden, lawyer says","By Annie Grayer, CNN","4 minute read Updated 5:44 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/25/politics/mervyn-yan-gop-investigators-interview/,"House Republicans interviewed a former business associate of Hunter and James Biden on Thursday who told Congress ahead of the interview he had “no contact” with President Joe Biden, according to a letter obtained by CNN.
The letter sent to House Oversight Chairman James Comer on Wednesday is the latest example of a witness undercutting Republican allegations related to their impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden.
The committees conducting the investigation subpoenaed Mervyn Yan in November for his testimony, claiming that he may know whether the president had been involved in his family’s business dealings, an unproven allegation that rests at the heart of their probe.
But Yan’s lawyer wrote to Congress on Wednesday to refute that allegation.
“Throughout his interactions with Hunter and James Biden, Mr. Yan never met, spoke to, did business with, or had any personal or professional communication with President Biden, who was then the former Vice President of the United States,” Yan attorney Soumya Dayananda wrote to Comer, a Republican from Kentucky.
“He never heard mention of President Biden with respect to any of the transactions pursued by Hudson West III and is unaware of any involvement President Biden may have had with his son’s business pursuits,” Dayananda added.
As a result, Dayananda wrote, “Mr. Yan does not possess any materials or information bearing on President Biden’s alleged involvement in his family’s business dealings.”
Dayananda also mentioned that Comer never responded to a letter she wrote to him last year, outlining that her client was a private citizen who never worked with the president, and therefore should not be a target of congressional oversight.
“He is not a public official and he is not himself a valid target for inquiry. He has had no professional contact or communication with President Biden at any time,” Dayananda wrote in May to Comer.
Dayananda’s letter in May was in response to a separate subpoena from the House Oversight Committee for a broad array of documents related to his business dealings.
Yan, a Chinese-American businessman, worked with Hunter and James Biden, the president’s son and brother, on a joint venture involving a Chinese-backed energy company that dissolved in 2018, when Joe Biden was not in office. Yan worked as an “independent consultant” on the joint venture, known as Hudson West III, between Hunter Biden and a Chinese executive named Gongwen Dong, according to Dayananda.
As part of the joint venture agreement, the president’s son drew a monthly compensation of $100,000 and the president’s brother drew a monthly compensation of $65,000, Yan’s lawyer added. Yan, per Dayananda, is unaware of where the funding for the initial $5 million operating budget originated from.
Hunter Biden began to “investigate potential infrastructure projects” with the Chinese-backed energy company, CEFC, in 2015, when Joe Biden was vice president, according to the recent indictment in the federal tax case against the president’s son.
A House Oversight Committee aide told CNN that Republican members of the panel are concerned about the veracity of the letter Yan’s attorney sent based on the facts and information obtained in the investigation and that is why Yan is being cross examined about claims contained in the letter.
Following the interview, Comer said in a statement provided to CNN, “Mervyn Yan admitted on the record the Bidens had no experience in the energy and infrastructure sectors and was not sure what they brought to the table. His testimony raises many questions about the Bidens’ dealings with the Chinese government linked energy firm.”
“We will release the transcript from Mervyn Yan’s interview soon,” Comer added.
Meanwhile, the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, Rep. Jamie Raskin, said in a statement on X after the interview, “Mervyn Yan testified to the Committee today that he has no evidence of wrongdoing by President Biden and that, to his knowledge, President Biden was not involved in, did not profit from, and took no official actions in relation to his family’s business dealings.”
Republicans have continued to dig in on Hunter Biden’s foreign business dealings and have raised concerns about the transactions that came out of the joint venture with Yan.

NHWFYF6QT9_6AC7RW3QMQO2MT9,Boeing faces new safety alert over earlier generation of 737s,"By Gregory Wallace and Hanna Ziady, CNN","3 minute read Updated 5:09 AM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240122,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/22/business/boeing-737-earlier-generation-faa/,"(CNN) — The US Federal Aviation Administration has urged airlines to inspect so-called door plugs on an earlier version of Boeing 737 airplanes, after one blew out of the side of the newer Max model during an Alaska Airlines flight earlier this month.
The FAA on Sunday said airlines operating the Boeing 737-900ER model should “visually inspect mid-exit door plugs to ensure the door is properly secured,” referring to the panel that plugs the hole where a mid-plane exit would be.
“The Boeing 737-900ER is not part of the newer Max fleet but has the same door plug design,” the US aviation regulator added in what is known as a safety alert for operators.
Boeing’s shares fell almost 3% in premarket trade Monday. The safety alert on a plane that has been in service for almost two decades will deal a fresh blow to the company, which has faced repeated quality and safety issues with its aircraft in recent years, leading to the long-term grounding of some jets and delayed deliveries of others.
The planemaker’s stock has declined about 14% since a door plug on one of its Max 9 airplanes shot out from the side of the fuselage only a few minutes into a flight from Portland, Oregon, to Ontario, California, forcing the pilot to make an emergency landing.
In a statement shared with CNN, Boeing said it “fully” supports the FAA and its own customers in the regulator’s latest action.
Since the terrifying incident just over two weeks ago, some airlines have inspected the earlier-built Boeing planes and observed “findings with bolts” holding the door plugs in place, according to the FAA. The regulator did not specify what the findings were.
After recent inspections of the newer Max 9s, United Airlines and Alaska Airlines have also both found loose bolts.
United, Delta Airlines and Alaska Airlines told CNN Monday that they had already started inspections of their Boeing 737-900ER aircraft and did not anticipate any disruptions to operations. “We have had no findings to date,” Alaska Airlines said.
According to data on Boeing’s website, it has delivered a total of around 500 of these airplanes to carriers that also include Turkish Airlines.
Alaska said in a statement it began inspecting its 737-900ER planes several days ago and had “no findings” so far. It expects to complete the remainder of its 737-900ER inspections without pulling the planes from service.
The FAA notice does not ground the earlier generation of plane. Instead, it recommends that airlines inspect the door plugs and the bolts “as soon as possible.”
The newer Max 9 aircraft continue to be grounded in the United States. The agency said it continued to review data collected from inspections of 40 sample aircraft as it considered how to determine if the planes were safe to fly again.

NJYY47MVN7_TDG6IHTAHV922BW,Biden administration to pause proposed natural gas export projects until federal review is complete,"By Ella Nilsen, CNN","4 minute read Updated 11:24 AM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/26/politics/natural-gas-export-projects-pause-biden-administration/,"The Biden administration will pause federal approval for several pending liquified natural gas export projects as it undertakes a broad review of the massive increase in US exports to foreign nations, administration officials announced Friday – roiling the US gas industry and handing a temporary victory to climate groups.
US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm and White House National Climate Adviser Ali Zaidi said the recent boom in US liquified natural gas exports, especially to Europe following Russia’s war in Ukraine, prompted the need for a thorough analysis of the entire industry in the US – which hasn’t been done since 2018.
“The pause will not affect already authorized exports, nor will it impact our ability to supply our allies in Europe, Asia, or other recipients of already authorized exports,” Granholm told reporters.
The US is the world’s largest exporter of natural gas; new liquified natural gas projects that are currently under construction here would triple the nation’s current export capacity, Granholm said. Granholm and Zaidi said the review would, among other things, examine whether US producers are sending too much natural gas overseas instead of using it at home to help power the electric grid.

In a statement, President Joe Biden tied the pause to the climate crisis, which is drastically raising global temperatures and fueling extreme weather.
“This pause on new LNG approvals sees the climate crisis for what it is: the existential threat of our time,” Biden said. “During this period, we will take a hard look at the impacts of LNG exports on energy costs, America’s energy security, and our environment. While MAGA Republicans willfully deny the urgency of the climate crisis, condemning the American people to a dangerous future, my Administration will not be complacent. We will not cede to special interests.”
Natural gas is big business for the US fossil fuel industry, which has recently been exporting much of the product to other countries, particularly after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Europe’s subsequent move away from Russian gas. US companies have stepped in to fill that gap, compressing or freezing gas at export terminals and shipping it across the ocean in enormous tankers.
The review will also look at the climate implications of fracking and shipping billions of cubic feet of natural gas overseas, Zaidi said. The planet-warming superpollutant methane is the main ingredient of natural gas, and the Biden administration has taken several actions to try to crack down on methane leaks as part of its climate agenda.
“We take this action in a context where the United States has been an unwavering partner to our allies in Europe who, by the way, are our partner in calling for a transition away from fossil fuels,” Zaidi told reporters.
Sixty members of the European Parliament said Thursday that Europe did not need a hike in LNG from the US and said Europe was being used as an excuse for more drilling.

“We are concerned that a false depiction of European energy needs is now being used as an excuse by the fossil fuel industry and their allies to dramatically expand US LNG exports to the global market,” the lawmakers said in a letter Thursday addressed to Biden and Granholm.
The Europe lawmakers acknowledged natural gas from the US had been helpful in weaning off Russian gas. But the continent’s consumption of natural gas is already being met, they said.
“Even with current demand, the European LNG import infrastructure has been used at only 60% in 2023, suggesting that there is likely no infrastructure bottleneck impeding more US LNG from reaching EU markets, and that an LNG facility build-out in the US would be even less needed.”
Senior administration officials said the pause on four pending projects in front of the Department of Energy would take several months as federal scientists and experts do their analysis. The analysis will then undergo a public comment period, officials said.
And senior administration officials said the pause on pending projects wouldn’t yet impact CP2, the largest proposed gas export project to date in the US, which could ultimately export up to 20 million tons of natural gas a year. CP2 is still pending final approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, after which it would head to the Energy Department. However, CP2 development could effectively be paused if FERC approves it while the Energy Department review is ongoing.
Eight other LNG projects that the Biden administration has already approved won’t be impacted by the pause.
Fossil fuel industry groups decried the administration’s decision.
“This is nothing more than a broken promise to US allies, and it’s time for the administration to stop playing politics with global energy security,” American Petroleum Institute president and CEO Mike Sommers said in a statement.
Climate and environmental justice advocates on the Gulf Coast, meanwhile, celebrated it as a major victory and vowed to continue fighting new LNG projects.
“They made a monumental decision in this fight for climate justice,” said Roishetta Ozane, the founder of Vessel Project of Louisiana, a mutual aid organization. She added that Biden’s decision “sets the stage for potential rejections and slows down the progress of these projects.”
Ozane is a resident of Sulphur, Louisiana – a town near several major LNG terminals. “Living in a community that smells like rotten eggs and chemicals, I know that these facilities are not in the public interest,” she said."
NPWZAC8NI2_OLTD1L5HV4N1GIC,What to know about the Fani Willis allegations and the election subversion case,"By Dan Berman, Paula Reid, Jason Morris, Nick Valencia and Zachary Cohen, CNN","5 minute read Updated 11:40 AM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/23/politics/fani-willis-allegations-election-subversion-case/,"The allegations of an improper relationship between the Fulton County district attorney and a prosecutor she hired has roiled one of the major cases against former President Donald Trump.
The situation is another twist in the multiyear effort to punish those involved in attempting to subvert the 2020 presidential election won by Joe Biden.
Legally, the situation is unlikely to kill the case, but this could be a big political gift to Trump, who is seeking to discredit the Georgia charges as illegitimate and politically motivated.
Here’s what to know:
Fani Willis, as the Fulton County district attorney, hired Nathan Wade as an outside consultant to work as a special prosecutor on the election subversion case.
The hiring occurred while Willis and Wade were allegedly having an extramarital relationship, and Wade has received over $650,000 for his work on the case, according to court filings.
According to credit card records included in Wade’s divorce proceedings, he paid for Willis to accompany him on trips to Miami and San Francisco.
The allegations have become public through two court cases: the divorce proceedings between Nathan and Joycelyn Wade and in a filing from election subversion defendant Mike Roman.
Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee, overseeing the election subversion case, has scheduled a hearing on Willis for February 15.
In a scenario in which Willis is disqualified (hypothetically) by McAfee from overseeing the Trump racketeering charges, the case would then go to the Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council of Georgia, which would decide what prosecutors the case could go on to next.
A Fulton County commissioner has launched an inquiry into whether Willis misused funds or accepted valuable gifts from a contractor in addition to their improper relationship. The commissioner has raised questions about Wade’s qualifications for this job.
Peter Skandalakis, executive director of the group, told CNN earlier there is no indication of investigation by other groups aimed toward removing Willis at the time. Skandalakis and Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp have both said this issue should be resolved in court first by McAfee.
House Republicans are also investigating the unsubstantiated allegations regarding Willis and Nathan Wade.
In addition to requesting a variety of financial documents, House Republicans are asking Wade to turn over any communications with federal investigators, the House January 6 committee and other executive branch agencies, including the White House.
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Jim Jordan has demanded that Nathan Wade turn over a series of documents and communications related to the election subversion case by Friday. If Wade fails to comply with the deadline, he could potentially face a subpoena, according to a source familiar with the matter who told CNN that “all options are on the table.”
Republicans on the Judiciary Committee have long sought to undermine the credibility of Willis’s case. The Fulton County district attorney’s office has rebuffed a number of Jordan’s earlier demands for documents.
Republican lawmakers at the state-level in Georgia have introduced legislation to establish a new committee for investigating Willis.
“The multitude of accusations surrounding Ms. Willis, spanning from allegations of prosecutorial misconduct to questions about the use of public funds and accusations of an unprofessional relationship, underscores the urgency for a thorough and impartial examination,” said state Sen. Greg Dolezal said in a statement.
Trump and 18 co-defendants were charged as part of a conspiracy stemming from the former president’s efforts to overturn his 2020 electoral defeat in the Peach State, including the use of “fake electors.” Four of the 19 have since pleaded guilty; the remainder have maintained their not-guilty plea.
The Georgia charges are key because as a state case, it’s not something that could be dismissed through a presidential pardon, which applies only to federal matters. Trump’s lawyers have long considered this case the most significant legal threat given the jury pool and the fact that it is beyond pardon powers.
It also includes alleged co-conspirators including former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, and Trump ally and attorney John Eastman, among others. Trump thus far is the only one charged in the election subversion efforts in the federal probe by special counsel Jack Smith.
While Trump has denied all of the charges and repeatedly attacked Willis, a Democrat, as partisan, he and allies have failed in efforts to throw the prosecution off track. As a state case, there is also no direct alleged nexus to Biden and the US Justice Department.
Meadows attempted to move his charges to federal court, where he might have a better opportunity to get them dismissed – as well as open up the future pardon lane – but failed (he is appealing that ruling).
Meanwhile, Trump is seeking to have the sweeping criminal conspiracy case against him in Georgia thrown out by arguing he is protected from prosecution under presidential immunity.
But the former president can now kick his attacks against Willis into overdrive, saying truthfully that she is facing allegations of adultery and corruption.
Willis and Nathan Wade have not directly addressed the accusations, but Willis told a church congregation on January 14 that her adversaries were targeting her and Wade because of race, asking, “Isn’t it them playing the race card?”
She also defended Wade’s credentials, saying, “The Black man I chose has been a judge more than 10 years, run a private practice more than 20, represented businesses in civil litigation, I ain’t done y’all … served as a prosecutor, a criminal defense lawyer, special assistant attorney general.”
The district attorney has until next week to respond to the allegations, McAfee ruled.
In the meantime, Willis is also fighting a subpoena to testify in the Wade divorce case.
Willis has suggested in court filings that Joycelyn Wade is using the divorce proceedings to harass the district attorney and damage her reputation and is “obstructing and interfering with an ongoing criminal prosecution.”

NR1TAU0S9W_S0LQQE0C5RZRZFE,Kyiv rejects calls to cede land to Russia by Slovakia’s populist leader ahead of high-level meeting,"By Andrew Carey, Ivana Kottasová, Jessie Gretener and Maria Kostenko, CNN","3 minute read Published 7:19 PM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/22/world/kyiv-rejects-slovakia-leader-call-intl/,"Ukraine has rejected suggestions by Slovakia’s new Prime Minister Robert Fico that it will need to cede territory to Russia to end the war.
“There can be no compromise on territorial integrity, neither for Ukraine, nor for Slovakia, nor for any other country,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Oleh Nikolenko wrote on Facebook.
“Let’s be honest: if Ukraine is not secure, there will be no security, neither in Slovakia nor in Europe in general.”
In an interview with Slovak radio over the weekend, Fico offered a direct challenge to that idea, and the core position of most of his partners in the European Union.
Speaking just days ahead of a scheduled visit to Ukraine, Fico told the public broadcaster both Kyiv and Moscow would need to make painful compromises to bring the war to an end. For Ukraine, that meant accepting at least some of Russia’s gains.

“What are they expecting? That Russia will leave Donbas and Luhansk? Or that they will leave Crimea? No, that’s completely unrealistic. Everybody knows that,” Fico continued.
The Donbas and Luhansk are territories in eastern Ukraine, over parts of which Russia gained control in 2014, and from where it has expanded its territorial gains since launching its full-scale invasion in 2022. Crimea was also captured, and annexed, in 2014.
Widely seen as a pro-Kremlin figure, Fico won election in October, having run on a promise that he would block further military support for Ukraine - which he told the radio interviewer had been under the “total control of the United States” since 2014, when Ukrainians overthrew their pro-Moscow president Viktor Yanukovich.
In the European Union, he is closely aligned with Hungary’s Victor Orban and has been very open about his intentions to block Ukraine’s bid to join the EU and NATO. That blunt message would be repeated when he meets his Ukrainian counterpart, Denys Shmyhal, on Wednesday in the border town of Uzhhorod, he said.
“I will tell him that I am completely against Ukraine’s NATO membership and that I will veto it, because the only thing that would lead to is a Third World War.”
In a reversal of the policy of his predecessor, which saw Ukraine receive an air defense system and fighter jets from Slovakia, as well as other military aid, Fico also promised to tell his Ukrainian host that “he will not be getting any weapons from the Slovak Army” or from “Slovakia’s state stockpiles.”
Instead, he says he would bring an “offer of humanitarian help.”
Shmyhal’s office has not responded to a CNN enquiry about whether the visit will still go ahead.

Bringing a very different sort of message Monday to Ukraine was Poland’s new Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv.
The two leaders discussed possible joint arms production, as well as what Zelensky referred to in a statement from his office as “a new form of our cooperation – aimed at a larger scale of arms purchases for Ukrainian needs,” though no further details were given.
Tusk told his host Poland would try to help Ukraine’s accession to the EU, “so that Ukraine’s full membership in the European Union becomes a fact as soon as possible.”
The two men also expressed confidence that they could achieve lasting solutions to disputes over Ukrainian grain exports and permit-free access to the European Union for Ukrainian truck drivers, which led to blockades for many weeks at border crossings between the two countries."
NRLJKYC7BE_XS7YBC3TJDVVXP3,The crisis at Kyte Baby might not have happened if the US had a mandated paid leave policy for new parents,"By Jeanne Sahadi, CNN","5 minute read Updated 11:50 AM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/23/success/paid-parental-leave-policies-kyte-baby/,"The crisis that has enveloped clothing company Kyte Baby this week might not have happened if the United States had a national paid parental leave policy in place.
Company founder and CEO Ying Liu was forced to offer two public apologies after making, in her words, a “terrible decision” to deny an employee more work flexibility after her adopted newborn landed in neonatal intensive care.
The United States is the only developed economy among the 38 members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development not to provide national paid maternal leave and job protection, never mind paid paternal or parental leave.
Related article Kyte Baby under scrutiny for denying mom’s remote work request while newborn was in NICU, CEO walks back ‘terrible decision’
“Across the OECD, statutory rights to paid maternity leave are provided with an average length of 18.5 weeks as of April 2022, ranging from 43 weeks in Greece (the longest entitlement) to none in the United States — the only OECD member with no national provision of paid maternity leave,” the OECD states on its site.
What’s more, almost all OECD countries have paid leave programs around childbirth for mothers and fathers, whether they are birth parents, adoptive parents or same sex parents. Besides pay, the programs offer to protect one’s job while on leave around the time of childbirth and the first few months after, according to the OECD.
Looking more globally, “approximately 83% of countries guarantee at least 12 weeks of paid leave to parents who give birth,” according to the paid leave advocacy group FamilyValues@Work.
US-based employees, by contrast, have to figure out which, if any, options might be available to them from a complex, confusing patchwork of programs.
“Nobody knows what they have access to,” said paid leave expert Vicki Shabo, a fellow at the policy research think tank New America.
Nine US states and the District of Columbia currently have paid family leave laws on the books, and four more states have similar laws that will go into effect in the next couple of years, according to a New America report.

At the employer level, only 27% of US workers in the private sector have access to paid family leave through their job, up from 12% a decade ago, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. (Among state and local government workers, 28% have access to paid family leave today.)
In recent years, in a bid to boost talent attraction and retention, mostly larger employers have been expanding their paid family leave programs, not just for birth mothers but also fathers, working parents in same sex couples, and employees who adopt or foster a child.
Among companies with more than 500 employees, 75% now offer or plan to offer paid parental leave in 2024, up from 70% last year and from 46% in 2018, according to HR consulting firm Mercer. The median amount of paid time off is seven weeks, up from six in prior surveys Mercer has conducted.
And, according to a recent survey by HR consulting firm WTW, nearly 20% of the employers that currently offer paid leave for parents plan to make those leave policies more generous in the next two years.
At the national level, however, there is still not a federal program for paid leave, despite legislative efforts in recent years to pass one in Congress.
At present, the only federal mandate on the books is the three-decades-old Family and Medical Leave Act, which allows employees to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid but job-protected leave a year — not just for childbirth but for a range of needs, including dealing with one’s own or a family member’s illness or with caregiving needs when a family member is in the military and gets deployed.
Most people, of course, can’t afford to take much unpaid leave. But even if they could, due to its eligibility rules, the FMLA doesn’t cover a large swath of the workforce. In 2020, 44% of workers weren’t eligible for FMLA leave because they didn’t have sufficient tenure on the job, didn’t work enough hours and/or their work site was too small, according to the US Department of Labor. Given that the Kyte Baby employee in question had only worked at the company for “a little over 7 months,” the company wrote in an email to CNN, she likely would not have qualified for FMLA coverage.
In the wake of its troubles this weekend, Kyte Baby’s CEO told CNN the company will now expand its maternity leave policy, which currently only offers two to four weeks with pay depending on tenure.

And perhaps it may also follow in the footsteps of other employers when it comes workplace flexibility.
The initial video on TikTok that alerted the world to the Kyte Baby situation alleged that the new mother was “fired” after proposing she be allowed to work remotely. But the company told CNN that “[s]he did propose a remote option for her job, but given that her role was largely on-site, at that time, we did not feel that the proposed plan would fulfill the responsibilities of her current position. We told her we understood her situation and informed her that her job would be here if and when she opted to return. However, upon reflection, we should have taken more steps to accommodate her situation.”
One trend that workplace experts expect to see in 2024 is more employers coming up with different ways to provide equity in their workplace policies so employees whose jobs are not remote friendly can enjoy more flexibility on par with that of their desk-based colleagues — for instance, by providing them with four-day workweeks or more flexibility in scheduling their hours.
But as executives at Kyte Baby are no doubt learning the hard way, it is always better to proactively offer these types of new or expanded benefits before a very public crisis forces their hand and potentially threatens their brand.

NUJK3AOKN0_V4G4HTRYY7IJNUF,New Hampshire proves how historically strong Trump is,"Analysis by Harry Enten, CNN","3 minute read Published 9:37 AM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/24/politics/new-hampshire-trump-strong-republican/,"Donald Trump won a historic primary victory Tuesday night in New Hampshire.
Unofficial returns at time of publication have the former president at about 55% of the vote to Nikki Haley’s 43%. Not only does Trump’s win make him the prohibitive favorite for the GOP nomination, but it leaves Haley with an unclear road map heading forward.
Indeed, in a number of ways, Trump’s New Hampshire triumph puts him on a GOP primary tier few, if any, Republicans have reached.
Let’s start off with Trump’s share of the vote. He’s only the second nonincumbent Republican to win a majority of the GOP primary vote in New Hampshire in the modern era. The only other was Ronald Reagan in 1980, and Trump’s 55% surpasses Reagan’s 50.2%.
Trump’s big vote share isn’t the only way we know New Hampshire Republicans love him. He is also just the second nonincumbent Republican to win the New Hampshire primary twice in the modern era. The other Republican was John McCain – a name synonymous with success in the first-in-the-nation primary.
Trump’s win comes on the back of his dominant victory in the Iowa caucuses, where he became the first nonincumbent Republican to earn a majority of the vote in the modern era.
Putting aside his wide victory margins, the fact that Trump was able to win both Iowa and New Hampshire is quite unusual. No other nonincumbent Republican has ever done it. Mitt Romney in 2012 came the closest (winning New Hampshire but losing Iowa by 24 votes) – and he took less than 40% in New Hampshire and under 25% of the vote in Iowa.
Related article Five takeaways from the New Hampshire primary
Trump’s ability to win Iowa and New Hampshire with such ease tells you how strong his candidacy is among Republicans. He appeals to different parts of the party, as evidenced by the fact that he succeeded in two very different contests in two fairly different states.
Iowa is a low turnout caucus that engages most with core party activists. New Hampshire is a primary, which sees relatively high turnout. Whereas New Hampshire openly invites registered independents (or undeclared voters) to cast a ballot, Iowa’s caucuses have few non-Republicans taking part.
Moreover, Iowa is a contest dominated by conservatives and evangelical Christians. New Hampshire voters are more moderate and far less religious. New Hampshire’s electorate is wealthier than Iowa’s, as well.
Put another way, New Hampshire should have been a far worse state for Trump. His biggest backers look a lot more like the Iowa electorate than New Hampshire voters: conservatives, religious Republicans and Republicans of more modest financial means.
None of that stopped Trump from pulling in the largest share of the vote for an nonincumbent in New Hampshire GOP primary history.
All of this, of course, is bad news for Haley. The former South Carolina governor, who insisted Tuesday she was staying in the race, is strongest among voters who can be found in disproportionately large quantities in New Hampshire compared with other primary and caucus states.
The polling in South Carolina, the next major contest to see Haley and Trump on the same ballot, is not good for Haley, despite it being her home state. Trump is again pulling in a majority of the vote, well ahead of Haley, and this polling was done before he won Iowa and New Hampshire.
The national polling has Trump ahead of Haley by more than 50 points. No nonincumbent Republican has ever been ahead of his nearest rival by more than 50 points in the immediate aftermath of both Iowa and New Hampshire.
Indeed, at this point, Trump does not appear to be trailing in any state, according to the polls. He’s even well ahead in Vermont, which should be one of Haley’s best states because it has an even less conservative GOP electorate than New Hampshire.
It seems quite plausible at this point that Trump may pull off the ultimate historic GOP primary win: becoming the first nonincumbent Republican to go undefeated in all 50 states during the primary season."
NUR2AF9PQU_7ZJHGXXOHF843WC,Royal Mail is on the brink. Cutting letter deliveries to 3 days a week could save it,"By Anna Cooban, CNN","3 minute read Published 10:45 AM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20230124,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/24/business/royal-mail-cut-letter-delivery/,"Royal Mail could ditch its near-daily deliveries of letters as the centuries-old British institution attempts to modernize its service and plug a growing hole in its finances.
Ofcom, the UK regulator overseeing the postal service, published proposals to rescue the beleaguered company Wednesday. It said Royal Mail could save as much as £650 million ($828 million) a year if it cut letter deliveries to three days a week from the current six.
The company’s business model is “getting out of date” and risks becoming “unsustainable” as people send fewer letters and receive more parcels, Ofcom said.
The number of letters sent via the Royal Mail network had halved since 2011, and financial losses have ballooned.
Among its other proposals, Ofcom suggested that Royal Mail could save up to £200 million ($255 million) a year by cutting its letter deliveries down to five days a week, or by extending the time it takes to get mail to customers.
“Something’s got to give, or the service is going to be too costly, and either stamp prices will go up or it will become unsustainable,” Melanie Dawes, Ofcom’s chief executive, said in an interview with the BBC Wednesday.

Any changes to Royal Mail’s Monday-Saturday letter delivery schedule would need to be approved by lawmakers because the company’s service obligations are set out in legislation. It delivers parcels five days a week, Monday to Friday.
Kevin Hollinrake, the United Kingdom’s postal services minister, told the BBC Wednesday that it was important to maintain a six-day service, and that Saturday deliveries were “sacrosanct,” in part, because many businesses, such as those producing magazines and greeting cards, required deliveries over the weekend.
Ofcom said Royal Mail was not currently providing a “reliable service” and change was urgently needed, a view shared by the company’s parent — International Distribution Services (IDS).
“It is not sustainable to maintain a network built for 20 billion letters when we are now only delivering 7 billion,” IDS CEO Martin Seidenberg told CNN in a statement.
The regulator fined the company, which was owned by the UK government until its privatization around a decade ago, £5.6 million ($7 million) last year for failing to deliver mail on time.
At the time, Ofcom said the pandemic had significantly hampered Royal Mail’s operations, but that the firm could “no longer use that as an excuse” for poor performance.
Royal Mail reported an operating loss of £319 million ($407 million) in the six months to the end of September, up 46% from the loss it recorded during the same period a year earlier. Its parent company, International Distribution Services, said low revenues and the cost of a pay deal agreed with a major postal workers’ union were behind the loss.
Ofcom said its proposals were meant to start a “national discussion” about the future of Royal Mail — an institution that is more than 500 years old — and that it would hold events in the next few months with individuals and businesses to ask for feedback."
NVBDJJDHLA_VUKSBQCR8XCJBO9,Three dead as 7.1 earthquake strikes near China’s border with Kyrgyzstan,"By Nectar Gan and Xiaofei Xu, CNN","3 minute read Updated 11:13 AM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/23/china/powerful-7-1-earthquake-strikes-near-chinas-border-with-kyrgyzstan/,"Three people have died after a 7.1-magnitude earthquake rocked a mountainous and remote part of China’s far western Xinjiang region early Tuesday.
State broadcaster CCTV reported that a further five people were injured and 12,426 evacuated from affected areas.
The quake struck Wushi county, also known as Uqturpan county, in Aksu prefecture near the Kyrgyzstan border shortly after 2 a.m. local time, state-run news agency Xinhua reported.
Strong tremors caused two houses to collapse and downed two major power lines near the epicenter, though electricity was quickly restored, according to Xinhua, and tremors were felt in Central Asian countries hundreds of miles away.
Rescue missions are taking place in cold weather with temperatures expected to reach minus 23 degrees Celsius (minus 9.4 degrees Fahrenheit) in Wushi county in the next three days, China’s Meteorological Agency said Tuesday.
The Xinjiang railway authority immediately sealed off routes in areas affected by the quake and suspended 27 trains, Xinhua reported.
Three people were hospitalized in a township 26 kilometers (16 miles) from the epicenter, state broadcaster CCTV reported. A child was rescued from the rubble of their house in that township, the broadcaster said.
Nearly 200 rescue workers have been dispatched to the quake zone, and hundreds more are being assembled, Xinhua reported.
More than 50 aftershocks above magnitude 3 were reported as of 11 a.m. Tuesday, according to the state-run China Earthquake Networks Center.
The quake’s epicenter is a remote, mountainous and sparsely populated area at an altitude above 3,000 meters (9,842 feet), CCTV said.
Five villages are located within a radius of 20 kilometers from the epicenter, which is about 50 kilometers from Wushi county’s main urban area, Xinhua reported.
Wushi county has a population of 205,000 people, according to China’s latest census in 2020.
Heavy tremors were felt in cities hundreds of miles away, including the Silk Road oasis of Kashgar and Hotan in southern Xinjiang.
Videos posted by Xinjiang residents on Chinese social media show lights swinging and crashing onto the floor, and crowds taking shelter outside in the streets, wrapped in winter jackets and blankets as overnight temperatures dropped as low as -10 degrees Celsius (14 degrees Fahrenheit).
The tremors were also felt across the border in Kyrgyzstan, according to the United States Geological Survey.
In nearby Kazakhstan, at least 44 people were injured in the country’s largest city Almaty following the quake, authorities said Tuesday. The quake was also felt as far away as Uzbekistan, Reuters reported.

Residents in the rural areas of southern and western Xinjiang are mostly Uyghurs, a predominantly Muslim ethnic minority that has been targeted by a sweeping Chinese government crackdown in recent years, from mass detention to strict restrictions on religious and cultural life.
A United Nations report said China committed “serious human rights violations” against Uyghurs that may amount to “crimes against humanity” – accusations that Beijing has vehemently denied.
In December, a powerful earthquake killed 151 people in the provinces of Gansu and Qinghai in northwest China, the deadliest quake to hit the country in nine years.

Wolf, CNN","5 minute read Published 5:30 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/25/politics/border-policy-congress-what-matters/,"A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.
It might surprise Americans to learn that high-level bipartisan talks have been underway to find a compromise solution to the crisis at the border.
It should shock no one who has paid attention to US border policy over the past 30 years that the talks may soon be dead. Even less shocking is that former President Donald Trump can be blamed for killing them.
Trump, the Republican Party’s likely presidential nominee, again wants the border to be his main election issue. He’s opposing any sort of compromise between Republicans and Democrats, especially one that could give President Joe Biden a legislative victory, even as he now acknowledges there is a border crisis. Lawmakers find themselves in a bind, left with nothing much beyond talking points.
Versions of this story have been on repeat for the past several decades. Every recent president, Republican and Democrat, has tried to put his name on a border compromise. They ultimately fail because of hard-line resistance on Capitol Hill.
Here’s the anatomy of how a border compromise never came to be:
► May 2023 - House Republicans pass hard-line border bill. As a Trump-era border policy known as Title 42 expired, House Republicans pass their own policy proposal to restart construction of a border wall, increase funding for border agents and upgraded border technology, reinstate the “remain in Mexico” policy, place new restrictions on asylum-seekers and enhance requirements for E-verify, a database employers use to verify immigration status. It’s immediately rejected by Senate Democrats and the White House.
► September 30 – House passes a spending bill without the border element. To avoid a government shutdown, then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy abandons a Republican spending bill that includes tough new border policies and works with Democrats to pass a short-term spending bill.
► October 3 - McCarthy ousted. The speaker is kicked out of his position by hard-line Republicans. A chaotic search for a new speaker ensues.
► October 20 - Biden requests $105 billion with a border sweetener. In an effort to get aid for Ukraine and Israel passed through Congress, Biden adds $13.6 billion to his national security package to address border security. Biden makes no mention of border policy in a prime-time address from the Oval Office making the case for the package. But in a letter to House Republicans, his budget director says the money would be spent on 1,300 more Border Patrol agents as well as immigration judges, asylum officers and Customs and Border Protection officers focused on stopping the flow of fentanyl.
► October 25 - New House Speaker Mike Johnson says the border is the top priority. “Inaction is unacceptable and we must come together and address the broken border,” he says on the House floor. “We have to do it.”
► November - A bipartisan group of senators works on a border compromise. Trying to find common ground, meetings are underway between a group of senators, including the Oklahoma Republican James Lankford and the Connecticut Democrat Chris Murphy, among others. If a deal on the border can be reached, there is hope among lawmakers that it will unlock support for passage of aid to Ukraine.
► November 14 - House passes another short-term spending bill. In an effort to buy more time on a long-term spending bill, Johnson pushes another short-term bill. No border policy changes are included.
► December 7 - Biden promises “significant compromises on the border.” Desperate for Ukraine aid, Biden says in a White House speech that he’s willing to make a deal on the border. He says Republicans have been unwilling to come to the table.
► January 3, 2024 - Johnson travels with House Republicans to the border. The speaker tells CNN the situation at the border is a “catastrophe,” throws cold water on the Senate negotiations and points instead to the bill House Republicans passed in 2023 and which the White House rejected. CNN reports the chances of a Senate compromise passing the House seem slim.
► January 17 - Biden and Johnson meet at the White House. There is some optimism for accord after the meeting that lasts 1 hour and 23 minutes. But in an interview later, Johnson tells CNN he cannot guarantee a Senate compromise would even get a vote on the House floor.
► January 18 - Trump turns squarely against compromise. Encouraging Johnson only to accept a “perfect” deal, Trump helps mobilize the GOP base and hard-line Republicans against any kind of deal.
► January 18 - House passes another short-term spending bill. Still trying to avert a shutdown and without any kind of compromise, Johnson again pushes a short-term funding bill to keep the government completely open through early March.
► January 22 - Compromise group continues working. With more and more focus on the Senate compromise talks, Republican leaders say the cost of the border elements of the bill could increase beyond Biden’s suggested $13.6 billion and that larger policy elements are being discussed. These could include a return to Trump-era policies for asylum-seekers and more.
► January 23 - Republicans feud. After winning Iowa’s Republican caucuses and New Hampshire’s Republican presidential primary, the front-runner to be Republicans’ 2024 presidential nominee throws more cold water on any immigration deal. Senate Republicans feud at a lunch, raising questions about whether they could support a deal.
► January 24 - It’s officially a “quandary.” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell acknowledges in a closed-door meeting the difficulty of the situation. House Republicans, pushed by Trump, are revolting against the idea of compromise. To be sure, there is always the chance the deal could be salvaged and finalized, and House Republicans could be convinced to accept it. But that currently seems like a very remote possibility, which leaves border policy and Ukraine and Israel funding in limbo."
NZHF4T83RH_8V8PYIO35QLJFWG,Mysterious Russian plane crash raises more questions than answers,"Analysis by Tim Lister, CNN","5 minute read Updated 5:08 AM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/24/europe/plane-crash-belgorod-analysis-intl/,"It’s still unclear why a Russian military transport aircraft crashed in the Belgorod region near the Ukraine border on Wednesday, whether because it was brought down by a missile or suffered some catastrophic technical failure. But all 74 people on board were killed, according to Russian authorities.
The first images of the wreckage on the ground are inconclusive; one video shows the last seconds of the plane as it hurtles towards earth before a large fireball erupts.
But the Russian authorities have claimed that Ukrainian missiles were responsible – and that they killed 65 of their own prisoners of war, along with six crew members and three Russian personnel, who were on board the Ilyushin Il-76.
The Russian Defense Ministry said the plane was destroyed by an anti-aircraft missile system deployed in the area of Liptsy in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region, some 50 miles (80 kilometers) from where the plane came down. It said radar equipment had detected the launches.
The Defense Ministry also claimed that “the Ukrainian leadership knew very well that, according to established practice, today Ukrainian military personnel would be transported by military transport aircraft to the Belgorod airfield for exchange” at the Kolotilovka checkpoint on the Russian border with the Ukrainian region of Sumy.
In response, Ukraine’s military command said it regarded Russian military aircraft approaching Belgorod as legitimate targets but stopped short of acknowledging it fired at a Russian transport plane.
The 50-mile distance from Liptsy to the crash site would be beyond most Ukrainian ground-to-air missile systems. A Ukrainian defense intelligence official did confirm that a prisoner exchange had been due to happen on Wednesday, but did not acknowledge knowing the logistical details of the Russian side of the swap. Another Ukrainian military source was quoted as claiming that the plane was carrying Russian missiles, not prisoners.
So one question is whether the Ukrainians were indeed aware of the timing and route of the aircraft that the Russians say was bringing prisoners to the site of the exchange, and additionally whether that information would have been conveyed to front-line units across the border from Belgorod.
The plane’s two flight recorders could, however, provide answers. An emergency services representative told Russian state news agency RIA Novosti on Thursday that “both flight recorders – flight parameter recording device and voice recorder – have been found” in good condition and handed over to investigators.
But there are already other ramifications from this disaster.
Andrey Kartapolov, who is chairman of the Duma Defense Committee in Moscow, made a significant allegation in claiming that the missiles fired were from US-made Patriot or German-made IRIS-T systems that have been supplied to Ukraine, without offering any evidence. Ukraine has pledged not to use foreign-donated weapons to attack Russian territory and this would have been a highly significant departure from that policy. In any case, the IRIS-T would not have had the range to hit the Ilyushin from the nearest Ukrainian-held territory. A Patriot deployed (at considerable risk) so close to the border with Russia would have been within range of the plane.
Related article Russia says 74 killed on military plane that crashed near Ukrainian border
Some observers are also pointing out that Russian missile defenses in the area were on high alert Wednesday, and that a Ukrainian drone had been brought down shortly before the plane crashed. However, the governor of Belgorod said that had happened in a location to the west of the city, which would put it at least 37 miles (60 kilometers) from the site where the Ilyushin crashed.
Another puzzling element is that according to the Russian version of events, the Ukrainian PoWs were guarded by just three Russian personnel on board the plane (besides the crew.) A former Ukrainian PoW, Maksym Kolesnikov, said Wednesday in a post on X that when he had been transported by plane from Bryansk to Belgorod, there were about 20 military police for 50 prisoners.
So this disaster already has multiple political dimensions and as yet a lot of unanswered questions. It has quickly become another episode in the information war that has been a constant in this conflict.
Dmytro Lubinets, Ukraine’s human rights ombudsman, said Wednesday that “information warfare is no less important than fighting at the front… The enemy is insidious. We all know what terrible methods Russia can use to destabilize Ukrainian society.”
Indeed the Russian Defense Ministry in its statement said that “by committing this terrorist attack, the Ukrainian leadership showed its true colors – it neglected the lives of its citizens.“
It’s worth recalling that Russia alleged that Ukraine killed its own prisoners of war in a strike on a camp in Olenivka in Donetsk 18 months ago, a claim that after extensive forensic investigation looked extremely dubious.
Then, as most likely in this instance, no independent on-the-ground analysis was possible.
But a large Russian military aircraft without anti-missile defenses approaching Belgorod – itself a frequent target of Ukrainian drones – would have been a tempting and valuable target for Ukraine.
It would therefore have been a flight of considerable risk – unless the Ukrainians had been notified of its purpose, as the Russians have claimed. On the whole, Russian Il-76 aircraft stay well beyond the range of Ukrainian missiles; this would be the first time since the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine nearly two years ago that one of them has been shot down.
But the Ukrainians have extended the range and frequency of their attacks into Russia, using drones, missiles and sabotage. Earlier this month, the Ukrainian military claimed to have shot down one of the Russians’ most advanced early detection aircraft, the A-50, over the Sea of Azov. There’s been no visual evidence of the wreckage, and the Russian Defense Ministry has not responded to the claim. Some analysts believe that the Ukrainians may have repurposed a Patriot battery to carry out that attack, but there has been no confirmation. Patriot missiles generally have a range of just under 100 miles.
For Ukraine, at a time when the battlefield is in stalemate and there are few victories to celebrate, attacking Russian bases, ships, aircraft and infrastructure well beyond the border has become a different way to disrupt the enemy’s military machine.
But if evidence emerges to confirm the version of events being offered up by the Russian Defense Ministry and others in Moscow, what would have been a coup for Ukrainian air defenses may instead have been a horrendous mistake."
O2EG247G9X_EPXSZ6M3N465GXW,"Former officer who shot and killed Patrick Lyoya can stand trial for murder, appeals court says","By Chris Boyette, CNN","2 minute read Updated 2:02 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/25/us/patrick-lyoya-death-michigan-police-officer/,"The former police officer who shot and killed Patrick Lyoya, a Black man from Michigan, can stand trial for murder, an appeals court ruled Thursday.
The Michigan Court of Appeals handed down a 2-1 ruling Thursday, denying an appeal by former Grand Rapids police officer Christopher Schurr.
“We agree that there is at least sufficient evidence presented at the preliminary examination to establish probable cause that defendant’s actions did not satisfy the standards for use of deadly force in self-defense,” the opinion said.
Schurr appealed after a district court judge ruled in October 2022 that he should stand trial for one count of second-degree murder. Schurr, who pleaded not guilty, was fired days after being charged in June 2022.
Lyoya was shot to death in April 2022 by Schurr, a White police officer trying to arrest him after a traffic stop in Grand Rapids. Schurr and Lyoya had struggled over the officer’s Taser, and after Lyoya gained control of the weapon, Schurr shot Lyoya in the back of the head as Lyoya was on the ground, authorities said.
The case drew national attention because of the moments leading to the shooting and the multiple videos that show Lyoya’s final moments.
The court acknowledged that it is “uncontested” that Schurr shot and killed Lyoya during a struggle while trying to arrest him and that Lyoya did not follow Schurr’s instructions and attempted to escape. But it rejected Schurr’s arguments the lower court erred by denying his justification of use of force and self-defense.
“Defendant’s argument on its face would suggest that whenever a police officer is met with force in making an arrest, the officer is always justified in using force, including deadly force, in order effectuate an arrest. We reject this blanket rule, concluding that use-of-force in making an arrest is more nuanced than defendant’s brief suggests,” the opinion said.
The appeals court agreed with the district court, which found there “was evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that self-defense did not justify defendant’s actions.”
Schurr’s attorney, Matthew Borgula, said in a statement they are “considering our options going forward” and may appeal.
“We respectfully disagree with the majority opinion that there was sufficient evidence to bind the case over for trial, given that it is undisputed that Mr. Lyoya had disarmed Officer Schurr of his taser, which at least one of the judges held was a dangerous weapon as a matter of law,” Borgula said.

O4LG2QHG1B_60XLYMZRU33NP4G,Macy’s rejects a $5.8 billion unsolicited takeover offer,"By Jordan Valinsky, CNN","2 minute read Published 7:21 AM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240122,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/22/business/macys-rejects-arhouse-bid/,"Macy’s has rejected a $5.8 billion offer to take the 165-year-old retailer private, announcing late Sunday that the “unsolicited proposal lacks compelling value.”
Last month, Arkhouse Management, a real estate-focused investing firm, and Brigade Capital Management, a global asset manager, offered to buy the remaining Macy’s shares it doesn’t own at a 32% premium.
The company on Sunday responded to the proposal more than a month after it was offered, disclosing in a statement that its board of directors and management “has determined not to enter into a non-disclosure agreement or provide any due diligence information to Arkhouse and Brigade.”
Macy’s CEO Jeff Gennette said the proposal is “not actionable and that it fails to provide compelling value to Macy’s shareholders,” adding that the retailer continues “to be open to opportunities that are in the best interests of the company and all of our shareholders.”
Arkhouse, however, isn’t backing down. The firm responded to Macy’s late Sunday, saying that it sees a potential for a “meaningful increase to our original proposal if we are granted access to the necessary due diligence.”

The firm also cited Macy’s shares soaring 17% after the proposal was revealed in December, adding that Arkhouse believes “Macy’s investors support a privatization given the stock’s largest single-day gain in more than two years following media reports of our interest in acquiring the company.”
Macy’s (M) shares fell about 12% in the past month but bounced 2% higher in premarket trading.
Last week, Macy’s announced it was laying off about 3.5% of its workforce, or roughly 2,350 employees, and closing five stores as it continues to shrink its massive retail business amid the online-shopping era.
The company first opened in 1858 and now operates about 500 Macy’s branded stores, as well as 55 of the more upscale Bloomingdale’s chain.
Macy’s has attempted numerous strategies in recent years to revitalize its business, such as new brands and smaller stores, but the moves have not altered its long-term trajectory.
Its stock price has dropped 75% from a peak of $73 a share in 2015. Since then, it has closed nearly 300 stores — almost one-third — leaving about 700 across its brands.

The study involved testing blood for a key biomarker of Alzheimer’s called p-tau217, which increases at the same time as other damaging proteins — beta amyloid and tau — build up in the brains of people with the disease. Currently, to identify the buildup of beta amyloid and tau in the brain, patients undergo a brain scan or spinal tap, which often can be inaccessible and costly.

But this simple blood test was found to be up to 96% accurate in identifying elevated levels of beta amyloid and up to 97% accurate in identifying tau, according to the study published Monday in the journal JAMA Neurology.
“What was impressive with these results is that the blood test was just as accurate as advanced testing like cerebrospinal fluid tests and brain scans at showing Alzheimer’s disease pathology in the brain,” Nicholas Ashton, a professor of neurochemistry at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden and one of the study’s lead authors, said in an email.
The study findings came as no surprise to Ashton, who added that the scientific community has known for several years that using blood tests to measure tau or other biomarkers has the potential to assess Alzheimer’s disease risk.
“Now we are close to these tests being prime-time and this study shows that,” he said. Alzheimer’s disease, a brain disorder that affects memory and thinking skills, is the most common type of dementia, according to the National Institutes of Health.
Related article Doubts abound about a new Alzheimer’s blood test
Last year, the first blood test for assessing beta amyloid protein was made available for consumer purchase in the United States, called AD-Detect, to help people with mild cognitive impairment identify their risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. Some researchers have raised doubts about the science behind the test. Quest Diagnostics, the company behind the test, has stressed that it is not meant to diagnose Alzheimer’s, but says it helps assess a person’s risk of developing the disease.
The test used in the new study, called the ALZpath pTau217 assay, is a commercially available tool developed by the company ALZpath, which provided materials for the study at no cost. The test is currently available for research use only, but Ashton said it is expected to be available for clinical use soon.
“This is an instrumental finding in blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer’s, paving the way for the clinical use of the ALZpath pTau 217 assay,” Professors Kaj Blennow and Henrik Zetterberg from the University of Gothenburg, co-authors of the study, said in a press release. “This robust assay is already used in multiple labs around the globe.”
ALZpath estimates the price of the test could be between $200 and $500.
“A robust and accurate blood-based biomarker would enable a more comprehensive assessment of cognitive impairment in settings where advanced testing is limited,” the researchers wrote in their study. “Therefore, use of a blood biomarker is intended to enhance an early and precise AD diagnosis, leading to improved patient management and, ultimately, timely access to disease-modifying therapies.”
For instance, the test demonstrated “high accuracy” in identifying tau pathology within people who tested positive for beta amyloid, according to the study. That may help guide treatment decisions in patients considering therapies that target beta amyloid, such as Leqembi and Aduhelm, since they may be less effective in patients with advanced tau pathology, the researchers wrote.
“These results emphasize the important role of plasma p-tau217 as an initial screening tool in the management of cognitive impairment by underlining those who may benefit from antiamyloid immunotherapies,” the researchers wrote.
The study included data on 786 people, who had an average age of 66 and had brain scans and spinal taps completed, as well as blood samples collected. The data and those samples came from the Translational Biomarkers in Aging and Dementia, Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer’s Prevention and Sant Pau Initiative on Neurodegeneration.
Some of the participants showed signs of cognitive decline while undergoing the data collection but others did not. The researchers, from institutions in Sweden, the United States and other countries, analyzed the participants’ data from February to June of last year.

The researchers found that when they tested a participant’s blood sample with the p-tau217 immunoassay, the blood test showed similar results and accuracies in identifying abnormal beta amyloid and tau as the results from the participant’s spinal tap or brain scan.
Only about 20% of the study participants had blood test results that, in a clinical setting, would have required further testing with imaging or a spinal tap due to being unclear.
“This is a significant reduction in costly and high-demand examinations,” Ashton said in the email. Therefore, based on the study findings, “we think that a blood test and clinical examination can have definitive decision in 80%” of those who are being investigated for early signs of dementia.
Yet even though the blood test in this study was found to be highly accurate in predicting whether someone has key characteristics of Alzheimer’s disease in their brain, not everyone with those characteristics will go on to develop the disease.
Also, the p-tau test is specific for Alzheimer’s disease, so if someone tests negative but is showing signs of cognitive impairment, this test could not determine other possible causes of their symptoms, such as vascular dementia or Lewy body dementia.
“A blood test being negative speeds up the investigation for other causes of the symptoms and this is just as important,” Ashton said.

Overall, a blood test for Alzheimer’s disease, such as the one described in the new study, can be used to help diagnose both a person experiencing early memory loss, as well as before a patient shows signs or symptoms of the disease, because changes in the brain can occur about 20 years before the onset of overt symptoms, said preventive neurologist Dr. Richard Isaacson, director of research at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Florida, who was not involved in the study.
“This is actually the test that has, at this time, among the best available evidence for being one single test for Alzheimer’s,” Isaacson said about the study’s findings. “This study takes us one really powerful step closer to having that test, and the beauty of this study is it also looked at people before they had symptoms.”
Signs and symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease can vary from one person to another, but often memory problems are the first signs of the disease, such as losing track of dates, getting lost, misplacing things or having difficulty completing tasks, such as bathing, reading or writing.
Isaacson, who has researched blood biomarkers in people with no or minimal cognitive complaints, likened testing blood samples for signs of Alzheimer’s disease to how people undergo routine blood tests for high cholesterol.
“People get cholesterol tests before they have a heart attack. People get cholesterol tests before they have a stroke. To me, this type of test will eventually be best served in people before they start to have cognitive symptoms,” Isaacson said. And “just like cholesterol tests, by following the pTau217 level over time, we can better understand how various therapies and lifestyle changes are working to keep Alzheimer’s under better control.”
Testing for Alzheimer’s before someone has symptoms “leaves a lot of time” for that person to make brain-healthy choices and to talk to their doctor about their individual risk factors, Isaacson said, adding that a blood-based test also can be more cost-effective than performing brain scans or other methods of testing.
“PET scans have radiation and can cost over $5,000. Spinal taps are great because you get detailed information, but not everyone wants one and it is expensive and not covered by insurance. These blood tests are generally more reasonably priced,” Isaacson said.
“Having a blood test like this can also help democratize access for people and just make it easier for our health care system to more proactively manage the tsunami of dementia risk that our society is facing,” he said. “This is the key to unlock the door into the field of Alzheimer’s prevention and preventive neurology.”
More than 6 million people in the United States are living with dementia caused by Alzheimer’s disease, according to the Alzheimer’s Association, and the number of people affected is projected to double in the next two decades, rising to some 13 million in 2050.

In the future, adults older than 50 may be recommended to undergo routine blood tests for Alzheimer’s disease, said David Curtis, honorary professor at the University College London, who was not involved in the new study.
“When effective treatments to prevent the progression of Alzheimer’s disease become available it will be essential to be able to identify people who are at high risk before they begin to deteriorate. This study shows that a simple blood test might be able to do this by measuring levels of tau protein in the blood which has been phosphorylated in a specific way. This could potentially have huge implications,” Curtis said in a statement distributed by the UK-based Science Media Centre.
“Everybody over 50 could be routinely screened every few years, in much the same way as they are now screened for high cholesterol. It is possible that currently available treatments for Alzheimer’s disease would work better in those diagnosed early in this way,” he said. “However, I think the real hope is that better treatments can also be developed. The combination of a simple screening test with an effective treatment for Alzheimer’s disease would have a dramatic impact for individuals and for society.”"
O6OTYMSLLO_3TWHRGS6A08JFAT,"Alabama inmate Kenneth Smith executed with nitrogen gas, marking the emergence of a wholly new method of capital punishment","By Dakin Andone, Isabel Rosales and Christina Maxouris, CNN","7 minute read Updated 12:47 AM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/25/us/kenneth-smith-nitrogen-gas-execution-alabama/,"Alabama on Thursday night executed Kenneth Smith, the first death row inmate known to die by nitrogen gas, marking the emergence of a wholly new method of execution in the United States that experts have said could lead to excessive pain or even torture.
Smith, who was sentenced to death for his role in a 1988 murder for hire, had survived the state’s initial attempt to execute him by lethal injection in 2022. Earlier Thursday, the US Supreme Court denied his last-minute appeal to halt the execution, after declining the same request on Wednesday.
Smith’s time of death was 8:25 p.m. local time, officials announced. In a news conference after the execution, Alabama Department of Corrections Commissioner John Hamm said nitrogen was running for about 15 minutes.
In a joint report, witnesses from the media said Smith made a lengthy statement before he died, saying, “Tonight Alabama caused humanity to take a step backward,” and adding, “I’m leaving with love, peace and light, thank you for supporting me, love all of you.”
Smith appeared conscious for “several minutes into the execution,” and for two minutes after that, he “shook and writhed on a gurney,” according to the media witness report. That was followed by several minutes of deep breathing before his breath began slowing “until it was no longer perceptible for media witnesses.”
When asked at the news conference about Smith shaking during the start of the execution, Hamm said Smith appeared to be holding his breath “for as long as he could” and may have also “struggled against his restraints.”
“There was some involuntary movement and some agonal breathing, so that was all expected and is in the side effects that we’ve seen and researched on nitrogen hypoxia,” Hamm added. “So nothing was out of the ordinary of what we were expecting.” Agonal breathing is usually described as a kind of gasping seen in people who are dying.
Another witness, Smith’s spiritual adviser who’d previously expressed concern that the method could be inhumane, described the death in more graphic terms, saying it was “the most horrible thing I’ve ever seen.”
Smith, wearing a mask through which the nitrogen was administered, convulsed when the gas was turned on, “popped up on the gurney” repeatedly, and gasped and heaved, the Rev. Jeff Hood said.
“An unbelievable evil was unleashed tonight,” Hood said.
One of the sons of the victim, Elizabeth Sennett, said Smith’s death got justice for his mother.
“Nothing happened here today that’s going to bring mom back. Nothing,” Mike Sennett said at the news conference. “We’re glad this day is over. All three of the people involved in this case years ago, we have forgiven them.”
“Kenneth Smith made some bad decisions 35 years ago, and his debt was paid tonight,” he said.
In a statement, Smith’s legal team said they were “deeply saddened” by his death, adding he had found and “sincerely practiced his faith,” had become sober and helped other inmates achieve sobriety, and had earned an associate’s degree.
“Nothing can undo the tragic consequences of the actions for which he was convicted, including the pain of the Sennett family and friends. Kenny’s life, however, should be considered in its full context,” the statement added.
Little is known about how the method of execution, known as nitrogen hypoxia, was carried out because the state’s published protocol bears redactions experts say shield key details from public scrutiny. The state, in court records, indicated the redactions were made to maintain security and it believes death by nitrogen gas to be “perhaps the most humane method of execution ever devised.”

But Smith and his team were skeptical. “The eyes of the world are on this impending moral apocalypse,” the inmate and his spiritual adviser, Hood﻿, said midday Thursday in a joint statement. “Our prayer is that people will not turn their heads. We simply cannot normalize the suffocation of each other.”
Elizabeth Sennett’s sons told CNN earlier Thursday they felt it was time for Smith’s sentence to be carried out, adding they believed their mother was forgotten because of the new execution method.
“It seems like a lot of the focus today is on Smith and his nitrogen, whatever, process,” Mike Sennett said. “And that’s kind of upset us a little bit.”
“What’s going on is overshadowing what’s actually happened,” his brother, Chuck Sennett, said. “He’s gotta pay the price for what he done to our mother,” who should be remembered “as a loving, caring woman.” The two brothers were in their 20s when their mother was killed.
Before his execution, Smith accepted a final meal of steak, hashbrowns and eggs, according to information released by the Alabama Department of Corrections.
The US Supreme Court first declined to intervene in Smith’s case on Wednesday after his attorneys tried to argue a second execution attempt would violate the US Constitution’s protection against cruel and unusual punishment.
A separate federal appeals court ruling on Wednesday evening also declined to halt the execution﻿. Smith’s team had again appealed Thursday morning to the Supreme Court.
State officials on Wednesday welcomed the high court’s rejection of Smith’s earlier request, framing it as an “attempt to bar the State from executing him by any method at all,” Attorney General Steve Marshall said in a statement.
Alabama “remains confident that the execution, and long-awaited justice, will proceed as planned,” he said.
Still, Smith’s advocates and critics of the state feared the nitrogen gas execution could go awry, pointing to its novel nature, questions around its shrouded protocol and Alabama’s recent struggles to carry out lethal injections.
In 2022 alone, the state carried out or attempted three executions in a row that critics deemed “botches,” meaning they deviated from the stated protocol. In two of the cases, the inmates – including Smith – survived as officials called off the executions because they could not set an intravenous line used to deliver the fatal drugs before the death warrants expired.
Alabama on Thursday used nitrogen hypoxia, a method it adopted in 2018. It is one of just three states, along with Oklahoma and Mississippi, that has approved the use of nitrogen for executions, though no other state has used it and only Alabama has a protocol.
﻿In theory, the method involves replacing the air breathed by an inmate with 100% nitrogen, depriving the body of oxygen. Its proponents contend the process will be painless, citing nitrogen’s role in deadly industrial accidents or suicides.
Others are skeptical, including a group of United Nations experts who this month voiced concern a nitrogen gas execution will “result in a painful and humiliating death,” with no scientific evidence to the contrary.
“It’s lunacy, absolute lunacy,” Smith’s spiritual adviser said before the execution.
“The process, obviously, is designed to execute Kenneth Smith,” Hood told CNN. “But the way that they’re constructing this, the way that they’re doing it, the way that they’re being silent, the way that they’re holding back information, yes, it’s incredibly concerning. And should be incredibly concerning for everybody in the room.”
Apart from the execution method, Smith’s life should be spared based on the previous, failed attempt to put him to death, said the founder and director of the Equal Justice Initiative, a non-profit opposed to excessive criminal punishment that advocates on behalf of death row inmates. The group has assisted Smith’s attorneys in the case.
“Since that time, we’ve been arguing that the state doesn’t have the competency to carry out these executions,” Bryan Stevenson told CNN on Thursday. “They switched the method, and now they’re saying they have the skill to carry out a method that’s untested and never been used before.”
Smith was convicted and sentenced to death for the murder of Sennett, whose husband, Charles, was having an affair and had taken out an insurance policy on his wife, according to court records.

Charles Sennett recruited a man who recruited two others, including Smith, and agreed to pay each $1,000 to kill his wife and make it look like she died in a burglary, the records show. The men carried out the killing as planned in March 1988, and Smith took from the Sennett home a VCR player that he stored in his own home.
Charles Sennett killed himself a week after the murder, records state, as the investigation’s focus turned to him. Smith was ultimately arrested after authorities, based on an anonymous tip, searched his home and found the VCR player.
Smith was convicted and sentenced to die, but an appeals court overturned the initial outcome and ordered a new trial. He was again convicted in the retrial, but this time his jury voted 11-1 for a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole.
The judge in Smith’s second trial, however, essentially vetoed the jury’s vote and sentenced the defendant to death – a practice known as judicial override that’s since been repealed in Alabama.

O7XBLIZ8AQ_HPPR8RKBDV3IF4Q,A Colorado pastor says God told him to launch a crypto venture. He’s now accused of pocketing $1.3 million from his followers,"By Faith Karimi, CNN","4 minute read Updated 10:14 AM EST, Sun January 28, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/24/us/colorado-pastor-crypto-fraud-cec/,"Denver pastor Eli Regalado had an exciting message for his congregation.
After months of prayers and cues from God, he was going to start selling cryptocurrency, he announced in a YouTube video last April. The Signature and Silvergate banks had collapsed weeks earlier, signaling the need to look into other investment options beyond financial institutions, he said. With divine wisdom, he said, he was “setting the rails for God’s wealth transfer.”
Shortly afterward, Regalado and his wife, Kaitlyn Regalado, launched a cryptocurrency, INDXcoin, and began selling it to members of his Victorious Grace Church and other Christian communities in the Denver area. They sold it through the Kingdom Wealth Exchange, an online cryptocurrency marketplace he created, controlled and operated.
The Regalados raised more than $3.2 million from over 300 investors,  Tung Chang, Securities Commissioner for Colorado, said in a civil complaint.
The couple’s sales pitches were filled with “prayer and quotes from the Bible, encouraging investors to have faith that their investment … would lead to ‘abundance’ and ‘blessings,’” the complaint said.
But Colorado state regulators say that INDXcoin was “essentially worthless.” Instead of helping investors acquire wealth, the Regalados used around $1.3 million of the investment funds to bankroll lavish expenditures, including a Range Rover, jewelry, cosmetic dentistry and extravagant vacations, the complaint said. The money also paid for renovations to the Regalados’ Denver home, the complaint said.
In a stunning video statement posted online on January 19 — several days after the civil charges were filed — Eli Regalado did not dispute that he and his wife profited from the crypto venture.
“The charges are that Kaitlyn and I pocketed 1.3 million dollars, and I just want to come out and say that those charges are true,” he said, adding, “A few hundred thousand dollars went to a home remodel that the Lord told us to do.”
The Colorado Division of Securities started investigating the Regalados after it received complaints from an anonymous investor, a state spokesperson told CNN.
Chan filed civil fraud charges last week against the pastor and Kaitlyn Regalado,  accusing them of violations of the anti-fraud, licensing and registration provisions of the state’s Securities Act.
CNN has reached out to the Regalados for comment. It was unclear Wednesday whether they have retained an attorney.
In video statements, Eli Regalado has said that God led him to open INDXcoin and convinced him that it was a safe and profitable investment venture.
He told investors that INDXcoins “were highly sought after and offered an unparalleled risk-to-return ratio,” the complaint said.
But the state says INDXcoin was not backed by assets, making it a risky currency. There was no market for it or interest in it beyond its pool of investors, the complaint said.
The Regalados used technical terms to confuse investors and misled them into believing that the coins were valued at between $10-$12 even though they were purchased for $1.50 or, at times, given away, the complaint said.
“Regalado took advantage of the trust and faith of his own Christian community and … peddled outlandish promises of wealth to them when he sold them essentially worthless cryptocurrencies,” Chan said in a statement.
The Regalados failed to explain to investors how the INDXcoin market would work or that their Kingdom Wealth Exchange was the only platform “upon which anyone could buy, sell, or trade the currency,” the complaint said.
When INDXcoin failed to yield financial returns, Eli Regalado posted videos reassuring investors and saying, according to the complaint, they just “had to wait for God’s plan to unfold.”
In his video last week, Regalado addressed the accusations and acknowledged that people who bought INDXcoin are stuck because they are unable to sell.
“We launched an exchange,” he said. “The exchange technology failed. Things went downhill. And from that point forward, we’ve just been waiting on the Lord.”
“I know this looks bad,” he said later in the clip. “I know this looks terrible.”
Regalado also said that he and his wife used about half a million dollars of their investors’ funds to pay taxes to the IRS.
He reiterated that God led him and his wife to leave their marketing company in 2021, get into cryptocurrency and multiply investors’ money. God told them to trust him to provide the funds, he said.
Investigators found that investors began sending money in June 2022 via Eli Regalado’s Venmo account or wire transfers, long before Regalado announced the launch of the trading platform in April.
It’s unclear when an investor first complained to state officials. In November, Regalado announced that the INDXcoin and Kingdom Wealth Exchange networks were down and asked people to “stop being ruled by mammon (chasing material wealth).”
As recently as last week, Eli Regalado expressed hope that divine intervention would bail out him and his investors.
“Either I misheard God … or God is still not done with this project, and He is going to do a new thing,” he said in the video posted January 19. “What we’re praying for, and what we’re believing for still, is that God is going to do a miracle. God is going to work a miracle in the financial sector … (and that) everyone (who invested) … is going to be able to receive money back.”
A court hearing is scheduled for Monday."
O90V0O03XL_4OYOQT4KL9DZRWR,New York man found guilty of murder after 20-year-old woman was shot and killed when car turned in wrong driveway,"By Brynn Gingras, Nicki Brown, Nic F. Anderson and Ray Sanchez, CNN","4 minute read Updated 7:30 PM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/23/us/new-york-man-found-guilty-of-murder-after-20-year-old-woman-was-shot-and-killed-when-car-turned-in-wrong-driveway/,"Kevin Monahan was found guilty of second-degree murder Tuesday for shooting and killing a woman who was a passenger in a car that mistakenly drove up his driveway in rural New York last year, according to Katherine Thompson, deputy chief clerk of Washington County Supreme and County Courts.
Monahan had pleaded not guilty to charges of murder in the second degree, reckless endangerment and tampering with physical evidence in the death of 20-year-old Kaylin Gillis on April 15, 2023. He was convicted of all charges after about two hours of deliberations.
Monahan shot at the vehicle when it accidentally turned into his driveway while the occupants looked for a friend’s house in Washington County, roughly 55 miles north of Albany. Gillis died a short time after the shooting.
District Attorney Tony Jordan will seek a maximum sentence of 25 years to life when Monahan is sentenced on March 1.
Prosecutors argued that the 66-year-old defendant acted recklessly when the teens used his driveway to turn their vehicles. The defense said what happened was a  terrible accident.
Defense attorney Kurt Mausert said his client was disappointed by the verdict. Mausert told CNN the trial was “ripe with appellate issues” and he planned an appeal.
“He truly believes what happened was an accident. That he stumbled and he fell and the shotgun went off by accident,” Mausert said of his client.
“You got a beautiful 20-year-old girl, who, of no fault of her own, is dead. There’s no way to look at this case other than a horrible tragedy. But an accident has been turned into depraved indifference and that’s a tragedy also,” Mausert said.
Jordan said he hopes the guilty verdict means the families of Gillis and the others who were in the car “can have continued hope that there is justice and have something to hold onto as they move into their next chapter of recovery.”
“For us, our hope was to let people know that justice is possible,” Jordan told CNN. “There were neighbors who stepped up and heard something and reported it. Our hope is people can have faith in the system.”
Monahan took the stand at his trial last week, testifying that he felt like he and his wife were under siege that day and that he only wanted to protect his wife, Spectrum News 1 reported.
Monahan told jurors that he and his wife were awakened by three vehicles in his driveway: two SUVs and a motorcycle revving its engine, the station reported. He testified that he told his wife to hide in their closet and he loaded his 20-gauge pump-action shotgun before going outside.
Monahan testified that he thought about past criminal activity in the area and fired a warning shot into the air. The vehicles began to leave slowly, he testified, and he lost his balance on some nails on his deck when the second fatal shot was fired, Spectrum News 1 reported.
Under cross-examination, Monahan was not able to point out in a photograph the nails that caused him to lose his balance. He was emotional when asked how Gillis’ death made him feel, telling the jury that his “soul is dead,” the station reported.
Gillis was fatally shot just days after a Black teenager in Kansas City was shot twice by a White homeowner after going to the wrong address to pick up his siblings.
In the New York shooting, both Monahan and Gillis are White.
After the shots were fired, Gillis and the rest of the group drove away from the house, looking for cell phone service and then called 911.
They were found around 5 miles away from the home in the town of Salem. First responders began administering CPR but Gillis was pronounced dead at the scene.
Police officers went to Monahan’s home in Hebron and found him to be uncooperative, the Washington County sheriff told reporters at the time.
Gillis’ family issued a statement at the time praising her as a “kind, beautiful soul and a ray of light to anyone who was lucky enough to know her.”
“She was a big sister, much loved daughter, devoted friend and partner to her loving boyfriend. She was just beginning to find her way in the world with kindness, humor, and love,” the family said. “Kaylin was a talented artist, an honor student, a Disney fanatic and loved animals. She was looking forward to starting college in Florida to pursue her dream of becoming a marine biologist.”
Gillis graduated from Schuylerville High School in 2021 and held the position of “flyer” on the cheerleading team."
OBADTL8QZ5_7KBDVQ0Q1HP4ICM,Opinion: Defendants in the Georgia election case have no reason to complain — even if the Fani Willis allegations are true,Opinion by Bruce A. Green,"6 minute read Updated 9:06 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/24/opinions/fani-willis-trump-georgia-election-case-green/,"Editor’s note: Bruce A. Green is the Louis Stein chair at Fordham Law School, where he directs the Stein Center for Law and Ethics. He is a former federal prosecutor in New York. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely his own. View more opinion on CNN.
The Georgia prosecutor who brought the 2020 election interference case against former President Donald Trump and 18 co-defendants is facing an allegation of having a romantic relationship with the man she appointed as a special prosecutor in the case. One of the co-defendants, Michael Roman, a campaign official for Trump in 2020, has asked a judge to remove Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis and special prosecutor Nathan Wade from the case, asserting that the two prosecutors have an impermissible conflict of interest due to an “improper” relationship.
Neither Willis nor Wade has directly addressed the allegations. Speaking publicly for the first time after the accusations emerged, Willis told the congregation at Atlanta’s Big Bethel AME Church on January 14 that Wade was a “legal superstar” and “a great friend and a great lawyer.” Fulton Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee has scheduled a hearing on the matter for February 15, and prosecutors have been instructed to file a written response to the allegations by February 2.
While Willis may have engaged in nepotism in appointing Wade to lead an important prosecution, it seems doubtful that any of the defendants have a legitimate cause to complain.
Prosecutors have considerable power and discretion, which they should exercise in a disinterested fashion. To the extent possible, they should avoid prosecuting cases in which they have a significant personal interest at stake.
In extreme cases, such as when prosecutors have an ax to grind against a defendant because of self-interest or a relationship, or because the prosecutor will benefit financially from decisions made in the case, courts have authority to replace the prosecutor with a disinterested lawyer. (If Willis were disqualified, the case would go to the Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council of Georgia, which would then decide on a new prosecutor.)

For example, the Supreme Court has held that when a party violates a federal court order to stop infringing a company’s copyright, the company’s lawyer may not be appointed to prosecute the infringer for contempt of court. That lawyer, being beholden to the victim, would not be sufficiently disinterested and would be likely to treat the defendant too harshly.
As New York Law School professor Rebecca Roiphe and I have previously written however, courts rarely remove prosecutors based on a conflict of interest because as professionals, prosecutors are able to put self-interest and personal preferences to the side except in extreme cases. For example, a Republican prosecutor can be trusted to investigate or prosecute a Democratic president (as in the case of Ken Starr and President Bill Clinton), notwithstanding political preferences that in theory might bias the prosecutor against the accused.
An elected prosecutor who works daily with a police department can investigate allegations of police misconduct, notwithstanding an interest in maintaining good relations with the police department. The law presumes that prosecutors will overcome their biases.
In the Georgia prosecution of Trump and his co-defendants, an alleged romantic relationship between two top prosecutors seems to be even less of a problem, as far as disinterested prosecutorial decision-making is concerned, than the alleged conflicts of interest that courts ordinarily overlook.

The prosecutors’ relationship, if confirmed, has little, if anything, to do with their attitude toward the defendants; it may have affected Willis’ initial decision to appoint Wade, but beyond that, it has no logical impact on how they are making decisions in the case. Whatever affection the prosecutors may have for each other would not lead them to treat any of the defendants too harshly — it does not give them an ax to grind. Nor, for that matter, would it lead them to treat the defendants too leniently.
In a court filing, Roman asserted that Willis appointed Wade not because he was the best lawyer to serve as special prosecutor, but because of her affection for him. If so, such an appointment does not explain why either Willis or Wade might treat the defendants unfairly or abuse their authority in the criminal case.
Wade answers to Willis, but there’s nothing in the fact of a relationship that would prejudice him against a defendant. Ditto Willis: Her fondness for Wade wouldn’t affect her exercise of discretion regarding the defendants. (Four of the 19 defendants in the Georgia case have pleaded guilty, while Trump and the rest have maintained not guilty pleas.)
If anyone has the right to complain, it is not the defendants, but the county and the public. Willis may have engaged in nepotism (as when President John F. Kennedy appointed his brother Robert Kennedy to be US attorney general or when Trump appointed his daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner to positions in his presidential administration).
Related article Opinion: America needs Trump’s election subversion trial to be televised
Willis may have picked Wade not (or not only) because he is a terrific trial lawyer but because of her personal affection for him. If so, she may have violated state or local anti-nepotism or conflict of interest laws.
Indeed, Fulton County Commissioner Bob Ellis, a Republican, has raised questions about whether Willis misused county funds for her benefit after allegations emerged in Wade’s divorce proceedings that he paid for airline tickets for Willis to accompany him on out-of-state trips. Wade has earned more than $650,000 from the case over the past two years, according to Roman’s court filing. In a letter to Willis, Ellis also asserted that Wade lacks “relevant prosecutorial experience in a case of this type and complexity.”
Republicans at both the state and national levels are investigating the allegations. House Republicans are asking Wade to turn over any communications with federal investigators, the House January 6 committee and other executive branch agencies, including the White House. A state senator has filed legislation to create a special panel to investigate Willis.

Of course, if the allegations are true, Willis’ selection of Wade would be a colossal misjudgment, even if she violated no state or local law. Such a misstep would raise questions about the quality of Willis’ judgment in general. By appointing Wade, she may have turned a personal relationship into a personally embarrassing public issue in a high-profile criminal case. And she would be handing the defendants an issue to raise in a pretrial motion that, regardless of how it is decided, would delay the proceedings. Surely, there was at least one other skillful trial lawyer in Georgia who could have been appointed, thereby avoiding these problems.
But the judge should not linger over Roman’s motion, because the defendants have no legal reason to complain to the court or to seek some sort of judicial remedy such as removing the prosecutors. If Willis had picked a less-than-capable lawyer, which seems unlikely, the defendants would be beneficiaries of her misjudgment, not victims of it. They cannot plausibly claim that they are being prosecuted unfairly on account of the prosecutors’ alleged relationship with each other, whatever it may turn out to be."

Bob Menendez investigation is ongoing, federal prosecutors say","By Kara Scannell, CNN","2 minute read Published 5:10 PM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240122,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/22/politics/bob-menendez-investigation/,"Federal prosecutors say their investigation into New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez is continuing as he faces numerous corruption charges, including that he acted as an agent for a foreign government, and pressure by fellow Democrats to resign.
Prosecutors referenced the ongoing investigation numerous times in a letter to the judge responding to media organizations request to unseal or unredact portions of recent motions filed in the case.
“Although the grand jury has returned indictments in this case, its investigation remains ongoing,” prosecutors said.
Prosecutors often say investigations are ongoing; however, in this case they have added to the allegations facing Menendez twice since they were initially announced.

Prosecutors said they don’t oppose removing redactions for certain information in the filings but argued against unsealing others because it could reveal matters under investigation.
“With an ongoing investigation, and in the shadow of an upcoming trial, any potential witness statement concerning matters under investigation or that may be the subject of trial – whether or not that particular witness is likely to be called – may influence or affect the testimony of other witnesses to those facts, affect the jury pool, or otherwise prejudice the course of the investigation or trial,” prosecutors wrote.
Menendez, his wife, Nadine Menendez, and three New Jersey businessmen were indicated last fall in an alleged bribery scheme involving payments in gold bars, hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, a luxury car and passing sensitive information to the Egyptian government.
A superseding indictment was later handed up charging Menendez and his wife with conspiring to act as a foreign agent to Egypt. Earlier this month a third indictment was returned adding a new allegation that Menendez took steps to help Qatar in order to help one of the businessmen receive a multimillion-dollar investment from a Qatari-related investment fund.
Menendez has vigorously denied any wrongdoing as he faces calls from fellow Democrats to resign. He and the others pleaded not guilty to the charges.
Last week Menendez and his wife asked the judge to sever their cases so he doesn’t have to choose between defending himself and having his lawyers make arguments that could impugn his wife. They are set to go to trial in May."
OCY8JCRF0Y_5ETEAO67XACI2QM,Republican AGs back Texas and Florida social media regulations at US Supreme Court,"By Brian Fung, CNN","2 minute read Published 3:55 PM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240122,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/22/tech/republican-ags-back-texas-and-florida-social-media-regulations-at-us-supreme-court/,"Social media companies should be treated as utilities such as telephone or telegraph companies, a group of states led by Republican attorneys general told the US Supreme Court on Monday.
In a friend-of-the-court brief, 19 states and the state legislature of Arizona wrote that the Supreme Court should uphold laws passed by Texas and Florida that restrict companies including Meta, YouTube, X and others from moderating the content that their users post online.
Contested state laws forcing social media companies to carry all online speech are constitutional because tech platforms enjoy “hyperconcentration” of economic power, the group argued.
The brief reflects broad conservative support for laws that have been presented as “anti-censorship” but that the tech industry has argued violate the First Amendment rights of social media companies to manage their own, private spaces.
The high-stakes case could determine the future of social media moderation and online political speech and is expected to go to oral argument next month. The case could have implications on the posts that people and institutions make on social media during this presidential election cycle.
In their brief, the states noted “striking similarities between social media companies and telegraph and telephones,” and that those similarities justify tough new rules barring discrimination on the basis of political viewpoint.
The question for the court, the states wrote, is “whether companies like Facebook are more like newspapers, parade organizers, cake bakers, and website designers, or more like telephones, telegraphs, schools and shopping malls.”
The brief also argues that the rules are needed because dominant social media companies are “entrenched” and use their “unprecedented power to censor mainstream speakers on important issues of public debate.”
Tech platforms have long argued that their services are politically neutral and that their content moderation practices reflect the private policies they have established to combat spam, fraud, incitement, misinformation or other ills the companies may choose not to host.
Some legal experts have warned that the breadth of the state laws makes it nearly impossible to comply with them without also unleashing a torrent of spam, adult content or other objectionable material on the platforms that the companies may freely moderate today.
US appeals courts are split on the matter. In 2022, the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals sided with Texas on its law, while the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the tech industry."

Anderson, CNN","2 minute read Updated 7:09 PM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/22/us/jose-lazaro-cruz-arrest-costa-rica/,"A man wanted in connection with the 1991 killing of his wife was extradited earlier this month from Costa Rica, putting an end to his more than three decades on the run, officials said in a news conference Monday.
Jose Lazaro Cruz was arrested in Costa Rica in 2022 and brought back to Fairfax County, Virginia, earlier this month to face trial in the 32-year-old murder case, police said.
It is unclear if Lazaro Cruz has an attorney. CNN reached out to the Commonwealth Attorney for Fairfax County and the Fairfax County Public Defender Office for information about his legal representation.
On April 30, 1991, Fairfax County police officers responded to a call of a stabbing and found Ana Jurado, 24, dead in the street from trauma to her upper body, according to Eli Cory, Fairfax County’s deputy chief of investigation.
Lazaro Cruz was Jurado’s then-estranged husband and was identified as the alleged killer by police, but he fled, according to Cory. First, Lazaro Cruz tried going to Canada but was refused entry due to using falsified documentation, Cory said, adding border agents said they noticed what appeared to be a “fresh cut” on his hand at the time.
After being unable to get into Canada, Lazaro Cruz evaded authorities by traveling to Houston, Texas, and is believed to have used a smuggler to get out of the country, eventually going to El Salvador, according to Cory.
Cory said at the time, El Salvador did not have any mechanisms or policies in place to extradite him to the United States. The country eventually amended its constitution in 2000, allowing for the extradition of Salvadoran nationals.
Jurado was the mother of three young children. Her 3-year-old and 7-month-old daughters lived with her in the US and her 4-year-old son lived in El Salvador at the time of her death.
While official charges are still being sorted, Fairfax County Police Chief Kevin Davis said this case is not a “traditional cold case” because Lazaro Cruz was identified right away, he was just “on the lam.”
On July 29, 2022, Lazaro Cruz was arrested while trying to enter Costa Rica, according to Cory.
Lazaro Cruz remarried and had several children since the 1991 killing and “definitely started a whole new life in El Salvador,” according to Cory.
He is currently in the Fairfax County Correctional Center awaiting trial."

Israel has offered a two-month ceasefire to Hamas as part of a prospective hostage deal, Axios reported Monday, citing two unnamed Israeli officials.
It would be “the longest period of ceasefire that Israel has offered Hamas since the start of the war,” wrote Axios reporter Barak Ravid, who is also a CNN analyst.
The proposal comes after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected Hamas’ call for an end to the Gaza war in exchange for the release of hostages held there, as he faces increasing public pressure to bring the captives home.
In order to release the remaining hostages, Netanyahu said Hamas was demanding an end to the war, the release of Palestinian prisoners and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. “I work on this around the clock. But to be clear: I reject outright the terms of surrender of the monsters of Hamas,” he said in a statement on Sunday, adding that agreeing to the terms goes against Israel’s security.
“If we agree to this, our soldiers fell in vain. If we agree to this, we will not be able to guarantee the security of our citizens,” the Prime Minister said.
Netanyahu has since told families of the remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza that Israel has an “initiative” to secure the release of those abducted – but that there is “no real proposal” from Hamas that would advance their freedom, according to the prime minister’s office.
According to the Axios report, Israel’s latest proposal envisions the release of all remaining hostages and hostage bodies in multiple phases, in exchange for Palestinian detainees imprisoned in Israel.
It would also see Israel move its forces out of main population centers and allow “a gradual return of Palestinian civilians to Gaza city and the northern Gaza strip.”
Out of the 253 hostages Israel says Hamas seized on October 7, Israel believes that 132 are still in Gaza, of whom 104 are thought to be alive.
The Wall Street Journal report has reported that the US, Egypt and Qatar want Israel to join a new phase of talks with Hamas that would start with the release of hostages and lead to the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.
These developments come amid deepening divisions within Israel’s war cabinet about whether to prioritize bringing hostages home over defeating Hamas, and as thousands protested over the weekend in Tel Aviv against Netanyahu’s handling of the war.
War cabinet minister Gadi Eisenkot last week suggested that the key war aim of defeating Hamas is unrealistic and called for elections within months. Eisenkot also said the government had failed to achieve what he says should be its highest priority: securing the release of the hostages.
Netanyahu is under mounting pressure from the Israeli public to secure the release of captives in Gaza. On Monday, more than a dozen people, including families of the hostages, forced their way into a meeting held by the Israeli parliament’s finance committee. The protesters held placards that read: “You will not sit here while they die there.”
Video of the scene showed security officers trying to remove the protesters amid shouting and jostling.

“It can’t go on like this. You’d better know. It can’t go on like this. You will not sit here while our children die there,” shouted one protester. There were no reports of arrests inside the parliament, known as the Knesset.
Israeli police said that in a separate demonstration dozens of protesters had blocked the entrance to the Knesset, “violating public order.” That protest called for an immediate election, and included some of the families of those killed on October 7.
After some refused to leave, a police officer announced a dispersal order, according to an Israeli police statement.
A poll released on Monday by CNN’s Israeli affiliate Channel 13 found that 35% of Israelis would support a deal involving the release of all hostages from Gaza in exchange for stopping the war and freeing all Hamas detainees in Israel. Nearly half (46%) said they would oppose such a deal.
A slim majority (53%) said Netanyahu’s personal interests were the main consideration driving his conduct of the war and a third (33%) said the national interest was his main consideration.
It has been more than three months since Israel launched its war against Hamas, which came in response to the group’s brutal October 7 attack that killed 1,200 people, according to Israeli authorities.
Meanwhile, the death toll in Gaza on Sunday surpassed 25,000, according to the Hamas-controlled health ministry in the enclave.
CNN cannot independently verify the figures.
Netanyahu reiterated his rejection of future Palestinian sovereignty over the occupied territories on Saturday after talks with US President Joe Biden about Gaza’s future. The White House has been pushing Israel to recognize the need for the Palestinians to establish an independent state in areas Israel captured in the 1967 war.
“I will not compromise on full Israeli security control over all the territory west of Jordan - and this is contrary to a Palestinian state,” Netanyahu said in a post Saturday on X.
The Prime Minister’s public rejection of a Palestinian state has placed him at odds with Israel’s staunchest ally, which has long advocated for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Several European foreign ministers have also joined the chorus of criticism directed at Netanyahu over Israel’s opposition to a two-state solution. Josep Borrell, the European Union’s foreign policy chief said on Monday that Israel’s opposition to a two-state solution is “unacceptable” and Israel cannot expect countries to drop the issue.

OJRR73UDSG_LRNB9TDHVVNWHFV,The conservative legal world lines up behind Donald Trump at the Supreme Court,"By Joan Biskupic, CNN Senior Supreme Court Analyst","7 minute read Published 5:00 AM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/26/politics/supreme-court-trump-colorado-mitchell-analysis/,"As Donald Trump wages a Supreme Court battle to stay on state presidential ballots, a potent contingent of the conservative legal world has united behind him.
His new principal attorney for the case, Jonathan Mitchell, is a former Supreme Court clerk connected to the right-wing elite who devised the 2021 Texas abortion ban that helped lead to reversal of the Roe v. Wade landmark decision. The Texas law, which included a shrewd mechanism impeding judicial review, prompted liberal Justice Elena Kagan to refer disparagingly to its masterminds as “some geniuses.”
Also backing Trump, with “friend of the court” briefs, are the Republican National Committee and GOP establishment forces, similarly represented by elite appellate advocates who’ve worked for the justices and speak their language. They include former Trump Solicitor General Noel Francisco, George W. Bush-era legal adviser John Yoo and other ex-clerks of conservative Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas.
The leading Republican presidential candidate appears to be benefitting from ideological kinship, and perhaps personal loyalty, in the case that arose in Colorado but will have nationwide implications for the November general election.
The new filings in the case of Trump v. Anderson also reinforce the tight world of Supreme Court lawyering. From the start, the Colorado voters trying to keep Trump off the ballot, and who won at the state Supreme Court level, have been represented by former US Supreme Court clerks who’ve become prominent advocates.
The arguments tied to an anti-insurrectionist safeguard in the Constitution are scheduled for February 8 and bound to be hard fought and high energy. Given the GOP-appointed conservative dominance of the bench, the Trump side could find more allies in the give-and-take.

In his brief, Mitchell cited Thomas, whose influence has grown with the addition of more conservative colleagues in recent years. Mitchell highlighted what he insisted was the proper textualist reading of the disputed constitutional provision. Lawyers for the Republican National Committee similarly emphasized textualist arguments, repeatedly citing the late Justice Scalia, a prominent disciple of the textualist mode of legal interpretation.
At the lectern opposing Mitchell, who clerked for Scalia two decades ago, will be Jason Murray, a more recent law clerk to Justice Kagan. Murray’s partners in the case, Eric Olson and Sean Grimsley, who argued in Colorado lower courts, served as law clerks to the late Justices John Paul Stevens and Sandra Day O’Connor, respectively.
They, and their side’s “friend of the court” briefs, have until January 31 to respond to the Trump arguments. Based on the Colorado challengers’ preliminary submission to the high court, they will likely try to turn the justices’ attention to what happened on January 6, 2021, when Trump sought to overturn the election results that legitimately gave Joe Biden the White House.
Referring to the findings of a Colorado trial court judge, the lawyers wrote that Trump caused “the insurrection on January 6, 2021, having intentionally incited the mob to violence in a desperate ploy to cling to power.”
The former president is urging the justices to overturn the Colorado Supreme Court decision that said he should be disqualified from the state ballot for his role in the attack on the US Capitol based on the Constitution’s 14th Amendment.
Adopted after the Civil War and aimed at former Confederate leaders, Section 3 says, “No person shall … hold any office … under the United States … who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States … to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.”
Mitchell opened his arguments with the assertion that the president is not an “officer” of the United States, as the term is used in the Constitution, and therefore not covered by Section 3. (This theory was adopted by the Colorado trial judge but rejected by the state Supreme Court, which found it “inconsistent with the plain language and history of Section 3.”)
Mitchell highlighted oaths that are separately delineated in the Constitution and taken by the president and other top officials. “The president swears a different oath set forth in Article II, in which he promises to ‘preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States’ — and in which the word ‘support’ is nowhere to be found,” Mitchell wrote.

Focusing on the specific words of the text, he told the justices, “Section 3’s disqualification can apply only to those who have ‘previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States.’ It is undisputed that President Trump never took such an oath.”
Trump’s lawyers also are arguing that Section 3 applies only to a person who would “hold” office, not “run” for office. That contention has been endorsed in court brief by Francisco on behalf of the National Republican Senatorial Committee.
A group of former Republican attorneys general, which includes William Barr, Michael Mukasey and Edwin Meese, is also emphasizing that Section 3 does not cover the president, even as the group subtly acknowledges the national divisions arising from the attack on the Capitol.
In their interpretation of Section 3, they say, “The text speaks to a hierarchy of public offices in descending rank order, and its reference to an ‘officer of the United States’ low in that hierarchical list cannot include a President because an office ‘under the United States’ and ‘officer of the United States’ did not include the presidency as those terms were historically understood.”
The former attorneys general add, “Whatever one thinks of President Trump’s behavior on January 6, 2021, the stakes in this case are much larger than any one candidate or election. The overriding question is whether the Court will interpret Section 3 in a way that would henceforth empower partisan officials to unilaterally disqualify their political opponents from the ballot, especially the presidential ballot.”
Mitchell was already scheduled to make an appearance at the high court in February.
He will argue on behalf of a gun owner on February 28 in a dispute over government-banned bump stocks, devices that augment semiautomatic rifles to fire hundreds of bullets a minute.
After his clerkship, Mitchell became a lawyer in the George W. Bush administration’s Office of Legal Counsel and taught law school, including at the University of Chicago, where he had earned a law degree. He served as Texas state solicitor general from 2010 to 2015.
Recalled by colleagues over the years as smart but somewhat eccentric, Mitchell, now 47, seemed destined to become a solo operator. He opened his own firm in 2018. Mitchell has gravitated to culture-war issues, notably against reproductive rights and LGBTQ interests.
During the Colorado proceedings, Trump was represented by Scott Gessler, a Republican lawyer and former Colorado secretary of state, and the Dhillon Law Group, which has shepherded other Trump litigation related to January 6.
As Mitchell has taken over the Supreme Court appeal, he has focused Trump’s legal attack, eliminating some arguments and leading with the claim that the president is simply not an “officer of the United States” covered by the anti-insurrectionist provision.
For Supreme Court justices, reviewing the Trump arguments and soon-to-be-filed responses from the Colorado challengers, they are likely in only the first chapter of litigation related to the former president this election year.
Among the other controversies on the near horizon is whether Trump can claim immunity from criminal prosecution for election subversion related to the 2020 presidential contest.
Special counsel Jack Smith had tried to persuade the court to hear arguments related to the immunity claim, well in advance of a scheduled March trial for Trump. The justices spurned the December request, and as a result a US appellate court heard arguments on January 9 over whether Trump should be shielded for alleged crimes while in office.
A decision could come any day, and when that happens, the case of United States v. Trump would, no doubt, return to the justices."

“We regret to announce that after a 10-day exhaustive search, our two missing U.S. Navy SEALs have not been located and their status has been changed to deceased,” Central Command said in a statement Sunday. “Out of respect for the families, no further information will be released at this time.”
CENTCOM added that teams from the US, Japan and Spain searched more than 21,000 square miles to try to locate the two missing SEALs. The two sailors were boarding a vessel in search of illicit Iranian weapons when one fell into the water due to eight-foot swells, and the second jumped in after them according to protocol, CNN previously reported.
“We mourn the loss of our two Naval Special Warfare warriors, and we will forever honor their sacrifice and example. Our prayers are with the SEALs’ families, friends, the U.S. Navy, and the entire Special Operations community during this time,” said Gen. Michael Erik Kurilla, US CENTCOM commander.
“We mourn the loss of our two brave Navy SEALs, and our hearts are with their families,” Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement Sunday. “The entire Department is united in sorrow today. We are grateful to all who worked tirelessly to try to find and rescue them.”
The US maintains a small military presence in Somalia that focuses on the threat of the al-Shabaab militant group, an extremist Islamist organization that has carried out attacks against the Somali government. The US recognizes al-Shabaab as a terrorist organization.
In addition to training Somali forces, the US has also coordinated with the Somali government to carry out strikes against al-Shabaab.
According to US Africa Command, “Al-Shabaab is the largest and most kinetically active al-Qaeda network in the world and has proved both its will and capability to attack U.S. forces and threaten U.S. security interests.”

OK1ONJ0E55_2G6ZWLE1A50M6M7,Australia sanctions Russian national accused of hacking in Medibank data leak,"By Jessie Yeung and Hilary Whiteman, CNN","3 minute read Updated 2:58 AM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/23/tech/medibank-attack-australia-sanction-revil-intl-hnk/,"Australia has publicly named and imposed cyber sanctions on a Russian national for his alleged role in a 2022 ransomware attack, in the country’s first use of the penalty.
The attack stole sensitive personal data from 9.7 million customers of Medibank, one of Australia’s largest private health insurers: including names, dates of births, medical information and Medicare numbers. Some of these records were published on the dark web, according to Australian authorities.
At the time, the Australian Federal Police said investigators knew the identity of the attackers but declined to name them. On Tuesday, the Australian government revealed the name of the individual sanctioned — Russian national Aleksandr Ermakov, 33, an alleged member of the Russian ransomware gang REvil.
The sanctions make it a criminal offense to provide assets to Ermakov, or to use or deal with his assets, including through cryptocurrency wallets or ransomware payments, according to a government news release.
The offense is punishable by up to 10 years’ imprisonment. The government has also imposed a travel ban on Ermakov.
Australian authorities have “worked tirelessly over the past 18 months to unmask those responsible for the cyberattack on Medibank Private,” Richard Marles, deputy prime minister and defense minister, said in the release.
Related article Australia blames cyber criminals in Russia for Medibank data breach
The investigation included collaboration between federal intelligence agency Australian Signals Directorate, the Australian Federal Police, the FBI and National Security Agency (NSA) in the United States, and the United Kingdom’s cyber agency GCHQ — as well as with companies including Microsoft (MSFT) and Medibank, Marles said at a news conference Tuesday.
Cybersecurity experts said at the time of the data breach that it was likely linked to REvil, which had previously launched large attacks on targets in the United States and elsewhere. One such attack on international meat supplier JBS Foods in 2021 shut down the company’s entire US beef processing operation and prompted the company to pay an $11 million ransom.
At the request of the US, Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) intelligence agency detained multiple people associated with REvil in January 2022, seized millions of dollars and raided the homes of 14 people.
When the Medibank attack took place later that year, experts said it could have been perpetrated by a REvil member — which Australian authorities confirmed on Tuesday.
“REvil is only one of many Russian cyber-criminal syndicates, and those gangs we know are dynamic and have multiple partners. So a disruption of REvil at one point in time doesn’t cease its business,” Abigail Bradshaw, head of the Australian Cyber Security Center, said at the news conference.
However, she said, “cyber criminals trade in anonymity” — so publicly naming Ermakov “will most certainly do harm” to his activities, on top of the financial blow of the sanction.
Marles added that with this announcement, “his identity now being completely plain is on display for every agency around the world, but also anybody who is seeking to operate with him, so this will have a very significant impact on Aleksandr Ermakov.”
Investigations into other individuals linked to the attack are ongoing, Marles said.
The stolen data belonged to not only Australian customers but 1.8 million international customers. An initial ransom demand was made for $10 million (15 million Australian dollars). It was later lowered to $9.7 million, which Medibank refused to pay.
Australian authorities have repeatedly urged businesses and individuals not to pay ransoms to cyber criminals, arguing that paying does not guarantee the recovery of data or prevent further attacks — and makes the country a bigger target."
OKXUD6I7P6_98HH5Y8KOAV25R8,Oklahoma state lawmaker apologizes for bill labeling ‘Hispanic’ gang members terrorists. Fellow lawmakers say it’s not enough,"By Chandelis Duster, CNN","3 minute read Published 9:48 AM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/24/us/oklahoma-humphrey-gang-terrorist-bill-reaj/,"An Oklahoma state lawmaker says he will now change the language of a bill he proposed that designates anyone “of Hispanic descent” that is “a member of a criminal street gang” and convicted of a “gang-related offense” a terrorist.
Earlier this month, Oklahoma state Rep. Justin Humphrey, a Republican, introduced HB 3133, which states, “Any person who: 1. Is of Hispanic descent living within the state of Oklahoma; 2. Is a member of a criminal street gang … and 3. Has been convicted of a gang-related offense … shall be deemed to have committed an act of terrorism.”
The bill has been met with backlash, with some critics labeling it racist.
“I am not trying to offend any race,” Humphrey told CNN. “I support the Hispanic people. I am willing to change this to improve the language – very happy to do that.
“I do want to make certain that people understand that I don’t believe I was wrong. I can absolutely respect that and say, ‘You know what, I believe I’m right,’ but I can respect your opinion and if I offended you, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to offend you,” he added.
Humphrey said he wrote the law to target anyone engaged in gang-related criminal activities, mainly those committed by Mexican drug cartels.
He said he did not intend to target people of Hispanic descent and pushed back on allegations that he is racist.
“The whole world can call me racist, doesn’t bother me because I know I’m not a racist and anybody who’s around me would know that as well,” he said. “It doesn’t matter what race you are, if you’re not engaging in those activities then this bill does not apply to you.”
Humphrey said he has talked with narcotics experts, including the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, who advised him to broaden the language of the bill to “include all the players.”
He said the next iteration of the bill will remove the term “Hispanic” and will be introduced when the Oklahoma legislature returns for a new session on February 5.
Oklahoma state Rep. Arturo Alonso-Sandoval, a Democrat, said he feels Humphrey’s decision to change the language of the bill is too little, too late.
“He might swap the term ‘Hispanic’ with something else, but he already said the quiet part out loud,” Alonso-Sandoval said.
“Conflating Hispanics with terrorists is textbook fear-mongering. I don’t see this bill going anywhere, but it does add to the negative and false stereotypes that are often portrayed by individuals that are just trying to make an enemy out of someone.”
The bill has also been criticized by Oklahoma Republican state Sen. Jessica Garvin, the state legislature’s first elected Hispanic woman. Garvin told CNN she appreciates Humphrey’s commitment to changing the language in the bill, but that is not enough.
“It doesn’t excuse the bill’s initial language that was filed and what I thought was disparaging remarks about Hispanic Oklahomans in our state, including me,” she said. “I am appalled by this bill, as it has portrayed our state in a light that does not represent the position of the Republican Party, or the vast majority of elected officials,” Garvin added."
OP1K85JG95_SRY72SNA4NEWUXN,US Supreme Court declines to halt execution of Alabama inmate set to be the first to die by nitrogen gas,"By Dakin Andone and Devan Cole, CNN","6 minute read Updated 9:05 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/24/us/alabama-kenneth-smith-execution/,"The US Supreme Court on Wednesday declined to halt the execution of Alabama death row inmate Kenneth Smith, who is scheduled to be put to death this week using nitrogen gas – a wholly new method some experts have decried as veiled in secrecy amid concerns it could lead to excessive pain or even torture.
Smith is due to be executed during a 30-hour window starting Thursday for his part in a 1988 murder for hire. The state 14 months ago aborted an effort to execute him by lethal injection because officials could not set an intravenous line before the execution warrant expired.
Related article Alabama plans the first nitrogen gas execution this week in largely secret process experts say raises concerns about cruelty
Smith and his attorneys last week asked the Supreme Court to pause the execution so they could argue trying to execute Smith a second time would amount to cruel and unusual punishment, violating the Eighth and 14th amendments.
On Wednesday, the justices declined Smith’s requests. They did not provide an explanation in their brief order, and there were no noted dissents.
Still, litigation continues ahead of Smith’s scheduled execution by nitrogen hypoxia, a method only Alabama, Oklahoma and Mississippi have approved and none has used; only Alabama, which adopted the method in 2018, has outlined a protocol for it, indicating officials plan to deliver the nitrogen to Smith through a mask.
Smith’s lawyers had also filed a separate appeal with the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit on Wednesday — that court also declined to halt Smith’s execution Wednesday night, saying “Smith has failed to show a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of his claims.”
“Accordingly, his motion for a stay of execution is due to be denied without regard to the other prerequisites for the issuance of the same,” said the court in its ruling.
In the request to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, Smith’s attorneys said Alabama altered its execution plans by changing the schedule for Smith to have his last meal.
That change was made, the attorneys said, in response to evidence that Smith “has been vomiting repeatedly” — one of several concerns previously raised by Smith and the state’s critics, who fear Smith could vomit into the mask, causing him to choke and raising the risk of a tortuous death.
“While there is no doubt that a stay of execution is the exception and not the rule, it is difficult to imagine a more exceptional case than one in which a State intends to employ a novel protocol for a never-before-used method of execution, using a plan that continues to shift less than 48 hours before the execution is scheduled to begin,” the attorneys wrote.
In response, the state said the evidence Smith had been vomiting was largely from his own self-reporting. The Department of Corrections, the state said, only altered the last meal schedule to alleviate Smith’s concerns.
The state urged the court to deny the request for a stay, saying Smith’s “recent delays and latest filing make a mockery of the judicial process.”
Responding to the appeals court’s decision to deny the stay, Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall said, “While Smith will likely appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, my office stands ready to carry on the fight for Liz Sennett. Two courts have now rejected Smith’s claims. I remain confident that the Supreme Court will come down on the side of justice, and that Smith’s execution will be carried out tomorrow.”
During the November 2022 attempt to execute him, officials “jabbed Mr. Smith repeatedly in his arms and hands” in an effort to access his veins, causing the inmate “severe physical pain and psychological torment, including post-traumatic stress disorder,” his lawyers wrote in their appeal to the Supreme Court.
Smith’s execution would mark only the second time in US history that a state would attempt to execute an inmate a second time after initially failing, they said.
The state opposed Smith’s appeal, pointing out this week in a filing with the Supreme Court it would use a different method this time and describing nitrogen hypoxia as “perhaps the most humane method of execution ever devised.”
“Such treatment is much better than Smith gave Elizabeth Sennett nearly thirty-six years ago,” Alabama wrote, referring to the victim in the 1988 case.
United Nations experts, however, have “expressed alarm” over Smith’s looming execution, saying this month in a news release, “We are concerned that nitrogen hypoxia would result in a painful and humiliating death.” The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights called on Alabama to halt the execution, saying it “could amount to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment under international human rights law.”
“It’s not that nitrogen gas won’t kill you,” Dr. Joel Zivot, an associate professor of anesthesiology and surgery at Emory University, told CNN. “But will it kill you in a way that would comport with the constitutional requirement that it not be cruel and it not be torture?”
Smith was sentenced to death for his role in the 1988 murder for hire of Sennett. Her husband, minister Charles Sennett, hired someone who hired two others, including Smith, to kill his wife and make it look like a burglary for $1,000 each, according to court records.
Sennett, who court records say was having an affair and had taken out an insurance policy on his wife, killed himself a week after her murder as investigators’ focus turned to him. Smith was eventually arrested after investigators searched his home and found the Sennetts’ VCR, which he’d taken in the course of the killing.
Smith expressed a desire to be executed by nitrogen hypoxia both before and after the 2022 execution attempt. But that was before the state had a protocol, a federal judge noted this month.
His stated preference likely owed to his belief the state wasn’t close to finalizing a protocol, the judge wrote, adding if the state were forced to execute him using nitrogen, it would effectively place him “in an indefinite holding pattern” – keeping him safe from execution.
That changed in August, when Alabama suddenly agreed to execute Smith using nitrogen gas and released the protocol, which bore copious redactions the state said it needed to maintain security. Still, the protocol illuminated some aspects of how officials intended to carry out the execution, namely delivering the nitrogen using a mask.
Related article Executions in the US are in decline – but some jurisdictions lead the rest
While Alabama later agreed not to try to execute Smith again using lethal injection, he then challenged the nitrogen hypoxia protocol, claiming it left him at risk of “superadded pain” and could cause him to have a stroke or leave him in a vegetative state if it fails, court records show. He proposed the state either amend its protocol or execute him by firing squad.
The judge’s ruling early this month cleared the way for Alabama to proceed, finding there was “simply not enough evidence to find” the protocol would cause Smith superadded pain.
“It could, in a highly theoretical sense, but only if a cascade of unlikely events occurs,” the judge wrote. “Or it may well be painless and quick. Execution by nitrogen hypoxia is novel, and it will remain novel even if the Defendants employ Smith’s proposed amendments to the protocol.”
While the judge acknowledged the “heavily redacted” protocol maintained the Department of Corrections “familiar veil of secrecy over its capital punishment procedures,” he also noted the state had provided Smith’s team with an unredacted protocol.
The office of Republican Gov. Kay Ivey declined to provide an unredacted copy of the nitrogen hypoxia execution protocol or respond to CNN’s questions about experts’ concerns over it. Smith’s attorneys declined to provide a copy of the unredacted protocol to CNN, citing a protective order by the court.

OUE3R0Q1V6_OG6LN24U242L3KC,These Ukrainian teenagers sought refuge from war in Israel. Then they were caught up in the horrors of Hamas’ attack,"By Lianne Kolirin, CNN","8 minute read Updated 4:41 AM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/26/middleeast/teenage-refugees-ukraine-israel-intl-cmd-scli/,"It was supposed to be a safe haven – a new life for those seeking refuge from the turbulence of war.
But when tens of thousands of Ukrainians fled to Israel in the wake of Russia’s invasion, they had no idea of what the future would hold.
With men aged 18 to 60 forbidden to leave Ukraine, the refugees were mostly women, children and the elderly. Among them, four courageous teenagers who arrived alone in Israel to start a new life as a result of Moscow’s assault on their homeland on February 24, 2022.
Little more than a year and a half later, these young people found themselves immersed in another conflict, as they study at a boarding school just 8 miles from Gaza.
“The day before was very peaceful,” recalled Artem Karpin, 18, of Hamas’ attack on Israel on October 7. “I remember thinking I wasn’t really ready with my homework and wondering how to postpone my deadlines.”
Karpin lives and studies at Kfar Silver, a youth village near Ashkelon, close to where Hamas militants infiltrated the border that Saturday morning. He is one of about 40 Ukrainian refugees to enrol there since Russia invaded his country.
Run by the global education charity World ORT, the “village” is effectively a sprawling complex for 1,090 children from challenging backgrounds – including 250 boarders.
Originally from the southwestern city of Odesa, Karpin had been visiting relatives in Israel when Russia invaded Ukraine. His father gave him no choice but to stay put.
“I started crying when I began to understand that I’m not going back,” he told CNN at Kfar Silver. “I felt betrayed. I didn’t think it was a wise decision to leave me here.”
Nearly 2,000 miles from his parents, Karpin, then 16, enrolled at Kfar Silver, where he soon began to learn the language, make friends and settle in. That was until life was upended again on October 7.
“That morning we all ran from the dorms to the shelter in the school,” he said. “I was scared but not terrified. I was trying to talk it all through rationally and it really helped.”
Karpin was one of 63 of pupils on site that day, as was 18-year-old Michael Reider.
Originally from Kyiv, Reider arrived in Israel in March 2022 following a gruelling journey from his homeland to Poland, where he spent a week on his own before flying out.
On that “black Shabbat” of October 7, he said: “I woke up and there were a lot of sirens and rockets were flying.

“I had already experienced one invasion and now this was a second one. I don’t know how to explain it – I wasn’t really afraid. I felt kind of angry and like I had the energy to fight.”
Pupils and staff remained in the shelter for hours as the unprecedented terror raged around them.
Amos Gofer, who served in the IDF for 25 years before becoming chief executive of Kfar Silver, told CNN: “During my military service I spent time in Lebanon, Gaza, occupied territories. I saw some stuff but October 7 was the hardest day of my professional life.
“We were terrified. We knew very early that the situation was very bad, that there were a lot of terrorists.”
Friday had marked the end of a week-long religious holiday, so fortunately very few pupils were at school, said Gofer. Most of the Ukrainian students, however, had nowhere else to be.
“I was sure the terrorists were going to come here to kill us,” said Gofer, who keeps the remains of a rocket which exploded on the school grounds on his desk.
“I had three people with personal pistols, which was nothing compared to the heavy ammunition the terrorists had.
“We saw no helicopters, no police, no military – I still don’t understand why it took so long,” said Gofer, referring to widespread reports on October 7 that the army and security forces took hours to react to the incursions.
Gofer told CNN that “thousands of rockets” flew over the village, while fires broke out everywhere around them.
With no response to his repeated calls to the army and emergency services, who were dealing with ongoing attacks in multiple locations, Gofer finally called a bus company manager he knew.
“He told me none of his bus drivers were willing to come… everyone was terrified.”
Two drivers from the bus company eventually volunteered to evacuate the children to another village further north, he added. “They told me if they’re not out of here in two, three minutes they would go without the students.”
Karpin recalled: “We had several minutes to pack our clothes and run for the buses. I got the most essential stuff and that’s it. In an hour or two we were in Netanya.”
Four days later, Karpin’s parents, back in Ukraine, insisted that he leave Israel with other relatives for Europe.
“After three weeks I started to feel that I wanted to return (to Israel),” he said of his time in Greece and Germany. “I missed my studies and my friends. It was getting a little safer in Israel, so I convinced my family I needed to get back.”
In common with some other foreign boarders, 17-year-old Maria, who asked not to give her surname for privacy reasons, was staying with a nearby “host family” because of the religious holiday when Hamas launched its assault on October 7.
“At six in the morning we were all running to the shelter and you could hear sirens,” she said.
Originally from the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, Maria and her younger brother had moved to their father’s home in Kyiv following the Russian invasion. Eventually the two siblings left the country via Moldova and flew to Israel.
“When war broke out in Ukraine it was like life fell apart and this time it was very similar - I had flashbacks,” she said. “I was scared but also thought if I tried to distance myself as much as possible everything would be OK.”
She remained with the family, who live in Ashkelon, for several days before heading north to join the evacuees, including her brother. There they remained until last month when they returned to the school.
“My mum was worried about us,” she said, adding that their mother suggested they return home to Ukraine.
“I told myself I could go back but that I’d be going back to war and I couldn’t possibly know if it’s safer. At the same time, I didn’t want to leave Israel. I thought ‘do I need to flee again to start life again once more?’”
After lengthy family discussions, the siblings decided to stay.

“In some ways I’d rather be here,” said Maria. “I just wish for my family to be brought together again in peace.”
Fellow Ukrainian Sviatoslave Kulyk, 17, told CNN he had “not been afraid at all” about leaving his family for Israel back in 2022.
“I understood that it was better to live in a country with no war,” he said.
That all changed when he woke up at his friend’s house in Ashkelon on October 7.
“I had flashbacks to Ukraine, especially when we watched TV about what was happening,” said Kulyk, who told CNN he had witnessed Russian forces roll into his street from his home in Kharkiv.
“My mum was really afraid of me being in Ashkelon but I was trying to explain that I had a bomb shelter here,” he said, adding that Ukrainian homes are not equipped with so-called safe rooms. All Israeli homes built after 1993 must have such a shelter, designed to protect residents from rocket attacks.
With the village now at “95% operational,” according to Gofer, counsellors, social workers and psychologists are on hand to support pupils as they navigate the mental and emotional fallout of the war.
Kulyk said he feels safe but admitted that “sometimes it’s really hard for me to live in Israel.” However, he added: “I’m not sure I’ll go back to Ukraine. My main goal is to finish school right now.”
In the immediate aftermath of Hamas’ attack “hundreds of terrorists were caught in the area,” said Gofer, who told CNN that around 35 pupils at Kfar Silver had relatives who were murdered or kidnapped.
Many families and staff remain evacuated from their homes, while some teachers are serving in the IDF reserves.
Rockets continue to fly, though less frequently, while some staff – including Gofer – now have access to long-range rifles.

“Everyone’s on high alert,” he said. “People aren’t afraid of sirens – they’re afraid of terrorists.”
And yet the situation has not dented the optimism and determination of these four youngsters.
Both Maria and Kulyk are interested in studying international relations – something they are surely more qualified for than most teenagers.
Reider has other ideas. “When the war started here there was relative silence in Ukraine and my family felt more safe,” he said.
“They were very worried (about me) but I didn’t want to go back. I’m a Jew and Israel is my country. If Israel calls me to the army, I’ll go.” A period of military service is compulsory for most Israelis when they turn 18.
Karpin plans to study electrical engineering in Israel.
“I want to go back home once I have two university degrees so I can work on rebuilding and improving Ukrainian infrastructure and make my country a safe and better place,” he said."

The decision from Manhattan Supreme Court Judge David Cohen represents a significant setback to Fox’s corporate leadership, including the powerful Murdoch family, who will now face more scrutiny in the litigation. Cohen already let the case proceed against Fox News — and on Wednesday, he rejected a request by Fox Corporation to throw out the claims against the parent company.
The lawsuit was filed in the wake of the 2020 election, when Fox repeatedly gave airtime to far-right figures who promoted outrageous and debunked claims that Smartmatic rigged the presidential election by flipping millions of votes from Donald Trump to Joe Biden. They did this even though on-air anchors, top producers and executives privately admitted that the election wasn’t stolen.
The judge said Smartmatic’s case was strong enough to proceed against the parent company because it has “sufficiently alleged that (Fox) Corp. employees acted with malice by purposely and deliberating publishing knowingly false stories about (Smartmatic) in order to benefit (Fox) Corp.’s financial interest.”
Smartmatic has “sufficiently alleged in their amended complaint that (Fox) Corp. employees played an affirmative role in the publication of the defamation at issue,” Cohen concluded.
The parent corporation had argued that it shouldn’t be involved in the defamation case because it only had general oversight of Fox News itself. Further, Fox Corp. argued there wasn’t proof that any corporate employees “directed” the allegedly defamatory statements to be aired.
Fox denies defaming anyone and claims that the lawsuit is an assault on the First Amendment.
“We will be ready to defend this case surrounding extremely newsworthy events when it goes to trial, likely in 2025,” a Fox spokesperson said in a statement after the ruling. “As a report prepared by our financial expert shows, Smartmatic’s damages claims are implausible, disconnected from reality, and on their face intended to chill First Amendment freedoms.”
Smartmatic sued Fox News and its parent corporation in 2021 for defamation and is seeking more than $2 billion in damages. A New York appeals court previously dismissed the case against Fox Corp. but gave Smartmatic a chance to refile the allegations with more evidence. Cohen said Wednesday that the refiled claims against Fox Corp. are sufficient enough to move forward.
“We look forward to proceeding and holding Fox Corporation, as well as Fox News, responsible for the damage they did to Smartmatic,” the company’s lead attorney Erik Connolly said.
The case is still in the discovery phase, with some major depositions taking place in the past month, including former Fox Corporation chairman Rupert Murdoch.
The decision boosts Smartmatic’s case against the right-wing media behemoth. A similar 2020-related lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems was also allowed to proceed against Fox and its parent company. That case unearthed tranches of internal emails that described in devastating detail how top Fox officials cravenly allowed Trump allies like Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell to lie about the election on its shows.
The judge also on Wednesday gave Fox News a greenlight to continue its counterclaims against Smartmatic. The right-wing network is alleging that Smartmatic’s massive $2.7 billion request for damages is a legally baseless attempt to silence the network’s free-speech rights.
Fox filed its counterclaims against Smartmatic last year, in a bid to push back against the company and recover the money it’s spending on high-priced attorneys to defend itself.
“(Fox’s) argument here is that (Smartmatic’s) alleged damages are so extenuated from their actual lost profits that they were pleaded and/or sought in order to chill (Fox’s) free speech rights. That argument has not yet been adjudicated in any court,” Cohen said, paving the way for Fox to continue its fight against the $2.7 billion figure.
Smartmatic had asked Cohen to dismiss the counterclaims, on the basis that of Fox’s arguments were already shut down in Dominion’s similar defamation case that the right-wing network settled last year, and that they shouldn’t be relitigated now.
In the Smartmatic case, Fox has previously argued that the Florida-based voting company couldn’t have lost billions of dollars due to the airing of election lies because it was already unprofitable and scandal-plagued before anyone accused the company of rigging votes against Trump.
“While the recovery of fees and costs will not undo all the damage this First Amendment-defying lawsuit has wrought, at least it may cause the next plaintiff to think twice before trying to penalize the press to the tune of billions of dollars in non-existent damages for ensuring that the people can hear perspectives from all sides of the most pressing controversies of the day,” Fox wrote in a filing last year."
OY10GEG5SD_Z2JOYZATOHKSCEF,"DeSantis, once a rising Republican star, ran a presidential campaign filled with missteps and mistakes","By Steve Contorno, Jessica Dean and Kit Maher, CNN","12 minute read Published 12:00 AM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240122,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/22/politics/desantis-campaign-what-happened/,"In the days leading up to the Iowa caucuses, top advisers to Ron DeSantis steeled themselves for a grim result. The polling that for months told them enough Republicans there were ready to move on from Donald Trump was now predicting that most of them wouldn’t, and they began to consider options for the Florida governor with his political future in mind.
They presented DeSantis with a range of potential outcomes and paths forward. In the event of a dominating performance by Trump, they pitched that DeSantis could bow out, endorse the former president, finish his second term as governor and rebuild his reputation with an eye toward 2028.
He rejected the idea outright, according to a source familiar with the exchange. That was the end of that conversation.

Or so they thought. On Sunday, less than a week after a crushing defeat in Iowa and days before New Hampshire voters are expected to deliver another one, DeSantis bowed out of the 2024 presidential race. In a scripted video statement from Florida, DeSantis endorsed Trump and looked ahead to finishing his second term as governor.
His exit marked a stunning fall for a Republican who for a time appeared singularly positioned to pull the party from Trump’s vice grip. DeSantis once seemed to have it all: money and momentum behind him, a compelling background, a generational argument and a success story to share. Some early polls actually showed him with a lead over Trump.
But what he didn’t have was room for error running up against a popular former president. And the DeSantis campaign made many of them, his advisers, allies and supporters have acknowledged to CNN in interviews.
“Every single thing that could have not gone as we had hoped or planned for went horribly wrong,” one close adviser said.
DeSantis has suggested the race would be different if Trump wasn’t facing four indictments and 91 charges in federal and state courts. Many of his advisers also believe Trump’s legal peril galvanized Republicans just as the GOP presidential contest was about to get underway, closing an opening for an alternative. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley will attempt to test how wide that opening is in the coming days and weeks.
“I would say if I could have one thing change, I wish Trump hadn’t been indicted on any of this stuff,” DeSantis told the Christian Broadcasting Network in December.
But over a campaign that stretched eight months, there is little DeSantis’ team could point to that they did right – from the disastrous, glitchy kickoff announcement on Twitter Spaces with Elon Musk to the Iowa ground operation that was supposed to overcome Trump’s popularity and arctic weather to deliver a surprise outcome that would shock the country.
It was that final miscalculation that ultimately provided the knockout blow. Not only did the result in Iowa evaporate enthusiasm for his campaign, it also sapped it of credibility. He had promised victory in the Hawkeye State, convinced that the polls hadn’t captured his 99-county tour of the state and insisted the nearly 1 million doors his supporters had touched would be rewarded.
Instead, Iowa revealed how ineffective his effort had been all along — his ground game, his message, his strategy, all exposed as a paper tiger and turning his candidacy into a punchline in Republican circles.
“Historic disaster,” said one veteran Republican fundraiser once hopeful of DeSantis’ chances. “JV team.”
Veteran GOP strategists Curt Anderson and Alex Castellanos called it the “Worst Republican Presidential Campaign Ever” in a blistering audit written for Politico that was devoured Friday by DeSantis allies and enemies alike.
It’s a title DeSantis earned as much for what he squandered as how he fared.
DeSantis’ White House bid carried more than just the weight of a political campaign.
“He thinks he’s on a mission from God,” one close confidant described DeSantis’ drive to become president.
It’s an attitude captured in the closing message of his 2022 reelection campaign: A black-and-white video posted to social media by his wife, Casey, that suggested God created DeSantis, “a fighter,” on the eighth day.
After a 19-point reelection victory that November, some in the Republican Party were at least ready to anoint him the inevitable heir to Trump.
“DeFuture,” the New York Post declared the day after, the culmination of two years of Rupert Murdoch’s media empire showering DeSantis with praise for his pandemic contrarianism and cultural battles.
Trump, already a candidate for president once again, was ready for a fight. He called his former ally “an average Republican governor” as the buzz around DeSantis reached new heights and escalated the attacks from there.
But DeSantis, who once donned a Top Gun outfit to declare he would “never back down from a fight,” opted not to punch back. He instead put his focus on the 2023 legislative session in Florida, plotting an agenda of long-sought conservative priorities – universal school choice, a near ban on abortion, fewer restrictions on guns – that would serve as the platform for a policy-oriented presidential campaign. He also escalated his fight with Disney over new state restrictions on teaching sexual orientation and gender identity by taking control of the company’s special taxing district.
He didn’t step foot in Iowa until March to sell his new book. His first earnest swipe at the former president – a dig at the hush money payments allegedly made to adult film star Stormy Daniels – was followed days later by DeSantis defending Trump in the face of an indictment in a New York case related to those payments.
“The war had begun and we were kind of sitting on our backsides,” a source close to the campaign said, describing the time when DeSantis was traveling around the country on a book tour but had yet to formally announce. It left his team unable to push back on his behalf as Trump and his allies pounded the governor, ultimately spending $21 million in ads seeking to define DeSantis when he wouldn’t punch back.
Meanwhile, an emerging super PAC, led by veteran GOP strategist Jeff Roe and Ken Cuccinelli, a former homeland security official in the Trump administration, was given the keys to the DeSantis’ financial coffers. The super PAC, Never Back Down, received $83 million from DeSantis’ former state political committee in a move that a campaign finance watchdog group flagged as potentially illegal, but nevertheless provided an unprecedented financial advantage for the Republican governor.
In an unusual arrangement, Never Back Down was asked to take on many tasks traditionally reserved for campaigns, including training paid canvassers and hosting the governor’s events. Roe and others promised a novel concept that would change presidential campaigns forever.
But Never Back Down’s team of seasoned political consultants clashed immediately with the inexperienced but scrappy Tallahassee team that had just steered DeSantis to a historic gubernatorial victory. The early squabbling, which the media quickly caught wind of, was a precursor to a summer and fall of discontent that ultimately ended with several top staff and advisers leaving acrimoniously, including Roe.
Meanwhile, the Republican donor class that rained six- and seven-figure checks on DeSantis during his reelection bid suddenly had second thoughts. Some voiced displeasure with his contentious second-term agenda and fixation with Disney. Others wanted to kick the tires on other GOP candidates after all.
The DeSantis financial team wrongly assumed the flush times wouldn’t end, and they budgeted for $200 million between the campaign and super PAC at launch with a goal of amassing half a billion dollars by the year. Instead, the super PAC had raised $130 million by June 30 – a historically large amount that nevertheless fell well short of expectations.
“Pick a name,” another fundraiser said. “Every one of them, it was expected they would keep giving.”
His fundraising team downplayed the pull back at the time, with one person telling CNN it would only be a problem if Ken Griffin, the billionaire hedge fund owner who helped bankroll DeSantis’ reelection, decided he wouldn’t donate. They expected $25 million from him.
Griffin ultimately did not give a cent toward DeSantis’ White House bid.
“If you had told me finances would be the problem, I would have hung up on you as needing a mental health check,” the fundraiser continued. “All the dynamics that Trump would be difficult to beat I expected, but I believed there was enough of a coalition of the willing to fund an opposition candidate.”
Ad spending by Never Back Down peaked in mid-April – before DeSantis had officially entered the race.
By the time DeSantis was ready to announce, his entire political operation was on edge.
“People already felt like it was an uphill battle,” the fundraiser said.
There was a “contentious” debate among DeSantis’s orbit over how best to launch the candidate, with some people pushing for a more traditional announcement from his hometown of Dunedin followed by stops in Iowa and New Hampshire, according to a source familiar with the conversations. But that approach was rejected by the woman who would be announced as DeSantis’ campaign manager, Generra Peck.
Another idea emerged to do something with Elon Musk and X, formerly known as Twitter, which ultimately snowballed into the final idea of the two appearing together on Spaces to broadcast a live announcement. The idea’s supporters argued it was a nontraditional announcement for a nontraditional campaign, according to a source familiar with the discussions.
But donors and other DeSantis allies worried after all the build-up to his candidacy there would be no visual of DeSantis actually announcing his run to air on television stations across the country. A compromise was struck with DeSantis immediately going on Fox News after the Spaces launch to talk about his campaign. An intermediary took the idea to Musk, who agreed.
Musk’s website, though, crashed repeatedly during the announcement, which quickly became the narrative of his introduction as a presidential candidate.
“It could have been cool and successful,” one source familiar with the launch told CNN, “but the glitchiness at the top was perhaps a foreshadowing of the campaign to come.”
Donors gathered in a glitzy Miami hotel for the launch were stunned, and grew more furious when Peck and others tried to spin it as DeSantis breaking the Internet.
As coverage of these early stumbles on mainstream news outlets snowballed, DeSantis stayed inside a right-wing media bubble. He spoke almost exclusively to Fox News, conservative radio stations and right-wing podcasters, ignoring some aides who pushed aggressively for DeSantis to do more with the national media from the very beginning.
DeSantis instead listened to others in his orbit, particularly Christina Pushaw and Bryan Griffin, both of whom joined his campaign from the governor’s office and encouraged him to continue to ignore the mainstream media. He now acknowledges that decision was a mistake.
“I came in not really doing as much media,” DeSantis recently told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt. “I should have just been blanketing. I should have gone on all the corporate shows. I should have gone on everything.
“We had an opportunity, I think, to come out of the gate and do that and reach a much broader folk,” he added.
The abnormalities surrounding DeSantis’ campaign continued to stack from there.
It quickly became apparent that the campaign grew too quickly for its financial situation. In mid-July, the trickle of layoffs began. Meanwhile, DeSantis pulled back plans for a national campaign and refocused his efforts almost exclusively on Iowa.
Yet, as his campaign shrunk, it spent $1.5 million on private planes through September, campaign finance reports show, and held donor retreats at posh locations, like a resort in Park City, Utah.
A bizarre series of events on July 25 illustrated the disconnect. DeSantis flew privately into Tennessee for a fundraiser. Once on the ground, his four-vehicle motorcade was involved in an accident, including the car carrying the governor. That same day, his campaign cut one-third of its staff. And Never Back Down aired its last ad in South Carolina.
Two weeks later, Peck was fired.
Yet, amid the turmoil, DeSantis’ team, led by his top pollster Ryan Tyson, assured donors and operatives that there was an opening in Iowa. Each time they went into the field, their poll numbers showed a growing pool of Republicans open to moving on from Trump. They assumed the surge of support for the former president was a sugar rush from his indictments that would eventually end.
But rather than a coherent message around his candidacy, there was a scattershot of approaches in the ads coming from the super PAC and the campaign. It was largely left up to DeSantis to win over Trump voters through appearances in the state.
Across his 99-county tour of Iowa, DeSantis struggled to articulate a coherent rationale for his candidacy and focused more often on his past accomplishments as a governor than his ideas for the future. He regularly responded to questions from Iowans with actions he took in Florida, rattling off local terms from back home and sometimes leaving crowds perplexed.
His speeches sometimes required a glossary for regular Republicans to understand: woke, ESG, DEI, CRT, Central Bank Digital Currency, social credit scores, Zuckerbucks – all words, phrases and acronyms that were staples of DeSantis’ campaign appearances, media interviews and debate responses.
Still, there were moments when it seemed DeSantis was on the cusp of gaining momentum, such as when Iowa’s popular governor, Kim Reynolds, endorsed him in November.
But that evening also offered a window into his flailing candidacy.
Her involvement represented a momentous coup for DeSantis and a striking break from a tradition from her predecessors. In a stirring speech that night inside a Des Moines event space, she defended her involvement and made an impassioned case for the like-minded conservative governor from Florida.
Yet, during his turn at the mic, DeSantis delivered a largely rote speech filled with familiar lines from his six-month tour of the state, an extended riff off his Florida accomplishments and the “woke” forces he had destroyed. There were only a few passing references to the woman who risked her political capital to back him. He said little that night to suggest he had grown as a politician during his bruising uphill fight for the nomination or had learned much about Iowa or its people despite spending hundreds of hours in the state and meeting thousands of its residents. At times, the crowd could barely muster more than polite cheering.
After stepping off the stage, he shook hands and posed for pictures for 10 minutes from behind a barrier, leaving Reynolds to mingle with his supporters.
The night laid bare the promise and the shortcomings of DeSantis as a presidential candidate. An exacting and relentless leader, DeSantis could execute a game plan as well as anyone but lacked a feel for the campaign trail and struggled to stir a room. He could summon the energy to barnstorm across the state for weeks on end but often appeared disinterested in the people who showed up to hear him.
In the end, a politician who had seemingly done everything necessary to win Iowa – shown up, spent money, secured endorsements – could not win over Iowans.
DeSantis himself acknowledged the limits of the key endorsements he often touted on the trail.
A day before suspending his campaign, he told reporters in Myrtle Beach, “Iowa Republican leadership lined up behind me, and we came in second,” in response to a question about Trump’s new support in South Carolina.
And yet, in the face of this overwhelming rejection of his pitch to Make America Florida, DeSantis refused to change gears. The contours of his stump speech stayed the same as he half-heartedly moved on to South Carolina. Vote for me, he told Republicans there, because I have already done the stuff you supposedly like.
Even in defeat, DeSantis vowed to continue to take on “woke ideology.”
“While this campaign has ended, the mission continues down here in Florida,” DeSantis said as he signed off. “We will continue to show the country how to lead.”"
OZUFMJ8W9O_PTHF15N9OG9M1S6,Supreme Court takes up appeal of Oklahoma death row inmate after state attorney general admitted mistakes,"By Devan Cole, CNN","3 minute read Updated 11:21 AM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240122,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/22/politics/supreme-court-appeal-oklahoma-death-row-inmate/,"The Supreme Court agreed on Monday to take up the extraordinary appeal of an Oklahoma death row inmate named Richard Glossip, a man who even the state attorney general said should not be executed.
Last May the justices halted the pending execution while legal challenges played out.
Glossip has endured 26 years behind bars, nine execution dates, three last meals and two independent investigations that raised serious doubts about his conviction.
“We are grateful that the court is providing Richard Glossip the opportunity to argue that Oklahoma should not be permitted to kill him,” Glossip’s attorney, John Mills, said in a statement. “The court should reverse the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals, which has inexplicably refused to accept the state’s confession of error.”
Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner F. Drummond told the Supreme Court that the state had recently made the “difficult decision” to confess error in Glossip’s case and supports vacating the conviction of Glossip. The move was an about-face and came after review of new information that had come to light related to prosecutorial misconduct at Glossip’s trial.
The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals refused however, to accept the confession of error and determined the execution should go forward.
“That decision cannot be the final word in this case,” Drummond told the justices. “The injustice of allowing a capital sentence to be caried out where the conviction was occasioned by the government’s own admitted failings would be nigh unfathomable,” Drummond told the court in court papers.
The case dates back to 1997 when Justin Sneed murdered Barry Van Treese, the owner of a motel in Oklahoma City. After his arrest, and in exchange for avoiding the death sentence, Sneed implicated Glossip, who was serving as the motel’s manager. Sneed admitted to killing Van Treese. But at trial, prosecutors portrayed the killing as a murder-for-hire plot orchestrated by Glossip. Sneed secured a deal to avoid the death penalty: Plead guilty and testify against Glossip, then a 35-year-old whose criminal record included a single traffic ticket, per his attorneys.
Glossip’s conviction, according to the state, hinged almost entirely on Sneed’s credibility. But the state recently learned that the prosecution failed to disclose evidence related to Sneed’s credibility and failed to correct testimony it knew to be false.
Specifically, the state failed to release records that disclosed that Sneed was treated for a serious psychiatric condition.
Van Treese family members believe the execution should go forward.
“The State deeply respects the victim’s family’s concerns about ensuring justice be done,” Drummond told the justices, “but Justice would not be served by moving forward with a capital sentence that the State can no longer defend because of prosecutorial misconduct and cumulative error.”
Lawyers for Glossip say they only obtained files this year that revealed that Sneed saw Oklahoma’s only psychiatrist who diagnosed him with bipolar disorder and prescribed lithium. At trial, Sneed testified that after he was arrested he had “asked for some Sudafed because I had a cold, but then shortly after that somehow they ended up giving me Lithium for some reason, I don’t know why, I never seen a psychiatrist or anything.”
There were no noted dissents on Monday, although Justice Neil Gorsuch is recused from the case, likely because he dealt with it in some form before he took his seat on the high court.

P3186JLRJJ_90S6MGQ1QL9LG9J,24 soldiers killed on deadliest day for Israeli forces in Gaza combat,"By Amir Tal and Richard Allen Greene, CNN","4 minute read Updated 4:16 PM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/23/middleeast/gaza-israeli-soldiers-deaths-intl-hnk/,"Twenty-four Israeli soldiers were killed during fighting in Gaza on Monday, the military said, in the deadliest day for its troops inside the battered enclave since the war with Hamas began.
Most of the soldiers – 21 – were killed in an attack in central Gaza “when a terrorist squad surprised our fighters and launched missiles and rockets,” said Daniel Hagari, spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).
That attack, which Hagari said happened several hundred meters from the eastern border, was the deadliest single incident for the IDF in Gaza since the ground invasion began on October 27. A further three Israeli soldiers - an IDF captain and two majors - were killed in a separate incident the same day, in southern Gaza.
The attack in central Gaza took place as the IDF soldiers were laying explosives to demolish “terror infrastructure and buildings,” according to Hagari.
A rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) hit one of the buildings and set off an explosion that led to its collapse.
“Most of our fighters died because of the collapse of that building,” Hagari said.
Another RPG hit a nearby IDF tank, killing the tank commander and another Israeli soldier, Hagari added.
On Monday, the Hamas-controlled health ministry in Gaza said the number of Palestinians killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since October 7 has risen to 25,295, with at least 63,000 injuries recorded.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is facing increasing political pressure on multiple fronts, said the deaths of the soldiers represented “one of the most difficult days since the outbreak of the war.”
“I mourn for our fallen heroic soldiers. I hug the families in their time of need and we all pray for the peace of our wounded,” Netanyahu said, adding that the IDF had launched an investigation into the incident.
The Israeli military’s large-scale bombing campaign in Gaza has been ongoing since the October 7 murder and kidnapping rampage by Hamas gunmen that saw some 1,200 people killed in Israel and more than 250 taken hostage. One hundred and thirty two hostages remain in Gaza. Of those, 104 are believed to still be alive.
The incidents in Gaza on Monday bring the number of Israeli soldiers killed since operations there began to 219.
The previous deadliest day for IDF soldiers in Gaza since the start of the conflict was October 31, when 16 Israeli troops died. That day also included the previous deadliest incident, which saw 11 troops killed in an armored personnel carrier.
In recent weeks, the Israeli military’s main focus has been in southern Gaza, with intense fighting around the city of Khan Younis.
The IDF said Tuesday that the city is now surrounded, while the Hamas-controlled Health Ministry says nearly 200 people have been killed in the past day.
In a statement Tuesday, the IDF said “dozens of terrorists” had been killed in the past 24 hours by IDF ground troops in coordination with the Israeli air force.
“Over the past day, IDF troops carried out an extensive operation during which they encircled Khan Younis and deepened the operation in the area. The area is a significant stronghold of Hamas’ Khan Younis Brigade,” the IDF said.
Hagari said Israeli soldiers continue to fight in Khan Younis, adding, “It’s a very complicated area – very crowded, with a lot of people living there.” One hundred Hamas fighters have been killed in the Khan Younis area within the last day, Hagari claimed.
A source familiar with the matter told CNN Monday that a major Israeli military offensive underway in western Khan Younis is expected to last several more days. The source said Israeli troops had encircled the Khan Younis refugee camp and were conducting raids to try and dismantle Hamas’s military capabilities in the area.
Medical facilities in the city have been battered amid an Israeli assault in the area Monday, Palestinian health officials said, as the number of people killed in Israel’s siege on Gaza continues to rise.
On Monday, the Hamas-controlled health ministry said Nasser Hospital is receiving more patients with serious injuries than it can accommodate and intensive care units have reached capacity.
This month, Israeli officials said its military will shift toward a new, less intense phase of operations in Gaza, but a humanitarian crisis in the enclave continues to deepen.
Netanyahu is facing mounting pressure both on the state of the conflict at present and on what Gaza will look like once the fighting ends.
The Israeli prime minister is being pushed by the international community – including the US, Israel’s most important ally – to allow the creation of a viable Palestinian state. Domestically, he is being pressured to guarantee Israel’s security, most notably from far-right members of his coalition.
He has also faced growing criticism inside Israel for so far failing to secure the release of all the hostages taken by Hamas during their October 7 attack.
Israel has offered a two-month ceasefire to Hamas as part of a prospective hostage deal, Axios reported Monday, citing two unnamed Israeli officials. Israeli officials are optimistic about Hamas’ response to that proposed deal, CNN foreign policy analyst Barak Ravid told CNN on Monday.

P3CSHZQB4W_JF4Q59G3OXEVH4R,Opinion: The ‘Barbie’ outrage is missing a very important point’,Opinion by Hannah Ryan,"5 minute read Updated 4:34 PM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/26/opinions/barbie-oscars-outrage-is-misplaced-ryan/,"Editor’s Note: Hannah Ryan is an associate producer for CNN International. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. Read more opinion on CNN.
It’s Oscars season and “Barbie” is dominating the discourse.
Since the nominations were announced on Tuesday, fans of Greta Gerwig’s pink-tinged fantasy have been taking to social media to make it clear that they’re not happy that Gerwig and star Margot Robbie didn’t bag nominations for their respective categories in best director and best actress (though both did receive nominations, Robbie as a producer and Gerwig for best adapted screenplay).
The outrage at their perceived omissions is so widespread that even former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has weighed in. Many feel that the fact that Ryan Gosling is nominated for best supporting actor for his performance as Ken, Barbie’s lovable-but-dim boyfriend, is reflective of the patriarchal power of the world that the film supposedly rallies against.
But here’s the thing; “Barbie” is neither smart enough nor interesting enough to be inspiring this level of uproar. When I first heard about “Barbie,” I thought I would like it. I’m a huge fan of Gerwig’s other work, especially “Frances Ha” and “Little Women,” the latter of which I am convinced is the greatest example of a perfect filmic adaptation of a book (and for which Gerwig received a nomination for best adapted screenplay, though notably not for best director).
Related article Opinion: Why the ‘Barbie’ Oscars snubs are so enraging
Of “Barbie,” I thought it might be, if nothing else, a fun time at the movies. What I found, instead, was a deeply disappointing blockbuster that offered audiences a watered-down version of feminism and which often felt like a vehicle for multimillion dollar toy company Mattel to poke fun at itself whilst using the movie as a shield from real criticism. (The distributor of “Barbie” and CNN share a parent company).
There is nothing radical about the feminism that “Barbie” puts forward. In fact, I feel that it actually lets patriarchy off the hook far too easily by suggesting – through the proxy of Ken – that men’s misogyny comes from a place of idiocy rather than malice. By depicting Ken as a dumb, hapless figure, “Barbie” makes misogyny a laughing matter, instead of what it often is – a matter of life and death for women.
“Barbie” functions only as a palatable crowd-pleaser and not as an intelligent critique of sexism. In the film, audiences have a laugh at bumbling Mattel executives. But the company will continue to make a fortune from a doll that, at least at its inception, helped to uphold unrealistic beauty standards for a generation of girls and women.

It’s also important to remember that “Barbie” has most certainly not been ignored by the Academy Awards’ members. It has eight nominations – which is far more than many of 2023’s other women-directed films got. While “Barbie” achieved cultural phenomenon status last year, other films that took a more complicated approach to womanhood were shut out of the Oscars and the mainstream awards circuit completely.
Sofia Coppola’s “Priscilla” – a claustrophobic portrait of Priscilla Presley’s marriage to Elvis – and Molly Manning Walker’s “How to Have Sex” – a devastating story of a girls’ vacation that ends in tears – received no attention from the Academy. Nor did Ava DuVernay’s groundbreaking film “Origin.” All offer far more fascinating explorations of women’s lives and interior thoughts than “Barbie,” and all are defined by their exceptional direction and their standout performances by two rising stars in Cailee Spaeny and Mia Mckenna-Bruce, as well as veteran Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor.
“Origin” is a fascinating work inspired by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Isabel Wilkerson’s book, “Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents.” “Priscilla” was directed by one of the most famous and accomplished female directors of the 21st century and “How to Have Sex” won the prestigious prize of “Un Certain Regard” at the Cannes Film Festival.  Yet all were totally overlooked by the Oscars.

And, ironically, the discourse swirling around Gerwig and Robbie’s supposed lack of recognition has overshadowed a truly historic moment. Lily Gladstone is up for best actress for her role in the Martin Scorsese epic “Killers of the Flower Moon” – making her the first Native woman of American descent to be nominated in the category.
Yet, in most conversations about the Oscars in recent days, Gladstone’s achievement has become something of a footnote. Energy that could be better expended by highlighting the watershed moment for Gladstone and for Native women of American descent has instead been poured into indignation over Gerwig and Robbie missing out.
As for the categories that Robbie and Gerwig were not considered for, I don’t think it’s unfair to argue that they might’ve not landed the nominations because neither have put forward their best work here. Gerwig’s direction in “Barbie” is grand in scope, no doubt, but it’s her impeccably observed depiction of a strained mother-daughter relationship in 2017’s “Lady Bird” that broke my heart and cemented her as an astute filmmaker.

Robbie does a fine job as the titular doll in “Barbie,” but she is far more affecting in the few minutes of screentime she has in Wes Anderson’s recent “Asteroid City” and far funnier in “The Wolf of Wall Street” – where her excellent comedic timing comes across much better than it does in the hollow world of “Barbie.”
With just over a month to go before the ceremony itself, don’t expect the furor over “Barbie” to go away anytime soon. But while some of its fans flood the internet with anger, it might be worth seeking out some of 2023’s other female-directed films, from A.V. Rockwell’s “A Thousand and One” to “Priscilla” and “Origin” and “How To Have Sex,” all of which offer far more nuanced and complex studies of women and all of which haven’t had so much as a whiff of winning a seat at the Oscars’ table."

After completing 72 historic flights on Mars over three years, NASA’s Ingenuity helicopter mission has ended.
Originally designed as an experiment, Ingenuity became the first aircraft to operate and fly on another world, lifting off on April 19, 2021.
Imagery and data returned to NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, showed that one or more of the chopper’s carbon fiber rotor blades was damaged while landing during its final flight this month. The team determined that the helicopter is no longer able to fly, according to the space agency.
Ingenuity, which had traveled to Mars as the Perseverance rover’s trusty sidekick, is sitting upright on the surface of the red planet, and mission controllers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory have been able to maintain communications with the rotorcraft.
The NASA mission team only expected the chopper to carry out five test flights in 30 days. After acing its five expected flights, Ingenuity graduated from its role as an experiment to serving as an aerial scout for the Perseverance rover. The chopper flew over areas of scientific interest to capture images and help the mission team determine Perseverance’s next targets for detailed analysis. The helicopter carried out its final flight on January 18.
Together, the rover and helicopter spent the past few years exploring Jezero Crater, the site of an ancient lake and river delta on Mars. Scientists are hoping that samples collected by Perseverance, which will be returned to Earth by future missions, could determine whether life ever existed on the red planet.
“The historic journey of Ingenuity, the first aircraft on another planet, has come to end,” said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson, in a statement. “That remarkable helicopter flew higher and farther than we ever imagined and helped NASA do what we do best — make the impossible, possible. Through missions like Ingenuity, NASA is paving the way for future flight in our solar system and smarter, safer human exploration to Mars and beyond.”
Apart from achieving the first Wright brothers moment on another planet, Ingenuity logged many milestones. It flew 14 times farther and 33 times longer than planned, logging more than 2 hours of flight time.
“At NASA JPL, innovation is at the heart of what we do,” said Laurie Leshin, director of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in a statement. “Ingenuity is an exemplar of the way we push the boundaries of what’s possible every day. I’m incredibly proud of our team behind this historic technological achievement and eager to see what they’ll invent next.”
As the first space helicopter, Ingenuity has been compared with the Wright Flyer, the first heavier-than-air, powered aircraft to fly successfully on Earth in 1903. The Wright Flyer flew four times on its first day of flight before being blown over and broken by the wind, Leshin said. The feat is still considered one of humanity’s greatest achievements, and now Ingenuity joins the Wright Flyer as a history-making aircraft that has proved new capabilities.
“It’s humbling Ingenuity not only carries onboard a swatch from the original Wright Flyer, but also this helicopter followed in its footsteps and proved flight is possible on another world,” said Teddy Tzanetos, Ingenuity’s project manager at JPL, in a statement.
Ingenuity was scheduled to make a short vertical flight, known as a hop, on January 18 to help the mission team determine its exact location. The helicopter experienced an emergency landing on its previous flight, flight 71.
During flight 72, Ingenuity rose about 40 feet (12 meters) in the air, hovered for 4.5 seconds and began to descend at 3.3 feet per second (1 meter per second).
But when the chopper was 3 feet (1 meter) above the Martian surface, the mission team lost communication with Ingenuity because it stopped sending data to the rover. The helicopter relies on Perseverance to serve as its communications relay because Ingenuity doesn’t have a way of independently exchanging data with Earth.
Communications were restored with Ingenuity the next day, allowing the mission team to analyze the flight data and see images that revealed at least one damaged rotor blade.
The team is still investigating the cause of the communications blackout and the helicopter’s orientation as it touched down. It’s possible that one of the blades struck the ground during landing, Nelson said.
The team estimates that 25% of the end of the blade is missing, Tzanetos said.
Ingenuity will not attempt any additional flights to test the capability of its rotors because helicopters must be impeccably balanced in order to fly, he said. Most of the lift comes from the last 25% to 35% of the rotor system, and Ingenuity has lost a key part of its thrust capacity.
Whether or not the blade strike occurred and caused the communication loss or a power brownout caused the rotor strike, the team will never know because the data was not saved, he said.
Currently, Perseverance is several hundred meters to the southeast of Ingenuity and driving west on its sample collection mission. The rover may be able to get within 200 to 300 meters of the helicopter and will try to photograph it.
Ingenuity doesn’t carry any scientific instruments, so there is no benefit to treating it like a stationary mission on the ground now that it can’t fly, Tzanetos added.
Once Perseverance drives to the west of the crater’s rim, the rover will lose contact with Ingenuity, which is expected to occur within weeks or months.
Now, the team will carry out some final tests with Ingenuity and download the rest of its data and images.
“She’s tougher than any of us could have ever imagined, going through a blade strike for a helicopter is typically the end and Ingenuity was able to do that and still survive afterwards,” Tzanetos said. “We couldn’t be prouder of our little tough trailblazer.”
The ending of the mission is “bittersweet,” as Nelson said, but the helicopter surpassed expectations for so long. The mission team overcame numerous challenges to keep Ingenuity flying long past its expected life span.
On Earth, helicopters can’t fly above about 25,000 feet, Leshin said. And Ingenuity had the monumental task of flying through the thin Martian atmosphere.
“On Mars, the atmosphere is so thin that it’s equivalent to what Earth’s atmosphere is at (80,000) or 90,000 feet,” Leshin said.
Over the course of its mission, Ingenuity had multiple software upgrades to help it fly over treacherous terrain, cleaned itself up after dust storms, survived the frigid Martian winter, executed three emergency landings, had a dead sensor and carried out operations from 48 different sites. The helicopter experienced the “infinite amount of curveballs that Mars always throws at you want to try to operate a spacecraft so, so far away,” Tzanetos said.
Ingenuity’s mission kicked off in the spring, when conditions are warmer and clearer on Mars. But as Martian winter approached in June 2022 and the mission outlasted its initial goals, Ingenuity didn’t have enough power to keep itself heated during the freezing nights. As a result, the chopper’s flight computer regularly froze and reset, causing multiple “brownouts.”
All of the data gathered during the lengthy duration of Ingenuity’s mission will help inform future rotorcraft designs to explore Mars and other worlds.
Tzanetos said no one should be surprised when the first astronauts land on Mars with aircraft zooming around above them in the Martian skies to capture the moment.
“The Mars helicopter would have never flown once, much less 72 times, if it were not for the passion and dedication of the Ingenuity and Perseverance teams,” Tzanetos said. “History’s first Mars helicopter will leave behind an indelible mark on the future of space exploration and will inspire fleets of aircraft on Mars — and other worlds — for decades to come.”"
P6LAHVKW3Y_39I2B4LEHZDRF2I,This hidden BBQ joint is taking Dubai’s food scene by storm,"Story by Rebecca Cairns, CNN; Video by Ana DeOliva, CNN","5 minute read Published 4:27 AM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240122,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/travel/big-t-bbq-dubai-texas-hidden-barbecue-joint-hnk-spc-intl/,"Editor’s Note: This CNN series is, or was, sponsored by the destination it highlights.

Al Quoz Industrial Area 4 looks much like the other three: a vast complex of low-rise warehouses, dusty roads passing factories and storage units, trucks and lorries ferrying goods to and fro. It looks nothing like the Dubai of travel brochures or Instagram — no iconic skyscrapers, no golden beachfront, no glitzy lights, no luxe resorts.
But among the clutter of concrete and corrugated iron of Al Quoz 4 is a restaurant that’s quickly turning the neighborhood into a must-visit for foodies: Big T’s BBQ.
The humble Texas-style barbecue joint, named after its owner, founder, and head chef Fadel “Big Tasty” Faour, is only open three days a week but has garnered a cult following of loyal customers who are willing to queue for up to an hour to grab a portion of its famous brisket.
“I’m proud and honored that I’ve received a lot of attention from people who love to explore food,” says the Palestinian chef, who grew up in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), adding that many of his regulars have now become friends.
One of the draws here is Faour’s 1,000-gallon Texan smoker — the largest of its kind in the UAE, he claims. Faour’s goal is to recreate the authentic flavors of the Lone Star state for his customers, down to the post-oak wood he imports from Texas for smoking.
“It’s what Texas uses. Think of oak as the spice — each wood will taste different. I try to keep it as original tasting as possible,” says Faour. “If you want to taste actual Texas barbecue, not any just state, but Texas barbecue, it’s this.”
Food runs in Faour’s family. His parents owned a chocolate factory and import business in Al Quoz Industrial estate, and he always had a passion for cooking. In 2016, after years of traveling and volunteering in kitchens, he joined the Institute of Culinary Education in Manhattan, and worked in prestigious New York kitchens. “I was just eager to jump at any chance to explore food,” he says.
It was a trip to Texas in 2019 that gave him his first taste of barbecue, and he spent months living with a friend and trying all the best spots for smoked and grilled meat. It was here Faour bought his famous smoker — long before he dreamt up Big T’s.
“Good Texas smokers are scarce” because they’re handmade and often have year-long waiting lists, he says. “I knew I wanted to open a restaurant but I didn’t have a plan on when or where,” he adds.
When the pandemic hit in 2020, Faour moved back to Dubai. Lockdowns and restrictions forced the family’s chocolate business to close — but Faour saw an opportunity to put his culinary training into action and make his dream of opening a restaurant a reality, utilizing the now-empty warehouse.
He transported the smoker to Dubai in 2022, opening Big T’s BBQ in December of that year. It was bare-bones: the sign above the door was handpainted, and a hand-written menu was taped by the cash register. Fluorescent tube lights bounced off the concrete floor and mismatched furniture.
But the sparse decor of the cafeteria-style restaurant didn’t matter to his diners. They were there for one thing: beef. Brisket, short ribs, pastrami, sausages, burgers, and double-fried beef tallow fries, along with a monthly and weekly rotation of specials. The brisket, which has become Big T’s signature, is smoked for 12 to 16 hours a day.
“We just cook it till it’s done. There is no time or temperature, we just keep checking. We know how it feels when it’s done. We go a lot on feeling,” Faour adds.
When Big T’s opened, Faour could barely keep up with demand, sometimes selling out by mid-afternoon. With the growing popularity, he bought not one, but two new smokers, tripling his capacity.
“Now we only sell out of everything once every three months,” Faour says. There may be less choice in the hour before it shuts but he’s quick to add: “You’ll always have something nice to eat till closing time.”
While Dubai’s food scene has captured international attention, dominating the 50 Best Restaurant list for MENA (Middle East and North Africa) and becoming the first city in the region to have its own Michelin guide, its budget dining venues are less well known.
The emirate is home to around 18,000 food outlets, and its culinary scene is a reflection of the 200 different nationalities living in the UAE — something that makes it “one of the best cities in the world for diversity of food,” says Alex Augusti, the Dubai-based food vlogger behind Just Food DXB. His videos often highlight low-cost eateries in unusual places, like Big T’s, which he calls his “go-to” for all things meat.
“It’s rustic, it’s rough around the edges and that’s why I love it,” says Augusti. “He’s got years of experience in the US and he really does inject that passion and that enthusiasm into his food.”
Augusti adds that Faour has “shaken up the food scene” and has raised the bar for barbecue in the city, “especially the smoked brisket scene, he’s really the leader in it.”
Through his videos and reviews, Augusti hopes he can convince visitors to look beyond the city’s malls and five-star resorts. “When you explore new foods and new cultures, that’s when you have the best experiences. And places like (Big T’s) are a perfect example — it’s in the middle of nowhere and you’ll probably get some of the best food in the city.”
The attention of adventurous foodies like Augusti has boosted Big T’s reputation in the city’s culinary scene, and Faour is now embarking on his second project, which he’s keeping under wraps until launch.
“I love barbecue, (but) I want to keep it interesting for me as a chef, and keep trying new things,” he adds."

P7CLMSS120_GR01Q7PHOQ9G94F,Fake Joe Biden robocall urges New Hampshire voters not to vote in Tuesday’s Democratic primary,"By Em Steck and Andrew Kaczynski, CNN","4 minute read Updated 5:44 PM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240122,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/22/politics/fake-joe-biden-robocall/,"A robocall that appears to be an AI voice resembling President Joe Biden is reaching out to New Hampshire residents, advising them against voting in Tuesday’s presidential primary and saving their vote for the November general election.
Audio of the call was reviewed by CNN from the anti-robocall application Nomorobo. Their tracking data suggests a large volume of calls. It’s unclear who is behind the call.
“Republicans have been trying to push nonpartisan and Democratic voters to participate in their primary. What a bunch of malarkey,” says the digitally altered Biden voice. “We know the value of voting Democratic when our votes count. It’s important that you save your vote for the November election. We’ll need your help in electing Democrats up and down the ticket. Voting this Tuesday only enables the Republicans in their quest to elect Donald Trump again.”
The application rates the number of calls, which were first reported by NBC News, as “severe,” among its highest rating for calls.
Nomorobo CEO Aaron Foss told CNN their data showed that 76% of the robocalls targeted New Hampshire, with 12% directed at Boston and the remaining 12% covering other areas. They estimated the number of these fraudulent calls ranged from 5,000 to 25,000.
Biden’s name will not appear on the ballot in the upcoming New Hampshire primary on Tuesday over a dispute between the state and the Democratic National Committee, which voted to move the New Hampshire primary out of its traditional first-in-the nation position. As a result, there is an organized effort to write-in Biden’s name.
“This matter has already been referred to the New Hampshire Attorney General, and the campaign is actively discussing additional actions to take immediately. Spreading disinformation to suppress voting and deliberately undermine free and fair elections will not stand, and fighting back against any attempt to undermine our democracy will continue to be a top priority for this campaign,” Julie Chavez Rodriguez, Biden’s campaign manager, said in a statement.
Aaron Jacobs, a spokesperson for Write-In Biden, said in a statement, “This is deep fake disinformation designed to harm Joe Biden, suppress votes, and damage our democracy,” adding that the group remains “focused on one goal until polls close on Tuesday: encouraging Granite Staters to write-in Joe Biden.”
At the end of the call, the voice of an unknown male directs listeners to call a local New Hampshire number to be removed from future calls.
The call uses spoofing, a common practice in fraudulent robocalling which manipulates caller ID information to display a false phone number, obscuring the true identity of the caller.
The robocall shows up on caller ID as a local New Hampshire number that belongs to Kathy Sullivan, a former New Hampshire Democratic Party chair and treasurer for the Granite for America PAC. The PAC is working to encourage voters to write in Biden’s name this Tuesday.
In a phone interview, Sullivan, who is supporting Biden in the 2024 election, said she first received calls on Sunday night and spoke with the New Hampshire attorney general’s office on Monday to file a complaint over the robocall.
“It’s very apparent that there’s someone, or someones, out there who want to suppress the primary write-in vote on Tuesday, tomorrow, by sending out this robocall saying, ‘Don’t vote for Joe Biden,’ or Joe Biden saying, ‘Don’t vote on Tuesday, save your vote until November,’” said Sullivan. “It’s voter suppression by someone who wants to hurt Joe Biden.”
Sullivan said she believes her phone was listed as a way to “jam” up her phone lines.
“It’s personally annoying, but more importantly it’s just reprehensible that someone would be trying to suppress the vote by telling people not to vote on Tuesday,” she said. “That’s an interference with our democracy. It doesn’t get much worse than that.”
The campaign of Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips, who is challenging Biden in the New Hampshire primary, found out about the call from reporter outreach last night, according to spokesperson Katie Dolan.
“Any effort to discourage voters is disgraceful and an unacceptable affront to democracy,” Dolan said in a statement. “The potential use of AI to manipulate voters is deeply disturbing.”

“The death sentence of Mohammad Ghobadlou for the crime of intentional murder of Farid Karampour Hassanvand was executed this morning after 487 days of judicial review of the case,” the Mizan news agency said.
Iranian authorities allege Ghobadlou ran over the official during a protest in Robat Karim, Tehran province, in September 2022, according to rights group Amnesty International.
He was sentenced to death by judge Abolqasem Salavati – who has been sanctioned by the United States for the notoriously harsh sentences he issued to activists, journalists and political prisoners, CNN previously reported.
Ghobadlou received two death sentences – one for “corruption on Earth,” issued by a Revolutionary Court and upheld by the Supreme Court, and one for murder, issued by a criminal court in Tehran province, according to Amnesty.
Mizan reported that the death sentence for “corruption on Earth” was suspended earlier this month until the intentional murder charge was investigated.
Ghobadlou’s lawyer Amir Raesian said he was not notified about a ruling regarding his client, and called on Mizan to release more information on the execution.
“If Mizan news agency is telling the truth, it should announce the number and date of issuance of this verdict,” Raesian said in a statement on X.

Amnesty has criticized the death sentences for following what it described as “grossly unfair sham trials, marred by torture-tainted ‘confessions’ and failure to order rigorous mental health assessments despite (Ghobadlou’s) mental disability.”
Ghobadlou had been under the supervision of a psychiatric hospital for bipolar disorder since the age of 15, Amnesty said. International law and standards prohibit using the death penalty against people with mental disabilities, according to the rights group.
Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam, the director of Norway-based Iranian human rights group Iran Human Rights (IHR), called Ghobadlou’s execution an “extrajudicial killing.”
On X, formerly Twitter, he wrote that “the Islamic Republic’s leader Ali Khamenei and his Judiciary must be held accountable for this crime. This execution must be met with strong international condemnations!”
At least eight protesters are known to have been executed in connection to nationwide demonstrations over the death of Mahsa Amini in September 2022.
Amini, a 22-year-old woman, died in the custody of Iran’s morality police after being arrested for allegedly not wearing her headscarf properly.
Protests spread like wildfire in the following weeks – which Iranian authorities responded to with brute force, mass arrests and hasty sham trials, drawing sharp global condemnation and sanctions from the US.
More than 300 people were killed in the months-long protests, including more than 40 children, the United Nations said. US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) placed the number of dead at more than 500, including 70 children. Thousands were arrested across the country, the UN said in a report last year, citing research from its Human Rights Committee."
PCY0NQ5CXT_B23BXIVP481HG3T,Another Biden business associate says Joe Biden was not involved in foreign business dealings,"By Annie Grayer, CNN","3 minute read Updated 6:17 PM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/26/politics/john-robinson-walker-house-republican-interview/,"Hunter Biden business associate John Robinson Walker said in a closed-door interview on Friday that President Joe Biden “was never involved” in any of his business dealings with the president’s son, according to Walker’s opening statement provided first to CNN.
Walker is among a growing list of Biden family business associates who have undercut Republican allegations related to their impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden including another business associate of the Biden family who testified behind closed doors on Thursday.
The committees conducting the investigation subpoenaed Walker in November for his testimony, claiming that he may know whether the president had been involved in his family’s business dealings, an unproven allegation that rests at the heart of their probe.
“In business, the opportunities we pursued together were varied, valid, well-founded, and well within the bounds of legitimate business activities. To be clear, President Biden-while in office or as a private citizen-was never involved in any of the business activities we pursued,” Walker said according to his opening statement.
“Any statement to the contrary is simply false,” Walker added. “Hunter made sure there was always a clear boundary between any business and his father. Always. And as his partner, I always understood and respected that boundary.”
Walker also discussed an interaction he had with Joe Biden shortly after he left office in 2017, House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan told reporters. Walker testified to the FBI in 2020 that Joe Biden, shortly after he left office, made in appearance at a lunch Hunter Biden was having with foreign business associates at the Four Seasons in Washington DC.
“He literally sat down. I don’t even think he drank water,” Walker told the FBI of Joe Biden’s appearance at the Four Seasons lunch meeting Hunter Biden was having with a Chinese energy company, CEFC, that Walker also attended.
Walker also said in his 2020 interview with the FBI that he believed Hunter Biden orchestrated for his father to show up to that meeting and that there were times he heard Hunter say he was setting up a meeting with his father who was then serving as the vice president.
But even in 2020, Walker testified, “I certainly never was thinking at any time that ah … the V. P. was a part of anything we were doing.’”
Jordan characterized the Four Seasons lunch interaction as “the biggest thing” he had learned so far.
Jordan said the timing of the Four Seasons meeting is “interesting” because shortly after, CEFC wired $3 million to Biden family business associates that members of the Biden family received indirectly. Republicans have zeroed in on the deals between Walker and the president’s son but there is no evidence of wrongdoing by the president.
Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin told reporters that Walker has repeatedly stated during the interview that Joe Biden was not involved in any of his business dealings with Hunter Biden. He said Walker testified Joe Biden’s appearance at the Four Seasons meeting lasted “less than 10 minutes,” and he “didn’t order any food, he wasn’t having drinks, it was a drop by to say hello.”
“The aimlessness of this investigation continues. It’s a like a fishing expedition with no fishing rods or poles or lines or bait or tackle or a map,” Raskin added.
Walker said in his opening statement he is “very concerned” that his closed-door testimony on Friday could be taken “out of context” given recent accusations that Republicans have misrepresented closed-door testimony, and asked that any public statements about the interview include the entire transcript.
Walker testified that he began working with Hunter Biden around 2008.
Upon walking into his closed-door interview, Walker told reporters he plans to tell the committee “the truth.”
After roughly seven hours of closed-door testimony, Walker left the building and said, “I answered questions to the best of my ability.”

PDEHGMXLDR_AWF6YEP0937Y8YT,The US and Iran are dangerously close to confrontation in the Middle East. Here’s where they both operate,"By Nadeen Ebrahim and Abbas Al Lawati, CNN","9 minute read Updated 7:16 AM EST, Mon January 29, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/24/middleeast/us-iran-middle-east-war-mime-intl/,"Editor’s Note: A version of this story appears in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here.
The war between Israel and Hamas has already spilled over to the wider Middle East, with prospects of a confrontation between regional and world powers becoming ever more likely.
Over the weekend, three US service members were killed and more than 30 were injured in a drone attack on a small US outpost in Jordan, according to US officials. It was the first time US troops were killed by enemy fire in the Middle East since the beginning of the Gaza war. US President Joe Biden cast the blame on Iran-backed groups, promising retribution. An umbrella group of Iranian-backed militias in Iraq said it had attacked US positions along the Jordan-Syria border, but Iran denied any direct involvement in the strikes.
Across the region, the fighting has largely been confined to tit-for-tat attacks between Iran-backed militias on one side and the US, Israel and its allies on the other. But the direct intervention of both Iran and the US in recent weeks, as well as the death of US troops, has heightened fears that the proxy conflict between the two could turn into a direct one.
US officials have repeatedly said they do not want to see the increasingly high tensions across the Middle East broaden into a regional war. So far, the US and Iran have avoided directly confronting each other. The US has attacked Iranian-backed groups in Yemen, Syria and Iraq, while Iran-linked groups have targeted American personnel in Iraq and Syria. Tehran has also struck what it said were anti-Iran groups in Iraq, Syria and Pakistan. Pakistan responded with retaliatory strikes.

The Islamic Republic, which has long opposed the presence of US forces in what it considers to be its backyard, has spent the past few decades building a network of Islamist, anti-Western and anti-Israel militias that it trains, funds and arms. Those groups have become more belligerent of late, especially Yemen’s Houthi rebels, who have disrupted a vital international waterway, wreaking havoc on global trade and prompting Western states to intervene. And it has built ties with and helped fund Hamas, which launched its war on Israel on October 7.
The US, having been trying to pivot away from the Middle East for years, finds itself drawn back into the region. It already had a sizeable military footprint in the region before the war, with over 30,000 troops.
Since the war began, however, Washington has significantly strengthened its military posture in the region, having moved roughly 1,200 US service members, alongside thousands of others aboard Navy carrier strike groups and a Marine Expeditionary Unit roughly 2,000 people strong.
And in some places, including Iraq and Syria, the US military presence overlaps that of Iran and its allies.
As tensions across the region rise, here is where Iran or its allies are present, where US forces are stationed and where both sides have conducted military operations since the start of the Israel-Hamas war:
Tehran wields significant influence on several Shiite militias closely tied to the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). These include Kataib Hezbollah, Harakat al-Nujaba, and Kata’ib Sayyid al-Shuhada.
Since the Israel-Hamas war started, a new group emerged calling itself the Islamic Resistance in Iraq (IRI). That was the group that took responsibility for the attack on Tower 22 in Jordan. According to the Washington Institute for Near East Policy (WINEP), a think tank, the IRI is an umbrella term used to describe the operations of all Iran-backed militias in Iraq. Its objective is to allow various Iraqi militias to attack US troops in Iraq and Syria under one umbrella term while obscuring the actual perpetrator, according to WINEP.
Experts say that some of the groups, like Kataib Hezbollah, are more answerable to the authorities in Tehran than to the government in Baghdad. The US Office of the Director of National Intelligence believes it has up to 10,000 members. Iraq is also home to the IRGC-founded Badr Organization as well as Asaib Ahl Al-Haq.
Iran-backed groups have carried out dozens of attacks against US forces in Iraq since the Gaza war started, to which the US has retaliated with airstrikes. Over the weekend, US personnel were injured in a ballistic missile attack on Al-Asad Air Base in Iraq. It appeared to be the second time ballistic missiles were used to target US and coalition forces in the country since October 7.
Until 2008, at the height of the Iraq war, the US had up to 160,000 troops in the country. Today, some 2,500 forces are deployed at several bases, including Erbil AB, Al-Asad AB, and the JOC-I (Union III) base in Baghdad.
Wary of his country becoming a staging ground for a regional war, Iraq’s prime minister this month said that Baghdad is seeking an exit of the US-led coalition. The US has stressed that its military is present in the country at the invitation of the government.
Iran has a direct presence in Syria, where its Quds Force, an elite unit of the IRGC that handles overseas operations, deployed after the 2011 uprising to back the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Its personnel served as military advisers and fought on the frontlines for Assad, alongside Iranian-backed militias.
Syria also hosts the Zainabiyoun and Fatemiyoun Brigades, Shiite militias linked to the IRGC who are believed to recruit Afghan and Pakistani fighters.
The US has 800 forces in Syria as part of an ongoing mission to defeat ISIS. Most US forces are stationed in what military officials call “the Eastern Syria Security Area,” where the US supports the anti-regime Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in the country’s northeast. There is also some US troop presence in Syria’s southeast, where the US supports the Syrian Free Army, which also opposes the Syrian regime. The regime considers the US to be an invader.
US troops in Syria have increasingly come under attack by Iran-backed groups in recent weeks, to which the US has responded with airstrikes.
The American troops were killed at Tower 22, a US base in northeastern Jordan near the border with Syria. US forces at the outpost are there as part of an advise-and-assist mission with Jordan. US officials said the drone was fired by Iran-backed militants and appeared to come from Syria.
The Islamic Resistance in Iraq said in a statement on Telegram that it had attacked four bases along the Jordanian border, including three in Syria.
Jordan hosts around 3,000 US troops. A longtime US ally and a major recipient of US military aid, Jordan’s airbases such as the Muwaffaq Salti Air Base in Azraq, have been key to US intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance missions in Syria and Iraq, where Washington has been fighting ISIS.
Lebanon is home to the most powerful paramilitary force in the Middle East: Iran-backed Hezbollah, one of the Islamic Republic’s most effective regional proxies.
The group has its main base on the Israel-Lebanon border and has been exchanging fire with Israel since the Gaza war began. The movement is close to Hamas in Gaza.
While the exact size of the Shiite Islamist group’s arsenal is unknown, experts have estimated it has between 150,000 and 200,000 missiles, as well as rockets and mortars. Hundreds of those missiles “are of high precision and highly destructive,” according to the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv.
Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah claims the group has 100,000 fighters, including active soldiers and reservists. Iran is believed to be Hezbollah’s main arms supplier.
At the heart of today’s proxy conflict between Iran and the US are Yemen’s Houthi rebels, who have been stepping up their strikes on ships in the Red Sea, saying they are revenge against Israel for its war in Gaza.
The group is currently in control of northern Yemen, and was engaged in nearly eight years of fighting with a US-backed and Saudi-led coalition before a halt in fighting last year.
Home-grown Houthi weapons were largely assembled with Iranian components smuggled into Yemen in pieces. But the group later made progressive modifications that have added up to big overall improvements, an official familiar with US intelligence told CNN previously.
The US military stations warships in the Red Sea, off Yemen’s coast, from which it has been striking Houthi targets. In December, the US assembled a coalition of more than 20 countries to safeguard commercial traffic against Houthi attacks in the Red Sea.
The besieged Gaza Strip is home to the Hamas militant group, which Israel believes to have had around 30,000 fighters before the war. An Islamist organization with a military wing, Hamas was established in 1987, and on October 7 launched an attack on Israel that killed around 1,200 people and took 253 others hostage, according to Israeli authorities.
Iran has built closer ties with the group in recent years; unlike all of Tehran’s other allies in the region, Hamas is a Sunni Muslim organization, rather than a Shiite one.
There is no evidence that Iran knew in advance about the October 7 attacks and Iran is not believed to have as much influence on Hamas as its other allies in the region. But the US believes that Iran has historically provided up to $100 million annually in combined support to Palestinian militant groups, including Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), another Gaza-based militant group.
On the other side of the border, Israel is the largest recipient of US military aid, with Washington having contributed  more than $130 billion in assistance since the Jewish state’s founding in 1948.
While the Israel-Hamas war has not yet spilled into the Gulf Arab states, some of those nations feel vulnerable as they have been targeted by Iran-linked groups before. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were attacked by the Houthis in 2019 and 2022, respectively.
The US-allied Gulf states are also home to some of the biggest deployments of US troops in the world.
The US has around 13,500 US forces in Kuwait, the largest American military presence in the region. Only Germany, Japan, and South Korea host more US forces than Kuwait.
The US’ second-largest military presence in the region is in Qatar, which hosts around 10,000 US forces at Al-Udeid Air Base, the largest US military base in the Middle East that is also home to the US Central Command’s Forward Headquarters and the Combined Air Operations Centre. The US this month quietly reached an agreement that extends its military presence for another 10 years at the base.
Qatar maintains relations with Hamas, having hosted its political office in the capital Doha since 2012.
More than 2,700 US forces are stationed at the Prince Sultan Air Base in Saudi Arabia, while the UAE hosts 3,500 US military personnel at Al Dhafra Air Base, which is home to the Gulf Air Warfare Center.
Other hubs for US military presence include Bahrain, which hosts the US Naval Forces Central Command and is home to the Navy’s Fifth Fleet. Turkey hosts 1,465 military members at Incirlik airbase."

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis ended his campaign on Sunday and endorsed Trump; Vivek Ramaswamy and Asa Hutchinson ended theirs after disappointing finishes in last week’s Iowa caucuses.
Crowded candidate fields often narrow rapidly following Iowa and New Hampshire, which have long been the first two contests on the presidential nominating calendar.
Out of the 11 major Republican candidates who competed in Iowa in 2016, it was just over 90 days before Trump was the only one left standing. (This analysis is defining major candidates as those receiving more than 1% of the vote in the Iowa caucuses.)
This year, just a week after Iowa, only Haley remains, setting up 2024 to be one of the shortest competitive primary seasons in recent history.
In 2016, the Democratic field narrowed to  Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders after the Iowa caucuses, but then the race to the nomination remained competitive through the entire primary season.
Trump won 98 of 99 Iowa counties in last week’s Iowa caucuses and outperformed his 2016 results. He claimed more than 50% of the vote, the biggest win in the history of the Iowa caucuses. Haley came in third, with 19.1% of the vote.
As for New Hampshire, Trump held 50% support among likely Republican primary voters in the Granite State, with Haley at 39% and DeSantis at 6%, according to a new CNN poll conducted by the University of New Hampshire that was released Sunday before DeSantis’ exit.
When DeSantis’ supporters are reallocated to their second-choice candidates, Trump leads Haley by a wider 54% to 41% margin. Another 3% of likely GOP primary voters say they’d vote for someone else."

“We have removed this ad,” the Swedish fashion giant told CNN. “We are deeply sorry for the offense this has caused and we are looking into how we present campaigns going forward.”

The ad, screenshotted by a number of social media users before it was removed, featured two elementary schoolgirls dressed in school uniform, with the slogan “Make those heads turn in H&M’s Back to School fashion.”
It prompted a backlash on social media, where users called it “creepy,” “disturbing,” and recalled their own stories about “being ogled” while still at school.
Australian writer Melinda Tankard Reist, who says her work addresses sexualization and the harms of pornography, was among the first on social media to oppose the ad.
“What is your intention with this sponsored Facebook ad?” she posted on X, formerly known as Twitter.
“Little schoolgirls generally don’t want to ‘turn heads.’ The large numbers I engage with in schools want to be left alone to learn and have fun and not draw unwanted attention to their appearance.”"
PE7PWV7U1H_F15HY0XDC9UPO6L,"The Never Trump movement might be in its last throes, but a news publication it birthed is booming","Analysis by Oliver Darcy, CNN","4 minute read Published 7:34 AM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/26/media/never-trump-bulwark-george-conway-podcast/,"Editor’s Note: A version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here.
The Never Trump movement might be on life support, but one of the outlets that it gave birth to is flourishing.
The Bulwark, a clear-eyed conservative news publication that stands in firm opposition to Donald Trump, is not only thriving online, but is in the midst of a “growth spurt,” publisher Sarah Longwell told me on Thursday.
The outlet, which features notable investors such as James and Kathryn Murdoch, aims to expand with new hires in the coming weeks. The first of them? George Conway, the conservative attorney whose sharp legal analysis and unsparing political commentary launched him from a well-known D.C. politico into a household name during the Trump administration.
Conway will join The Bulwark as the host of a new podcast, “George Conway Explains it All (to Sarah Longwell),” breaking down the president’s legal cases in plain, easily digestible terms. The program, co-hosted by Longwell, will air once a week and the first episode will drop Thursday night.
“The legal questions surrounding Trump are going to be an   enormous part of what happens in 2024,” Longwell noted to me. “And   I am not a lawyer. And I was constantly asking my friends who are lawyers to   explain things to me. And I was like, George, how about we just do a podcast   where you just explain stuff to me?”
The Bulwark, which now boasts nearly 30 staffers, is   “very close to breaking even,” Longwell said during our phone   conversation. The outlet generates about $3.6 million alone on newsletter   subscriptions, she said, and also draws on a separate dual revenue stream   made up of advertisements and live events.
Since its founding in 2018, the outlet has swelled in size. It now houses 10 podcasts (including Charlie Sykes’ hit show, which ranks in the top 25 news programs on Apple Podcasts), five newsletters, and has recently poured resources into a YouTube channel, which has amassed nearly 150,000 subscribers and more than 21 million video views.
Think of it like this: For the left, there is Pod Save America. For the reality-dwelling right, there is The Bulwark.
The success of the outlet might strike some as odd, given that the Never Trump camp has, at this juncture, lost the war for the soul of the Republican Party. It’s a reality that Longwell acknowledged. She described the publication’s audience as a group of Republican “expats,” “high information” Democrats looking for honest commentary from a conservative perspective, and others “trying to make sense of this political moment.”
“Part of what Never Trump was, was a way to separate   Trump from the rest of the Republican Party,” Longwell said. “As   Trump has absorbed the Republican Party, there is less of a mission over how   to save it. But that doesn’t mean that there is not a desperate need for a   voice in the center that is unapologetically pro-democracy.”
The Bulwark’s growth also comes at a time in which most news   publishers are pulling back, with the start of 2024 bringing news of brutal   layoffs from coast-to-coast. Longwell said the conservative publication has   found success by “building a community” willing to pay for a   subscription, even though most of the content is available outside its pay   wall, for free.
A key part of what gives The Bulwark an advantage in this   political moment, and inspires such loyalty, is that its writers intimately   understand the conservative movement, given they all were a part of it at one   point in time. Longwell described the outlet’s personalities as   “sherpas” helping those whom are perplexed by the GOP’s   radicalization under Trump make sense of the moment (to the greatest extent   that is possible).
That also means that those at The Bulwark don’t have a cloudy   vision and are willing to call out lies and misdeeds for what they are. While   some in the establishment press might worry about being perceived as   out-of-touch liberals, those at The Bulwark have no such fears.
“A lot of people talk about the false equivalence the   media supposedly has to do to tell ‘both sides.’ And it leads journalists to   make these false equivalencies,” Longwell said. “When you’ve been a   part of the conservative movement and seen how much it has changed, you have   no temptation to say these things are equivalent. You’re like, ‘These guys   have lost their minds! They have abandoned their principles!’ I think we have   been more unrestrained in our coverage because we’ve seen it from the   right.”
When asked whether the mainstream press is failing to call   balls and strikes properly, Longwell said she believes everyone is doing   their best to “navigate this particular unprecedented moment in their   own way.” But she did contend that she believes “we are   under-reacting as a country to this political moment.”
“And part of that is because a bunch of institutions, in   an attempt to behave, in their minds responsibly — they don’t know how to say   how dangerous this moment is and still feel like they are maintaining their   institutional objectivity,” Longwell said.
“We,” Longwell added, speaking of The Bulwark,   “are quite certain about how to handle this moment. This is really black   and white. Just say the things that are true, that are right and   wrong.”"
PHPCR03WGC_LX69QV6QOEL12X2,Who invented butter chicken? Indian judge to rule on dispute over global favorite,Story by Reuters,"2 minute read Published 9:42 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/butter-chicken-inventor-india-dispute/,"Butter chicken – one of India’s best-known dishes globally – is delicious and apparently also contentious, with two Indian restaurant chains doing battle in court over claims to its origins.
The lawsuit – which has become a hot topic in India – was brought by the family behind Moti Mahal, a famed Delhi restaurant brand that has counted late US President Richard Nixon and India’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru among its guests.
It claims restaurant founder, Kundan Lal Gujral, created the curry in the 1930s when the restaurant first opened in Peshawar before it moved to Delhi. In a 2,752-page court filing it has sued rival chain Daryaganj, accusing it of falsely claiming to have invented the dish as well as dal makhani, a popular lentil dish that is also laden with butter and cream.
The Gujral family is seeking $240,000 in damages, also alleging that Daryaganj has copied the layout of Moti Mahal’s website and “the look and feel” of its restaurants.
“You cannot take away somebody’s legacy … The dish was invented when our grandfather was in Pakistan,” said Monish Gujral, managing director at Moti Mahal.
Inventor of the UK’s ‘true national dish’ dies at 77
Daryaganj – which was established relatively recently in 2019 – counters that its late family member, Kundan Lal Jaggi, had partnered with Gujral to open the Delhi restaurant in 1947, and the dish was invented there. That gives it the right to also lay claim to the creation of the dish, it argues.
Daryaganj shared with Reuters a faded, hand-written partnership document registered in 1949 to back its argument.
The dispute has captured the nation’s attention with Indian TV broadcasters running segments on the history of the dish and debate raging on social media.
“It’s an offbeat, unique case. You really don’t know who created the first dish of butter chicken. The court will be hard pressed and will need to rely on circumstantial evidence,” said Ameet Datta, an intellectual property lawyer at India’s Saikrishna & Associates.
Testimonies of people who can link the brand to the dish they consumed decades ago could be critical proof, Datta added.
Made with tandoor-cooked chicken pieces mixed in a tomato gravy with dollops of cream and butter, the dish was ranked 43rd in a list of world’s “best dishes” by TasteAtlas as rated by nearly 400,000 users.
It was the second-ranked Indian food after butter garlic naan bread. The two are often paired together.
The case was first heard by the Delhi High Court last week and the next hearing is scheduled for May."
PNQ40YL2K7_MEB2HWYN6C5ESQH,Trump SPAC has tripled since the Iowa caucuses,"By Matt Egan, CNN","3 minute read Published 2:59 PM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/23/business/trump-stock-spac,"The latest meme stock is one closely associated with the 45th president of the United States.
Digital World Acquisition Corp., the blank-check firm that’s been trying for years to merge with Truth Social owner Trump Media & Technology Group, has emerged as a way for investors to make bets on the political fortunes of former President Donald Trump.
The share price of the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) has exploded in value as Trump’s political rivals drop out of the 2024 race and line up behind him. That’s despite the legal, regulatory and financial questions that have been swirling over the corporate marriage since it was proposed in October 2021.
Digital World’s share price spiked 88% to 19-month highs on Monday alone. That was the day after Florida Governor Ron DeSantis ended his 2024 presidential campaign and endorsed Trump.
The Trump-linked stock tumbled 10% Tuesday morning as residents of New Hampshire began voting in the primary there. But by late afternoon trading the stock reversed course and was up 6% on the day.
Since Trump’s landslide victory in the Iowa caucuses on January 15, Digital World shares have more than tripled.
“After Iowa, it got crazy. This is the only direct-ish way to play Trump,” said Matthew Tuttle, CEO of Tuttle Capital Management.
Tuttle said the stock surge has been purely fueled by momentum and Trump’s political success – not the fundamentals that are supposed to move stocks in the long run.
“There are no fundamentals here,” he said. “This is all investors playing what’s going on with Trump on a blow-by-blow basis, crushing the shorts and creating a short squeeze.”
A short squeeze occurs when investors that bet against a stock are forced to unwind their bets and buy the stock back at a higher price. That in turn drives the share price even higher, creating further losses for short-sellers.
Jay Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida, expressed shock at the stock spike for Digital World.
“It’s basically a memestock like GameStop,” Ritter said, noting that the company has “almost no revenue and is hemorrhaging money.”
Despite that, Digital World’s share price values the company at up to approximately $8 billion on a fully diluted basis, which includes all shares and options that could be converted to common stock, according to Ritter.
“It’s so grossly overvalued,” he said.
Neither Trump Media & Technology Group nor Digital World responded to requests for comment.
In November, SEC filings showed Trump Media & Technology Group has lost $31.6 million since launching in early 2021.
The Truth Social owner is burning cash so rapidly that accountants warned it might not survive unless the long-delayed merger with Digital World is completed soon.
Ritter cautioned retail investors that betting on a momentum stock like Digital World could backfire.
“Retail investors are pushing the price around, not based on the profitability of the company now or in the future but a combination of sticking it to the man and perhaps gambling that you can sell it to a greater fool at an even higher price,” he said. “The greater fool theory of investing works in the short-term but as a consistent strategy it certainly does not work.”
Even some professional traders are keeping their distance from the Trump stock given the recent volatility.
Tuttle said he’s not “messing” with Digital World now, preferring to bet on less volatile stocks that are “not going to rip my head off.”
“This is not your widow-and-orphan stock. This is something you don’t play unless you know exactly what you’re doing,” Tuttle said."
PQ32BE0GZH_NAOZ4F1RJLW9V6B,Biden campaign watching Nikki Haley’s New Hampshire performance closely,"By MJ Lee, Kevin Liptak and Arlette Saenz, CNN","5 minute read Published 5:00 AM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/23/politics/haley-biden-new-hampshire-trump/,"The unofficial start of the general election for President Joe Biden’s campaign could commence late Tuesday evening – but that all hinges on what kind of a night Nikki Haley has.
Following Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ suspension of his presidential campaign over the weekend, Haley now stands as the last remaining Republican attempting to dethrone Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential campaign. The Biden campaign is keenly aware that a strong showing for the former South Carolina governor Tuesday night could delay the informal start of the Biden-Trump match-up, which plenty of Biden campaign officials and allies are eager to kick off sooner rather than later.
The Biden campaign and the Democratic National Committee have been closely tracking the former South Carolina governor’s performance in the GOP race, following her ups and downs since she jumped into the contest almost a year ago to challenge her former boss.
As the Republican field began to narrow – and, in particular, as DeSantis’ political star seemed to fall in recent months – some Democrats close to the Biden campaign increasingly speculated that Haley appeared to be the sole candidate with anything resembling a realistic shot at defeating Trump.
Now, with only the former president and Haley competing in the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday, some Democrats are hoping Trump sews up the GOP presidential nomination sooner rather than later so the Biden campaign can fully turn its attention to the former president. Some polls have shown Haley with a more formidable edge against Biden in a general election that other Republican contenders, including Trump. Haley has sought to use that argument on the trail, claiming she’s best positioned to defeat the incumbent Democrat in November’s election.
“The sooner they can make it about Trump, and Nikki Haley falls away, that’s going to be a successful moment for the campaign,” said a senior Democrat in close touch with the campaign.
That desire to eliminate any ambiguity about who Biden’s general election rival is, is in no small part about trying to jolt voters whom the campaign says are still not paying close attention to the campaign. As CNN first reported earlier this month, the Biden campaign’s internal research shows that most of the undecided voters that the campaign is targeting – nearly three-in-four of them – do not appear to believe that Trump is likely to be the Republican presidential nominee. That biggest reason, they say: Voters are still not tuned in.
That would shift once the narrative becomes abundantly clear Trump is, in fact, the man for Biden to beat – even if that transition doesn’t happen overnight.
Officially, the Biden campaign says they remain ready to run against any GOP candidate – and that includes Haley, whose surrogates insist that New Hampshire is not a “must-win” state for her. Unlike running against Trump, campaign officials say, a Biden-Haley face-off would require the Biden reelection operation to freshly define the former United Nations ambassador.
At the top of their ammunition against Haley: Her staunchly anti-abortion views, and a bill she signed as governor that made it illegal for a woman in the state to obtain an abortion after their pregnancy reaches 20 weeks, without exceptions for rape and incest.
She has also sought to lump Biden and Trump together, telling CNN’s Dana Bash on Sunday that they were “equally bad.”
“If either one of them was good, I wouldn’t be running,” she said. “I don’t think we need to have two 80-year-olds sitting in the White House when we basically got to make sure that we can handle the war situation that we’re in. We need to know they’re at the top of their game.”
The Biden team is also closely watching how Haley’s performance plays in fundraising circles after these early contests. One Democratic source close to the campaign argued some donors looking for a GOP alternative to Trump could swing from Haley to Biden if the campaign heads towards a 2020 rematch, especially those nervous about what a second Trump term could look like.
“Nikki Haley might have survived the longest in this primary but not because she’s some kind of moderate,” one campaign official said.
One recent Haley flub has drawn the attention of Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. The two Democrats pushed back after the former South Carolina governor didn’t mention slavery as a cause of the Civil War.
“Let me be clear for those who don’t seem to know: Slavery was the cause of the Civil War,” Biden said speaking at Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, earlier this month. “There is no negotiation about that.”
For now, Biden is largely training his political fire on Trump, beginning with speeches at the start of the year casting his predecessor as a threat to democracy and, this week, accusing Trump of orchestrating the overturning of Roe v. Wade.
Online, most of his campaign’s attention has been focused on the former president rather than Haley – or before he dropped out, DeSantis. Rapid response accounts for the campaign and the DNC post clips in near real-time from Trump’s rallies, seeking to portray him as either extreme or incoherent.
There have been far fewer posts about Haley. In fact, Biden himself sought to amplify Haley’s criticisms over the weekend of Trump’s verbal flub confusing her and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi – one of the first times Biden’s own social media accounts have cast attention, however obliquely, on Trump’s mental fitness.
Toward the end of last year, Biden’s campaign had been criticized by some Democrats and allies of the president for not being forceful enough in going after Trump as it became increasingly clear he would be the GOP nominee.
Now, as Biden does ramp up his attacks, the challenge is in convincing voters to pay attention."
PQC77XWE6D_IJKAVM0JMPYDUAQ,Robert Kraft is buying a Super Bowl ad to highlight the rise of antisemitism,"By Jordan Valinsky, CNN","2 minute read Published 8:18 AM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/25/business/super-bowl-ad-stand-up-to-jewish-hate/,"A Super Bowl ad set to be shown during next month’s game will highlight the rise of antisemitism, with a 30-second spot from “Stand Up to Jewish Hate,” a campaign from the nonprofit organization founded by Robert Kraft, the billionaire businessman and owner of the New England Patriots.
It’s the first time his Foundation to Combat Antisemitism (FCAS) is buying an ad during the “most visible platform,” which last year was watched by 113 million viewers and was the third most-watched television program of all time.
Specifics of the ad weren’t released, but the organization said it builds on its “work to inspire Americans of all backgrounds to be vocal upstanders for the Jewish community and to stand up against all forms of hate.”
The “Stand Up to Jewish Hate” ad campaign debuted a few years ago in after several antisemitic incidents, including insidious comments from Kanye West (or Ye), but has taken on new significance in recent months following the October 7 assault by Hamas militants in Israel and some US college campuses becoming roiled in the subject.
A focal point of the “Stand Up to Jewish Hate” are its blue squares, which FCAS said is a “symbol of solidarity” for non-Jewish people to show their support for Jews by adding it to their social media presence.

“This message will make its debut at one of the country’s most significant cultural events to not only continue to push against indifference to Jewish hate, but also to celebrate those who stand up to all incidents of hate,” FCAS said in a press release.
According to FCAS research, 183 million posts on social media were related to antisemitism and Jewish culture in 2023 — a 330% increase from the prior year. The organization said Google searches for “Kill Jews” increased by 1,800% in the past three months.
Kraft, who built his estimated $11 billion fortune in the paper business, has recently poured millions of dollars into FCAS to combat the spread of hatred and raise awareness.
The Super Bowl airs on CBS on February 11, with ads costing a reported $7 million each."

The freezing rain is being made possible by a large push of milder air slowly starting to overspread much of the winter-weary US.
A barrage of back-to-back winter storms this month have left at least 90 people dead in 13 states as severe conditions have left people crushed under fallen trees, trapped in tornadoes or tangled in snowy car accidents. Tennessee has experienced the brunt of the fatalities, with 34 storm-related deaths.
Now people from the southern Plains to the Great Lakes are seeing accumulating ice and freezing rain Monday. Weather officials and several local transportation departments have warned drivers to exercise caution – or stay off the roads entirely.
“Icy roads will make driving hazardous. Use extra caution and drive slowly!” the Weather Prediction Center said.
Morning commuters in parts of Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas discovered slick sidewalks and icy roadways Monday. At least a glaze of ice was reported in each state, according to National Weather Service data.
Even small amounts of ice are enough to cause significant issues on untreated, paved surfaces like roads and sidewalks. Areas that receive greater amounts of ice are more likely to endure tree damage and power outages.
Several school districts across the region have canceled classes Monday, including in Tennessee, Missouri, Arkansas and Oklahoma.
Meanwhile, parts of eastern Texas and the Lower Mississippi Valley have been showered with rain and thunderstorms as a wave of warm air engulfs the region. Unseasonably warm air will go on to overrun more of the US as the week progresses.
Moisture from the Gulf of Mexico began pushing northward over the weekend and into Monday, colliding with the cold air still hovering over parts of the central US to create ice and freezing rain conditions over the Plains and Midwest.
More than 50 million people from Arkansas to the Great Lakes are under winter weather alerts Monday, prompting road hazard warnings in several states.

Ice began to build up on bridges and overpasses in the area Sunday night, the weather service in Tulsa said in a forecast message. The forecasters warned drivers to use “extreme caution” if they have to travel and leave ample distance for stopping.
“Please slow down and use caution as rain may freeze to your vehicle while driving and roads that appear wet may actually be icy!” the Tulsa weather service said in a post.
In Missouri, videos on social media showed cars losing control traveling down an ice-covered hill. Elsewhere in the state, emergency responders literally spun out in any icy development.
Air travel was also hampered by the icy conditions. By Monday afternoon at least 850 flights were canceled in the US with more than 3,300 delayed. Cancellations jumped early Monday for Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport and the St. Louis Lambert International Airport due to freezing rain in the vicinity of each airport.
In Memphis, Tennessee, cold temperatures caused water mains to break, leaving thousands with their service interrupted over the weekend, Memphis Light, Gas, and Water CEO Doug McGowen said Sunday. Most should have their service restored by Monday, and a boil water advisory could be lifted by Thursday, McGowen said.
Separate from the early-week ice, brutal winter cold triggered time-sensitive rescues in Vermont. Twenty-three skiers and snowboarders were rescued after getting lost Saturday in the backcountry, according to the Killington Police Department, which deployed a team that “hiked, snowshoed and skinned approximately 5 miles, in frigid temperatures” to guide them to safety.
Significantly above-average temperatures will spread across the East by later in the week as a series of fronts and low-pressure systems usher in warmer air and tropical moisture.
After shivering through a frigid weekend, some cities will see daily high temperatures soar by nearly 30 degrees in the coming days.
Daily high temperatures across the region will tick up a few degrees each day through midweek before some of the warmest air arrives Thursday.
Thursday’s highs are set to hit the upper 60s and 70s in the Southeast and the 50s as far north as New York. More than 140 records for warmest daily lows could be broken by Friday in parts of the Southeast, where overnight lows will soar into the 60s.
The significant warm-up will not be confined only to the East. A large swath of the central US will also finally recover from the bone-chilling cold that persisted much of January.
“Temperatures thaw out this week & will stay well above normal through the end of January,” the weather service office in the Twin Cities posted on X, later adding a future of near-record highs “certainly looks possible, stay tuned!”
Though the rush of warm air will shake off the arctic blast that dominated much of the country’s weather through the weekend, it could usher in hazardous rain and flooding.
Heavy rain will bring a threat of flooding along the Gulf Coast and western portions of the Southeast until late in the week.
Approximately 37 million people across the affected areas are under threat of flash flooding and excessive rainfall through Thursday morning. As many as 5 to 6 inches of rain could fall by the end of the week, with some areas seeing even more.
Here’s a glimpse of where the heaviest rainfall is expected across the South through throughout the week:
• Monday – eastern Texas, western Louisiana and southwestern Arkansas• Tuesday – eastern Texas to Mississippi and southwestern Tennessee• Wednesday – Texas-Louisiana border to central Tennessee and northern Alabama• Thursday to Friday morning – Eastern Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama to the far western corner of North Carolina
Some areas will be under a Level 2 of 4 risk of excessive rainfall for several days in a row.

The Ilyushin-76 cargo plane crashed inside Russian airspace, 5 to 6 kilometers (about 3 to 3.7 miles) from the village of Yablonovo in the Belgorod region. Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and its Defense Ministry called it an act of terrorism.
“The plane was destroyed by the Ukrainian Armed Forces from the area of Liptsy, Kharkiv region, using an anti-aircraft missile system,” the ministry said in a statement.
“The radar equipment of the Russian Aerospace Forces observed the launch of two Ukrainian missiles.”
Air defense systems in the Belgorod region were active shortly before the crash, according to the region’s governor Vyacheslav Gladkov.
Ukraine’s military command said it regarded Russian military aircraft approaching Belgorod as legitimate targets but stopped short of acknowledging it fired at the plane.
In a carefully worded statement, the General Staff of Ukraine’s armed forces said recent attacks on the city of Kharkiv, which lies just 18 miles (30 km) from Russia, are being facilitated by Russian cargo planes bringing weapons close to the border.
“The recorded intensity of the shelling is directly related to the increase in the number of military transport aircraft that have recently been heading to the Belgorod airfield,” the statement said.
“With this in mind, the Armed Forces of Ukraine will continue to take measures to destroy delivery means and control the airspace to eliminate the terrorist threat, including on the Belgorod-Kharkiv direction.”
Ukrainian sources earlier said the plane was carrying missiles for the S-300 air defense system. CNN cannot independently verify either side’s claims.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of “playing with the lives” of Ukrainian prisoners of war and called for an international investigation, saying “it is necessary to establish clear facts as much as possible, given that the plane crash happened on Russian territory that is beyond our control.”
Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov told reporters on Wednesday that he had requested an emergency United Nations Security Council meeting following the crash.
A video geolocated by CNN appeared to show the IL-76 plane’s final seconds before it crashes to the ground.
The video was filmed in Yablonovo, which lies about 40 kilometers (25 miles) northeast of the city of Belgorod, and begins with the plane already in a steep fall. Just before it disappears behind a passing truck and trees, what appears to be a part of the plane can be seen falling from the front of the fuselage.
Two seconds later, after the plane has disappeared from view, a huge fireball and black smoke can be seen emerging from the point of impact – which is not visible – with the ground.
The camera then pans sharply to the left to show what appears to be a small cloud of smoke. This could be an indication of a possible explosion on the plane, though the flight path of the plane cannot be established with certainty from the video.

Several eyewitness described hearing loud, thunderous claps at the time of the crash, followed by an air raid alert in the Russian city.
“We heard one or two loud bangs. With an interval of a minute or less. The second bang was much louder. We all ran out to see if someone needs help, but the crash was further away after the village. It was very loud and scary,” one woman told Russian state media RIA Novosti.
“We heard three claps. The claps were loud enough, and we thought that either something had fallen somewhere here, or that missiles had been shot down in the air. Then right after that, the guys in my class began to say that air raid alert went off in Belgorod, the sound of a siren,” said one young man.
Another man said there was a “strong vibration” in the room after the loud noises.
The pilots of the Il-76 managed to steer the plane away from the village of Yablonovo, sacrificing their lives, the rector of the local church, Priest Georgy Borovikov said.
Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov said 65 Ukrainian servicemen were on board the plane and being flown to Belgorod ahead of a prisoner swap.
“It was supposed to transport from the Moscow region to Belgorod 65 military servicemen of Ukraine. They were accompanied by three Russian officers plus the crew of six people. All of them died,” Lavrov said. “The Ukrainian side launched an air defense missile from the Kharkiv region. It targeted the aeroplane and was a fatal strike.”
CNN is not able to independently verify Russia’s claims.
A Ukrainian government agency for prisoners of war said it was investigating claims that the plane was carrying Ukrainian servicemen.
Ukraine appears to be unclear, at least publicly, on whether Ukrainian prisoners were actually on board but has suggested Moscow might have deliberately put the Ukrainian servicemen’s lives at danger.
A statement from the “Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War of Ukraine” provided no further details but did warn Russia was “actively conducting information special operations against Ukraine aimed at destabilizing Ukrainian society.”
Ukraine confirmed that a prisoner of war exchange with Russia had been due to take place on Wednesday. “It is not happening at the moment,” Andriy Yuson, from Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence, told CNN.

Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence arm said in a subsequent statement that it had fulfilled its side of that agreement, bringing captured Russian servicemen to an agreed location. However, it said Ukraine had not received details from Russia about how Ukrainian servicemen were to be brought forward to the exchange – whether they would be moved by air, rail, or road.
Crucially, it said it had not been warned against challenging the security of Belgorod’s airspace at an appointed time – something it had been warned against doing “many times in the past.” Russia has a duty to ensure the safety of prisoners of war, the statement added.
“This may indicate deliberate actions by Russia aimed at endangering the lives and safety of prisoners. Landing a transport plane in a 30-kilometer combat zone cannot be safe and in any case should be discussed by both sides, because otherwise it jeopardizes the entire exchange process.”
Six Russian crew members and three “accompanying personnel” were also on board the plane, Russian officials said. Russian Parliament’s defense committee member Andrey Kartapolov said a second military plane, also an IL-76, was carrying an additional 80 prisoners of war, which was diverted.
Kartapolov said the “Ukrainian leadership was well aware of the impending exchange and was informed of how the prisoners would be delivered. But the IL-76 plane was shot down by three missiles, either with anti-aircraft missile systems or Patriot, or with German-made IRIS.”
Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said the cause of the crash was being investigated. “A transport airplane crashed in the Korochansky district. It went down in a field near a settlement. All those on board died,” Gladkov said. “Now the crash site is cordoned off. All operational services are on site, investigative measures are being carried out,” he added.
Two Russian officials, including the Russian governor of the Tambov region, Maksim Yegorov, claimed the plane changed its course after it was hit “to avert danger to civilians” in a nearby village.
The Ilyushin Il-76 is a Soviet-era military transport aircraft with a payload of more than 50 tons, according to Europe’s air safety body, Eurocontrol. It has been in service since 1975.
The border city of Belgorod was the site of one of the deadliest Ukrainian attacks on Russian soil late last year. At least 24 people, including three children, were killed and 108 others wounded in the attacks, which sparked retaliatory Russian strikes on the Kharkiv region of Ukraine.
The plane crash comes as Russia’s war in Ukraine is set to enter its third year, with little battlefield progress made by either side in recent months. Western intelligence assessments warn that battlefield movement could further stagnate this year.
Kyiv and Moscow have exchanged prisoners of war throughout the conflict. The largest swap came earlier in January, when the two sides each exchanged over 200 prisoners.

PXZ2QHIG6P_U4DL62I55FDNMGW,Pakistan accuses India of extrajudicial killings on its territory,"By Sophia Saifi, Sania Farooqui, Michael Rios and Rhea Mogul, CNN","2 minute read Published 10:08 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/26/asia/pakistan-accuses-india-extrajudicial-killing-intl-hnk/,"A top Pakistan official on Thursday accused India of killing two Pakistani nationals on its soil, citing what he called “a pattern” of alleged Indian assassination plots overseas and raising tensions between the two nuclear-armed rivals.
In a news conference, Pakistani Foreign Secretary Muhammad Syrus Sajjad Qazi claimed Islamabad has “credible evidence” linking Indian agents to the killing of Muhammad Riaz in Pakistan-administered Kashmir on September 8 last year and of Shahid Latif in the city of Sialkot, near Kashmir, a month later.
“These were killings-for-hire cases involving a sophisticated international setup spread over multiple jurisdictions,” Qazi said.
He accused two Indian agents of recruiting assassins to kill the men – both slain in the vicinity of mosques – but did not provide further information about the victims or suggest why New Delhi might have targeted them.
India has long accused Pakistan of harboring terrorists, particularly in the disputed and heavily militarized region of Kashmir, which both countries claim in its entirety. A de facto border called the Line of Control divides it between New Delhi and Islamabad. The dispute has led to three wars between the two nations.
Qazi on Thursday compared the alleged killings in Pakistan to other purported recent Indian assassination plots in North America.
“They fit the pattern of similar cases which have come to light in other countries including Canada and the United States,” Qazi said. “Clearly the Indian network of extrajudicial and extraterritorial killings has become a global phenomenon.”
India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) rejected Qazi’s allegations, calling them “Pakistan’s latest attempt at peddling false and malicious anti-India propaganda.”
“As the world knows, Pakistan has long been the epicenter of terrorism, organized crime, and illegal transnational activities. India and many other countries have publicly warned Pakistan cautioning that it would be consumed by its own culture of terror and violence,” MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.
“Pakistan will reap what it sows.”
Last November, the US accused an Indian government official of being involved in a conspiracy to kill an American citizen on its home soil.
The revelation came a little over a month after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau publicly alleged that India may have been involved in the murder of a Canadian national on its territory, prompting a furious response from New Delhi and a diplomatic fallout between the two countries.
The Indian government has denied involvement in the American and Canadian cases and has set up a high-level committee to investigate the accusations in the US."

The steps by the Harvard Medical School affiliate come after a molecular biologist published a blog post earlier this month alleging researchers falsified data by manipulating images.
More than 50 papers are part of the ongoing review by Dana-Farber into four researchers, all of whom have faculty appointments at Harvard Medical School. Four of the papers under review were authored by Dana-Farber CEO Laurie Glimcher.
“We are committed to a culture of accountability and integrity. Therefore, every inquiry is examined fully to ensure the soundness of the scientific literature,” Barrett Rollins, Dana-Farber’s research integrity officer and chief science officer emeritus, said in a statement to CNN on Monday. “Dana-Farber has been swift and decisive in this regard.”
Six manuscripts have retractions underway, 31 have been “identified as warranting corrections” and another one with a reported error “remains under examination,” according to Rollins.
Dana-Farber has not determined whether misconduct has occurred.
The retractions and corrections add to the pressure on Harvard following weeks of scrutiny over how the Ivy League school responded to allegations of plagiarism facing Claudine Gay, who stepped down as the university’s president earlier this month. Gay requested corrections to some of her writings due to what the university described as “inadequate citation.”
Harvard submitted a trove of documents to Congress late last week as part of an investigation from a House committee.
Earlier this month, Sholto David published a blog post titled “Dana-Farberications at Harvard University,” alleging researchers at the cancer institute manipulated images and data. David suggested Adobe Photoshop was used to copy and paste images in some of the papers.
According to Rollins, Dana-Farber said it was already reviewing “potential data errors” in multiple cases that the blog listed and stressed that the issues uncovered do not necessarily amount to misconduct.
“The presence of image discrepancies in a paper is not evidence of an author’s intent to deceive,” Rollins said in the statement. “That conclusion can only be drawn after a careful, fact-based examination which is an integral part of our response. Our experience is that errors are often unintentional and do not rise to the level of misconduct.”
Some allegations raised in the blog against Dana-Farber researchers are “wrong,” while others concern data generated in outside labs, Rollins said."

The most significant national threat to reproductive rights is not a looming Supreme Court judgment or a bill being considered by Congress. It’s already here, in the form of an extant but long dormant law from 1873 that could ban abortion nationwide: the Comstock Act. The act is named after Anthony Comstock, an anti-vice crusader from the late 1800s who used his power as a special agent of the US Postal Service to enforce his beliefs about sex and propriety. He was able to persuade Congress to pass laws against “indecent or immoral” materials, including broad definitions of contraception, pornography and abortion.
Some antiabortion advocates are interpreting this law, which remained on the books during the half century that Roe v. Wade was in force, to ban mailing anything that induces an abortion. Because virtually everything used for an abortion — from abortion pills, to the instruments for abortion procedures, to clinic supplies — gets mailed to providers in some form, this interpretation of the Comstock Act could mean a nationwide ban on all abortions, even in states where it remains legal.
The Comstock Act must be repealed, and in our view, that process needs to begin this year. As tempting as it is to ignore this law, allowing it to remain on the books is too dangerous, and the stakes are too high.

The Comstock Act has long been considered a relic of history and a symbol of outdated, discriminatory beliefs. The Act had already fallen into disuse by the late 1930s and was presumed unconstitutional after the Supreme Court found a constitutional right to contraception and abortion. However, in 1971, before Roe v. Wade was decided, Congress deleted the Comstock provisions related to contraception. It left untouched the provisions on abortion, including a ban on mailing through interstate commerce “every article or thing designed, adapted, or intended for producing abortion, or for any indecent or immoral use.” This language applies to the US Postal Service as well as express carriers, such as UPS or FedEx.
The act, however, has not been enforced against abortion provision in almost 100 years. And when it was enforced in the early 1900s, federal appeals courts had read the language of the law very narrowly to apply only to illegal abortions. This interpretation was necessary for many reasons, but one of the most obvious was that the act, by its terms and contrary to pre-Roe standards, doesn’t contain an exception to save a pregnant person’s life. The Department of Justice reinforced that narrow interpretation in 2022.
But antiabortion activists, emboldened after the demise of Roe, have a new interpretation that contradicts this almost-century worth of precedent: The law is as broad and as strict as its plain terms would indicate. And, in effect, interpreting Comstock this way would solve the problem of a divided Congress that won’t pass a nationwide abortion ban. They have set forth this new interpretation in litigation, local ordinances, threatening letters by state legislators and attorneys general, media statements and plans for a Republican administration in 2025.
For now, the current Department of Justice will not enforce the Comstock Act. As long as a Democrat sits in the White House, the law will remain in the dustbin of history. But a future Republican administration could exhume the law and make enforcing Comstock a top priority. Even worse, given that the Act has a five-year statute of limitations, an antiabortion administration could not only prosecute people for violations that occur in the future, but also for any violations occurring right now. Current abortion providers targeted under this interpretation would try to make arguments about due process and entrapment, but they’d have to raise those arguments in court after being prosecuted, a precarious position.
Related article Opinion: How Republicans intend to bounce back from devastating losses on abortion
With this potential threat, the Comstock Act is too dangerous to stay on the books and remain unchallenged or in the shadows. We need a repeal bill now.
We concede that the questions of when and how to go about repealing Comstock involve complex strategic considerations. It is reasonable to worry that a repeal bill would draw even more attention to the Comstock Act and inadvertently confer legitimacy on the broad antiabortion interpretation. Moreover, courts might view a failed repeal effort—and given the current Congress, failure is likely—as evidence that Congress believes the Comstock Act is good law and applies to all abortion, not just illegal abortions. It’s true that courts sometimes look to this subsequent legislative history to interpret laws, though doing so is generally disfavored for good reasons.
These concerns are real but should be evaluated alongside other strategic considerations. Most notably, as already described, antiabortion extremists are already hard at work pushing their interpretation of the Act into the mainstream discourse. Ignoring those strategies will not stop them from gaining momentum unless those in power call out the severe (and absurd) consequences of enforcing this law.
And antiabortion judges wouldn’t need a failed repeal attempt to achieve the outcome they want. They can and will rely on Comstock’s current text whether Congress tries to repeal the law or not. Federal courts in Texas and the Fifth Circuit of the US Court of Appeals have already accepted the antiabortion interpretation without a whisper of Congressional action to repeal the Act. And there are ways to mitigate the risks of a failed repeal bill. The bill could include ample language in the preamble or purpose section that explicitly rejects any endorsement of the broad, antiabortion interpretation of Comstock.
The risks of a repeal effort also need to be balanced against the benefits. We are not naive enough to think the repeal law will pass in this Congress given the Republican-controlled House and lack of a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate. Nonetheless, there is much to be gained in introducing a repeal bill that forces every federal legislator to take a public position on Comstock.

With a repeal bill on the table, representatives would have to state publicly whether they defend a law written at a time when women couldn’t vote, couldn’t say no to their husbands’ sexual advances, were barred from most professions (including the legal profession), and had their legal identity disappear upon marriage. They should be forced to say whether they support banning not only abortion-inducing items but also lingerie and sex toys and any other items that could be put to “indecent or immoral use.” And perhaps most forcefully, they should look their constituents in the eyes when they explain that, with Comstock still on the books for an antiabortion Department of Justice to enforce, there will likely be nowhere for them to go when they need an abortion resulting from pregnancy complications, inevitable miscarriage, fetal anomaly, rape, incest or unwanted pregnancy.
Again, the Comstock Act has no exceptions and applies nationwide. Everyone implicated by the act, even pregnant people, are subject to punishment, and the penalties for violating the act are steep: federal prison time and fines.
It’s time for legislators who support abortion rights to take control of the conversation — to force their colleagues to say the quiet part out loud and to vocalize their support for these draconian laws. And even if a repeal effort fails, making Comstock an issue now might influence voters to choose a president and other politicians in November who do not want Anthony Comstock’s moral judgments, from a bygone era, governing our modern life."

A record number of New Hampshire voters – more than 320,000 when all votes are counted, according to CNN’s estimate – turned out to choose between former President Donald Trump and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley in the state’s Republican primary.
The increase in New Hampshire Republican primary turnout is a shift from last week’s Iowa caucuses. In Iowa, Republican caucus turnout was down compared with 2016, the most recent contested Republican primary with no incumbent.
The New Hampshire primary result is a second decisive win for Trump as he begins the process of building a delegate lead. No other non-incumbent Republican candidate has won the early contests in both Iowa and New Hampshire, although Trump, as a former president with almost universal name recognition, has some of the advantages of incumbency.
Turnout is generally higher for Republican primaries in years like this one when there is a hotly contested primary on the GOP side and less competition on the Democratic side. In 2016, when there were contested primaries for both Republicans and Democrats, and when Trump notched his first victory as a candidate in the New Hampshire primary, a then-record number of Republican primary voters – nearly 288,000﻿ – took part.
Trump performed better than he did in the 2016 primary in nearly every New Hampshire town, and most of those were by double-digit margins.
That’s partly driven by the dynamics of the race: This year, Trump faced a sole remaining major challenger, while several other contenders were still actively campaigning at the time of the New Hampshire primary in 2016.
In New Hampshire’s three largest cities (Concord, Nashua and Manchester), Trump performed nearly 20 percentage points better than he did in the 2016 primary.
With final votes still being tabulated and returns not complete in all of New Hampshire’s towns, Trump won a commanding majority of more than 54%. Haley, in placing second with more than 132,000 votes, about 43% of the total, got more support in 2024 than Trump got in his 2016 victory.
Trump’s vote total of more than 166,000 and counting also sets a new record for the most votes ever won by a candidate in the New Hampshire primary in either party.
The previous record was Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ roughly 152,000 votes in the 2016 Democratic primary, when he defeated former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
One major difference for Republicans is that the 2016 race was contested between a large number of candidates and Trump won the primary with less than 36% of the vote. By primary day this year, Haley was Trump’s only remaining major challenger, making the contest mostly a two-person race, although thousands of votes were also cast for other candidates.
In 2012, when there was a similarly crowded primary and hope among Republicans that they could oust a weakened President Barack Obama, more than 249,000 voters took part in the GOP primary. In 2008, when there was another contested primary, more than 241,000 voters took part.
Compare those figures with years in which there was an incumbent Republican president. Most recently, in 2020, nearly 159,000 voters took part in the GOP primary. In 2004, when George W. Bush ran without major competition, more than 67,000 people took part.
On the Democratic side, where Democratic Party officials had tried to force New Hampshire to delay the primary, and where President Joe Biden won as a write-in candidate, fewer than 89,000 total votes were recorded with 81% of the vote tabulated, according to CNN’s calculations.
That’s more than the nearly 62,000 who took part in 2012, when Obama was an incumbent running without major opposition. The Democratic counting process was slowed this year by the fact that Biden did not appear on the ballot and officials had to read his name as written on individual ballots.
The low turnout is likely the result of the standoff between the Democratic Party and New Hampshire’s state government over the primary date. Biden’s easy victory as a write-in candidate who boycotted putting his name on the ballot is a show of his strength in the party despite some angst among Democrats about the current state of his approval ratings.
While much has been made of Haley’s effort to bring independent voters into the primary, they represented similar portions of the Republican primary electorate.
In 2016, 36% of Republican primary voters in New Hampshire were registered as independents or “undeclared,” according to CNN’s exit polls at the time. In a much more crowded field that year, Trump won the largest portion of those independent voters (39% of them).
This year, the portion of registered independents was slightly higher at 46%, and Trump got a similar portion of them at 35%, although he lost the remaining independent voters to Haley, who got 64%. A major difference for Trump in 2024 is that he won nearly three-quarters of registered Republican voters compared with the 33% he got in 2016.
Two very different versions of American Republicans showed up at the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary, and turnout was not the only difference between them.
Trump has now won more than half the vote in Iowa, a state where the majority of Republican caucusgoers (61%) think most or all abortions should be banned nationwide, and also in New Hampshire, where more than two-thirds of Republican primary voters (67%) oppose such a ban.
In New Hampshire, only a little more than a third of Republican primary voters said they were part of the MAGA movement, referring to the “Make America Great Again” slogan that Trump popularized in 2016. In Iowa, it was nearly half of caucusgoers.
In Iowa, a third of Republicans don’t think he’d be fit for office if he’s convicted of a crime. In New Hampshire, 42% of primary voters feel that way."
QASPVQQB4Y_219HB1ZEJP7JGX6,How much aid Gaza needs to survive: A visual guide,"By Rachel Wilson, Krystina Shveda and Alex Newman, CNN","7 minute read Updated 4:39 PM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240122,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/22/middleeast/gaza-foreign-aid-dg/,"Less than a week into the Israel-Hamas war, the United Nations appealed to the world asking for nearly $300 million in aid to assist Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Within a month, the figure nearly quadrupled as the entire Gaza Strip plunged into a humanitarian catastrophe.
Three months into the war, international donors, mostly governments, have provided just over half of the requested funds through the UN’s plan, according to data from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs’ (OCHA) Financial Tracking Service.
The figures reveal that only four-fifths of the emergency funding needed to ensure food security and roughly a quarter of what’s needed for shelter, water and sanitation have been provided.
Aid organizations say that nearly the entire population of the Gaza Strip faces a humanitarian crisis. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, a UN-backed food security agency, reported on December 21 that “virtually all households are skipping meals every day” in Gaza. The spread of diseases, including hepatitis, diarrhea and respiratory infections, is putting more lives at risk, according to the World Health Organization.
The UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East (UNWRA) is reporting that nearly 80% of Gaza’s civilian population of roughly 2.2 million has been displaced since Israel launched its military operation in response to Hamas’ assault on October 7, when militants killed around 1,200 people and took more than 200 others hostage, according to Israeli authorities.
Many are sheltering in tents or overcrowded accommodations in Rafah in southern Gaza, after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told people to flee both northern Gaza and Khan Younis in the south. Displaced Palestinians, many of whom left their homes with little or nothing, say they are struggling to stay dry and warm as winter temperatures and rains set in.
Meanwhile, the UN agency which provides services to more than half of Gaza’s civilians is on the verge of collapse, its leader said in a letter to the President of the UN General Assembly on December 7. As of January 12, more than 150 staff members have been killed — more than in any other conflict — and at least 70% of the remaining staff are displaced, according to the UNRWA.
The IDF has begun pulling its soldiers out of Gaza, but has said it expects fighting to continue throughout 2024. On December 22, the UN Security Council passed a resolution calling for further extended humanitarian pauses to allow more aid into Gaza. There has been no pause in fighting since a seven-day span at the end of November which was negotiated as part of an Israel-Hamas hostage release deal.
Gaza’s long dependence on aid
Gaza has been among the world’s top recipients of aid per capita for years. Before the war, four in five people depended on international help and as many as 1.84 million people were food insecure, according to the World Food Program.
The unemployment rate for Gaza was as high as 45% in 2022, according to the Palestinian Bureau of Statistics. In 2022, according to the World Bank, South Africa had the highest unemployment rate in the world at 29.8%, and Gaza and the West Bank together were third at 25.7%.
In 1993, Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) signed the Oslo Accords. Under the agreement, the PLO gave up armed resistance against Israel in return for promises of an independent Palestinian state. The accords also established the Palestinian Authority (PA) as the limited self-rule government for Gaza and the West Bank. Hamas, an Islamist organization established in 1987, opposed the accords. Its charter calls for the destruction of Israel and the group sees Israel as an illegitimate state occupying the West Bank.
Rising frustration with the PA on a number of fronts, including the lack of change, led to Hamas winning the majority of seats in the 2006 Palestinian Legislative Council election. Fatah, the political party forming the backbone of the PA, and Hamas formed a short-lived coalition government. The latter forcefully took control of Gaza in June 2007. Since then, the PA only exercises limited self-rule in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
“From mid-1990s to early 2000s, Palestine is in this state-building project and a lot of (development) aid goes towards that,” said Yara Asi, an assistant professor at the University of Central Florida who studies Palestinian health and human rights. “In the early 2000s, you start seeing disillusionment — the promises of Oslo did not come to fruition.”
In 2007, Hamas militants seized control of Gaza from forces loyal to the PA. Within months, Israel’s security cabinet would designate Gaza as “hostile territory.”
Israel then instituted an ongoing blockade, severely limiting the movement of people and goods by land, sea or air, which it argues is essential to prevent Hamas from arming itself. Restrictions extend to goods the Israelis consider as having a dual civilian and military use, such as concrete, agricultural fertilizer compounds and some medical equipment.
“Lots of everyday goods and especially building materials could not enter the Gaza Strip because they are on the so-called ‘dual-use material’ list,” said René Wildangel, an adjunct fellow at the International Hellenic University in Thessaloniki, Greece, and a former human rights expert for the Middle East at Amnesty International.
This makes reconstruction difficult, Wildangel said.
The UN said in a 2022 report that the restrictions have had a “profound impact” on daily living conditions in Gaza and “undermined Gaza’s economy, resulting in high unemployment, food insecurity and aid dependency.”
In the wake of the blockade, trade stalled, jobs disappeared, and more and more families fell into poverty, while the population in Gaza grew by nearly 60%, according to an analysis of Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics data.
With Hamas classified as a terrorist organization by the United States and European Union, most of the international community cut off direct investment to Gaza after 2007.
But the magnitude of need in Gaza meant emergency and humanitarian assistance had to keep coming. Data published by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) shows total foreign aid to the Palestinian territories has been notably higher since the Hamas takeover compared with the post-Oslo era.
But even as foreign aid to Gaza rose in the wake of the Hamas takeover, the amount of aid fluctuates annually, OECD data shows.
“Aid to Palestinians is adhoc, it depends on who the (US) president is, depends on who is in charge in Europe; Qatar may wake up one day and decide they want (to help),” Asi told CNN. “So, Palestinians are not given any ability to plan things for the future.”
After 2007, the US bolstered its economic assistance to strengthen the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank.
In 2018, the Trump administration cut about $200 million in Palestinian aid and halted contributions to UNRWA. Though Biden reinstated assistance in 2021, the amounts have never returned to Obama-era levels, which reached as high as $1 billion in 2009.
Qatar has also been a major donor to Gaza, contributing about $1.3 billion since 2019, according to OECD data. The country has even provided cash to pay civil servants’ salaries and shipped fuel to help with generating electricity since at least 2018 with Israel’s approval.
The PA opposed the funding of its rival, and the Israeli intelligence community didn’t back it, according to a former senior defense ministry official, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at the time that he supported the Qatari payments, “to return calm to (Israeli) villages of the south, but also to prevent a humanitarian disaster (in Gaza).” Israeli and international media reported Netanyahu hoped that an emboldened Hamas and divided Palestinian factions would prevent efforts to create a Palestinian state, CNN has reported.
Qatar maintains close ties with both Hamas and Western states, including the United States.
Qatar’s funding has been “a lifeline to the Hamas government” ever since its takeover in 2007, Wildangel said, but added that these funds — some of which have been delivered in suitcases full of cash — have been very hard to track.
Israeli leadership fought over post-war plans for Gaza during a security cabinet meeting on January 4, CNN reported, and ministers have outlined conflicting plans for its future governance.
Meanwhile, civilians in Gaza continue to face desperate hardship. The UN emergency relief chief said earlier last week that the “great majority” of 400,000 Gazans at risk of starving “are actually in famine, not just at risk of famine” while the enclave faces a continuing near-total communications blackout. Medicine for Israeli hostages and Palestinians entered Gaza last Wednesday after Qatar brokered a deal with Israel and Hamas. For every box of medication given to a hostage, Palestinians in Gaza would receive 1,000 boxes.

QCEGYKYYFY_736LOGHEH31BEN0,Haley remains defiant as Trump ratchets up attacks on last-standing 2024 GOP rival,"By Eric Bradner, Arit John, Alayna Treene, Kylie Atwood and MJ Lee, CNN","10 minute read Updated 8:32 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/25/politics/nikki-haley-trump-republican-primary/,"Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley is growing more defiant in the face of Donald Trump’s efforts to push her out of the 2024 Republican primary race, poking and prodding at the former president and encouraging supporters to wear Trump’s attacks as a badge of honor.
Returning to her home state Wednesday, Haley mocked Trump’s victory speech in New Hampshire the night earlier — one in which the former president raged about the concession speech Haley had just delivered.
She said Trump “pitched a fit,” called him “insecure” and declared he “should feel threatened, without a doubt.” She cast doubt on his mental competency — the same line of attack Trump and his allies have long leveled at President Joe Biden — and dared Trump to debate her one-on-one.
“Bring it, Donald,” she said in North Charleston. “Show me what you got.”
Haley’s increasingly pointed attacks on Trump come amid pressure from many Republicans for her to drop out of the 2024 primary race so that the party can coalesce around the former president — who is seeking a third consecutive nomination.
Polls show Haley is far behind Trump in South Carolina, where many of her former allies have turned on her and the Republican primary electorate is much more conservative than that of New Hampshire — where she lost to Trump by 11 points.
Still, she remains a thorn in the former president’s side, provoking his ire in ways the 2024 Republican presidential contenders he’s already dispatched never did.

And Haley’s aides say that’s intentional.
Her campaign is bracing for Trump to go too far in attacking Haley and believes those attacks are likely to boost her support in South Carolina. One campaign official said Trump’s attacks would be a “key piece” of Haley’s pathway to winning over Palmetto State voters ahead of the February 24 primary.
It’s the same strategy she used in her home state in 2010 — when she seized on allegations of affairs and racist attacks to fend off three Republican primary rivals in the governor’s race.
“Those attacks were one part of why she won,” the campaign official said. “South Carolinians didn’t like it then and they won’t like nasty attacks now.”
With Haley refusing to drop out of the race, Trump has shifted from viewing her as a primary rival to a full-blown enemy, and has grown increasingly angry with her, sources close to the former president said.
“Before she was a gnat. Now she is an enemy, and Trump plans to bludgeon her in the lead-up to South Carolina,” a person who spoke with Trump following his victory in New Hampshire told CNN.
He is also targeting Haley’s donors, warning that they’ll be “permanently barred” from his orbit if they continue to contribute her campaign.
“Nikki ‘Birdbrain’ Haley is very bad for the Republican Party and, indeed, our Country. Her False Statements, Derogatory Comments, and Humiliating Public Loss, is demeaning to True American Patriots,” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform Wednesday night.
“Anybody that makes a ‘Contribution’ to Birdbrain, from this moment forth, will be permanently barred from the MAGA camp. We don’t want them, and will not accept them, because we Put America First, and ALWAYS WILL!” he said.
Haley’s campaign leaned into those attacks Thursday, releasing T-shirts emblazoned with the words“Barred. Permanently.” Haley posted a photo of the new T-shirts on social media, saying, “Enough said … Grab your shirt here.”
Haley also told supporters in North Charleston that her campaign had already raised $1 million after her concession speech and Trump’s election night address in New Hampshire.
Trump’s latest attacks are an escalation of weeks of digs at Haley, who served as his US ambassador to the United Nations.
Trump has already attacked Haley with a racist dog whistle, referring to her on Truth Social by her first name Nimarata, which he misspelled “Nimrada” and later “Nimbra.” He has also falsely suggested Haley is not eligible for the presidency.
Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants, was born Nimarata Nikki Randhawa. She has gone by “Nikki” since childhood and took her husband Michael Haley’s last name after they married. The attacks were reminiscent of Trump referring to former President Barack Obama by his middle name, Hussein, and demanding to see his birth certificate.
“It’s a little bit of a take off on her name — you know, her name, wherever she may come from,” Trump said of Haley on Fox News.
Trump and his campaign had hopes that a win in New Hampshire would effectively end the GOP presidential primary, his advisers said. They are eager to declare that the former president has become the presumptive Republican nominee as soon as possible and pivot their efforts toward a general election rematch with Biden.
Emboldened by the flood of endorsements he has received in recent days — from former primary rivals, congressional leaders and governors — Trump personally believes the party has fallen in line and wants to move forward with the weight of the GOP behind him, his advisers said. But from Trump’s point of view, Haley is getting in the way.
Haley’s decision to stick it out for now has infuriated the former president, the sources said, and he is now determined to hurt her as much as possible ahead of South Carolina, where his campaign will continue to try and paint Haley as being unpopular with people in her own backyard.
“We need to unite around our eventual nominee, which is Donald Trump,” Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said Tuesday on Fox News.
The Trump campaign had initially approved going forward with a draft RNC resolution to formally declare Trump the party’s presumptive 2024 nominee and the former president himself was also on board until backlash began, a source familiar told CNN.
Trump wrote on Truth Social that he appreciated the effort but was opposing it “for the sake of Party unity” and wanted to “finish the process off AT THE BALLOT BOX.” Dave Bossie, an RNC committeeman from Maryland who recently endorsed Trump, withdrew the resolution Thursday night, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN, but not before Haley’s campaign began fundraising off of it.

“The RNC is leveraging the establishment to try and crown Trump the presumptive nominee,” Haley wrote in a fundraising email. “Well I have news for them: I’m in this to win it and I’m not going anywhere.”
Trump’s attempts to embarrass Haley were on display in New Hampshire. In the final days before the GOP primary there, Trump paraded a series of South Carolina Republican officials onstage at his rallies, including Gov. Henry McMaster, Lt. Gov. Pamela Evette and multiple congressmen.
For Trump’s victory speech Tuesday night, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott — a onetime presidential rival whom Haley appointed to the Senate in 2012 — stood onstage behind Trump days after endorsing him.
“She actually appointed you, Tim,” Trump said. “You must really hate her.”
Scott stepped forward and leaned into the microphone in an effort to defuse the situation. “I just love you,” he said.
“That’s why he’s a great politician,” Trump responded.
Even as her campaign team plans for a monthlong fight in South Carolina, officials say Haley is gaugingthe support of donors and taking the temperature of longtime supporters about her path forward. Those private conversations could help influence any campaign decisions.
Trump did not do well with independents in New Hampshire, which further bolsters Haley’s argument that he would lose in the general election, her aides said. Haley got the vote of about 6 out of 10 independent voters in New Hampshire, according to CNN exit polls.
Art Pope, a North Carolina retail magnate who is supporting Haley, sharply criticized Trump’s threat to blacklist the former governor’s donors, saying it “emboldens me” and only increases his commitment to her candidacy for the GOP presidential nomination.
“I and most Americans do not respond well to a bully,” Pope, an influential player in North Carolina Republican politics, told CNN on Thursday while noting that he voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020. “President Trump wants to be the leader of the country … but rather than unifying, reaching out and building support, he’s basically telling us to go away and take a hike and threatening us. I decline to be threatened. I’m not going to be intimidated.”
He said Haley clearly is “getting under the skin” of someone “who wants an anointment, rather than letting the voters have a choice in the primaries.”
However, other donors, including a prominent Democrat who had crossed party lines in a bid to stop Trump, said they will no longer back Haley’s efforts financially after her loss in New Hampshire.
Reid Hoffman, the co-founder of LinkedIn and a prominent Democratic donor who initially gave $250,000 to the pro-Haley super PAC, SFA Fund Inc., has no plans to continue donating to Haley’s presidential campaign after she lost the New Hampshire primary, his adviser Dmitri Mehlhorn said.
“If she had won New Hampshire there would have been a huge push to raise many tens of millions for her to build on that momentum in SC and Super Tuesday. The investment was based on winning NH,” Mehlhorn told CNN.
Haley’s campaign declined to comment on the donor moves.
Biden campaign officials have been privately cheering on Haley’s decision to stay in the presidential race, sources say, as they monitor Trump lashing out at her.
The Biden campaign made clear after the New Hampshire primary that it fully believes Trump will be the president’s GOP opponent. Still, Biden’s reelection team has welcomed seeing Haley prolong the Republican contest and force the Trump campaign to use its resources and time to attack her.
“Go forth and prosper,” one Biden campaign official said in describing the team’s delight to see the Trump-Haley battle continue.
The Biden campaign account on Truth Social has amplified some of Haley’s ongoing attacks on Trump, including her saying in an interview this week that Trump is prone to throwing “temper tantrums” when he is nervous or feels threatened.
Haley and her supporters have embraced her status as a long-shot candidate, drawing connections to tough fights she has waged, and won, at the start of her political career in South Carolina.
“This is nothing new to her,” said South Carolina state Rep. Nathan Ballentine, a longtime Haley ally. “She’s always been the underdog, and frankly, she thrives in that environment.”
She won her first race, a 2004 contest for a state House seat, after beating a 30-year incumbent in a Republican primary by 9 points.
Six years later, she faced the real test of her political fortitude during her 2010 bid for governor. First, a key political ally – South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford – became a major liability after he revealed he’d secretly left the country to visit his mistress in Argentina.
“People looked at me with pity,” Haley wrote in her 2012 autobiography. “They no longer treated me like a real candidate. Worst of all, no one returned my calls.”
Fundraising dried up, and Haley’s campaign directed most of its funds to TV. She ran on a shoestring budget with donated office space and supplies, and charged supporters for yard signs.
“Any other person probably would have just quit and caved in there, but she knew that South Carolina needed her,” Ballentine said.
Haley went on to win the endorsement of Sarah Palin, which helped propel her in a GOP primary field that included McMaster, then the state’s attorney general, the state lieutenant governor and a congressman. And she stayed in after two men claimed without evidence that she’d had extramarital affairs. Haley won the nomination in a runoff election by about 30 points.

The pressure Haley may have faced to drop out in 2010 is a fraction of the national pressure she’s facing now. The Republican Party has also changed dramatically since then. There is no Palin-figure whose endorsement might change the tide of the race – an overwhelming majority of South Carolina politicians, as well as national leaders, have fallen in line behind Trump.
That hasn’t stopped Haley from attempting to get under his skin.
“I think part of her strategy is to make him mad, which seems to be very effective,” said Chip Felkel, a South Carolina GOP strategist not working for any campaign. “He gets off script, he says stupid stuff, he tweets stupid things, and it’s been indicative that he’s not controlled.”
Felkel, who described Haley’s approach as “guerrilla warfare,” said he doesn’t think she can win South Carolina but speculated that she may try to stay in until the convention.
“She got a lot of fight in her, but at some point conventional wisdom says you’ve got to get a W somewhere or the mind dries up,” Felkel said. “And maybe she’s banked enough, going to be judicious enough with it, that she thinks she can be in for the long haul.”

QFDTQU4MJ7_EELISI9DP6967OC,Opinion: It’s over 100 days since you were taken hostage. Our baby girl is crawling now,Opinion by Lishay Lavi,"5 minute read Updated 10:15 AM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240122,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/22/opinions/wife-letter-israeli-hostage-husband-lavi/,"Editor’s Note: Editor’s note: Lishay Lavi’s husband Omri Miran, father of their two daughters Roni and Alma, was kidnapped by Hamas on October 7 and remains captive in Gaza. Her letter has been translated from Hebrew by her brother, Moshe Lavi. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. Read more CNN Opinion.
Dear Omri, my Omri,
Alma began crawling soon after you were taken from us. She now sits and stands as well and tries to eat on her own. She smiles and reaches for the space you once occupied as if trying to grasp a memory that slips through her tiny fingers.
I wonder, will you be free to see her walk for the first time?
I have been writing daily to you, myself and the world. Writing about our pain, our agony, our despair. I hope that you’ll return to Roni, Alma and me.
We heard that one of the released hostages told you we survived October 7 against all odds; we were rescued from the house of horrors that saw the death of loved ones, our hours-long abuse and your violent abduction.
We hope that news is true. We hope that the knowledge we are here waiting for you helps you persevere through your captivity, just as the hope of your return is what helps me persevere.
I think of Penelope’s words about Odysseus: “How I long for my husband – alive in memory, always.”
Roni has been both a beacon of light and a mirror reflecting the pain in my heart. She speaks so much now, my love, with a wisdom that transcends her years.
Her words are bittersweet, a constant reminder of your absence. She asks every night where you are, why you are still lost. She speaks of the bad people who took you away in front of our eyes. She draws you every day. And her smile reminds me of you.
Her eyes search mine for reassurance, and I try to give her the certainty she craves. But real comfort can only come when you are returned to us.
Roni’s resilience is both inspiring and heartbreaking. She found hope when Mojo, your dog, returned injured but wagging his tail. He too longs to see you!
Alma is too young to understand what is happening; her laughter echoes through the hall of our temporary housing in Kibbutz Kramim. It’s a haunting reminder of the joy that once permeated our home.
Yes, I forgot to say. We are no longer in Nahal Oz. There’s no more Nahal Oz, at least not in the way we remember it, and at least not until this painful war ends.
The Nahal Oz community and spirit, however, live on through us, the survivors who are rallying in support of each other and fighting for your and (fellow hostage) Tsaci Idan’s release.
We also found a community and support system in Kramim, people who care and love us and give us the strength to wake up every morning and work for your release.
Your friends visit, supporting and loving us more than I could have wished.
The last time we saw each other, I told you that I love you, that I’ll care for the girls, and that you should not try to be a hero. You told me that you love me, and then Roni tried to run to you. Thankfully, I managed to stop her in time.
Your captivity, with all its unknowns, has been all-encompassing. Are you injured? Do you eat? Do you need any medication? Are you being tortured or abused?
The not-knowing is a torment that wraps around my heart and squeezes it.
Some of those who returned from captivity shared their horrifying stories; others might share more in the coming days and weeks.
But for now, parts of the world seem to have turned their backs on us – and most of all, on you – in our most difficult time. The United Nations, the International Committee of the Red Cross, some of those we viewed as friends and allies.
The international community’s corridors of power and palaces of justice resonate with a silence that is deafening. Meanwhile streets and public spaces around the world have become places of hateful discourse; extending the violence of October 7 with people ripping down posters bearing your name, your photo, your story. Leaving me with a sense of abandonment that cuts deep.
How did we arrive at a place where the humanitarian pleas of families are met with indifference and mockery, where the principles that should guide us are overshadowed by political posturing?
Lishay Lavi
How did we arrive at a place where the humanitarian pleas of families are met with indifference and mockery, where the principles that should guide us are overshadowed by political posturing?
There are times we feel that our government, too, has forsaken us. Though I truly believe it is committed to bringing about your, and all the hostages, release.
But do know that while some are silent, and some are hateful, many others are loud and full of love.
You are not alone; we are not alone.
Omri, in the face of despair, I choose hope. I believe in the power of love and the resilience of the human spirit to win the fight for your freedom.
Our families tirelessly advocate for you in Israel and worldwide. Your face and name appear everywhere – and we demand others to say your name, share your story and call for your release.
There are moments when I imagine crossing into Gaza, holding Roni and Alma close, marching in and looking into the eyes of your captors as we did in Nahal Oz.
In that daydream, I bring you home with us.
But the reality is darker, more complex. Love and humanity, as much as they define us, do not always triumph.
I remain hopeful that we will get to hug you again; that Roni will run to you just as she tried to run to you that day, and this time I will not hold her back. Alma will be crawling behind her. And those first steps will come before we know it.

Omri, my love, know that you are missed and fiercely fought for.
Until that day we bring you home, I will continue to write, speak and fight for the life we built together for our daughters.
I will continue to love you like Penelope loved Odysseus during his 20 years of absence.
I refuse to believe you will not return to me.

QKPBRAZ0MJ_8JYHJT1TXPZYEZO,Mysterious Russian plane crash raises more questions than answers,"Analysis by Tim Lister, CNN","5 minute read Updated 5:08 AM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/24/europe/plane-crash-belgorod-analysis-intl/,"It’s still unclear why a Russian military transport aircraft crashed in the Belgorod region near the Ukraine border on Wednesday, whether because it was brought down by a missile or suffered some catastrophic technical failure. But all 74 people on board were killed, according to Russian authorities.
The first images of the wreckage on the ground are inconclusive; one video shows the last seconds of the plane as it hurtles towards earth before a large fireball erupts.
But the Russian authorities have claimed that Ukrainian missiles were responsible – and that they killed 65 of their own prisoners of war, along with six crew members and three Russian personnel, who were on board the Ilyushin Il-76.
The Russian Defense Ministry said the plane was destroyed by an anti-aircraft missile system deployed in the area of Liptsy in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region, some 50 miles (80 kilometers) from where the plane came down. It said radar equipment had detected the launches.
The Defense Ministry also claimed that “the Ukrainian leadership knew very well that, according to established practice, today Ukrainian military personnel would be transported by military transport aircraft to the Belgorod airfield for exchange” at the Kolotilovka checkpoint on the Russian border with the Ukrainian region of Sumy.
In response, Ukraine’s military command said it regarded Russian military aircraft approaching Belgorod as legitimate targets but stopped short of acknowledging it fired at a Russian transport plane.
The 50-mile distance from Liptsy to the crash site would be beyond most Ukrainian ground-to-air missile systems. A Ukrainian defense intelligence official did confirm that a prisoner exchange had been due to happen on Wednesday, but did not acknowledge knowing the logistical details of the Russian side of the swap. Another Ukrainian military source was quoted as claiming that the plane was carrying Russian missiles, not prisoners.
So one question is whether the Ukrainians were indeed aware of the timing and route of the aircraft that the Russians say was bringing prisoners to the site of the exchange, and additionally whether that information would have been conveyed to front-line units across the border from Belgorod.
The plane’s two flight recorders could, however, provide answers. An emergency services representative told Russian state news agency RIA Novosti on Thursday that “both flight recorders – flight parameter recording device and voice recorder – have been found” in good condition and handed over to investigators.
But there are already other ramifications from this disaster.
Andrey Kartapolov, who is chairman of the Duma Defense Committee in Moscow, made a significant allegation in claiming that the missiles fired were from US-made Patriot or German-made IRIS-T systems that have been supplied to Ukraine, without offering any evidence. Ukraine has pledged not to use foreign-donated weapons to attack Russian territory and this would have been a highly significant departure from that policy. In any case, the IRIS-T would not have had the range to hit the Ilyushin from the nearest Ukrainian-held territory. A Patriot deployed (at considerable risk) so close to the border with Russia would have been within range of the plane.

Some observers are also pointing out that Russian missile defenses in the area were on high alert Wednesday, and that a Ukrainian drone had been brought down shortly before the plane crashed. However, the governor of Belgorod said that had happened in a location to the west of the city, which would put it at least 37 miles (60 kilometers) from the site where the Ilyushin crashed.
Another puzzling element is that according to the Russian version of events, the Ukrainian PoWs were guarded by just three Russian personnel on board the plane (besides the crew.) A former Ukrainian PoW, Maksym Kolesnikov, said Wednesday in a post on X that when he had been transported by plane from Bryansk to Belgorod, there were about 20 military police for 50 prisoners.
So this disaster already has multiple political dimensions and as yet a lot of unanswered questions. It has quickly become another episode in the information war that has been a constant in this conflict.
Dmytro Lubinets, Ukraine’s human rights ombudsman, said Wednesday that “information warfare is no less important than fighting at the front… The enemy is insidious. We all know what terrible methods Russia can use to destabilize Ukrainian society.”
Indeed the Russian Defense Ministry in its statement said that “by committing this terrorist attack, the Ukrainian leadership showed its true colors – it neglected the lives of its citizens.“
It’s worth recalling that Russia alleged that Ukraine killed its own prisoners of war in a strike on a camp in Olenivka in Donetsk 18 months ago, a claim that after extensive forensic investigation looked extremely dubious.
Then, as most likely in this instance, no independent on-the-ground analysis was possible.
But a large Russian military aircraft without anti-missile defenses approaching Belgorod – itself a frequent target of Ukrainian drones – would have been a tempting and valuable target for Ukraine.
It would therefore have been a flight of considerable risk – unless the Ukrainians had been notified of its purpose, as the Russians have claimed. On the whole, Russian Il-76 aircraft stay well beyond the range of Ukrainian missiles; this would be the first time since the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine nearly two years ago that one of them has been shot down.
But the Ukrainians have extended the range and frequency of their attacks into Russia, using drones, missiles and sabotage. Earlier this month, the Ukrainian military claimed to have shot down one of the Russians’ most advanced early detection aircraft, the A-50, over the Sea of Azov. There’s been no visual evidence of the wreckage, and the Russian Defense Ministry has not responded to the claim. Some analysts believe that the Ukrainians may have repurposed a Patriot battery to carry out that attack, but there has been no confirmation. Patriot missiles generally have a range of just under 100 miles.
For Ukraine, at a time when the battlefield is in stalemate and there are few victories to celebrate, attacking Russian bases, ships, aircraft and infrastructure well beyond the border has become a different way to disrupt the enemy’s military machine.
But if evidence emerges to confirm the version of events being offered up by the Russian Defense Ministry and others in Moscow, what would have been a coup for Ukrainian air defenses may instead have been a horrendous mistake."

Before his death, Tatarsky was one of Russia’s most outspoken and ultranationalist military bloggers, known for his ardent pro-war commentary and occasional criticism of Moscow’s battlefield failures.
He was killed in the April 2023 blast, which came during an event at the cafe.
Trepova was arrested soon after on suspicion she had handed over the explosive device, hidden in a statue, to Tatarsky, state media Tass reported at the time.
Trepova’s husband, Dmitry Rylov, told an independent Russian publication that he is convinced she was set up.
Tatarsky supported the war in Ukraine and had gained popularity by providing analysis and commentary on Telegram, much of which advocated for a harsher approach towards Ukraine.
Tatarsky, whose real name is Maxim Fomin, created his Telegram channel in 2019, naming it in honor of the protagonist of Victor Pelevin’s novel “Generation ‘P,’” according to Russian state news agency Vesti. He had since written several books and previously fought among Russian forces in Donbas, eastern Ukraine, in 2014.

QMU36MVPE1_70FEW3LN33JZ6V4,FAA approves a path for Boeing 737 Max 9s to return to operations,"By David Goldman, Gregory Wallace and Pete Muntean, CNN","6 minute read Updated 10:06 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/24/business/boeing-ceo-washington/,"Boeing CEO David Calhoun’s Wednesday was decidedly a mixed bag: The Federal Aviation Administration finally approved a set of inspection criteria for the 171 grounded 737 Max 9 planes that, if followed, could return the aircraft to service. But he also learned that his company faces yet another investigation into its safety issues.
The FAA late Wednesday opened its announcement with a stern warning: “The January 5 Boeing 737-9 Max incident must never happen again,” referring to an incident earlier this month in which part of an Alaska Airlines flight blew off in mid-air. And the FAA said it would not grant any production expansion of the 737 Max lineup while its safety probe of Boeing continues.
But the FAA cleared the way for the planes to return to the air. Airlines, especially Alaska and United, had faced hundreds of cancellations a day because of the grounding.
“The exhaustive, enhanced review our team completed after several weeks of information gathering gives me and the FAA confidence to proceed to the inspection and maintenance phase,” FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said in a statement.
Each of the 171 grounded aircraft must be inspected, including the bolts, fittings and guide tracks for the door plug, the piece of fuselage that flew off an Alaska Airlines plane earlier this month. The process also includes tightening fasteners and performing “detailed inspections of…dozens of associated components. ”
In a statement Wednesday, Boeing said it will “continue to cooperate fully and transparently with the FAA and follow their direction as we take action to strengthen safety and quality at Boeing. We will also work closely with our airline customers as they complete the required inspection procedures to safely return their 737-9 airplanes to service.”
On Wednesday, Alaska Airlines said it expects the inspections to take 12 hours and for the first of its 737 Max 9 planes to return to service Friday. It said inspections would be completed next week.
United Airlines announced that it has received approval from the FAA to return to its fleet 79 Boeing 737 Max 9 planes this weekend, according to a memo from the airline’s operations chief that was obtained by CNN.
“We will return each Max 9 aircraft to service once this thorough inspection process is complete,” said Toby Enqvist, executive vice president and chief operations officer at United. “We are preparing aircraft to return to scheduled service beginning on Sunday”
And Whitaker noted Boeing itself is not out of the woods.
“However, let me be clear: This won’t be back to business as usual for Boeing,” he said. “We will not agree to any request from Boeing for an expansion in production or approve additional production lines for the 737 Max until we are satisfied that the quality control issues uncovered during this process are resolved.”
Calhoun’s meeting with Washington lawmakers on Wednesday ended with a CEO’s nightmare: He was forced to defend the safety of his company’s planes to travelers, just before he learned Boeing faced yet another investigation.
“We fly safe planes,” Calhoun said to reporters assembled on Capitol Hill. “We don’t put planes in the air that we don’t have 100% confidence in.”
Calhoun acknowledged the seriousness of passengers’ concerns about flying, and he said he came to Washington in the spirit of transparency and openness to help lawmakers better understand the company’s efforts to improve safety.
“I’m here today … to answer all their questions, because they have a lot of them,” Calhoun said.
After speaking with reporters, Washington Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell, chair of the Senate Commerce Committee, announced that she should hold a future hearing to investigate Boeing’s safety record.
“The American flying public and Boeing line workers deserve a culture of leadership at Boeing that puts safety ahead of profits,” Cantwell said in a statement. “I will be holding hearings to investigate the root causes of these safety lapses.”
Cantwell said that in her meeting with Calhoun earlier in the day, she emphasized that Boeing has to prioritize quality and engineering first. After several incidents in recent years, including this month’s Alaska Airlines incident, that commitment has become a significant question.
The National Transportation Safety Board is also investigating the incident.
Not being able to increase production of the Max is a major blow to Boeing’s efforts to return to profitability.
Boeing’s production of the 737 Max, its best selling plane, has still not returned to the rate of production that it had before two fatal crashes led to a 20-month grounding of the plane in 2019. It is not clear when it will be able to move ahead with its efforts to resume production at a more profitable pace.
Industry experts have cast serious doubt about Boeing’s ability to walk away from its investigations unscathed. Last week, a Wells Fargo report, entitled “FAA audit opens up a whole new can of worms,” noted that Boeing’s quality control and engineering problems have been ongoing for years.
“Given Boeing’s recent track record, and greater incentive for the FAA to find problems, we think the odds of a clean audit are low,” the analysts said.
A week earlier, Calhoun acknowledged the company made a “mistake” at a staff-wide safety meeting, but he did not specify what that mistake was. NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy has demanded Boeing provide answers about any mistake it made as part of its safety investigation, which is separate from the FAA’s audit.
Boeing has faced repeated quality and safety issues with its aircraft for five years now, leading to the long-term grounding of some jets and the halt in deliveries of others.
The 737 Max’s design was found to be responsible for two fatal crashes: one in Indonesia in October 2018 and the other in Ethiopia in March 2019. Together, the two crashes killed all 346 people aboard the two flights and led to a 20-month grounding of the company’s best-selling jets, which cost it more than $21 billion.
Internal communications released during the 737 Max grounding showed one employee describing the jet as “designed by clowns, who in turn are supervised by monkeys.”
Late last month, Boeing asked airlines to inspect all of their 737 Max jets for a potential loose bolt in the rudder system after an airline discovered a potential problem with a key part on two aircraft.
Its quality and engineering problems have extended beyond the 737. Boeing also had to twice halt deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner, for about a year starting in 2021 and again in 2023, due to quality concerns cited by the FAA. And the 777 jet also suffered a grounding after an engine failure on a United flight scattered engine debris onto homes and the ground below.
Two Max variants — the Max 7 and the Max 10 — are still awaiting approval to begin carrying passengers. This latest incident complicates that, Wells Fargo analysts noted."
QTIFWVEQAP_6G1DZQPW8VMIP8L,Federal appeals court lets Trump gag order stand in federal January 6 case,"By Hannah Rabinowitz, Katelyn Polantz and Devan Cole, CNN","2 minute read Updated 2:19 PM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/23/politics/gag-order-trump-appeals-court-en-banc/,"The federal appeals court in Washington, DC, declined to rehear arguments over whether former President Donald Trump can be prohibited from talking about witnesses and court staff while he awaits trial in the special counsel’s January 6 criminal case.
Trump has unsuccessfully tried to challenge the gag order placed on him by Judge Tanya Chutkan late last year through appeals.
The 11 judges from the DC Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday declined to touch the case after a three-judge panel previously upheld the gag order against Trump. There were no statements or dissents made by any of the judges.
Trump can appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court, and his attorneys have previously indicated that they would appeal the matter to the nation’s highest court if necessary.
CNN has reached out to Trump’s legal team for comment.
In a unanimous decision issued last month, the three appellate judges said that Trump can be barred from talking about witnesses as well as prosecutors, the court staff and their family members.
But the court said the gag order does not apply to comments made about special counsel Jack Smith and narrowed the prohibition Trump had regarding speaking about witnesses in the case, a change from the original gag order.
The three judges on the panel — Patricia Millett, Nina Pillard and Bradley Garcia, all Democratic appointees — found Trump’s words on the public stage could undermine the fairness of a jury trial, sway or intimidate witnesses and imperil court staff. The court said that justifies limiting Trump’s speech, even while he campaigns to return to the presidency.
“Mr. Trump’s documented pattern of speech and its demonstrated real-time, real-world consequences pose a significant and imminent threat to the functioning of the criminal trial process in this case,” the appeals court wrote.

QUQ1MS1FAZ_EB48E4ICLBI97F6,UAW endorses Biden as he prepares to fight Trump for union workers,"By MJ Lee, Jeff Zeleny, Betsy Klein, Samantha Waldenberg, Chris Isidore and Michael Williams, CNN","5 minute read Updated 4:42 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/24/politics/uaw-expected-to-endorse-biden-as-he-prepares-to-fight-trump-for-union-workers/,"The United Auto Workers union on Wednesday endorsed President Joe Biden, a long-awaited announcement that is an important pickup for the president.
“Look, I kept my commitment to be the most pro-union president ever,” Biden said after receiving the UAW’s endorsement at the group’s conference in Washington, DC, on Wednesday afternoon. “I’m proud you have my back. Let me just say I’m honored to have your back, and you have mine.”
The endorsement comes as the Biden campaign is making a full pivot to the general election, pointing to former President Donald Trump’s victory in the Republican primary in New Hampshire Tuesday as a clear sign that he is poised to emerge as the GOP presidential nominee.
The president and union leadership have long courted each other. Although it’s a key endorsement for Biden, the backing from union leadership may not convince all of the rank-and-file to vote for the president in November. Biden won the endorsement of the UAW in the 2020 campaign, even though many rank-and-file members supported Trump.
Ahead of endorsing Biden, UAW President Shawn Fain said the choice union workers face in 2024 “isn’t about who you like. It’s not about your party. It’s not this b——- about age. It’s not about anything, but our best shot at taking back power for the working class.”
He then referred to Trump using the worst insult that can be made in front of a room full of union workers.
“Donald Trump is a scab,” Fain said. “Donald Trump is a billionaire, and that’s who he represents. … Donald Trump stands against everything we stand for as a union – as a society.”
The choice between Trump and Biden, Fain said, was clear.
“Joe Biden bet on the American worker while Donald Trump blamed the American workers,” he said. “We need to know who’s going to sit in the most powerful seat in the world and help us win as a united working class. So if our endorsement must be earned, Joe Biden has earned it.”
Trump has made appealing to union voters a key part of his political strategy, in no small part by targeting disaffected voters in parts of the Midwest who believe the Democratic Party has left them behind.
Biden, meanwhile, has continued to cast himself as the most pro-union leader. He joined members of the UAW in Michigan on the picket line last year in the middle of a strike – an unprecedented move for a sitting president.
“I will say, I was so damn proud to stand in that picket line with you,” Biden told the crowd on Wednesday, prompting cheers.
“Honest to God, I’ve always believed that the union movement in America is important because it produces the best-skilled workers in the world. That’s what happens. It’s good for everybody.”
But just because the union endorsed Biden for a second term doesn’t mean it is lockstep with the president on every issue. In December, UAW released a statement calling for a ceasefire in Israel and Gaza – a move that Biden has himself resisted. The gap between the union’s position on Israel and the president’s briefly revealed itself during his speech Wednesday, when a member of the audience unfurled a Palestinian flag and shouted, “Ceasefire now!”
The protest was brief and did not derail the president’s remarks – unlike the abortion-rights rally on Tuesday where Biden was interrupted more than a dozen times by protesters demanding a ceasefire.
The endorsement could be a factor in the battleground state of Michigan in November. Trump won the Great Lakes State in 2016 and Biden won it narrowly in 2020. The race is expected to be close again in November as Biden and the former president – should he win his party’s presidential nomination – both work to stake out their claim to be the champion of the working class.
The UAW had kept its powder dry on a potential endorsement, declining last year to join a cadre of high-profile unions in backing Biden’s reelection campaign ahead of high-stakes contract negotiations. At the time, the union cited concerns over Biden’s policies that would encourage a transition to electric vehicles.
The UAW has more than 400,000 members, and Biden – who has long relied on the political backing of unions – has touted its support in the past. The president has called American autoworkers “the most skilled autoworkers in the world.” The group’s membership is mostly concentrated in Michigan, a presidential election battleground.
Fain previously warned this cycle that “another Donald Trump presidency would be a disaster.”
While Biden took care to show his support on the picket line, the administration lacked the legal or legislative authority to act as a participant in the negotiations, which ended in late October.
Rep. Dan Kildee, a Michigan Democrat, dismissed concerns Tuesday that Biden had not yet received the union’s endorsement.
“No, it doesn’t,” Kildee told CNN’s Poppy Harlow when pressed on whether he was worried the endorsement had not yet been made.
“The UAW had other issues on its mind than injecting presidential politics into the 2023 challenges. They had an unprecedented strike. With the support of President Biden, they received an unprecedented contract. So, when I talk to auto workers, they understand that. And, you know, I’m very hopeful that organized labor generally, and the UAW specifically, will - will remember Joe Biden’s record and will stand with him as a result,” Kildee added.
Trump has found support among the rank-and-file of the UAW despite Fain’s strong criticisms and union leadership’s consistent support of Democratic candidates. On the same day that Biden visited a UAW picket line in Michigan, Trump spoke at a non-union auto shop in suburban Detroit – drawing the ire of the union.
Fain told CNN in December that he felt like the former president has never truly had the backs of UAW members.
“You go back to 2019, when he was a sitting president, and GM was on strike for, you know, 40 days. What did he say about the strikers in? What did he do to assist? What did you do show he cared about those workers, I mean, he was silent,” Fain said.
“You go back to 2015, when he was running for the presidency. And he talked about, we need to do a rotation of all these good paying jobs in the Midwest somewhere else, not out of the country, but somewhere else in the country, and have these workers begging for their jobs back. You go back to the economic recession, and he jumped on ‘The bandwagon of the UAW is to blame for everything wrong with these companies.’ And so those are facts, they’re indisputable.”

In an interview with Spanish newspaper El País, the “Griselda” star revealed that she and Manganiello disagreed about having children, according to People magazine.
“My marriage broke up because my husband was younger; he wanted to have kids and I didn’t want to be an old mom,” Vergara reportedly said. “I feel it’s not fair to the baby. I respect whoever does it, but that’s not for me anymore.”
Vergara, 51, is the mother of an adult son Manolo, whom she shares with her ex-husband. Manganiello is 47.
Vergara said she’s ready to move on to the next stage of her life.
“I had a son at 19, who is now 32, and I’m ready to be a grandmother, not a mother, she said. “So, if love comes along, he has to come with [his own] children.”
CNN has reached out to representatives for Vergara and Manganiello for comment.
Vergara will next be seen as the title character on “Griselda” about the female drug lord Griselda Blanco. It starts streaming on Netflix Thursday."

Although federal investigators continue to probe the incident and have not reached any conclusions, the details could provide critical new insight into what may have caused a gaping hole to form in a 737 Max 9 mid-flight.
The reports said the door plug, a part of the plane used to seal the aircraft when no exit door is installed, was removed because Spirit AeroSystems, which makes the fuselage for 737 Max 9 planes, needed to make other repairs to the door plug’s rivets, used to connect various parts together. Boeing then reinstalled the door after Spirit AeroSystems made the repair.
Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems are under multiple investigations that probe their safety policies and procedures. The Federal Aviation Administration recently expanded its Boeing probe to include Spirit AeroSystems, the National Transportation Safety Board is also reviewing the incident, and Washington Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell, chair of the Senate Commerce Committee, announced Wednesday that she would hold a future hearing to investigate Boeing’s safety record.
Boeing said it couldn’t comment on the reports about what may have led to the door plug blowing off the plane, citing the ongoing investigation.
“As the air safety agency responsible for investigating this accident, only the US National Transportation Safety Board can release information about the investigation,” Boeing said in a statement.
Spirit did not respond to a request for comment.
Although details are sparse, there have been some clues about what went wrong over the past few weeks. Boeing CEO David Calhoun on January 9 acknowledged the company made a “mistake” at a staff-wide safety meeting, but he did not specify what that mistake was. NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy has demanded Boeing provide answers about any mistake it made as part of its safety investigation, which is separate from the FAA’s audit.
Alaska Airlines CEO Ben Minicucci on Tuesday revealed the carrier found “some loose bolts on many” Boeing 737 Max 9s in an interview for “NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt.”
The FAA has grounded the 737 Max 9 since the incident. But late Wednesday, it approved a set of inspection criteria for the 171 grounded planes that, if followed, could return the grounded aircraft to service.
But the agency also issued a stern warning to Boeing: “The January 5 Boeing 737-9 Max incident must never happen again.” And it said it would not grant any production expansion of the 737 Max lineup while its safety probe of Boeing continues.

Each of the 171 grounded aircraft must be inspected, including the bolts, fittings and guide tracks for the door plug. The process also includes tightening fasteners and performing “detailed inspections of…dozens of associated components.”
FAA on Sunday also required airlines to ensure older Boeing 737 planes with similar door plugs were secure. The FAA said airlines operating the Boeing 737-900ER model should visually inspect the planes but didn’t require them to be grounded. Alaska Airlines on Thursday said it has completed all of those inspections “with only one minor finding, which was immediately corrected.”
In a statement Wednesday, Boeing said it will “continue to cooperate fully and transparently with the FAA and follow their direction as we take action to strengthen safety and quality at Boeing.”
But Whitaker noted Boeing itself is not out of the woods.

R7D1L0DNWO_ONND8QOHAAPX27Q,"Ian Bailey, suspect in notorious Irish murder case, dead at 66","By Lianne Kolirin and Kara Fox, CNN","4 minute read Updated 6:13 AM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240122,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/22/europe/ian-bailey-murder-dead-scli-intl,"A British man long suspected of killing the wife of a famous French film producer in Ireland has died at age 66, according to his lawyer.
Back in 2019, the Paris Criminal Court convicted Ian Bailey in absentia of the murder of TV producer Sophie Toscan du Plantier and sentenced him to 25 years’ imprisonment.
Bailey, a former journalist, had denied involvement in the murder, which has been the subject of a popular podcast series and two TV documentaries, including one on Netflix.
On December 23, 1996, 39-year-old Toscan du Plantier was found bludgeoned to death near the gate of her vacation home near Toormore, in Ireland’s West Cork region. Police found some 50 wounds on her body.
The case was widely publicized as the victim had been married to Daniel Toscan du Plantier, a well-known French film producer.
Days after the murder, local police began questioning Bailey, who lived nearby and had been tasked with reporting on the killing for a national paper. He was arrested twice: first in February 1997 and then in January 1998.
No forensic evidence linked Bailey to the scene of the crime, and he was released without charge. He spent years denying any involvement in the murder.
News of Bailey’s death emerged on Sunday, when his lawyer made a statement to the PA Media news agency.
Frank Buttimer, who had known Bailey since March 1997, said his client had a severe heart condition.

He told PA: “I knew Ian was very unwell, we were in communication in the past five days, but I didn’t know he was terminally unwell.
“He had a very severe heart condition, a very bad heart condition, and had cardiac events prior to Christmas.
“He was a candidate for surgical intervention but wasn’t well enough, so he was trying to become well enough.”
No one else has ever been charged over Toscan du Plantier’s death and her family had long pushed for Bailey to be brought to trial in France.
Under French law, authorities can investigate crimes against French citizens committed outside of its borders, although they cannot insist that witnesses travel for questioning.
Toscan du Plantier’s family responded to the news of Bailey’s death in a statement sent to CNN.
A press release from the group known as The Association for the Truth About the Murder of Sophie Toscan du Plantier said Bailey’s death means they “will never be able to obtain a confession.”
It said that, over the years, “Bailey refused to answer the questions of French investigators, entangling himself in lies and contradictions. Provoking and taunting the police, the judiciary, and the media, Ian Bailey always avoided telling the truth about this murder, of which, beyond any reasonable doubt, he knew every detail.”

The statement continued: “An investigation is underway in Ireland, and we are confident that the discovery of new elements, the hearing of new witnesses, and the revelation of possible complicity will enable Irish police to close the case, 27 years after the murder.”
At the time of the Paris trial, Buttimer told CNN that the murder conviction  was a “grotesque miscarriage of justice.”
Despite insisting on his innocence, many locals said Bailey’s actions over the years created a cloud of suspicion, which continued to follow him around in West Cork for more than two decades.
Weeks after the murder, Bailey’s editor at the now defunct Sunday Tribune told police that he told her that he killed Toscan du Plantier to resurrect his career. According to police documents, Bailey admitted making the comment but said it was a joke.
In the years following his arrests, Bailey alleged he was wrongfully arrested and a victim of police corruption. In 2015, he lost a civil action in the High Court on those claims. A subsequent review by the Irish policing watchdog found problems in the way that Bailey’s arrest was handled, but concluded in 2018 that there was no evidence of police corruption.
No one else has ever been charged with the murder.

R7RU3NTR9K_CUBVFNAS5FG1N9P,"Only five bodies delivered to Belgorod morgue after mysterious Russian plane crash, Ukrainian intelligence suggests","By Victoria Butenko, Andrew Carey, Christian Edwards, Olga Voitovych and Radina Gigova, CNN","5 minute read Updated 7:54 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/25/europe/russian-plane-crash-belgorod-ukraine-intl/,"Ukraine says it has intelligence suggesting only five bodies were delivered from the crash site of a Russian military transport plane to a nearby morgue, a Ukraine military intelligence official told CNN, casting doubt on Moscow’s claim that dozens of Ukrainian prisoners of war were killed in the explosion.
Moscow and Kyiv gave conflicting accounts of how the Ilyushin Il-76 was downed Wednesday in Russia’s Belgorod region, which neighbors eastern Ukraine. Moscow says the plane was transporting Ukrainian prisoners of war, while Kyiv says it was carrying Russian missiles to be used in further strikes on Ukraine.
But the latest comments indicate Kyiv’s growing confidence that the IL-76 plane, which crashed Wednesday morning in the village of Yablonovo in Russia’s Belgorod region, may not have been carrying Ukrainian prisoners of war ahead of an exchange, as Moscow claimed.
Andriy Yusov, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence (DI), told CNN the number of bodies brought to the morgue matched the number of crew members on the plane. “No other bodies were detected,” he said.
Moscow claimed all 74 people on board – comprising six crew members, three military escorts and 65 Ukrainian servicemen – were killed in the crash. A Russian regional governor posted a list of names of the people he said made up the six-person crew.
Pressed by CNN to account for the discrepancy between the number of crew members Russian authorities said were on board and the number of bodies Ukrainian intelligence suggests had arrived at the morgue on Wednesday, Yusov said he stood by his initial comments.
Russia initially failed to produce visual evidence to back up its claims there were Ukrainian soldiers on the plane. The first video that emerged from the crash site, of which some was broadcast on Russia state media, appeared to show several dead bodies on the ground, but no images appeared to suggest there were dozens of fatalities.
The Russian Investigative Committee released a second video on Thursday, which they claim is from the crash site, and appears to show human remains in the snow.
The video shows investigators measuring what appears to be a bloody human hand and a dismembered arm. In separate clips, the video also shows aerial footage of the crash site and remnants of the plane. It is unclear if the human remains in the video are in the same location as the remnants of the plane.
CNN geolocated the two videos released by Russia’s Investigative Committee of the crash site, which matches the location of a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image taken by Umbra Space for CNN.
The plane came down in a field in rural Belgorod oblast, just north of the small village of Yablonovo, according to CNN’s analysis of videos and the SAR image.
The SAR image shows a sprawl of debris littering the crash site of the Il-76. The debris field is just under a mile long, and stretches about 800 feet at its widest point.
Moscow also accused Kyiv of downing the plane with an anti-aircraft missile system from Ukrainian territory, claiming the radar equipment of the Russian Aerospace Forces detected two Ukrainian missiles. Ukraine’s military command said it regarded Russian military aircraft approaching Belgorod as legitimate target, but did not confirm it had fired at the plane.
CNN is unable to independently verify the claims made by the two sides.
Both Moscow and Kyiv agree that a prisoner exchange had been planned for Wednesday, with the swap due to take place some 60 kilometers west of Belgorod city. Ukraine’s ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said Thursday in a televised interview that the swap was planned and the “representatives of our institution were present.”
But Yusov said Ukraine had not received notification that the prisoners would be flown into the region, rather than being transferred by road or rail. In the only other recent prisoner of war exchange, which happened earlier this month, Russia had sent a deconfliction alert to Ukraine to keep Belgorod’s airspace free, Yusov said, which Ukraine had observed.
Yusov also claimed that Russian IL-76 aircraft were often used to carry S-300 missiles to forward positions, and that Russia was restocking its missiles in Belgorod region after several waves of attacks on the nearby Ukrainian city of Kharkiv.
Yusov’s comments, which cast doubt on the account given by Moscow, echo similar remarks made overnight into Thursday by Mykola Oleschuk, commander of the Ukrainian air force. “Frantic Russian propaganda is directing a stream of fake information to an external audience in an attempt to discredit Ukraine in the eyes of the world community,” he said in a statement.
Lubinets also called Moscow’s unsubstantiated account “a vivid example of Russia planning an information campaign against Ukraine in advance.” He said he has sent official letters to the UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) asking whether they were informed by Russia about a transfer of prisoners of war by plane.
Ukraine’s Security Service (SBU) on Thursday launched a criminal investigation into the crash. The government communications body also urged for an international investigation into the incident, saying “there is no evidence that any Ukrainian citizens were killed on board” and that “Russian official statements cannot be trusted.”
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Thursday it is too soon to talk about instructions from Russian President Vladimir Putin regarding the military plane crash as an investigation is still underway.
He called the downing of the IL-76 an “absolutely monstrous act” since the plane was allegedly carrying Ukrainian servicemen “who should have been at home literally in a day.”

RE08OB0AK5_SU5M6A8W1YKKE80,Police arrest California woman for allegedly stealing 65 Stanley cups,"By Jordan Valinsky, CNN","2 minute read Published 7:30 AM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/23/business/stanley-cups-arrest/,"Police responding to a retail theft call in a California city discovered what is likely the most 2024 thing ever: A Sacramento woman allegedly stole about five dozen Stanley cups valued at a whopping $2,500.
Last Wednesday, Roseville Police officers responded to a report of a theft at a retail store where staff “saw a woman take a shopping cart full of Stanley water bottles without paying for them,” and refused to stop for staff, police said on Facebook.
An officer saw the unidentified 23-year-old woman’s vehicle travel on a nearby highway, pulled her over and arrested her for grand theft. After a search of the car, the police recovered 65 Stanley cups.
The inexplicable allure of Stanley cups has led people to go to extreme lengths to collect them. Recently at Target, its special edition Valentine’s Day cups quickly sold out, and the cups appeared on the resale market for hundreds of dollars above sticker prices that range from $20 to $50 depending on size.
“While Stanley Quenchers are all the rage, we strongly advise against turning to crime to fulfill your hydration habits,” the police said on Facebook. “The Roseville Police Department remains committed to stopping retail theft.”
The 111-year-old Stanley brand is enjoying a massive resurgence of sorts with a much younger clientele of tweens, teens and young adults.
Invented by William Stanley, Jr., in 1913, the all-steel vacuum-insulated bottle was originally invented for keeping food and beverages hot or cold, and has since become a popular go-to camping and hiking accessory.
Related article The Stanley craze begs the question: Why do we love our special little cups so much?
In 2020, Stanley’s global president Terence Reilly revamped the brand and specifically chose women as a potential new consumer base. Then, with a new palette of colors and designs, the company relied on trusted influencers on social media to get the word out.
The strategy worked: Stanley’s 40-ounce Quencher cup gained rabid popularity for its candy-like array of colors and its ability to keep beverages hot and cold for long periods of time.
Once the cups took off on social media, Stanley’s annual sales reportedly jumped from $75 million to $750 million in 2023 alone.

REFXTPUHF9_83VI2PGB1IJWRS8,Turkish parliament approves Sweden’s NATO membership bid,"By Isil Sariyuce, Jessie Gretener, and Kristin Wilson, CNN","3 minute read Updated 9:48 AM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/23/europe/turkey-vote-sweden-nato-intl/,"The Turkish parliament voted Tuesday to approve Sweden’s NATO membership bid, bringing the Nordic country one step closer to joining the military alliance after months of delays.
Of the 346 members of parliament who voted, 287 were in favor of Sweden’s accession and 55 voted to reject it. Four others abstained from voting.
The vote was the second step of Turkey’s ratification process after the parliament’s Foreign Affairs Commission approved the bid last month. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan can now sign the protocol into law.
The outcome on Tuesday cleared a significant hurdle for the Nordic country’s accession into the military alliance, with Hungary now set to be the only member state that has not yet ratified Sweden’s accession.
But Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban on Wednesday told NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg that Hungary’s government supports Sweden’s bid for accession.
“I reaffirmed that the Hungarian government supports the NATO membership of Sweden,” Orban wrote on X. Stoltenberg also posted on X, saying he welcomed Orban’s “clear support” for Sweden’s membership bid.
On Tuesday, Orban said he had invited his Swedish counterpart Ulf Kristersson to visit Hungary to negotiate the terms of Sweden’s accession.
Sweden and Finland applied for NATO membership in May 2022 following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine earlier that year. Finland joined NATO in April 2023, doubling the alliance’s border with Russia, but Sweden has faced numerous delays in its path to accession.

Erdogan initially objected to Sweden’s membership bid, accusing Swedish officials of being too lenient on militant groups, including the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK). Since applying, Sweden has tightened its anti-terror legislation and agreed to work more closely with Turkey on security concerns.
Erdogan’s approval of Sweden’s accession bid also rides on a commitment by the United States, with the Turkish president signaling that he won’t sign the protocol into law unless the US approves the sale of F-16 fighter jets to Turkey.
US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chair Ben Cardin said on Tuesday that Congress, however, is waiting to see the accession documents completed before moving forward on the matter.
Following Tuesday’s Turkish parliamentary vote, Swedish Prime Minister Kristersson said Sweden was “one step closer to becoming a full member of NATO.”
The US Ambassador to Turkey Jeffry Flake reiterated the sentiment in a post on X, saying “Sweden’s accession to NATO is a critical step in strengthening the alliance” and that he “greatly appreciate the Turkish’s parliament’s decision to approve Sweden’s entry into NATO.”
The German government welcomed the outcome of the Turkish parliamentary vote. The federal government spokesperson Steffen Hebestreit said in a statement that Finland’s accession last April and Sweden’s “forthcoming accession” were a “direct reaction to the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine.”

REOE1I5MN3_91JZOEY46TP7OJQ,New Hampshire ad spending tops $77 million as Haley and Trump fight to the finish,"By David Wright and Alex Leeds Matthews, CNN","7 minute read Published 10:00 AM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/23/politics/new-hampshire-ad-spending-trump-haley/,"Donald Trump, Nikki Haley and their allies have traded sharp attacks on New Hampshire airwaves ahead of the second nominating contest in the Republican presidential primary.
Haley and groups supporting her White House bid have invested heavily in the Granite State, spending roughly twice as much on advertising there as Trump’s political network since the start of the 2024 race. But Haley’s advantage narrowed in the new year as Trump and his allies ramped up ad spending there to counter signs of momentum for the former South Carolina governor.
Combined, Republican campaigns and outside groups have spent more than $77 million on advertising in New Hampshire through Monday, significantly more than the roughly $50 million that campaigns and outside groups spent on advertising in the Granite State during the 2020 battle for the Democratic presidential nomination, according to data from the ad tracking firm AdImpact.
Trump and his political network spent more than $10 million on TV ads looking to blunt the high-profile challenge posed by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, hitting him in Iowa, New Hampshire and on national cable during the summer and fall of last year. The former president cruised to a dominant win in the Iowa caucuses last week while DeSantis and Haley finished a distant second and third respectively. DeSantis ended his presidential campaign on Sunday and endorsed Trump.
But with signs of a more competitive race in New Hampshire, Trump and his allies turned their attention to Haley and have spent more than $6 million attacking her on the Granite State airwaves.
Meanwhile, after months avoiding mention of Trump in most of their paid messaging, Haley and her allies have responded with attacks of their own, airing more than $4 million worth of ads targeting the former president.
Anti-Haley ads warn that she is soft on illegal immigration and wants to cut Social Security,  while ads touting the former South Carolina governor call for generational change and laud Haley as the only candidate who can beat Trump.
According to AdImpact data, Haley’s campaign and supportive outside groups have spent more than $31 million on advertising in New Hampshire since the start of 2023. By comparison, Trump’s campaign and its allies have spent about $15.7 million on New Hampshire advertising since the start of the race, while a pro-DeSantis super PAC spent about $8 million in the state last year.
So far in 2024, Haley’s campaign and its allies have spent about $12.3 million advertising in New Hampshire compared  with about $9.8 million for Trump and his allies. In stark contrast, DeSantis and his allies spent nothing on the New Hampshire airwaves this year.
In the closing days of the race in New Hampshire, SFA Fund, the super PAC supporting Haley, has been airing a new ad featuring popular Gov. Chris Sununu, who has endorsed and vigorously campaigned for Haley.
In the ad, Sununu tells voters, “There are now only two candidates who can win. One is surrounded by chaos and drama. That’s the Donald Trump we all know. The other is honest and hopeful. That’s Nikki Haley. She campaigned the New Hampshire way, and now we have a chance to reset the election for our entire country.”
The ad’s explicit criticism of the former president reflects a notable shift in the messaging from pro-Haley advertisers, who spent much of the last year avoiding any mention of Trump.
Earlier this month, SFA Fund began airing another ad hitting the former president, telling voters that “Trump can’t stop lying about Nikki Haley. One temper tantrum after another. His entire campaign based on revenge.”

The super PAC has also spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on an ad responding to some of the attacks leveled by Trump and his allies. The spot featured voters at a Haley town hall touting her toughness and pointedly mentioning her commitment to protecting Social Security.
And in the final week before votes are counted in New Hampshire, the Haley campaign launched its first ad targeting Trump by name. The commercial opens with a blunt message: “The two most disliked politicians in America? Trump and Biden. Both are consumed by chaos, negativity and grievances of the past.” The narrator continues, “The better choice for a better America: Nikki Haley.”
Another pro-Haley super PAC, Independents Moving the Needle, has aired ads in New Hampshire that feature voters who say they previously supported Trump but are now backing Haley.
Countering those efforts, Trump and his allies have spent millions attacking Haley on air in New Hampshire since she supplanted DeSantis as the top perceived threat to the former president’s campaign there.
The Trump campaign has spent more than $800,000 in New Hampshire on an ad claiming that Haley, who has campaigned on raising the retirement age for Americans currently in their 20s, would cut Social Security benefits. MAGA Inc., the super PAC supporting Trump, has spent more than $2.5 million airing an ad in New Hampshire that portrays Haley as soft on border security.
The Trump campaign has also spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on another ad focused on illegal immigration, knocking Haley for opposing a ban on Muslims entering the United States that Trump proposed as a candidate in 2015 and telling voters that “Haley’s weakness puts us in grave danger.”
Additionally, MAGA Inc. has put more than $2.7 million behind an ad that attacks Haley for her stance on the gas tax when she was governor of South Carolina. “New Hampshire can’t afford Nicky high-tax Haley,” the ad’s narrator says.
Looking beyond New Hampshire, Trump, Haley and the super PACs supporting them are mostly holding their fire, waiting on the outcome of the Granite State contest.
As a result, the next two states hosting GOP nominating contests, Nevada and South Carolina, have seen far less ad spending than New Hampshire and Iowa, where GOP campaigns and groups spent over $123 million.
In Nevada, none of the campaigns or outside groups are on the air. Haley’s campaign is not competing in the state’s party-run caucuses on February 8, opting instead for the state-run primary on February 6. But only the caucuses will be used to determine the allocation of delegates to this summer’s Republican convention.
And in South Carolina, the next major contest on February 24, just one group is actively spending: Americans for Prosperity Action, the super PAC arm of the Koch family’s political network, which is backing Haley.
AFP Action has spent more than $3 million on advertising in South Carolina and went up earlier this month with an ad touting Haley’s electability and showcasing her performance in hypothetical general election polls against President Joe Biden.
Meanwhile, Haley’s team said over the weekend that it plans to spend up to $4 million on a new ad campaign in South Carolina, signaling her intent to press on with her one-on-one matchup against Trump.
On the Democratic side, Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips and supporters of his long-shot presidential primary challenge to Biden have poured nearly $5 million into advertising in New Hampshire, where the president is not on the ballot.
According to AdImpact data, Phillips’ campaign and a super PAC supporting him, We Deserve Better, have spent $2.7 million and $2.2 million respectively delivering sharp criticism of Biden and slamming the national Democratic Party’s treatment of the state’s primary.
Biden did not register for the New Hampshire ballot following an internal party dispute over the date of the primary. The Democratic National Committee has said that no delegates will be awarded based on the New Hampshire primary as the contest is noncompliant with the DNC’s revamped nominating calendar. Accordingly, Biden and the outside groups supporting his reelection have not advertised in the state, though supporters have undertaken a low-key write-in effort on the president’s behalf.
Away from New Hampshire, Biden’s campaign and allied outside groups have been spending millions on early reelection advertising since last year.
According to AdImpact data, the Biden campaign, a supportive super PAC, his joint fundraising committee and a joint effort with the DNC have combined to spend about $50 million on ads so far. The network has committed millions to several key battleground states, including Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada, and North Carolina."
RHIGW1J6D7_LFRKEKW0ZW9MZSM,"Opinion: In victory, Trump loses it",Opinion by CNN contributors,"18 minute read Updated 10:15 AM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/24/opinions/primary-election-new-hampshire-trump-haley/,"CNN Opinion asked political contributors to weigh in on the results of the New Hampshire primary. The views expressed in these commentaries are their own.
This isn’t the Olympics. This is the GOP contest for the presidential nomination — and there are no medals for second place. Although former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley is the last contender standing between former President Donald Trump and the Republican nomination, the results in New Hampshire do not bode well for her future.
Haley cast herself as a reasonable alternative to Trump, a traditional Republican who could attract “Never Trump” GOP voters and Independents. The problem with this approach is that most Republican voters do not want an alternative to Trump; they overwhelmingly back him. Polling shows Trump even leads Haley in her home state of South Carolina.
Haley’s campaign suffers from an identity crisis. She presents herself as a moderate, and yet on issues like immigration, she echoes Trump’s hardline positions, including mass deportations of undocumented migrants and finishing the border wall.
She declared that “America has never been a racist country,” despite recounting discrimination that she experienced growing up. While she called for a “national consensus” on abortion, her vague stance on reproductive rights confused voters.
She questioned whether Trump was mentally fit for office and criticized him for “too many lies.” Yet she also suggested that, if elected, she would pardon him. And despite Trump’s bigoted attacks on her heritage (like calling her by a mangled version of her birth name), Haley told CNN’s Dana Bash that she would vote for him if he became the Republican nominee.
How does any of this add up to a coherent message?
Over the last few months, Haley has alternated between being a principled conservative and a Trump sycophant. In the process, she lost herself and any viable shot at the White House. On a broader level, Haley’s failure to launch in the Granite State is more evidence that the GOP is becoming less of a political party and more of a cult of personality.

This primary isn’t over. At least that’s what the Nikki Haley campaign said after finishing second to former President Donald Trump in the New Hampshire primaries on Tuesday.
While conventional wisdom, political analysts, talking heads and the Trump campaign insist this race is over, and that former Trump is the inevitable Republican nominee, it bears pointing out that nearly half of New Hampshire voters chose someone other than Trump. In Iowa last week, 49% of voters in Iowa chose someone other than Trump.
The only accurate way of describing the state of this race is that the voters in the Republican primary are divided, and have not, in fact, coalesced around Trump as he’d have us believe. That’s not a great way to go into a general election, with so many voters explicitly saying, as they did to CNN field reporters, that they were over Trump. That might change over the course of the primary, but if New Hampshire offers us a snapshot in time, the picture is of a fairly weak frontrunner. As the Haley campaign told me earlier on Tuesday, it’s almost as if a bunch of Republicans have left the party because of Trump … and Nikki is bringing them home.
Can the former South Carolina governor bring them all the way home? The map gets harder for her from here. But Haley has a $4 million ad buy starting Wednesday in South Carolina, and the campaign is looking ahead to Michigan, which votes a few days after her home state, as another place she can give Trump a run for his money.
For independents, moderates and disaffected Republicans, Haley represents an all-too-important candidate in this race: the woman standing between Trump and the White House. For everyone – including the Biden campaign – declaring this race over, she owes it to those voters to stay in and not succumb to Trump’s inevitability posturing, or Biden’s eagerness to face a weaker candidate. She’s earning votes to stop Trump, and that’s what she must continue to do.
SE Cupp is a CNN political commentator.
There are two very different storylines that emerged from New Hampshire: The first is former President Donald Trump’s cult-like support among diehard Republicans. The more important story, though, is his stunning weakness among independents.
Trump lost a stunning two-thirds of New Hampshire voters who are not in either political party, according to initial results from a CNN exit poll. In Iowa, 43% of former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s supporters said they would vote for President Joe Biden against Trump.
That the Republican Party is now one more Trump property is news from nowhere. In the eight years since he slithered down that escalator in Manhattan’s Trump Tower, he has remade the party. Where Reagan-Bush Republicans stood for limited government, strong national defense, and traditional family values, Trump added about $8 trillion to the national debt, disdains NATO, and has been found by a jury of his peers to be civilly liable for sexual abuse (which he has denied).
Trump’s challenge, now that the nomination fight is effectively over, will be to appeal to voters who are turned off by his cult of personality. His angry, bitter speech Tuesday night was a terrible beginning for the general election. Did the grievance-filled rant against Haley sound like a winner to you? No, it sounded like a guy who is in deep doo-doo with independents.
This is a potential disaster for Trump. To attend this year’s Iowa GOP caucuses in the freezing cold, you had to be a very committed Republican. (Unlike New Hampshire, Iowa does not allow independents to vote in the GOP caucus.) And yet nearly half of the loyal Republicans who supported Haley in Iowa say they cannot support Trump in November; Biden wins them by a margin of 20 points.
Trump’s team should have a well-deserved drink. But the hangover is going to be brutal.
Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist and CNN political commentator, was a political consultant for Bill Clinton’s presidential campaign in 1992 and served as a counselor to Clinton in the White House.
No matter how you feel about former President Donald Trump’s decisive victory in New Hampshire, there is bad news: Our country is now in general election mode, and it will be for 285 more days. Almost a full year. Even if the names at the top of the ticket change (which is still within the realm of possibility), the die is cast for the rest of the contest.
I am uncertain as to how the country survives the sensory assault of a prolonged presidential campaign — the ads; the endorsements; the controversies, real and imagined — and lives to vote about it. Remember how the monotony of the pandemic — hearing the same thing on the news every day, the same background sense of enormity — warped our sense of time? This could be like that, but louder.
What American will still feel like voting after nine months of being asked to? Nagging someone just encourages tuning out. We have lost the patience to watch television on a week-to-week basis; to keep us engaged, someone (the campaigns or the media covering them) will have to come up with cliffhangers far beyond the traditional questions of vice-presidential choices and debate performances.
If so, what could those stakes be? I fear the campaigns could become an ever-escalating war of even more extreme statements, on both sides, though I cannot imagine how we go more apocalyptic than we already are. President Joe Biden has said to voters, “Your freedom is on the ballot.” Trump … well, Trump finds the apocalypse in everything from the presence of immigrants to windmills. He warns constantly that the country itself may come to an end.
But Trump’s ego cannot abide any subsiding of attention; his word salad will get spicier every time he senses the nation’s eyes wandering. Then Biden will have to alert his voters to Trump’s extremism, his warning amping up the emotional charge even more.
Potentially, it becomes a contest as to whose base is more terrified of the other.
Trump — and Trumpism, or whoever represents it — is dangerous. Raise alarms! But the relentlessness of what’s to come troubles me. I have trouble picturing a high voter turnout if our experience of democracy is a series of campaign ads stomping on a human face, forever.

Getting a primary challenger is usually the harbinger of doom for a president. Often, that challenge has roots in an ideological critique. Not so for Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips. His challenge to President Joe Biden is rooted in chronology, not policy.
President Jimmy Carter faced a challenge from the left by Senator Edward Kennedy in 1980. Kennedy was a liberal icon. Carter won the nomination but suffered a devastating loss in the general election against Republican Ronald Reagan that year.
President George H.W. Bush was challenged by conservative columnist and ideological pitchfork holder Pat Buchanan in 1992. Democratic nominee Bill Clinton and third-party candidate Ross Perot exploited that division in the Republican Party against Bush in the fall. Bush lost that campaign.
Biden’s main intraparty challenger, however, isn’t attacking him for being out of touch with the party or the country. His main line of attack is that the president is too old.
That’s not insignificant. Voters care. It comes up in just about every survey. But agism isn’t an alternative vision for the future. It’s process. If most Democrats agree that Biden’s strengths are more important than his advanced years, the president should be okay. Time will tell.
More worrying would be an anti-war candidate running on Biden’s embrace of Israel in the war against Hamas after its brutal October 7 attack on Israel. There’s real ideological sand out there that could help a challenger get traction. Young people and many people of color reject Biden’s Israel policy. It was Eugene McCarthy’s anti-Vietnam campaign that undid President Lyndon Johnson in 1968.
Marianne Williamson is running that campaign in the Democratic primary but with no success. In an alternate universe, more prominent progressives such as US Sen. Bernie Sanders or Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal might. Not this year.
Instead, Democrats are wrestling with whether an 81-year-old Biden is up to the job. Tuesday night in New Hampshire we had the first answer to that question, and it appears Biden is passing the test.

Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley had everything going for her in the New Hampshire primary. This is a state that often rewards moderates and mavericks: where John McCain beat former President George W. Bush by 18 points in 2000. With President Joe Biden not even appearing on the New Hampshire Democratic ballot this time, liberal-leaning independents who wanted to participate in an exciting race had an easy excuse for voting in the Republican primary. They could show their disapproval for former President Donald Trump by voting for Haley.
It wasn’t enough. Trump has comfortably won New Hampshire, and the Republican race that looked like it was already over after the Iowa caucuses is unquestionably finished now. The next big contest is in her home state, South Carolina, but she polls worse there than she has in the Granite State. South Carolina looks like a safe state for Trump — the only question is what his margin of victory will be.
Haley knows this, and so does her campaign staff. So do her donors. Will they stay in the fight for another month, just to lose to Trump by a bigger margin than Tuesday night? As Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis showed in the days between his second-place finish in Iowa and his withdrawal from the race, it’s agony to keep campaigning when you know you only face humiliation in the races to come.
The Republican Party is united behind Trump, and with optimal conditions for an opponent like Haley, Trump was still unstoppable. Now he’s weighing vice presidential picks, and the ultimate contest — the rematch between him and Biden — begins.

The results Tuesday night, while not awarding any delegates to the current president, only confirmed what many of us liberal Democrats suspected: The Democratic Party no longer gives a fighting chance to candidates other than establishment neoliberals, so we must look elsewhere.
That President Joe Biden will be the winner of the nomination seems a foregone conclusion, even though I think author Marianne Williamson, who represents more traditional liberal values, could have made a bigger impact if she was given a chance.
Williamson might have picked up the pro-peace contingent if she hadn’t been mostly ignored by the traditional media and other Democrats. She was one of the few peace candidates, calling for a ceasefire early on in Gaza, and even wrote that rather than bombing the Houthis in Yemen, we might resolve the Red Sea shipping crisis by stopping the bombing of Gaza, the stated reason for the Houthis’ attacks on merchant vessels – a principled liberal stance that no other mainstream candidate seems willing to say out loud. Biden’s stance on both Gaza and Ukraine seem to align more with neoliberal and neocon values.
After liberal stalwart Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator, criticized Biden for failing to address working-class voters’ concerns, Williamson pointed out that there was a Democrat who was already doing so (herself), but was largely ignored by Sanders and the media.
Even failed 2020 candidate Andrew Yang, who suffered a similar fate to Williamson in the Democratic primaries, encouraged Williamson to step aside in favor of Minnesota Rep. Dean Philips just a few days before the New Hampshire primary. Williamson’s response to Yang should make traditional liberals beam: “The days of a woman stepping aside on the assumption that a man can do a better job are over.”

It’s all over but the shouting – former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley may have barely mustered a close enough showing in the New Hampshire primary Tuesday to justify a push toward her home state, but for all intents and purposes, the Republican Party has chosen to nominate former President Donald Trump for a third time.
The roster of those whom Trump defeated on his way to victory in 2016, 2020 and 2024 shows the deep bench of possible presidential contenders that Republicans had prided themselves on during the presidency of Barack Obama.
Dozens took their shot and lost: Successful governors who turned out to be paper tigers, like former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis; self-described compassionate conservatives like former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott; principled conservative senators like Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio; business-friendly moderates like former Ohio Gov. John Kasich and, of course, Haley. All of them, plus many more, proved more out of touch with the base of the party than the twice-divorced former reality TV star from New York.
There’s little doubt, now, that Trump has remade the party in his own image. In so doing, he cleared out an entire bench of those who would have offered a different path to the White House. Even if the likes of Cruz or DeSantis were to run again, they would do so as a Trump product, not a tea party one.
The next time there’s a meaningful Republican primary election, it will be a question of which of the post-Trump figures can best channel his energy — not which of his contemporaries can best present an alternative.

After the results of the Iowa caucuses, too many considered the trailblazing former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley dead in the political water. It turns out she wasn’t. Finishing third in Iowa to former President Donald Trump and Florida’s Gov. Ron DeSantis, many thought Haley seemed a long shot to be competitive in a two-person race with Trump at the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday night after DeSantis dropped out of the presidential primary this past weekend. And yet, she held her own on Tuesday.
But the real news coming out of New Hampshire is the ugly gender war in the GOP. Nearly all the fellas came to Trump’s rescue, including South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, who owes his political rise to Haley after she appointed him to the US Senate in 2012. At a time when the women of America feel under assault when it comes to reproductive rights and the Biden-Harris team centered an event Tuesday night in Virginia around reproductive rights, the Republicans seem badly out of touch with the women of America.
Case in point: once-rising Republican star Haley. At age 51, she was the only woman to go toe-to-toe with the guys on the debate stage, and by some accounts, she won every single time. And yet, the men of the Trump Party just do not get it from where this former moderate Republican woman of color sits.
They do not understand how vulnerable they are with women voters, and I expect 2024 will showcase that. As for Haley, I hope she stays in the race and finally finds the courage to call Trump out for the threat to American democracy that he is. Regardless, she should not under any circumstance be his running mate; she needs to run again in 2028, when the GOP and America will finally be free of Trump.

Overshadowed by the contentious GOP primary between former President Donald Trump and former UN Ambassador and South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, Tuesday’s New Hampshire Democratic primary was unique in its own right.
The outcome for Democrats was only symbolic since none of the votes translated to delegates for the presidential nomination after New Hampshire rejected the Democratic National Committee’s decision to take away its first-primary-in-the-nation status.
That made Tuesday’s vote more of a referendum on the strength of President Joe Biden. Indeed, the DNC’s decision to disregard the New Hampshire primary forced the state’s Democratic establishment to organize an 11th-hour write-in campaign for Biden – since he wasn’t on the ballot given the DNC’s move – to avoid a possible embarrassment by upstart challenger Dean Phillips, a third-term congressman from Minnesota, whom I have known since he launched his promising political career back in 2018.
Phillips’ hoped that the incumbent president’s absence from New Hampshire would provide an opening for testing his thesis that rank-and-file Democrats are keen on having an alternative to Biden and that the Democratic establishment is “sleepwalking towards disaster” with the 81-year-old president as its nominee, but that hypothesis met a somewhat icy reception in New Hampshire.
Sure, Biden might fail to hit the same 80%+ threshold that Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton achieved in the New Hampshire primary as they ran for second terms in 2012 and 1996, respectively. But the fact that Biden’s results were strong despite being a write-in candidate who spent basically zero time campaigning in the state speaks volumes about the power he still commands among the party faithful.
Phillips, for his part, is undeterred, telling me Tuesday night that he vows to fight on. “We’re taking our message to South Carolina and then Michigan and then maybe all the way to the finish line. We’re just getting started,” he told me. “Democrats deserve options, and it’s not clear at all that President Biden can beat Donald Trump. And once Americans become more familiar with the daylight that exists between me and the president on a host of issues from Israel to the southern border to Medicare for all – I am confident our campaign will only grow in support.”
Kudos to Phillips for sticking to his guns, but the road ahead won’t be getting any easier. With Biden on the ballot in future states and his campaign machine operating at full speed, Phillips’ reception in the next few primaries will likely be even more frigid than in New Hampshire.

Sometimes the biggest story of a New Hampshire primary is the thing that didn’t happen.
Heading into the evening, there were already rumblings that Donald Trump would not just win New Hampshire, but win by a landslide.
Meanwhile, on the Democratic side, it was unclear how Joe Biden would fare as a write-in candidate – and in a state which he just demoted from its prized first-in-the-nation status.
In short, it seemed reasonable to wonder: What would the political consequences be for the Democratic incumbent if he failed to get a larger percentage of the Democratic vote than Trump did in the GOP primary?
But none of that happened.
Trump earned a solid victory, with about 55% of the vote. But while he retained his blue-collar base, he trailed Haley among White voters with a college degree by an 18% margin.
In New Hampshire and other swing states, he may well face continued skepticism among suburban voters.
Meanwhile, it appears that more than 60% of Democratic voters supported Biden, even though voters had to write-in his name.
Gone are the comparisons to Lyndon Johnson and 1968. Dean Phillips is no Gene McCarthy.
2024 will go down in New Hampshire primary history as rather forgettable. But only if you forget what didn’t happen.

Intensity. Identification. Anger. The results from New Hampshire show persistent strengths for former President Donald Trump with Republican voters that President Joe Biden can’t ignore as both look past the remaining primaries toward a general-election rematch.
Almost three in four of Trump’s backers in exit polls expressed “strong” support for him; Biden can’t match that right now in his own party.
It seems that Trump’s zeal to fight and his supporters’ perceptions that he shares their values are more important to them than temperament or electability — especially those without college degrees and with negative perceptions of the economy and mistrust of the 2020 election results.
Dissatisfaction with the economy and direction of the country seem top of mind for voters this year. But on top of that, Trump’s backers appear to be disproportionately dissatisfied, another factor that may keep them engaged.
New Hampshire’s results do carry some real warnings for Trump in terms of the general election. Nikki Haley’s closer-than-expected New Hampshire loss shows many independents and a significant minority of Republicans don’t want Trump back in the White House.
They include moderates who want to preserve women’s access to abortion and institutionalists who dislike Trump’s past conduct, legal troubles, hardline immigration or foreign policy approaches.
Haley’s backers said they were driven more by their quest for a Trump alternative than devotion to her. But Trump’s back-to-back hold on his party in two very different states, Iowa and now New Hampshire, shows how formidable he may still be.

Back in 2019, the Paris Criminal Court convicted Ian Bailey in absentia of the murder of TV producer Sophie Toscan du Plantier and sentenced him to 25 years’ imprisonment.
Bailey, a former journalist, had denied involvement in the murder, which has been the subject of a popular podcast series and two TV documentaries, including one on Netflix.
On December 23, 1996, 39-year-old Toscan du Plantier was found bludgeoned to death near the gate of her vacation home near Toormore, in Ireland’s West Cork region. Police found some 50 wounds on her body.
The case was widely publicized as the victim had been married to Daniel Toscan du Plantier, a well-known French film producer.
Days after the murder, local police began questioning Bailey, who lived nearby and had been tasked with reporting on the killing for a national paper. He was arrested twice: first in February 1997 and then in January 1998.
No forensic evidence linked Bailey to the scene of the crime, and he was released without charge. He spent years denying any involvement in the murder.
News of Bailey’s death emerged on Sunday, when his lawyer made a statement to the PA Media news agency.
Frank Buttimer, who had known Bailey since March 1997, said his client had a severe heart condition.

He told PA: “I knew Ian was very unwell, we were in communication in the past five days, but I didn’t know he was terminally unwell.
“He had a very severe heart condition, a very bad heart condition, and had cardiac events prior to Christmas.
“He was a candidate for surgical intervention but wasn’t well enough, so he was trying to become well enough.”
No one else has ever been charged over Toscan du Plantier’s death and her family had long pushed for Bailey to be brought to trial in France.
Under French law, authorities can investigate crimes against French citizens committed outside of its borders, although they cannot insist that witnesses travel for questioning.
Toscan du Plantier’s family responded to the news of Bailey’s death in a statement sent to CNN.
A press release from the group known as The Association for the Truth About the Murder of Sophie Toscan du Plantier said Bailey’s death means they “will never be able to obtain a confession.”
It said that, over the years, “Bailey refused to answer the questions of French investigators, entangling himself in lies and contradictions. Provoking and taunting the police, the judiciary, and the media, Ian Bailey always avoided telling the truth about this murder, of which, beyond any reasonable doubt, he knew every detail.”

The statement continued: “An investigation is underway in Ireland, and we are confident that the discovery of new elements, the hearing of new witnesses, and the revelation of possible complicity will enable Irish police to close the case, 27 years after the murder.”
At the time of the Paris trial, Buttimer told CNN that the murder conviction  was a “grotesque miscarriage of justice.”
Despite insisting on his innocence, many locals said Bailey’s actions over the years created a cloud of suspicion, which continued to follow him around in West Cork for more than two decades.
Weeks after the murder, Bailey’s editor at the now defunct Sunday Tribune told police that he told her that he killed Toscan du Plantier to resurrect his career. According to police documents, Bailey admitted making the comment but said it was a joke.
In the years following his arrests, Bailey alleged he was wrongfully arrested and a victim of police corruption. In 2015, he lost a civil action in the High Court on those claims. A subsequent review by the Irish policing watchdog found problems in the way that Bailey’s arrest was handled, but concluded in 2018 that there was no evidence of police corruption.
No one else has ever been charged with the murder.

RNE03D1X13_W5C0YHBXS8Q8T6F,"Norman Jewison, Oscar-nominated director of ‘In the Heat of the Night,’ dead at 97","By Alli Rosenbloom, CNN","3 minute read Published 6:10 PM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/22/entertainment/norman-jewison-death/,"Norman Jewison, an Oscar-nominated Canadian director whose decades of work yielded a diverse resume that included Sidney Poitier-led drama “In the Heat of the Night” and 1971’s “Fiddler on the Roof,” has died, according to his publicist. He was 97.
Jewison died “peacefully” on Saturday, his publicist Jeff Sanderson told CNN in a statement on Monday. Sanderson did not specify a cause of death.
With a career spanning over 40 years, Jewison had several Oscar nominations, including three for best director and four for best picture as a producer – 1966’s “The Russians Are Coming the Russians Are Coming,” 1971’s “Fiddler on the Roof,” 1984’s “A Soldier’s Story” and 1987’s “Moonstruck.” In 1999, he was awarded the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award for his body of work.
“The biggest grossing picture is not necessarily the best picture, so just tell stories that move us to laughter and tears and, perhaps, reveal a little truth about ourselves,” Jewison said in his acceptance speech.
“In The Heat of the Night,” starring Poitier and Lee Grant, won five Oscars, including best picture, but Jewison was the director, not a producer on that film.
Jewison had been in show business since the age of five, when he made his on-stage debut as a performer at the Malvern Collegiate Institute, according to an official biography. After serving time in the Royal Canadian Navy, Jewison earned a degree from Victoria College in Toronto.
Some of his first credits as a director were for television series in the 1950s, including “Your Hit Parade,” “The Andy Williams Show” and “The Fabulous Fifties.”
His cinematic directorial debut came in 1962, with Jewison behind the lens of the Tony Curtis-led comedy “40 Pounds of Trouble.” He continued to find success as a director in the years that followed with the 1965 classic “The Cincinnati Kid,” starring actor and racing legend Steve McQueen.
He teamed back up with McQueen in 1967 to direct the original “Thomas Crown Affair,” which was remade in 1999 starring Pierce Brosnan.
Known for his ability to cover a variety of topics in his work, Jewison directed the cinematic version of the hit Broadway play “Fiddler on the Roof” and the rock opera “Jesus Christ Superstar” within two years of each other in the early 1970s.
He followed-up that duo of films with a war drama — 1984’s “A Soldier’s Story” — and “Moonstruck,” a family dramedy starring Cher, in 1987.
Jewison directed other iconic films throughout the 1980s, including “In Country,” starring Bruce Willis and Emily Lloyd, and “Other People’s Money.”
His last credited directorial offering came in 2003 with “The Statement,” a thriller starring Michael Caine and Tilda Swinton.
He is survived by his wife Lynne St. David, three children and five grandchildren."

The Ilyushin-76 cargo plane crashed inside Russian airspace, 5 to 6 kilometers (about 3 to 3.7 miles) from the village of Yablonovo in the Belgorod region. Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and its Defense Ministry called it an act of terrorism.
“The plane was destroyed by the Ukrainian Armed Forces from the area of Liptsy, Kharkiv region, using an anti-aircraft missile system,” the ministry said in a statement.
“The radar equipment of the Russian Aerospace Forces observed the launch of two Ukrainian missiles.”
Air defense systems in the Belgorod region were active shortly before the crash, according to the region’s governor Vyacheslav Gladkov.
Ukraine’s military command said it regarded Russian military aircraft approaching Belgorod as legitimate targets but stopped short of acknowledging it fired at the plane.
In a carefully worded statement, the General Staff of Ukraine’s armed forces said recent attacks on the city of Kharkiv, which lies just 18 miles (30 km) from Russia, are being facilitated by Russian cargo planes bringing weapons close to the border.
“The recorded intensity of the shelling is directly related to the increase in the number of military transport aircraft that have recently been heading to the Belgorod airfield,” the statement said.
“With this in mind, the Armed Forces of Ukraine will continue to take measures to destroy delivery means and control the airspace to eliminate the terrorist threat, including on the Belgorod-Kharkiv direction.”
Ukrainian sources earlier said the plane was carrying missiles for the S-300 air defense system. CNN cannot independently verify either side’s claims.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of “playing with the lives” of Ukrainian prisoners of war and called for an international investigation, saying “it is necessary to establish clear facts as much as possible, given that the plane crash happened on Russian territory that is beyond our control.”
Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov told reporters on Wednesday that he had requested an emergency United Nations Security Council meeting following the crash.
A video geolocated by CNN appeared to show the IL-76 plane’s final seconds before it crashes to the ground.
The video was filmed in Yablonovo, which lies about 40 kilometers (25 miles) northeast of the city of Belgorod, and begins with the plane already in a steep fall. Just before it disappears behind a passing truck and trees, what appears to be a part of the plane can be seen falling from the front of the fuselage.
Two seconds later, after the plane has disappeared from view, a huge fireball and black smoke can be seen emerging from the point of impact – which is not visible – with the ground.
The camera then pans sharply to the left to show what appears to be a small cloud of smoke. This could be an indication of a possible explosion on the plane, though the flight path of the plane cannot be established with certainty from the video.

Several eyewitness described hearing loud, thunderous claps at the time of the crash, followed by an air raid alert in the Russian city.
“We heard one or two loud bangs. With an interval of a minute or less. The second bang was much louder. We all ran out to see if someone needs help, but the crash was further away after the village. It was very loud and scary,” one woman told Russian state media RIA Novosti.
“We heard three claps. The claps were loud enough, and we thought that either something had fallen somewhere here, or that missiles had been shot down in the air. Then right after that, the guys in my class began to say that air raid alert went off in Belgorod, the sound of a siren,” said one young man.
Another man said there was a “strong vibration” in the room after the loud noises.
The pilots of the Il-76 managed to steer the plane away from the village of Yablonovo, sacrificing their lives, the rector of the local church, Priest Georgy Borovikov said.
Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov said 65 Ukrainian servicemen were on board the plane and being flown to Belgorod ahead of a prisoner swap.
“It was supposed to transport from the Moscow region to Belgorod 65 military servicemen of Ukraine. They were accompanied by three Russian officers plus the crew of six people. All of them died,” Lavrov said. “The Ukrainian side launched an air defense missile from the Kharkiv region. It targeted the aeroplane and was a fatal strike.”
CNN is not able to independently verify Russia’s claims.
A Ukrainian government agency for prisoners of war said it was investigating claims that the plane was carrying Ukrainian servicemen.
Ukraine appears to be unclear, at least publicly, on whether Ukrainian prisoners were actually on board but has suggested Moscow might have deliberately put the Ukrainian servicemen’s lives at danger.
A statement from the “Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War of Ukraine” provided no further details but did warn Russia was “actively conducting information special operations against Ukraine aimed at destabilizing Ukrainian society.”
Ukraine confirmed that a prisoner of war exchange with Russia had been due to take place on Wednesday. “It is not happening at the moment,” Andriy Yuson, from Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence, told CNN.

Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence arm said in a subsequent statement that it had fulfilled its side of that agreement, bringing captured Russian servicemen to an agreed location. However, it said Ukraine had not received details from Russia about how Ukrainian servicemen were to be brought forward to the exchange – whether they would be moved by air, rail, or road.
Crucially, it said it had not been warned against challenging the security of Belgorod’s airspace at an appointed time – something it had been warned against doing “many times in the past.” Russia has a duty to ensure the safety of prisoners of war, the statement added.
“This may indicate deliberate actions by Russia aimed at endangering the lives and safety of prisoners. Landing a transport plane in a 30-kilometer combat zone cannot be safe and in any case should be discussed by both sides, because otherwise it jeopardizes the entire exchange process.”
Six Russian crew members and three “accompanying personnel” were also on board the plane, Russian officials said. Russian Parliament’s defense committee member Andrey Kartapolov said a second military plane, also an IL-76, was carrying an additional 80 prisoners of war, which was diverted.
Kartapolov said the “Ukrainian leadership was well aware of the impending exchange and was informed of how the prisoners would be delivered. But the IL-76 plane was shot down by three missiles, either with anti-aircraft missile systems or Patriot, or with German-made IRIS.”
Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said the cause of the crash was being investigated. “A transport airplane crashed in the Korochansky district. It went down in a field near a settlement. All those on board died,” Gladkov said. “Now the crash site is cordoned off. All operational services are on site, investigative measures are being carried out,” he added.
Two Russian officials, including the Russian governor of the Tambov region, Maksim Yegorov, claimed the plane changed its course after it was hit “to avert danger to civilians” in a nearby village.
The Ilyushin Il-76 is a Soviet-era military transport aircraft with a payload of more than 50 tons, according to Europe’s air safety body, Eurocontrol. It has been in service since 1975.
The border city of Belgorod was the site of one of the deadliest Ukrainian attacks on Russian soil late last year. At least 24 people, including three children, were killed and 108 others wounded in the attacks, which sparked retaliatory Russian strikes on the Kharkiv region of Ukraine.
The plane crash comes as Russia’s war in Ukraine is set to enter its third year, with little battlefield progress made by either side in recent months. Western intelligence assessments warn that battlefield movement could further stagnate this year.
Kyiv and Moscow have exchanged prisoners of war throughout the conflict. The largest swap came earlier in January, when the two sides each exchanged over 200 prisoners.
This is a developing story and will be updated.

ROYTVUE7Q0_KOF7IA4NU5X79YN,British zoo has new plan to rehabilitate its potty-mouthed parrots,"By Issy Ronald, CNN","3 minute read Published 12:11 PM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/23/travel/lincolnshire-wildlife-park-potty-mouthed-parrots-intl-scli-scn-gbr/,"A British wildlife park has hatched a new plan to rehabilitate its potty-mouthed parrots after they unleashed a tide of expletives.
Back in 2020, five foul-mouthed African gray parrots, donated to Lincolnshire Wildlife Park in eastern England, were isolated from the flock in an attempt to improve their language.
But, from Tuesday, the team is adopting a different, riskier approach of integrating three newly donated, cuss-happy birds – named Eric, Captain and Sheila – alongside the original five miscreants into the flock.
“When we came to move them, the language that came out of their carrying boxes was phenomenal, really bad. Not normal swear words, these were proper expletives,” the park’s chief executive, Steve Nichols, told CNN.

“We’ve put eight really, really offensive, swearing parrots with 92 non-swearing ones,” he said.
If the new strategy works, the eight parrots could learn “all the nice noises like microwaves and vehicles reversing” that the other parrots in the flock favor, Nichols added. But if the other 92 instead pick up the expletives, “it’s going to turn into some adult aviary.”
After some time in isolation, integrating the five original birds into the flock was “mostly” successful, Nichols said, but they still curse sometimes, and even laugh afterward, mimicking the most common reaction to their foul language.
Parrots precisely echo the sounds they hear, so “six of them have got men’s voices, two of them have got ladies’ voices and when they’re all swearing it does sound really bad,” Nichols explained.

The park has installed large signs warning visitors about the parrots’ language, but Nichols said it hasn’t received a single complaint.
In fact, historically, “we did hear a lot more customers swearing at parrots than we did parrots swearing at customers,” Nichols said.
African grays are highly social parrots, forming groups of up to 1,000 birds to roost at night in the wild, and communicating with each other through various calls.
Researchers believe their intelligence is almost unparalleled in the animal kingdom, comparable to that of apes, whales and dolphins.
Expletives are particularly easy to mimic for African grays since they are almost always said in the same tone and context, without any other words surrounding them, Nichols explained.
“When you tell someone to eff off, you usually say it the same every time,” he said.
For now, the park is hoping they will learn the sounds of the flock, and mend their potty-mouthed ways.
“I’ve just left them up there and there’s lots of noises, which is brilliant … from squeaking gates to doors slamming, people laughing and mobile phones,” Nichols said.
“I’m hoping that’s part of the settling-in period, but I don’t think they will ever lose the swear because as soon as somebody swears, they’ll be swearing as well.”"

Tuvalu, with a population of about 11,200 spread across nine islands, has campaigned at international conferences for greater action to help low-lying nations address climate change, because science shows its capital Funafuti risks being inundated by tides by 2050.
Most of Tuvalu is forecast to be flooded by high tides by 2100, says the United Nations Development Programme, which is working with Tuvalu to bolster its coastline.
A contest for influence in the Pacific between China and the United States has seen Tuvalu courted, with Washington recently pledging to connect its remote population by undersea cable to global telecommunications for the first time.

Tuvalu is one of three remaining Pacific allies of Taiwan, after Nauru cut ties this month and switched to Beijing, which pledged more development support.
Taiwan on Thursday said China was trying to influence the Tuvalu election and “seize our diplomatic allies.” China’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
China views democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory and not entitled to diplomatic ties. Taiwan rejects China’s sovereignty claim.
Contenders for Tuvalu’s leadership have all advocated for climate change action on the world stage, but differ in approaches to ties with Taiwan, a diplomatic ally since 1979.
Tuvalu’s Finance Minister Seve Paeniu, who has secured a seat in the new parliament as one of only two candidates for the Nukulaelae island electorate, told Reuters he expects Taiwan ties to be reviewed after the election.
The new government should decide whether Taiwan or China can best respond to Tuvalu’s development needs, he said.

Prime Minister Kausea Natano has told Taiwan he continues to support ties, Taiwan said.
Enele Sopoaga, ousted as prime minister by Natano at the 2019 election, and former foreign minister Simon Kofe, have previously pledged support for Taiwan.There are no political parties, and two lawmakers will be chosen by voters in each of eight island electorates.
After votes are counted, government boats collect the new lawmakers from islands and bring them to the capital Funafuti, a journey that can take up to 27 hours. The prime minister is chosen by the newly elected lawmakers. Natano and Kofe are running in the seat of Funafuti.
Kofe attracted global headlines in 2021 when he delivered a speech to the United Nations climate change summit standing knee deep in water to highlight the plight of the low-lying nation.
Tuvalu signed a security and migration agreement with Australia in November that allows Canberra to vet security ties. Sopoaga has rejected the Australia deal, while Kofe said some aspects should be revised."
RT628OY633_9CDYZ4K6M00P522,McConnell says immigration talks in ‘quandary’ as Trump lobbies Congress to kill deal,"By Manu Raju, Lauren Fox and Ted Barrett, CNN","5 minute read Updated 9:33 AM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/24/politics/mcconnell-senate-gop-border-ukraine-package/,"Former President Donald Trump’s push to kill a bipartisan immigration deal may now derail a major national security package, forcing Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell to suggest a new course of action and endangering aid to Ukraine and Israel in the process.
According to a GOP source familiar with the matter, McConnell told Republicans at a private Wednesday meeting that they are in a “quandary,” given that bipartisan talks over immigration have created intraparty feuding and may have closed off a path to getting a massive package approved this Congress.
The fresh doubts from the Senate GOP leader – one of the leading proponents of more aid to Ukraine – suggest Congress may have to punt on the issues altogether or break up the package into individual pieces, though no decisions have been made. McConnell’s goal at the meeting, sources said, was to lay out to his colleagues that there was no clear path ahead unless members were willing to compromise.
The new doubts come as House Republicans – with the encouragement of Trump, who is railing on immigration as a top election issue – are revolting over the bipartisan talks, even before they’ve concluded. Republicans were already divided over whether to approve any aid to Ukraine, even as they have insisted that the border must be dealt with before Ukraine aid can be approved. On top of that, the House Republican demand to pass their border security bill – HR 2 – is a non-starter with Democrats.
The candid assessment, reported earlier by Punchbowl News, underscores the growing fears that Congress won’t be able to approve aid to Ukraine at a critical moment in its war against Russia – or pass any legislation to clamp down on the surge of migrants at the southern border.
During the meeting, McConnell read a quote from Trump in 2018 that cast doubt on Democrats ever voting for border security, a message to his GOP colleagues that this may be the best opportunity Republicans have to get border security in decades.
“He did a good job of quoting Donald Trump saying in 2018 that we will never get a Democrat to vote for this [border] stuff,” Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota said.
Senate Republicans engaged in a lengthy debate behind closed doors over the future of US aid to Ukraine, but the GOP emerged still divided over the best path forward as lawmakers remain stuck over how to get a bill to aid Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan and the US border across the finish line.
“We had a thorough airing of views,” Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn said.
Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, said at this point, he thinks he has a good sense of where everyone in the conference is but that there was no grand resolution.
“It was one of the most thoughtful discussions, sincere emotional discussions, we’ve had. I think that we will have a conference too divided on Ukraine, but we’re united in securing the border,” Sen. Roger Marshall, a Republican from Kansas, said.
GOP members emerging said it was less about finding a unified position (there is none) and more about giving members an opportunity to state their case and engage in a debate. Members also said that McConnell played the part of “historian in the room,” reminding the conference of where they once were and the opportunity at hand on the border.
“He is attentive and he understands the historical lay of the land and it is very instructive when he does those things, when he reminds us of other opportunities lost, how far James Lankford has brought us further than we have ever been in 30 years,” Cramer said.
Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina who is among those supportive of more aid, said he just wants to remind his colleagues there are consequences to not taking action.
“This won’t take decades to regret. This will be in a matter of years and so people who chose to ultimately to exit Ukraine if they are successful – for as long as I am breathing – I will remind them of the consequences I am convinced we will have to live with,” Tillis said.
Sen. Mitt Romney, a Republican from Utah who is supportive of the US aiding the war effort in Ukraine, said that Sens. Jerry Moran, Jim Risch and Susan Collins made rousing appeals in support of the effort.
Cramer told reporters that Risch, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, actually played a clip of the late Sen. John McCain talking about Russian President Vladimir Putin after the invasion of Crimea.
But it’s a delicate balance for many in the GOP conference.
“We have to figure out a way to sustain this fight without depleting our capabilities around the world. I don’t think that strategy should be whatever it costs for however long it takes. That’s neither realistic nor wise but it also can’t be we are walking away when we are done because we’ll pay a price for that too,” Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida said.
Asked if the meeting was tense, Rubio laughed it off, saying, “Compared to what?” Reminded that Tuesday’s lunch was animated and boisterous, Rubio quipped: “That’s not tense. Just because they don’t let us bring knives and forks anymore.”
Rubio reminded reporters that was a joke.

RVWUQU3M42_MKVHG8SY72XUCI0,Government warns funeral homes to stop misleading bereaved customers about pricing,"By Ramishah Maruf, CNN","2 minute read Updated 6:14 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/25/business/government-warns-funeral-homes-on-pricing/,"A government agency warned 39 funeral homes across the US that they risk hefty penalties if they fail to disclose accurate pricing information to customers, the Federal Trade Commission announced Thursday.
The FTC conducted an undercover phone sweep of more than 250 funeral homes, placing calls to obtain pricing information. For 38 calls, the agency said the funeral homes either refused to answer questions about pricing or gave inconsistent information about identical services.
Funeral homes have to follow the FTC’s “Funeral Rule,” which provides bereaved consumers rights during the process and holds the business  to strict requirements. One of the caveats is that funeral homes must give customers a general price list, and customers have the right to choose which services they want.
Funerals can be a major financial burden for families, and they are getting more expensive. The median cost of a funeral is $7,848 and the median cost of a funeral with cremation is approximately $6,971, according to the National Funeral Directors Association. Funeral prices rose 4.7% between December 2022 and December 2023, according to CPI data.
“Telephone inquiries are particularly important for people who are grieving a loss or making arrangements for a loved one in a different city. That’s why the Funeral Rule requires funeral homes to provide accurate price information over the phone,” Lesley Fair, a senior attorney with the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, wrote in an online post.
On one call, the funeral home said local health code required the body to be embalmed, the process of preserving a body after death. Most states’ health code, including that one, actually do not require embalming, the FTC said, and most states that do only require it in certain circumstances.
Yet another funeral home promised to send a general pricing list but instead sent a list of package prices. That broke the requirements, the FTC alleged.
The agency listed the funeral homes it sent warning letters to on its site, the locations ranging from Laredo, Texas, to Philadelphia. Funeral homes that don’t comply could pay up to $51,744 per violation."

The front page of the weekly Ouray County Plaindealer on Thursday featured a story alleging a relative of the police chief was one of three individuals arrested in connection with a sexual assault last May that reportedly occurred in Wood’s home.
On Thursday morning, more than 200 copies of that paper were missing from vending racks around the town, according to the Plaindealer.
“I have no idea whether he intended to frame me or my department,” Wood told CNN regarding the theft suspect. “But the obvious result was the appearance of a police cover up. And an utterly incompetent one at that. The story had already appeared online, what could possibly be gained from stealing hard copies?”
The Plaindealer reported the suspect was cited on suspicion of petty theft by the Ouray County Sheriff’s Office. CNN has reached out to the suspect for comment.
The sheriff’s office said it was not associated with the defendants in the case.
Wood said he was made aware of the allegations of an attack at his home “approximately two months after the incident was alleged to have occurred.”
Wood declined to comment further on the allegations. “I anticipate being called as a witness at trial so I feel it is not appropriate to comment on the plausibility of the young lady’s allegations at this time,” he said.
CNN has reached out for a copy of the arrest affidavit. The Colorado Bureau of Investigation continues to investigate the sexual assault case.
Ouray County is in southwest Colorado, about 160 miles south of Aspen."
RZIK7MK3X7_3SZ342EKZU9LCYD,FDA warns of secondary cancer risk tied to CAR-T therapies that treat cancer,"By Jacqueline Howard, CNN","5 minute read Updated 4:36 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/24/health/fda-car-t-therapies-secondary-cancer-risk/,"The US Food and Drug Administration has issued a new warning about the possible risk of secondary cancers in cancer patients who have been treated with a form of immunotherapy called chimeric antigen receptor T-cell, or CAR-T cell, therapy.
The FDA sent notification letters this week and last week to several manufacturers of these therapies, requiring them to add a “boxed warning” to the products’ prescribing information. The warnings say that some T-cell malignancies, which in some cases led to hospitalization and death, have happened after treatment with BCMA- and CD19- directed genetically modified autologous T-cell immunotherapies.
Related article Cancer incidence rising among adults under 50, new report says, leaving doctors searching for answers
“We would like to underscore that the overall benefits of these products continue to outweigh their possible risks,” FDA spokesperson Carly Pflaum said in an email Wednesday.
As of Monday, the agency has received 25 reports of T-cell malignancy after treatment with CAR-T cell immunotherapies, according to the email.
T-cells, a type of white blood cell, are the backbone of CAR-T therapies. These work by harnessing a patient’s T-cells, altering them in a lab so that they will attack cancer cells and then giving those modified T-cells back to the patient through an infusion.
Currently approved CAR-T cell immunotherapies are Abecma, Breyanzi, Carvykti, Kymriah, Tecartus and Yescarta. Kymriah, the first CAR-T cancer therapy approved by the FDA for leukemia treatment, was approved in 2017. The initial approvals of these therapies included an FDA requirement for 15-year follow-up studies to assess long-term safety and risk of secondary cancers after treatment.
Previously, the risk of secondary malignanices was included as a “class warning” in the US prescribing information for these CAR-T therapies.

“The FDA considers the serious risk of T cell malignancy to be applicable to all BCMA- and CD19-directed genetically modified autologous T cell immunotherapies,” the FDA said in a news release Tuesday. “The letters notify manufacturers of each such licensed product to update the package insert to include available information related to the risks and to update the Medication Guide for these products to identify the possibility of the increased risk of getting cancers, including certain types of cancers of the immune system.”
Patients and people participating in clinical trials who are receiving these therapies should be monitored “life-long” for any new malignancies, according to the FDA. If a new malignancy develops after treatment, health-care providers are urged to contact the manufacturer to report the event and get instructions on how to collect samples from the patient for testing.
“On an individual basis, a patient should not be too worried about this specific risk of developing treatment-induced T cell lymphoma after receiving CAR-T cell therapies, the risk appears to be extremely low,” Dr. Joshua Brody, director of the lymphoma immunotherapy program at the Tisch Cancer Institute at Mount Sinai, who was not involved in the FDA warning, wrote in an email Wednesday. “The real impact of this new safety label is that it will push CAR-T developers to even safer versions for future patients.”

In November, the FDA announced that it was investigating the risk of secondary cancers after treatment with certain CAR-T cell therapies.
As of the end of last year, the agency had received 22 reported cases of different types of T-cell malignancies possibly associated with CAR-T therapies, Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said in a presentation at the Alliance for Regenerative Medicine this month.
He added that there were more than 27,000 people treated with these CAR-T therapies in the United States.
“So the rate of a few of these cases, with tens of thousands of individuals treated, it’s not overly concerning to us in this malignant setting right now,” he said.
“We’ve put out some initial guidance here about what we’re asking for: long-term monitoring; asking that providers, if they see a new T-cell malignancy, contact manufacturers, contact us so that we can get the data we need to understand the frequency of these events. But just make no mistake, the overall risk benefit profile here is still incredibly beneficial,” Marks said. “Over the coming months, as we learn more, we will adapt and update our information.”
This secondary cancer risk associated with CAR-T therapies will not necessarily change the way oncologist Dr. Eric Smith treats his patients, he said.
“The benefits of CAR T cell therapies continue to substantially outweigh the risks for our patients,” Smith, director of translational research for immune effector cell therapies, like CAR-T cell therapies, at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, said in an email Wednesday.
“These cases, and the potential for secondary cancers is and should be taken seriously, however, it will not have a major impact on treatment approaches for the FDA-approved therapies. Patients who require these therapies often have a high chance of dying from their current cancers and CAR T cell therapies have been transformative in terms of the response rates and durability of responses for patients with these relapsed or refractory blood cancers,” he said. “Given the low rate of these secondary malignancies, it is important that we can continue to administer CAR T cell therapies to our patients in need of them.”
Dr. Mikkael Sekeres, professor and chief of the Division of Hematology at the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center in Miami, said he doesn’t think patients should be any more concerned about the risks associated with CAR-T therapy than they would be for other cancer therapies.

“When we offer treatments for cancer, unfortunately there are no free rides – every effective cancer therapy has the potential to cause side effects. CAR-T cell therapies are often offered to people who have lymphomas, leukemia, or multiple myeloma that has returned after standard therapy, and they work really, really well,” he said in an email Wednesday.
“I will still recommend CAR-T cell therapies for my patients as I always have, and will incorporate a discussion of the risk of another cancer, just as I do with other cancer treatments,” Sekeres said. “I applaud the FDA for including the additional risk in the safety labeling for CAR-T Cell therapy so all of us – physician and patient alike – go into a treatment approach with eyes wide open.”"
S3EG7O93Z7_KTT9K1GMLX1YOMU,"Biden family business associate had no contact with Joe Biden, lawyer says","By Annie Grayer, CNN","4 minute read Updated 5:44 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/25/politics/mervyn-yan-gop-investigators-interview/,"House Republicans interviewed a former business associate of Hunter and James Biden on Thursday who told Congress ahead of the interview he had “no contact” with President Joe Biden, according to a letter obtained by CNN.
The letter sent to House Oversight Chairman James Comer on Wednesday is the latest example of a witness undercutting Republican allegations related to their impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden.
The committees conducting the investigation subpoenaed Mervyn Yan in November for his testimony, claiming that he may know whether the president had been involved in his family’s business dealings, an unproven allegation that rests at the heart of their probe.
But Yan’s lawyer wrote to Congress on Wednesday to refute that allegation.
“Throughout his interactions with Hunter and James Biden, Mr. Yan never met, spoke to, did business with, or had any personal or professional communication with President Biden, who was then the former Vice President of the United States,” Yan attorney Soumya Dayananda wrote to Comer, a Republican from Kentucky.
“He never heard mention of President Biden with respect to any of the transactions pursued by Hudson West III and is unaware of any involvement President Biden may have had with his son’s business pursuits,” Dayananda added.
As a result, Dayananda wrote, “Mr. Yan does not possess any materials or information bearing on President Biden’s alleged involvement in his family’s business dealings.”
Dayananda also mentioned that Comer never responded to a letter she wrote to him last year, outlining that her client was a private citizen who never worked with the president, and therefore should not be a target of congressional oversight.
“He is not a public official and he is not himself a valid target for inquiry. He has had no professional contact or communication with President Biden at any time,” Dayananda wrote in May to Comer.
Dayananda’s letter in May was in response to a separate subpoena from the House Oversight Committee for a broad array of documents related to his business dealings.
Yan, a Chinese-American businessman, worked with Hunter and James Biden, the president’s son and brother, on a joint venture involving a Chinese-backed energy company that dissolved in 2018, when Joe Biden was not in office. Yan worked as an “independent consultant” on the joint venture, known as Hudson West III, between Hunter Biden and a Chinese executive named Gongwen Dong, according to Dayananda.
As part of the joint venture agreement, the president’s son drew a monthly compensation of $100,000 and the president’s brother drew a monthly compensation of $65,000, Yan’s lawyer added. Yan, per Dayananda, is unaware of where the funding for the initial $5 million operating budget originated from.
Hunter Biden began to “investigate potential infrastructure projects” with the Chinese-backed energy company, CEFC, in 2015, when Joe Biden was vice president, according to the recent indictment in the federal tax case against the president’s son.
A House Oversight Committee aide told CNN that Republican members of the panel are concerned about the veracity of the letter Yan’s attorney sent based on the facts and information obtained in the investigation and that is why Yan is being cross examined about claims contained in the letter.
Following the interview, Comer said in a statement provided to CNN, “Mervyn Yan admitted on the record the Bidens had no experience in the energy and infrastructure sectors and was not sure what they brought to the table. His testimony raises many questions about the Bidens’ dealings with the Chinese government linked energy firm.”
“We will release the transcript from Mervyn Yan’s interview soon,” Comer added.
Meanwhile, the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, Rep. Jamie Raskin, said in a statement on X after the interview, “Mervyn Yan testified to the Committee today that he has no evidence of wrongdoing by President Biden and that, to his knowledge, President Biden was not involved in, did not profit from, and took no official actions in relation to his family’s business dealings.”
Republicans have continued to dig in on Hunter Biden’s foreign business dealings and have raised concerns about the transactions that came out of the joint venture with Yan.

S3Z7RMFKZK_3MCSPHP05FXMILG,Supreme Court takes up appeal of Oklahoma death row inmate after state attorney general admitted mistakes,"By Devan Cole, CNN","3 minute read Updated 11:21 AM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240122,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/22/politics/supreme-court-appeal-oklahoma-death-row-inmate/,"The Supreme Court agreed on Monday to take up the extraordinary appeal of an Oklahoma death row inmate named Richard Glossip, a man who even the state attorney general said should not be executed.
Last May the justices halted the pending execution while legal challenges played out.
Glossip has endured 26 years behind bars, nine execution dates, three last meals and two independent investigations that raised serious doubts about his conviction.
“We are grateful that the court is providing Richard Glossip the opportunity to argue that Oklahoma should not be permitted to kill him,” Glossip’s attorney, John Mills, said in a statement. “The court should reverse the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals, which has inexplicably refused to accept the state’s confession of error.”
Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner F. Drummond told the Supreme Court that the state had recently made the “difficult decision” to confess error in Glossip’s case and supports vacating the conviction of Glossip. The move was an about-face and came after review of new information that had come to light related to prosecutorial misconduct at Glossip’s trial.
The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals refused however, to accept the confession of error and determined the execution should go forward.
“That decision cannot be the final word in this case,” Drummond told the justices. “The injustice of allowing a capital sentence to be caried out where the conviction was occasioned by the government’s own admitted failings would be nigh unfathomable,” Drummond told the court in court papers.
The case dates back to 1997 when Justin Sneed murdered Barry Van Treese, the owner of a motel in Oklahoma City. After his arrest, and in exchange for avoiding the death sentence, Sneed implicated Glossip, who was serving as the motel’s manager. Sneed admitted to killing Van Treese. But at trial, prosecutors portrayed the killing as a murder-for-hire plot orchestrated by Glossip. Sneed secured a deal to avoid the death penalty: Plead guilty and testify against Glossip, then a 35-year-old whose criminal record included a single traffic ticket, per his attorneys.
Glossip’s conviction, according to the state, hinged almost entirely on Sneed’s credibility. But the state recently learned that the prosecution failed to disclose evidence related to Sneed’s credibility and failed to correct testimony it knew to be false.
Specifically, the state failed to release records that disclosed that Sneed was treated for a serious psychiatric condition.
Van Treese family members believe the execution should go forward.
“The State deeply respects the victim’s family’s concerns about ensuring justice be done,” Drummond told the justices, “but Justice would not be served by moving forward with a capital sentence that the State can no longer defend because of prosecutorial misconduct and cumulative error.”
Lawyers for Glossip say they only obtained files this year that revealed that Sneed saw Oklahoma’s only psychiatrist who diagnosed him with bipolar disorder and prescribed lithium. At trial, Sneed testified that after he was arrested he had “asked for some Sudafed because I had a cold, but then shortly after that somehow they ended up giving me Lithium for some reason, I don’t know why, I never seen a psychiatrist or anything.”
There were no noted dissents on Monday, although Justice Neil Gorsuch is recused from the case, likely because he dealt with it in some form before he took his seat on the high court.

S4OIU78MTV_U3V5844J1RY6WGB,New Hampshire is poised to answer the GOP’s existential question,"Analysis by Stephen Collinson, CNN","8 minute read Published 6:00 AM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240122,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/22/politics/new-hampshire-haley-trump-analysis/,"“Can you hear that sound?” a jubilant Nikki Haley asked a jazzed-up crowd as she strode onstage Sunday night.
“That’s the sound of a two-person race.”
The former South Carolina governor had just got what she wanted for months – a one-on-one clash with Donald Trump for the Republican nomination.
But she must still prove she can make a head-to-head duel with the ex-president last through Tuesday’s New Hampshire primary and beyond, after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis suddenly shelved his White House bid.
Related article DeSantis, once a rising Republican star, ran a presidential campaign filled with missteps and mistakes
Trump’s critics have long argued that if he ever faced a one-on-one fight for the Republican nomination against a single candidate who united all the party’s opposition against him, he’d lose.
The theory is about to be put to its ultimate test.
Haley will never have a better chance than in New Hampshire, among an electorate in which moderate and independent voters play a crucial role, to beat Trump in a single contest and to prove she can mount a nationwide challenge against him. A victory, or very close runner-up spot, will be vital to the former South Carolina governor’s capacity to run through her home state’s primary next month and into the Super Tuesday major-state primaries at the beginning of March.
“There’s two people in this race. That’s what we wanted all along,” Haley told CNN’s Dana Bash on the trail Sunday, moments after DeSantis quit the campaign.
But Haley faces an existential question for her own campaign Tuesday. Is the front-running ex-president, who is hugely popular among GOP base voters after turning his unprecedented legal morass into a rallying call, simply too strong at this point for anyone in the party to beat him? And if there is a consolidation of the Republican pack, it seems to be around Trump, not her, as three of the ex-president’s defeated rivals – DeSantis, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy – have endorsed him in the last week. “They’re all all coming with us,” Trump noted with satisfaction at a rally in Rochester, New Hampshire, on Sunday night.
Related article Why DeSantis’ departure isn’t likely to change the dynamic between Trump and Haley
But the chief proponent of the idea that a head-to-head contest could imperil Trump and open the way for a prolonged duel for delegates has been New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu. The popular Republican seemed ecstatic that his preferred scenario had come true as he rallied for Haley in Exeter on Sunday night.
“A little while ago, there were 13 candidates in the race, and now there are only two,” he roared to the crowd. “They said that couldn’t be done, but then Nikki Haley came along and wiped them all out. For years we have been waiting for something where the Republicans could galvanize together.” Sununu’s remarks underscored how Haley’s race has become part of a long battle for the soul of the GOP, even if she has trodden carefully in criticizing Trump for fear of alienating party voters who like him. Still, Sununu has also been downplaying expectations for Haley in recent days, arguing she only needs to start winning states on Super Tuesday.
Practically, the DeSantis departure came late for Haley – giving her only one full day to make her case that she’s a genuine contender in an one-on-one battle with Trump before voters go to the polls in New Hampshire. But she quickly tried to capitalize on her new status, presenting herself as the antidote to Trump’s “chaos” – her code word for his criminal problems, impeachments and tumultuous first term – and as a far surer bet to beat President Joe Biden in November’s general election.
The news sent a jolt of energy through Haley and her crowd. She’s had a rocky few days, despite the withdrawal of former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, whom her team had feared would split the anti-Trump vote in New Hampshire. She came third in the Iowa caucuses last week, a showing that dented a narrative of momentum surrounding her campaign. And in a CNN poll released Sunday, Trump led Haley by 11 points in the state. If anything, she might have benefited from DeSantis staying in until Wednesday. When his small slice of the vote in the CNN poll was reallocated based on voters’ second preferences, Trump led by 13 points since the Florida governor’s voters are likely a better fit for his coalition.

Yet the signature unpredictability and fabled history of the New Hampshire primary means there’s a chance that the late-in-the race narrowing of the GOP field could justify Sununu’s euphoria and give Haley the shock win she needs.
While most polls show a solid Trump lead, a complication in New Hampshire is that no one can be sure how many undeclared voters – the name for independents in the Granite State – will show up on Election Day to vote in the GOP primary. An unexpectedly high turnout of undeclared voters powered late Arizona Sen. John McCain to a shock victory in the 2000 GOP primary against George W. Bush. The state has also sprung shocks on the other side of the aisle: In 2008, Democrat Hillary Clinton won New Hampshire days after losing the Iowa caucuses to Barack Obama, in a result that turned his march to the nomination into a monthslong slog.
“The New Hampshire polling is all over the place – one reason – and that is the proportion of the undeclared voters that can vote in the Republican primary,” Republican pollster Whit Ayers said in a Brookings Institution briefing last week. “It is very difficult to anticipate what proportion they will make of the final turnout.”
Trump has long had to endure arguments that his shock capture of the Republican nomination in 2016 was only possible since party heavyweights such as Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Christie and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush all vainly believed they were the only candidate who could beat him – and thus divided the anti-Trump vote among them.
There is some truth to this version of history. Bush only quit in February 2016 after a fourth place in the South Carolina primary proved what Trump was saying – that his campaign was a “low energy” failure. Rubio, whose soaring vision of 21st century Reaganism was destroyed by Trump, only pulled out in March of that year after losing his home state to the future president. Cruz survived as the last opponent standing and stayed in the race until May, but by then, Trump was too far ahead. Had the Texas senator been the lone challenger from New Hampshire onward, perhaps the outcome may have been different.
In many of the races in the last competitive GOP nominating season, Trump benefited from a fractured opposition, and the first-past-the-post rules of many contests meant he was able to harvest all the delegates on offer even without a majority of votes. In the South Carolina primary, for instance, Trump won 32.5%, ahead of Rubio with 22.5%, Cruz with 22.3% and Bush with 7.8%. Had there been a single unified anti-Trump Republican challenge, the future president would almost certainly have lost the race. Instead, he walked away with all the state’s 50 bound convention delegates. Even in New Hampshire last time, Trump won a relatively close race in a packed field with only 35% of the vote but won all 11 delegates.

Eight years later, Trump has changed the Republican Party beyond recognition. He’s remade it in his populist, nationalist image. This time last year, the former president looked vulnerable after his attempts to push his favored candidates in the midterm elections may have cost the GOP the Senate. But he successfully leveraged his 91 criminal charges, including over his attempt to overturn democracy to stay in power after losing the 2020 reelection, into a foundation for a revived campaign. Millions of Americans now believe his falsehoods about a stolen election. His expected appearance in a New York courtroom Monday in a civil defamation case is another example of how he has used his legal dramas to fuel his campaign. And Trump has driven out Republican lawmakers who still oppose him – such as former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, who lost a primary in 2022, and 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney, who is not running for a second term as a Utah senator.
That transformation of the GOP – and Trump’s extraordinary bond with voters – has often been reflected in polls of this race, which have shown Trump with greater popularity in key states than all of his rivals combined. This was borne out in Iowa last week when Trump got just over 50% of the vote in the widest victory in the GOP contest in the state’s history. While the magnitude of that result is unlikely to be repeated in New Hampshire, given the state’s demographic makeup, Haley’s path becomes far more complicated going forward even if she notches a win in the Granite state.
Take South Carolina. While she twice won gubernatorial battles, Haley hasn’t been on the ballot there in a decade. And now, the state is one of the most fervent pro-Trump bastions, a point the ex-president tried to make by inviting Gov. Henry McMaster, Lt. Gov. Pamela Evette and other top state Republicans who have endorsed him to join him on stage in New Hampshire on Saturday night. Scott delivered another blow to Haley on Friday by endorsing the former president, and argued on CNN on Sunday that Trump would be a much stronger commander in chief than Haley.
In Exeter, Haley pitched a vision of a deeply conservative presidency on issues including immigration reform, deficit reduction and foreign policy. But her demeanor and plans also offered a promise of a return to calm, steady governance instead of Trump’s tumult and the “retribution” he’s promising for a second term. There’s no suggestion, even from Democrats, that Haley would threaten democracy from the Oval Office or turn decades of US foreign policy values upside down. Hypothetical matchup polls showing Haley defeating Biden in many cases suggest that’s a campaign many Americans could get behind.
But Haley’s problem is that most Republican voters may not want what she’s offering.
“Republicans set all the issues aside,” CNN commentator and Republican consultant Scott Jennings said Sunday. “(They said) the only way for us to get euphoric vindication for all the wrongs that have been done to Donald Trump is to nominate him again, and I think that’s what they are going to do.”
In this race, being the last candidate standing against “the fellas,” as Haley calls her rivals, may not mean much or last very long. It might simply be a passport to be the last candidate who gets rolled over by Trump."
S7A9LPHCJV_HT2MPJW80QIYQUC,Five takeaways from the New Hampshire primary,"By Eric Bradner, CNN","6 minute read Updated 11:37 PM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/23/politics/takeaways-new-hampshire-primary/,"Former President Donald Trump took a huge step toward winning a third consecutive Republican presidential nomination Tuesday, winning the New Hampshire primary in a one-on-one matchup with his last challenger standing, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley.
Haley vowed to remain in the Republican race, saying she’ll now focus on the February 24 primary in her home state of South Carolina.
But she’ll be battling history: In modern presidential campaign history, no non-incumbent has won the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary without going on to win his party’s nomination.
Trump, who took the stage shortly after Haley spoke, seethed over her decision to continue her campaign.
“She had to win,” the former president said. “She failed badly.”
As Haley seeks to prove she remains a viable contender, President Joe Biden began preparations for a general election rematch with Trump — dispatching senior White House staffers to work on his campaign and holding an event in Virginia where he hammered Trump on abortion rights.
Here are five takeaways from the New Hampshire primaries:
In what were expected to be celebratory remarks Tuesday night in New Hampshire, Trump instead sounded annoyed that Haley had not yet dropped out of the Republican primary race.
He mocked Haley, calling her an “imposter” who had “claimed victory” despite doing “very poorly.” (Haley, in fact, had congratulated Trump for his victory at the beginning of her remarks.)
His remarks made plain that Haley’s attacks on Trump’s age, his verbal miscues and Republican losses during his time as the party’s leader have frustrated the former president.
It was a jarring contrast from Trump’s election night remarks eight days ago in Iowa, when he praised his rivals as “very smart people, very capable people” and predicted that Republicans are “going to come together. It’s going to happen soon, too.”
He invited two former 2024 GOP contenders, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, to attack Haley on stage Tuesday night.
“What we see right now with her continuing in the race is the ugly underbelly of American politics,” Ramaswamy said, blaming Haley’s decision to continue her candidacy on “megadonors” who are out of step with what Americans want. “What we saw tonight is America first defeating America last.”
Later, he gave Scott, who stood on stage behind him days after endorsing the former president, the chance to jab at Haley. He noted that Haley had appointed the South Carolina Republican to the Senate in 2013.
“Did you ever think that she actually appointed you, Tim?” Trump said. “You must really hate her.”
Scott diplomatically stepped to the microphone to interject. “I just love you,” he said.
Though Trump is eager to move past the Republican primary, and Biden’s campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said Tuesday night that Trump “has all but locked up” his party’s nomination, Haley insisted she won’t leave the race.
“New Hampshire is first in the nation. It is not the last in the nation. This race is far from over. There are dozens of states left to go,” Haley told supporters in her election night speech Tuesday in New Hampshire.
What’s not clear, though, is where Haley could actually notch a victory against Trump. She isn’t participating in the Nevada caucuses on February 8 (she will instead be on the state’s primary ballot, which won’t lead to her winning any delegates), and polls in her home state of South Carolina — where the February 24 primary will be the next major showdown — show Trump with a huge lead.
Haley is likely to face immense pressure to depart the race in coming days. She’ll face questions about whether she’ll follow a path similar to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who vowed to continue on after his second-place finish in last week’s Iowa caucuses — and then he dropped out days later.
Haley’s campaign said Tuesday it is placing $4 million in television advertising reservations in South Carolina. She has also scheduled a rally Wednesday night in North Charleston.
Mark Harris, executive director of the pro-Haley super PAC SFA Fund, told CNN the group is “on to South Carolina” and plan to spend millions on ads, mail and more.
Haley used her Tuesday night speech to make her most pointed argument yet about electability — blaming Trump for Republicans’ disappointing performances in the 2018 and 2022 midterms and the 2020 presidential election.
“With Donald Trump, Republicans have lost almost every competitive election,” she said, ticking through GOP failures during Trump’s time as the party’s leader. “The worst-kept secret in politics is how badly the Democrats want to run against Donald Trump.”
A supporter shouted: “He’s a loser!”
The former South Carolina governor called Trump “the only Republican in the country who Joe Biden can defeat.”

She also highlighted their ages. Trump will be 78 on Election Day in November; Biden will be 81. She also questioned Trump’s mental competency, and challenged him to debate her. (Trump skipped all five Republican primary debates, and has shown no indication he’d consider participating in one.)
Trump is dominating Republican primary polls. But polls also show Haley outperforms the former president in a hypothetical general election matchup with Biden — something Haley has frequently noted in recent days.
“The first party to retire its 80-year-old candidate is going to be the party that wins this election,” she said Tuesday night. “And I think it should be the Republicans that win this election. So our fight is not over, because we have a country to save.”
Though Trump’s win was a huge step toward cementing the GOP nomination, there were warning signs for his general election hopes within CNN’s exit polls of New Hampshire Republican primary voters.
Haley won the 29% of the electorate that identified themselves as moderate by a 3-to-1 margin.
On the issue of abortion, Trump was the strong favorite of those who support banning most or all abortions nationwide, but Haley edged him out among the 67% of the primary electorate that said they would oppose a ban. Biden’s campaign on Tuesday signaled its intent to make abortion rights a central focus of the general election.
“Let there be no mistake: The person most responsible for taking away this freedom in America is Donald Trump,” Biden told supporters at a rally in Manassas, Virginia.
There were other potential signs of trouble with moderate voters for Trump. Among them: 44% of the primary electorate said Trump is not fit for the presidency if he is convicted of a crime, and Haley won 84% of those voters. Haley won 79% of the votes of those who said Biden legitimately won the 2020 election — showing a potentially limited appetite among voters for Trump’s lies about widespread election fraud.
Biden won the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday night, but he had been at risk for blowback in New Hampshire after he led the Democratic push to demote the state in the party’s nominating process — elevating South Carolina’s primary to become the first contest with delegates on the line.
The Democratic National Committee had called the vote “meaningless” and had urged presidential candidates to “take all steps possible not to participate.” Still, Biden’s allies launched a low-key effort to get Democrats to write in Biden, and it paid off with an easy victory.
It was a reminder that even though Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips and author Marianne Williamson are challenging Biden, there is no drama: Biden’s path to the Democratic nomination for a second term is clear.
Biden’s campaign, meanwhile, is preparing for an early start of the general election, moving two senior aides from the White House to his reelection campaign in Wilmington. Jen O’Malley Dillon, who was campaign manager for Biden’s 2020 campaign, is poised to transition to a role as Biden’s campaign chair, while Mike Donilon, a long-time Biden messaging guru, will be chief strategist."
SE7O3HF5PG_UXV2KUXEF1BOUQM,UN agency fires staff members allegedly involved in October 7 attacks,"By Hira Humayun, CNN","4 minute read Updated 3:15 PM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/26/middleeast/unrwa-fires-staff-members-october-7-attacks-intl/,"The UN relief agency operating in Gaza said Friday that Israel had accused some of its staff of being involved in the October 7 attacks, and that their contracts would be “immediately” terminated.
The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNWRA) Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini said Israeli authorities provided the agency “with information” alleging several of its employees participated in Hamas’ murderous rampage into southern Israel, when the militant group killed at least 1,200 people and abducted more than 250 others.
An investigation is being launched into the alleged involvement of the employees and those involved will be held accountable “including through criminal prosecution,” added Lazzarini. The commissioner-general said he made the decision in order to protect the agency’s ability to deliver humanitarian aid.
Israeli Foreign Ministry told CNN on Friday that it welcomed the investigation. “It is important that UNRWA conduct a thorough in-house check on the activity of Hamas and other terrorist factors in its ranks in order to ensure the organization’s humanitarian activity is not taken advantage of,” it said.
The news came hours after the UN’s top court ordered Israel to act immediately to prevent genocide in Gaza but stopped short of calling for a ceasefire, in a ruling that was largely welcomed by the three main parties involved.

In the wake of the allegations against UNRWA, the US State Department announced it had “temporarily paused additional funding” to the agency – a move praised by Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to “emphasize the necessity of a thorough and swift investigation of this matter,” State Department spokesperson Matt Miller said in a statement on Friday.
The US has contacted the Israeli government for more details on the allegations, added Miller. They have also briefed member of Congress.
CNN has reached out to UNRWA and the Israeli authorities about the information Israel provided UNRWA and the nature of the alleged involvement of the UNRWA employees.
“These shocking allegations come as more than 2 million people in Gaza depend on lifesaving assistance that the Agency has been providing since the war began,” said Lazzarini. “Anyone who betrays the fundamental values of the United Nations also betrays those whom we serve in Gaza, across the region and elsewhere around the world”.
On Friday, Republican US Senator Jim Risch, ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, described the allegations as “unconscionable.”
“For years, I have warned the Biden Administration about resuming funding to UNRWA, which has a history of employing people connected to terrorist movements like Hamas. Today’s news is yet another example that underscores how corrupt this organization truly is.”
CNN cannot independently verify the allegations.
Israel’s relations with the UN have deteriorated in recent months, after the organization’s senior officials repeatedly condemned the country’s military approach to the war in Gaza.
In December, Israeli diplomats lashed out when UN Secretary-General António Guterres invoked a rarely used but powerful tool in his determined push for a ceasefire. At the time, Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen said the UN chief’s tenure was “a danger to world peace” and that his call for a ceasefire in Gaza amounted to supporting Hamas and the October 7 attack.
As Israel’s offensive enters its fourth month, entire neighborhoods in Gaza have been wiped out, critical supplies are dwindling and more than 2.2 million people face starvation, dehydration and deadly disease. At least 1.7 million Palestinians have been internally displaced, many of them multiple times, according to the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
Meanwhile, a growing chorus of world leaders have warned against the mounting Palestinian death toll. Israeli attacks on Gaza have killed at least 26,083 people, the vast majority of whom are women, children and the elderly, according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health. CNN cannot independently verify the figures due to the difficulties of reporting from the war zone.
Israel has strongly opposed calls for a ceasefire, maintaining that it needs to press on with its aim of eliminating Hamas.

SFWEEXS7E6_SW2IWUOHDI2VKNN,6 things to watch in New Hampshire’s presidential primary,"By Eric Bradner and Gregory Krieg, CNN","8 minute read Published 4:00 AM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/23/politics/what-to-watch-new-hampshire-primary/,"It’s now a two-person race for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination — and if former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley doesn’t defeat former President Donald Trump in New Hampshire’s primary on Tuesday, the fight may be over.
With Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis exiting the race Sunday, Haley now has the one-on-one shot at Trump that eluded his rivals in the 2016 GOP primary.
And it’s up to Republican primary voters in the Granite State — where Trump’s big win eight years ago began his road to dominance of a party he has since reshaped in his image — to decide whether they’ll stick with the former president for a third consecutive election.
New Hampshire, where independents play an outsize role in the GOP primary and where the popular governor, Chris Sununu, has been her top campaign surrogate, could be Haley’s only shot at delivering a political earthquake in the Republican race.
Another big Trump win, though, might effectively end the Republican primary after only two states, and tee up a general election rematch between Trump and President Joe Biden.
Here are six things to watch in the New Hampshire primary:
Haley’s campaign has for months focused on New Hampshire, identifying its more moderate electorate as her best shot of winning one of the four states — Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina — that kick off the GOP’s presidential nominating contest.
That’s fueled in part by the state allowing “undeclared” voters — those without a party affiliation — to vote in primaries. Undeclared voters make up a plurality of New Hampshire’s overall electorate.
Related article Why DeSantis’ departure isn’t likely to change the dynamic between Trump and Haley
For Haley, polls — including national and early-state surveys and CNN’s entrance poll in Iowa — have long found that she appeals most to moderates and Republicans eager to move on from Trump.
She’s also been helped by the endorsement of Sununu, himself one of the most prominent anti-Trump voices within the Republican Party. (A home-state gubernatorial endorsement has its limits: DeSantis had the support of Iowa’s Kim Reynolds and still flopped.)
Sununu, in an NBC News interview Sunday, sought to tamp down expectations for a Haley win, arguing that it won’t be critical for Haley to win primary contests until the slate of Super Tuesday primaries in early March.
“I’ve always said you wanted a one-on-one race going into Super Tuesday,” he said. “I think Super Tuesday is probably where you actually have to start winning states.”
Haley said Sunday she would “absolutely” remain in the Republican presidential race through South Carolina’s February 24 primary.
“South Carolinians know I won that state twice. They know I’m a fighter. They know I’m gonna go all the way through,” she said. “I’m also an accountant. So we saved a lot of our dollars to make sure we could be strong in South Carolina.”
Her campaign on Sunday announced plans for its first event in South Carolina after New Hampshire’s primary — a Wednesday evening gathering in North Charleston.
However, presidential candidates rarely admit that the end is near. DeSantis, after all, said he was in the GOP race for the “long haul” a week ago.

If Trump wins, he would make history: In modern presidential campaign history — since the Iowa caucuses began serving as the official kickoff, followed by the New Hampshire primary — no non-incumbent Republican has won both states.
And in doing so, he would make it much tougher for Haley to convince donors to pour money into her campaign and voters to stick with her for the month until the South Carolina primary. She’ll miss her only shot at another win before then because Haley filed to run in Nevada’s state-run primary, instead of competing in the state GOP-run caucuses. Delegates are awarded through the Nevada caucuses.
Some in the party are already eager to see the nominating race reach its end eight days after it started.
Montana Sen. Steve Daines, the chairman of the Senate GOP campaign arm, said Sunday on social media: “Donald Trump is the presumptive nominee. I am encouraging every Republican to unite behind him because it will take all of us to defeat Joe Biden, take back the Senate, and hold the House.”
Recent departures from the 2024 race have already shaped the New Hampshire Republican primary.
The exit of former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who consistently polled in the low double digits in the Granite State, likely benefited Haley, who has similarly tapped into a segment of the electorate dissatisfied with Trump.
Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy’s exit, meanwhile, has likely boosted Trump, coming with an full-throated endorsement from the Ohio businessman on the night of the Iowa caucuses.

DeSantis’ exit Sunday was the latest to shake up the race. And while the Florida governor had little support in New Hampshire, even small movements can prove determinative if the race is much closer than polls suggest it will be.
Trump held 50% support among likely Republican primary voters in the Granite State, with Haley at 39% and DeSantis at 6%, according to a new CNN poll conducted by the University of New Hampshire that was released Sunday before DeSantis’ exit.
And when DeSantis’s supporters are reallocated to their second-choice candidates, Trump leads Haley by a wider 54% to 41% margin. Another 3% of likely GOP primary voters say they’d vote for someone else.
Trump on Sunday night noted his former rivals’ endorsements.
“Vivek just came with us and now Ron just came with us. They’re all coming with us,” Trump said at a campaign event in Rochester, New Hampshire.
Haley, who was Trump’s US ambassador to the United Nations, has in recent days escalated her attacks on her onetime boss — deploying against Trump the same tactic he has used against Biden.
In Derry, New Hampshire, on Sunday, Haley again mentioned Trump’s gaffe Friday night in which he appeared to confuse her with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
“Trump goes on and on multiple times, saying that I prevented the security on January 6 at the Capitol. I wasn’t even anywhere near the Capitol. … The reality is he was confused. He was confused the same way he said Joe Biden was going to start World War II,” she said, referring to another Trump verbal miscue from a September 2023 speech.
Related article What voters in New Hampshire have to say about Nikki Haley and Donald Trump ahead of Tuesday’s primary
Haley also brought up Trump’s claim that he beat former President Barack Obama, not Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, in 2016.
“These things happen because the more you age, it just does — you have declined. Look at Joe Biden, he’s totally different now than he was two years ago. That’s a fact. It’s what happens,” Haley said.
She told CNN after a stop in Seabrook, New Hampshire, on Sunday that she sees Trump and Biden as “equally bad” options.
“If either one of them was good, I wouldn’t be running. Yes, they are equally bad. That’s why I’m running,” she said. “I don’t think we need to have two 80-year-olds sitting in the White House when we basically got to make sure that we can handle the war situation that we’re in. We need to know they’re at the top of their game.”
Tuesday’s result will test whether Haley’s approach — a line of attack no other Republican took against Trump in this election cycle — was effective.
Top Trump campaign aides Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles sent reporters a memo Sunday saying that Haley must win New Hampshire’s primary — citing past comments from Haley and her supporters, including Sununu, predicting her victory.
LaCivita and Wiles said that if Haley does not win Tuesday, she has two options: Either she “drops out, unites behind President Trump, and commits to defeating Joe Biden,” or she “prepares to be absolutely DEMOLISHED and EMBARASSED in her home state of South Carolina.”
“Choose wisely,” they said.
Should Haley lose, how she handles her election night remarks and  any next moves she announces are going to be closely monitored.  Does she see Trump as the all-but-certain nominee?  Does she have her eyes already on 2028, when Trump would either be a second-term incumbent ineligible to run for office again or an 82-year-old who’d have lost two consecutive general elections?
For her part, Haley insisted Monday on Fox News that she’ll continue in the race, no matter the outcome of the New Hampshire primary.
“I know the political class wants to say that this race is over, and I know that the political class is saying everybody has to get behind Trump. This is not a coronation,” Haley said, when asked about her viability in the race. “A democracy is about giving people options.”
“We’re going to go on into South Carolina, and we’re going to be strong,” she said.
The Democrats will also be holding a primary on Tuesday – or, more accurately, the state of New Hampshire will conduct a vote that the national Democratic Party, because it changed its primary calendar to make South Carolina the first official contest, has said will not count toward its nomination process. The winner here will not receive any delegates.
Related article Biden and New Hampshire Democrats have a lot riding on a low-key write-in campaign
For that reason, along with the fact that he spearheaded the move to change the order of the early primaries, Biden will not appear on the ballot. The Democratic National Committee has called the vote “meaningless” and has urged presidential candidates to “take all steps possible not to participate.” (Most ignored this warning and some familiar names, like author Marianne Williamson and Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips, are on the ballot. Neither are expected to fare well.)
And yet, the Biden camp will surely be watching how the president performs as a write-in candidate. Biden allies launched a low-profile effort to get Democrats to come to the polls to put pen to paper in support of him. But how many voters will bother?
Polls suggest Democratic enthusiasm for Biden is modest, at best, but a strong turnout for the president – with voters having the added onus of needing to write him in – could inject some new confidence into his reelection operation. On the flip side, a meager showing could confirm the intraparty worries."
SGB4SUB3YY_MF9QMHKSSEX1BD3,"Iran to execute protester with mental health condition on Tuesday, says lawyer","By AnneClaire Stapleton and Adam Pourahmadi, CNN","2 minute read Updated 9:30 PM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/22/world/iran-to-execute-protestor-with-mental-health-issues-says-lawyer/,"An Iranian protester with a mental health condition will be executed on Tuesday over the death of a local official during Iran’s 2022 mass demonstrations, his lawyer Amir Raesian said Monday.
Writing on X, Raesian said he received a notification from the Tehran General and Revolutionary Court that Mohammad Ghobadlou’s death sentence will be carried out on January 23, 2024.
Ghobadlou was sentenced to death by Iranian judge Abolqasem Salavati two years ago. Salavati has previously been sanctioned by the US for the notoriously harsh sentences he issued to activists, journalists, and political prisoners, CNN previously reported.
Iranian authorities allege Ghobadlou ran over a local official during a protest in Robat Karim, Tehran province, in September 2022, according to rights group Amnesty International.
He received two death sentences in relation to the death, according to Amnesty. The first death sentence was issued by a Revolutionary Court for “corruption on earth” on November 16, 2022 and upheld by the Supreme Court the following month, the rights group said. A second death sentence was issued by a criminal court in Tehran province for “murder” at the end of December 2022, it added.

But Amnesty criticized the death sentences for following what it described as “grossly unfair sham trials, marred by torture-tainted ‘confessions’ and failure to order rigorous mental health assessments despite (Ghobadlou’s) mental disability.”
Ghobadlou has been under the supervision of a psychiatric hospital for bipolar disorder since the age of 15, according to Amnesty. International law and standards prohibit using the death penalty against people with mental disabilities, according to Amnesty International.
Executions surged in Iran as the government cracked down on nationwide protests in 2022 after the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini while in the custody of the country’s so-called morality police.
Authorities violently repressed the months-long movement that posed one of the biggest domestic threats to Iran’s ruling clerical regime in more than a decade. Rights groups noted last year that the marked rise in executions reflected an effort by Tehran to “instill fear” among anti-regime protesters."
SHREMY74C1_EH3RFVI4HV84PI9,Alaska Airlines CEO says company found loose bolts on ‘many’ Boeing Max 9s,"By Ramishah Maruf, Pete Muntean and Gregory Wallace, CNN","3 minute read Updated 8:50 PM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/23/business/alaska-airlines-ceo-boeing-max-9-loose-bolts/,"Alaska Airlines CEO Ben Minicucci revealed the carrier found “some loose bolts on many” Boeing 737 Max 9s in an interview for “NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt” on Tuesday.
It was the CEO’s first interview since a door plug on one of its Max 9 airplanes shot out from the side of the fuselage only a few minutes into a flight from Portland, Oregon, to Ontario, California, forcing the pilot to make an emergency landing.
“I’m more than frustrated and disappointed. I am angry. This happened to Alaska Airlines. It happened to our guests and happened to our people,” Minicucci said, according to excerpts released ahead of the interview’s airing.
“Boeing is better than this. Flight 1282 should never have happened,” Minicucci said during the interview.
Boeing’s 737 factory will have what the company calls a “quality stand down” at its Renton, Washington facility Thursday, the company announced Tuesday.
“During the session, production, delivery and support teams will pause for a day so employees can take part in working sessions focused on quality. This is part of the immediate quality actions recently shared by Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stan Deal,” the company said in a statement.
The internal notice Boeing sent to its employees indicates that the 737 stand down is the first of several that it will hold at its facilities.
NBC asked Minicucci if Boeing has a problem with quality control extending beyond a single plane.
“I think this is the issue that’s at question right here, which is what is Boeing going to do differently on their quality program, to make sure that when we get an airplane, it’s at the highest degree of excellence and that’s what’s got to be different going forward,” he said.
He added that the company is adding its own extra oversight on the airplane maker’s production line.
The US Federal Aviation Administration urged airlines on Sunday to inspect so-called door plugs on an earlier version of Boeing 737 airplanes. After recent inspections of the newer Max 9s, United Airlines and Alaska Airlines have found loose bolts.
FAA opened a formal investigation into Boeing’s quality control around two weeks ago. The agency said it continued to review data collected from inspections of 40 sample aircraft as it considered how to determine if the planes were safe to fly again.
Minicucci noted in the interview that the inspections take about 10 hours per door.
In a statement, Stan Deal, the CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said: “We have let down our airline customers and are deeply sorry for the significant disruption to them, their employees and their passengers. We are taking action on a comprehensive plan to bring these airplanes safely back to service and to improve our quality and delivery performance. We will follow the lead of the FAA and support our customers every step of the way.”
The CEO of United Airlines, one of the biggest buyers of Boeing jets, also expressed frustration with the company.
“I’m disappointed that… this keeps happening at Boeing. This isn’t new,” said Scott Kirby, CEO of United, in an interview Tuesday on CNBC. “We need Boeing to succeed. But they’ve been having these consistent manufacturing challenges. They need to take action here.”
NBC said Minicucci told the network Alaska Airlines would continue to fly an all-Boeing fleet.
In contrast, United appeared more unsure about its relationship with Boeing.
United has 79 of the Max 9s, more than any other airline, and had originally scheduled nearly 8,000 flights with the plane for this month before the incident, according to Cirium, an aviation analytics firm. Boeing’s future is uncertain regarding orders for the 737 Max 10, a newer, larger version and more expensive version of the 737 Max that has yet to be certified by the FAA.
“I think the Max 9 grounding is probably the straw that broke the camel’s back for us,” said Kirby. “We’re going to build a plan that doesn’t have the Max 10 in it.”

It cites crime as the problem","By Jordan Valinsky, CNN","3 minute read Updated 6:49 AM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/23/food/in-n-out-oakland-closure-crime/,"In-N-Out is permanently closing one of its restaurants for the first time ever, announcing that its Oakland location will soon shutter because of rampant crime in the California city.
The burger chain said in a statement that “despite taking repeated steps to create safer conditions, our customers and associates are regularly victimized by car break-ins, property damage, theft, and armed robberies.”
The location, which has been open for nearly two decades, will close on March 24. It’s the city’s only In-N-Out and is near the airport.
Crime has indeed substantially increased in Oakland: Burglaries were up 23% and motor vehicle thefts were up 44% in 2023 compared to a year prior, according to Oakland Police Department data obtained by CNN affiliate KGO-TV.
In-N-Out said in a statement that while “several” of its locations have relocated in its 75-year history, the Oakland closure is the first restaurant it has closed.
“We feel the frequency and severity of the crimes being encountered by our customers and associates leave us no alternative,” said Chief Operating Officer Denny Warnick, in the statement.
Notably, Warnick said its Oakland location was “busy and profitable,” but it can’t ask its customers or employees to “visit or work in an unsafe environment.” Affected employees, which amount to about 100, will transfer to a nearby restaurant in San Francisco or receive severance.

A diner told CNN affiliate KPIX-TV that someone broke into their car recently while they were eating inside the In-N-Out location. “They were trying to steal my vehicle, but I had a kill switch on. So they couldn’t get my vehicle, but they took all my belongings out,” the diner said.
An In-N-Out employee also told the station they’ve seen armed robberies at the restaurant’s parking lot.
Councilwoman Treva Reid said she’s been asking Oakland’s mayor’s office for more police in the area but hasn’t received the support. “We’re in a state of emergency. Should it have to take a declaration to deliver (services) when we’re living this? My district has been in crisis,” she told KPIX-TV.
In-N-Out is a privately held company with roughly 400 locations around the United States, mostly on the west coast. It made national headlines last year when it banned its employees in five states from wearing masks as part of new company guidelines that “emphasize the importance of customer service,” notably showing their smiles.
In 2021, its locations in Contra Costa county (also near Oakland) temporarily closed because it didn’t want to verify customers’ vaccination status, which was required during that time for indoor dining.
Starbucks, Target and other stores have closed in Oakland and other cities recently over concerns about crime.
Target said in September that it was closing nine stores in major cities across four states, claiming theft and organized retail crime have made the environment unsafe for staff and customers – and unsustainable for business.
Crime rates vary from city to city, however. Nationally, violent crime fell 8.2% in 2023 for the second straight year after a rise in 2021, according to the FBI.
But crime has increased in Oakland. Violent crime increased 21% in 2023 from the year prior, according to the Oakland Police Department."
SPESV8FDHQ_AE8I2BT9DS0BXJN,"They fell in love on vacation but went their separate ways. Four years later, she sent him an email: ‘Remember me?’","By Francesca Street, CNN","16 minute read Updated 9:53 AM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/travel/scotland-romance-lost-touch-reunited-chance-encounters/,"Gabriella Vagnoli never forgot that trip to Scotland.
She tried not to think about it, to “remove that chapter completely.” She’d known Dan Watling for only a few days. He lived in the US. She figured she’d never see him again.
But as her long-term relationship in Italy started to dwindle, Gabriella’s mind returned to how it felt walking around Loch Ness with Dan in the spring of 2002. She thought about his eyes, “very blue, beautiful, striking.” She remembered the way they’d sat together, on the mountainous Old Man of Storr, looking out over the Isle of Skye, sharing stories about their lives.
It was mid-2006 when Gabriella finally typed Dan’s name into Google. Social media was pretty new at the time. She wasn’t sure anything would come up. She’d convinced herself Dan would have long moved on. They weren’t 22 anymore.
“I was just like, ‘Oh I’m just going to see – because by now he’s probably married – Americans marry early. Who knows what he’s doing,” Gabriella recalls to CNN Travel.
To her surprise, Dan popped up right away. Photos of him on a three-month trip around Europe a couple of years earlier.
“He looked different, more rugged, more experienced,” says Gabriella.
He still had the same kind eyes. To Gabriella, he looked “more handsome.”
Gabriella decided to send Dan a message.
“Remember me?” she wrote.
Gabriella and Dan first connected on the banks of Loch Ness, the large body of water in the northerly Scottish Highlands, known as the home of the mythical Loch Ness monster.
At the time, Gabriella was midway through her college degree in Italy, finishing up a year spent studying in the UK.
“Me and a bunch of friends from Italy, Germany and Portugal decided to do this trip to Scotland together,” recalls Gabriella.
The group headed to Edinburgh to join a tour bus traveling further north. It was a three-day trip, with several stops to take in the Highland highlights.
Dan was on the same tour. Dan says his brother Bill “kind of forced” him to join the trip to Scotland. Dan was very committed to his job as a software developer in Chicago. He’d never traveled much.
“He bought my ticket and helped me get the passport and everything else. So essentially, I had no choice but to go,” Dan tells CNN Travel today.
Bill did all the planning too. He picked the backpackers tour. He made sure they got on the bus.
The whole thing was a bit outside of 22-year-old Dan’s comfort zone, but Dan was excited to be there.
There were around 15 people on the tour, including Gabriella and her gang of college friends. When the group boarded the bus, the tour guide suggested the travelers take it in turns to introduce themselves.
Gabriella was one of the first up. She told the group she was from Pisa, in Italy. She talked about her love of music.
“I remember being ‘struck’ when Gabi introduced herself,” Dan recalls. “I thought she was very pretty and interesting.”
When Dan stood up front and nervously introduced himself, Gabriella was struck by him too.
“I noticed Dan because of his eyes,” she recalls. He seemed shy, a bit embarrassed to be talking in front of a group of strangers. Gabriella found she couldn’t stop looking at him.
The first stop on the tour was Loch Ness. The tour guide and most of the group went down to the shore of the Loch, but Gabriella and Dan didn’t join them right away.
“Instead, we hung back and started talking,” says Dan.
Their first conversation was a little awkward – in his nervousness, Dan asked Gabriella what it was like living in Rome. She assumed he hadn’t been listening when she’d introduced herself as sharing a home with the famous Leaning Tower.
After that, things warmed up. Gabriella and Dan carried on chatting as they admired the sweeping expanse of Loch Ness, the imposing ruins of Urquhart Castle in the distance.

Back on the bus, Gabriella and her friends sat with Dan and his brother Bill. The group started playing the card game Uno to pass the time. As the bus headed northwest, the roads got narrower, the scenery glimpsed from the bus window more staggering. Eventually, the bus crossed the bridge to Skye, the famous Scottish island known for its spectacular scenery – think dramatic mountains, picturesque glens and ancient castles.
Gabriella couldn’t believe the vastness of the landscape. It felt worlds away from the city living she was used to.
“It really struck me and it was beautiful,” she says.
But while Dan remembers being immediately enamored with “the rocks, and the hills, the waterfalls, and the clouds and everything,” his main memory of Skye is falling for Gabriella.
“I just remember being with her most of all,” he says.
Skye was a “key moment,” agrees Gabriella.
Their tour guide took them to the Old Man of Storr, a rock formation offering incredible views of Skye’s misty hills and crags, the sea stretching out ahead. The group set out to hike to the pinnacle.
Dan’s brother and Gabriella’s friends strode ahead. But Gabriella and Dan took it slow, more focused on each other than the views.
“We were just walking a lot and asking a lot of questions to each other,” says Gabriella.
In the end, Gabriella and Dan stopped before they reached the top of the ridge, sitting on one of the lower crags together, completely caught up in one another.
“Going up to the Old Man of Storr, that, for me, that’s when I really felt a connection,” says Dan.
He barely knew Gabriella, but felt like he could be himself with her. He’d never really experienced anything like it.
Gabriella really liked Dan.
“We talked a lot,” says Gabriella. “He was very sweet.”
But for Gabriella, the situation was more complicated. She was dating someone back in Italy. And while Dan was a romantic, Gabriella was more pragmatic. She didn’t think their connection would outlast their time in Scotland.
“We had this trip that was very romantic. There was this big connection, but it was a short trip,” says Gabriella. “It wasn’t going to lead anywhere.”

When the tour came to an end and the group returned to Edinburgh, Gabriella and Dan said goodbye, not sure exactly where they stood. They swapped email addresses.
“I remember emailing her almost as soon as I arrived back home,” Dan says.
Dan and Gabriella “kept in touch for a little bit,” says Gabriella.
But before long, she cut things off.
“I shortly after decided it was better not to keep in touch,” she says. “I wanted to focus on my life in Italy.
“I had no desire to move to America. I had a different life and I was like, ‘You know this is not going anywhere. It’s better that we don’t keep this thing going.’”
To Gabriella, her life in Italy felt real, and the time with Dan in Scotland felt like a dream. She tried to draw a line and move on. To make it final, she blocked Dan’s email address.
When Dan received Gabriella’s goodbye email, he was “a little distraught.”
He tried to move on too, but it wasn’t easy.
“I was always thinking about her,” he says.
The trip to Scotland had also opened up Dan’s world and given him a bit of wanderlust. The following year, in 2003, he returned to Europe, backpacking through various European cities for three months.
Dan incorporated Gabriella’s hometown of Pisa into the itinerary – partly to see the Leaning Tower, but mostly because he hoped, against the odds, that he might bump into the girl he’d met the summer before in Scotland.
When his train pulled into Pisa station, Dan couldn’t help but glance around, hopefully, for Gabriella.
“She had told me that she had worked at the Pisa train station as a barista,” he says. “But of course, she wasn’t there.”
Back in the US, Dan dated a couple of other people, but it never got serious.
“There wasn’t that connection. It definitely was not the same. And not what I felt with her.”
He created a website, adding the photos from his three-month European trip.
And then, in 2006, Gabriella’s surprise email landed in his inbox.
When Dan read Gabriella’s email, he was in disbelief.
“She was always in the back of my mind,” he says. “I always hoped that we could reconnect somehow. And so of course, when I got the email, I was overjoyed.”
He replied right away. Gabriella wrote back. The two started emailing regularly, “chatting a lot,” as Gabriella puts it.
“It’s just so crazy that he hadn’t forgotten about me, because as I said, it was a short trip. But he’d been thinking about me,” she says.
They tried video calling – a relatively new concept in 2006. It was hard to get much detail from the grainy, webcam images. But hearing each other’s voices again was special.
“We literally talked about everything,” says Dan.
By coincidence, when Gabriella re-entered Dan’s life, he was in the middle of planning a trip to Oktoberfest in Munich, Germany.
“I had no plans to go to Italy when I started planning it. But then when I got the email from her, I decided, ‘Well, I’m going to make my way down to Italy, for sure,’” says Dan.
Dan and Gabriella agreed to meet in the Tuscan hilltop town of Siena, not far from her home city of Pisa, in September 2006.
On the bus to Siena, Gabriella told herself, “We’re just going to meet and I’ll show him around.” While Gabriella had enjoyed speaking with Dan online, she was “still very much in denial” about what might happen next.
The moment Gabriella and Dan saw one another again was charged.
“When I saw her get off the bus, I cried,” says Dan. “I was just incredibly happy to see her again.”
“I didn’t expect it to be so emotional when I actually saw him and I didn’t expect to be so struck by him,” says Gabriella. “I was struck by his eyes again. It was just romantic. I didn’t think it would be so striking, but it was. There was just something between us.”
“A connection,” says Dan.
“Something very, very unique,” agrees Gabriella. “From the moment we saw each other. It’s hard to explain.”
Gabriella and Dan spent the day wandering around Siena together. They couldn’t stop looking at each other and smiling, almost giddy with excitement.
“I remember walking around Piazza del Campo and how happy I was to be there with her,” says Dan.
When they said goodbye, things were still “open-ended,” says Dan. But unlike when they parted ways in Scotland, there seemed to be a promise of a future.
“I believe Siena was the moment that the wheels started turning for the both of us, as far as beginning to actually think about what it would mean to pursue a real relationship with one another,” Dan says.
For Gabriella, the years apart, the unexpected reunion, and the fact the connection was still there gave her the confidence to embrace her feelings for Dan.
“I do think we both needed those few more years of growth to truly find each other,” she says.

A couple of months later, Gabriella planned a trip to the US to visit Dan in Chicago. She intended to stay for almost a month.
“Three, four weeks, something like that – which was a pretty crazy thing to do for a guy that I didn’t know that well,” says Gabriella.
On Gabriella’s first evening, Dan took her out for dinner with his brother Bill and his wife, and his mother.
“It was a bit overwhelming to meet his mom the first night I got there,” says Gabriella.
But despite being tired from the flight, Gabriella felt immediately welcomed by Dan’s family. It was great to see Bill again. It was exciting to be in the US. And Dan held her hand all evening.
The only hiccup during the four-week trip was Gabriella discovering Dan’s cooking ability – or lack thereof.
“I always say that I saved him because he was so deprived, he ate so bad,” says Gabriella, laughing. “He told me, ‘I’m going to take you to have the best breakfast ever.’ And he took me to McDonald’s.”
As an Italian foodie, Gabriella was slightly horrified. But part of her also found it endearing. And over the course of her trip, she taught Dan to cook pasta.
The following year, in 2007, Gabriella returned to the US, taking some time off work to stay with Dan for three months. While she was there, Gabriella studied for a qualification to teach Italian as a foreign language.
By then, Gabriella and Dan were talking about their future and what being together long-term might look like. They didn’t want to date across continents for too long. They talked about Dan moving to Italy, or Gabriella moving to the US.
“It was pretty fast, but at the same time, we knew that it was serious,” says Gabriella.
As Dan was more settled in his job, and owned a house, Gabiella moving to the US felt like the obvious choice.
“He had the more stable life,” says Gabriella.
So she made plans to move, getting a job as an Italian teacher at a language school in the Chicago area. And in November 2007, Dan proposed. The couple were on vacation in the historic town of Galena, Illinois.
“We had a nice, romantic evening at the house that we’re staying at,” recalls Dan. “I felt that was the time and so I proposed to her in Italian. And she said yes.”
Dan and Gabriella had a small wedding ceremony in the US in 2008 and then a big wedding party in 2009 in Italy, at “a beautiful Renaissance villa in the countryside with wonderful frescoes,” called Villa di Corliano, in the Tuscan town of San Giuliano.
Gabriella’s college friends who’d been there when she first met Dan in Scotland came along to celebrate.
“It was a fun reunion,” says Gabriella.
Gabriella and Dan’s wedding celebration was characterized by happy tears.
“When I walked in, we were both crying,” says Gabriella. “Dan cried when he saw me. I was crying the moment I walked in anyway. So it was just really sweet.”
Dan didn’t know much Italian – despite his best efforts to learn. He’d started calling Gabriella “mi amore” – which, as Gabriella pointed out to him, is “grammatically wrong.” But she found it adorable.
“I had that engraved inside my wedding ring,” she says. “And then I call him ‘sweetie.’ So he has ‘sweetie’ inside his ring.”
While Dan struggled with Italian, he wanted Gabriella to hear wedding vows in her first language.
So he wrote down what he wanted to say, translated the phrases into Italian and memorized them.
“It was just very, very sweet,” says Gabriella.
At the wedding, Gabriella and Dan also shared with their guests some additional happy news – Gabriella was pregnant.
“It was cute for us to announce it at the wedding,” says Gabriella.

Newly married, Gabriella and Dan started a new chapter together in the US. They were excited to be together, and thrilled about the upcoming birth of their child.
But for Gabriella, moving abroad was tough.
“I know a lot of people dream of moving to the States, but it wasn’t one of my dreams,” she says. “It was pretty tough because Chicago is a super-duper cold place.”
Gabriella was aware, before she moved, that relocating across the world was a big step. She wanted to be with Dan, but she knew she’d miss Italy and her family and friends.
Before making the decision, Gabriella spoke with her mother, who she figured would be able to empathize with her mixed emotions.
Gabriella’s mother was from Brazil, and her father is from Italy. In the mid-1970s, Gabriella’s mother moved across the globe from Brazil to Italy to be with him. The couple met a few years earlier, when Gabriella’s dad was visiting Rio de Janeiro.
“She showed him around Rio and he said he would come back in two years and marry her,” says Gabriella. “Two years later they were in fact married. I of course don’t know all the details, as a kid I thought it was the most romantic story ever.”
Her parents’ love story meant Gabriella grew up thinking “the idea of someone moving away to be with someone” wasn’t “completely implausible.” But it also meant Gabriella knew some of the challenges of leaving one’s own country behind.
Gabriella’s mother cautioned Gabriella to consider the decision carefully.
“She did say that I had to think about it, because it was a big choice to move.”
But Gabriella’s mother also told her daughter to follow her heart. Her dad agreed.
“They both saw that Dan was special and very committed – the love was showing,” says Gabriella. “They liked him right away.”
As Gabriella and Dan established their family in the US – welcoming their first child in 2009 and their second a few years later – they made regular trips back to Italy to visit whenever they could. Gabriella taught her children Italian, and educated them on their Brazilian heritage.
And while adjusting to cold Chicago was tough, Gabriella credits moving to the US with discovering an unexpected new career.
She’d always loved drawing and doodling, but until she lived in the US, she never considered turning that hobby into a job. Living in Italy, she associated art with “Michelangelo.”
“For good or bad, there’s the weight of Italian history and all the art that came before,” says Gabriella.
Calling herself an artist in Italy felt wrong. But in the US, she found a “different mentality.” To Gabriella, American art and design felt “a lot more innovative.”
So when her kids were little, Gabriella went back to school to study children’s book illustration. Now she draws for a living.

Today, Gabriella and Dan live in Seattle with their two teenage kids. They moved to Seattle a couple of years ago, and realized the landscape reminded them a bit of Scotland, the place where they’d first met and fell in love.
“We were both so drawn to it, because there’s a similarity – not only the weather, it’s kind of rainy, gray – but also the ocean, the rocks, the wilderness,” says Gabriella.
While Gabriella and Dan haven’t returned to Scotland together, they would love to. They want to go to Skye and make it to the top of the Old Man of Storr this time round.
In the meantime, they’ve been focusing on exploring new places together.
“We have that in common that we like to travel a lot, explore new things, new places,” says Gabriella.
While a love of adventure unites them, Gabriella and Dan insist they’re quite different in many other ways. He’s a self-described computer programming “nerd.” She’s passionate about art and music. He’s a romantic. She’s more pragmatic.
But there’s “something deeper that we have in common,” as Gabriella puts it.
“Maybe just our perspective on what is important in life,” says Gabriella. “We both think that our family is the first thing – our kids are the first thing – and not work.”
They support each other through the tough times too, such as when Gabriella’s mother passed away in 2022.
Today, after 15 years of marriage, Gabriella likes to say her relationship with Dan is a “vacation fling gone wrong.”
“Because a vacation fling, it’s supposed to end on vacation,” she says, laughing. “How crazy that is that he’s the guy that I met in Scotland on that trip and we’re married and have kids and we’re happy.”
Dan says if you told 22-year-old him, sitting on the Old Man of Storr next to Gabriella, that he’d end up married to this Italian stranger, he’d have absolutely believed you. He never got over that first meeting.
“I immediately felt that connection,” he says, adding that reuniting with Gabriella and building a life with her feels like “winning the lottery.”
“I feel incredibly lucky to have met Gabi back in 2002 and incredibly lucky that we reconnected again years later,” says Dan. “I would not be who I am today without having had her by my side.”
“I also feel like we were incredibly lucky,” says Gabriella. “I look at my kids and think about all the incredible coincidences that had to happen just for them to be here now and it blows my mind.
“I can’t believe how lucky we have been, but also I think that when you know you know. I’m glad I followed my heart.”"
SPZN96Z76L_PCOB48Z9VKB109I,Kenya court blocks deployment of police officers to Haiti,"By Larry Madowo and Nimi Princewill, CNN","2 minute read Published 8:04 AM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/26/africa/kenyacourt-blocks-deployment-of-police-officers-to-haiti/,"A judge in Kenya has barred the East African nation from deploying 1,000 police officers to Haiti to lead a UN-backed multinational force to restore security in the Caribbean nation.
High Court judge Chacha Mwita ruled on Friday that President William Ruto and his National Security Council do not have the authority to send police officers to Haiti or any other country under Kenyan law.He added that the long-delayed deployment under a deal financed by the United States “contravenes the constitution and the law and is therefore unconstitutional, illegal and invalid.”
In October, the State Department pledged $100 million to support a multinational force in Haiti after the UN Security Council voted to approve it to quell gang violence in the island nation. Kenya volunteered to lead it and got necessary approvals from its cabinet and parliament.
But Kenyan politician Ekuru Aukot led a legal challenge to the planned in deployment in court, terming it unconstitutional. The high court ruling agreed with him.
“There’s no reciprocal arrangement between Kenya and Haiti and there can be no legitimate deployment of police officers to Haiti,” Judge Mwita said when he read his ruling in Nairobi.
The ruling poses a potential setback for Kenya’s peacekeeping mission to the Caribbean nation having previously supported similar initiatives by the UN and the African Union.

It is not immediately clear whether the Kenyan government would appeal the ruling or the extent to which the domestic legal battle could complicate the deployment of the multinational force to Haiti, which it spearheads alongside Haiti’s neighbors – Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, and Jamaica.
Kenya’s UN representative Martin Kimani told the Security Council Thursday that his country “has made substantial progress … including taking legal, administrative steps” in its preparation for the Haiti mission and was awaiting the outomce of today’s ruling. Kimani has yet to react to the verdict.
Gang violence rose by more than 100% in Haiti last year with over 8000 victims documented, according to UN data.
“The Haitian people have had enough of the armed gangs’ savagery,” Haiti’s foreign minister Jean Victor Geneus told the UN council while urging a speedy deployment of the multinational force.
“Every passing day that this long-awaited support has not yet arrived is one day too many,” he added."
SR07TSQYFK_KO1Z1Y6OXX7VLHL,Trump wins New Hampshire Republican primary,"By Eric Bradner and Gregory Krieg, CNN","5 minute read Updated 5:56 AM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/23/politics/trump-new-hampshire-primary/,"Former President Donald Trump won New Hampshire’s Republican presidential primary on Tuesday, defeating former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and moving him closer to a rematch with President Joe Biden this fall.
Trump’s victory, after a big win in the Iowa caucuses, marks the first time in the modern primary era that the same non-incumbent candidate has won both the Iowa and New Hampshire Republican contests. His hold on the GOP further solidified, Trump’s campaign on Tuesday night sent a fundraising text to supporters declaring, “THIS RACE IS OVER!”
It’s a crushing blow to Haley’s 2024 hopes and those of the party’s anti-Trump factions. New Hampshire’s primary electorate is much more moderate than other early voting states, thanks to nearly 40% of the state’s voters being registered as “undeclared” and allowed to participate in the primary of their choosing. Polls consistently showed Haley, who was Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations, performing best among moderate voters and those eager to move on from the former president.

Haley, though, insisted Tuesday night that she plans to stay in the race and delivered, during her concession speech New Hampshire, some of her sharpest lines of attack on Trump since the campaign began nearly a year ago.
“New Hampshire is first in the nation, it is not the last in the nation,” Haley told supporters in Concord. “This race is far from over. There are dozens of states left to go. And the next one is my sweet state of South Carolina.”
Haley is the last candidate standing in the way of Trump’s third consecutive Republican presidential nomination, after entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy dropped out following a disappointing fourth-place finish in the Iowa caucuses and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis exited on Sunday.
She’d sought to portray Trump, who will be 78 by Election Day in November, and Biden, who will be 81, as past their primes and “equally bad.”
In her Tuesday remarks, Haley pinned recent Republican election failures on Trump, while also warning of the potential backlash to his criminal indictments and questioning his mental acuity following an incident in which the former president confused Haley with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
“With Donald Trump, you have one bout of chaos after another,” Haley said. “This court case, that controversy, this tweet, that senior moment. You can’t fix Joe Biden’s chaos with Republican chaos.”
Eight days after a delighted Trump gave a mostly gracious speech following his Iowa caucus victory, a plainly angry and frustrated Trump spent the majority of his New Hampshire speech railing against Haley.
“Who the hell was the impostor that went up on the stage that went before and claimed victory?” Trump said. “She did very poorly actually.”
Trump first responded – in real time as Haley spoke – in a series of social media posts calling her campaign a lost cause and demanding she drop out.
“Haley said she had to WIN in New Hampshire,” Trump wrote. “SHE DIDN’T!!!”
Moments after Haley began her remarks, he continued: “DELUSIONAL!!!” “SHE CAME IN THIRD LAST WEEK!” Trump wrote in a third post.
Outside groups aligned with Haley appear to disagree.
Mark Harris, executive director of the pro-Haley super PAC SFA Fund, told CNN they’re “on to South Carolina” and plan to spend millions on ads, direct mail and more.
“Trump struggled to get 50% in two states,” Harris said, suggesting that the twice-nominated former president is shedding overall support in the race, his third consecutive presidential campaign.
While Haley had a prominent supporter in New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu – as demonstrated by DeSantis’ loss in Iowa despite Gov. Kim Reynolds’ endorsement – there are limits to a popular Republican governor’s influence when stacked up against Trump.
It wasn’t enough to stop Trump from making history by becoming the first non-incumbent Republican in modern presidential politics — since the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary moved to the front of the nominating calendar — to win both states.
The campaign manager for Biden, who spent the day with Vice President Kamala Harris in Manassas, Virginia, rallying to “restore Roe” and codify abortion rights, said in a statement late Tuesday that the Democrat expects Trump to be his opponent in November.
“Tonight’s results confirm Donald Trump has all but locked up the GOP nomination, and the election denying, anti-freedom MAGA movement has completed its takeover of the Republican Party,” Julie Chavez Rodriguez said. “Donald Trump is headed straight into a general election matchup where he’ll face the only person to have ever beaten him at the ballot box: Joe Biden.”
The next contest is in Nevada — but Haley has already ceded that state to Trump. Circumventing the state’s primary, where Haley will on the ballot on February 6, the Nevada GOP opted to award its delegates instead through caucuses that will take place on February 8. Haley chose to file for the primary and not the caucuses, which means Trump is certain to dominate in the delegate-awarding contest.
Her next real shot at Trump would come on February 24, when her home state of South Carolina holds its primary.
The “first in the south” primary has a long history of picking presidential nominees. It’s where Biden cemented his status as the Democratic front-runner in 2020 and where Trump’s win thinned out a still-crowded GOP field in 2016.
Already, Trump has sought to embarrass Haley with a raft of Republican endorsements from her former allies in her home state. Sen. Tim Scott, who Haley appointed to the Senate when she was governor in 2013, and Rep. Nancy Mace, who Haley supported against a Trump-backed challenger in 2022, both endorsed Trump in recent days.
“I have watched the political class line up with Donald Trump. I have fought the political class all my life. You won’t see the political class with me in South Carolina,” Haley said at a Monday campaign stop in Franklin, New Hampshire.

The defendant, Shinji Aoba, was charged with murder and arson after telling police his work had been plagiarized and that he used gasoline to set fire to the studio. He was found guilty by the Kyoto District Court on Thursday.
Dozens of people were inside the three-story building at the time of the blaze, which spread so rapidly that many did not have time to escape, police said at the time. All those who died were employees, with at least 32 others injured.
In his ruling, the court’s presiding Judge Keisuke Masuda called Aoba’s crime “truly atrocious and inhumane.” The victims’ deaths were “too serious and tragic,” Masuda said, describing how flames and smoke engulfed the studio.
“The horror and pain of the victims who died in Studio 1, which turned into a hell in an instant, or who died afterward, is beyond description,” the judge said.
In a 2019 news conference, police said Aoba had unspecified mental health issues.
He pleaded not guilty at the trial, which began last September, with his defense lawyers arguing he had a mental disorder and could not be held criminally responsible.
Prosecutors however called for the death penalty, arguing Aoba was fully competent.
Among industrialized democracies, only Japan and parts of the United States retain capital punishment. Rights group including Amnesty International say international law prohibits using the death penalty against people with mental disabilities.
On Thursday, the judge ruled that Aoba could determine right and wrong at the time of the incident, according to NHK. His capacity for responsibility was “determined to have been neither insane nor mentally incompetent at the time of the crime,” NHK reported.

The fire marked the worst mass killing in Japan since a 2001 arson attack on a building in Tokyo’s Kabukicho district, which killed 44 people. The death toll also surpassed the infamous Tokyo sarin gas attack on a subway in 1995, which killed 13.
The Kyoto attack left fans worldwide grieving the loss of life and a studio that claimed to put its employees first and was a major force in the industry.
Founded in 1981, Kyoto Animation – known as KyoAni – made its name producing high quality animations that draw on both the mystical and the mundane.
Its popular works include animated series “Free!,” manga series “K-On!,” the anime TV adaptation of “the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya” and “Violet Evergarden,” which Netflix picked up in 2018.

SVS7QACTUM_CW6KDJDYXC546XL,Opinion: This is the difference Jon Stewart could make in the 2024 election,Opinion by Dean Obeidallah,"4 minute read Updated 8:05 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/24/opinions/jon-stewart-daily-show-return-trump-obeidallah/,"Editor’s Note: Dean Obeidallah, a former attorney, is the host of SiriusXM radio’s daily program, “The Dean Obeidallah Show.” Follow him on Threads. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.
It only took eight years, but apparently Jon Stewart has finally decided to answer the plea from my May 2016 CNN article titled, “We need Jon Stewart back now!”
At the time, my point was that we desperately needed Stewart back in “The Daily Show” host chair because he was the comedic antidote to then-candidate Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. And after Trump won that election, many — including myself — believed that if only Stewart had not abdicated his late-night show in August 2015, Trump might well have been defeated.
That is why the news that Stewart is returning to “The Daily Show” in February as an executive producer and a host — even if just one day a week in that latter role — is more than the “Moment of Zen” he treated us to on his show for 16 years. It’s truly a moment of celebration.
On a serious note, I don’t actually believe my 2016 article had anything to do with Stewart returning. And no one — not even the award-winning host himself — can save us from Trump or any other societal problem facing our nation today.
I am confident, however, that Stewart’s weekly hosting will bring us much-needed laughs as he points out the absurdity of the words and actions of people in power — including Trump, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene or even President Joe Biden. Stewart — while clearly leaning left on many political issues — had no qualms about directing his comedic barbs at Democrats while hosting “The Daily Show.” And, of course, Stewart also became an insightful critic of the corporate media — much to the chagrin of some cable news outlets. (I’m especially looking at you, Fox News, but who could forget his famous comments on CNN’s Crossfire in 2004, battling with then co-host Tucker Carlson?)

But … and you knew a but was coming … Stewart’s history of effectively ridiculing and taunting Trump is what so many of us will be tuning in for. And if history is any guide, Stewart will get under Trump’s pathetically thin skin, surely causing him to lash out on social media.
That’s how it went before. Just one example came shortly before Trump announced his 2016 run, when Stewart discussed the other GOP presidential candidates. When he got to Trump, Stewart joked, “They’re all very colorful characters, but for me there can only be one F**kface von Clownstick.” Stewart then did an impression of Trump, mercilessly mocking him for saying he had a secret, “foolproof” plan to defeat ISIS.
How did Trump respond? With a series of angry tweets calling Stewart “a wiseguy with no talent,” “the most overrated joke on television” who delivered “dumb clown humor” and more. For a comedian, having a person like Trump respond angrily on social media to your jokes is better than a standing ovation.
Now, however, there’s an added concern that Stewart didn’t have to deal with back in 2015 when he was last hosting “The Daily Show.” If Trump were to win in 2024, he may go beyond simply slamming Stewart on social media and employ the apparatus of government to silence him.
As a reminder, in 2019 as president, Trump threatened “Saturday Night Live” for parodying him by publicly demanding the Federal Communications Commission investigate the iconic comedy show. Trump even bemoaned that there was no form of “retribution” against the show for ridiculing him.

Given Trump has made “retribution” a central theme of his 2024 campaign, even vowing to be a dictator if he wins — but only for “one day” — Stewart has potentially more to lose. But as we’ve seen with his activism, Stewart has not backed down before to a fight with people in power. For example, in 2019 he confronted members of Congress to their faces, slamming them for not helping 9/11 first responders. And in 2022, he again took members of Congress to task for not passing legislation to help veterans who contracted illnesses after being exposed to burn pits during their active service. In both cases, Stewart’s work helped pass the legislation at issue.
As I wrote in 2016 when pleading with Stewart to return to the airwaves, “In what will likely be a truly ugly and stress inducing general election contest,” Stewart would offer “us a much needed comedic cathartic release.” Those words are even more true today given that Trump — or as Stewart called him, “F**kface von Clownstick” — is the likely 2024 GOP presidential nominee. Given what is coming between now and November, we have all earned Stewart back, and at least a few Moments of Zen!"
SW9HNGLLHV_M1C70PIXMUO5AEN,These Ukrainian teenagers sought refuge from war in Israel. Then they were caught up in the horrors of Hamas’ attack,"By Lianne Kolirin, CNN","8 minute read Updated 4:41 AM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/26/middleeast/teenage-refugees-ukraine-israel-intl-cmd-scli/,"It was supposed to be a safe haven – a new life for those seeking refuge from the turbulence of war.
But when tens of thousands of Ukrainians fled to Israel in the wake of Russia’s invasion, they had no idea of what the future would hold.
With men aged 18 to 60 forbidden to leave Ukraine, the refugees were mostly women, children and the elderly. Among them, four courageous teenagers who arrived alone in Israel to start a new life as a result of Moscow’s assault on their homeland on February 24, 2022.
Little more than a year and a half later, these young people found themselves immersed in another conflict, as they study at a boarding school just 8 miles from Gaza.
“The day before was very peaceful,” recalled Artem Karpin, 18, of Hamas’ attack on Israel on October 7. “I remember thinking I wasn’t really ready with my homework and wondering how to postpone my deadlines.”
Karpin lives and studies at Kfar Silver, a youth village near Ashkelon, close to where Hamas militants infiltrated the border that Saturday morning. He is one of about 40 Ukrainian refugees to enrol there since Russia invaded his country.
Run by the global education charity World ORT, the “village” is effectively a sprawling complex for 1,090 children from challenging backgrounds – including 250 boarders.
Originally from the southwestern city of Odesa, Karpin had been visiting relatives in Israel when Russia invaded Ukraine. His father gave him no choice but to stay put.
“I started crying when I began to understand that I’m not going back,” he told CNN at Kfar Silver. “I felt betrayed. I didn’t think it was a wise decision to leave me here.”
Nearly 2,000 miles from his parents, Karpin, then 16, enrolled at Kfar Silver, where he soon began to learn the language, make friends and settle in. That was until life was upended again on October 7.
“That morning we all ran from the dorms to the shelter in the school,” he said. “I was scared but not terrified. I was trying to talk it all through rationally and it really helped.”
Karpin was one of 63 of pupils on site that day, as was 18-year-old Michael Reider.
Originally from Kyiv, Reider arrived in Israel in March 2022 following a gruelling journey from his homeland to Poland, where he spent a week on his own before flying out.
On that “black Shabbat” of October 7, he said: “I woke up and there were a lot of sirens and rockets were flying.

“I had already experienced one invasion and now this was a second one. I don’t know how to explain it – I wasn’t really afraid. I felt kind of angry and like I had the energy to fight.”
Pupils and staff remained in the shelter for hours as the unprecedented terror raged around them.
Amos Gofer, who served in the IDF for 25 years before becoming chief executive of Kfar Silver, told CNN: “During my military service I spent time in Lebanon, Gaza, occupied territories. I saw some stuff but October 7 was the hardest day of my professional life.
“We were terrified. We knew very early that the situation was very bad, that there were a lot of terrorists.”
Friday had marked the end of a week-long religious holiday, so fortunately very few pupils were at school, said Gofer. Most of the Ukrainian students, however, had nowhere else to be.
“I was sure the terrorists were going to come here to kill us,” said Gofer, who keeps the remains of a rocket which exploded on the school grounds on his desk.
“I had three people with personal pistols, which was nothing compared to the heavy ammunition the terrorists had.
“We saw no helicopters, no police, no military – I still don’t understand why it took so long,” said Gofer, referring to widespread reports on October 7 that the army and security forces took hours to react to the incursions.
Gofer told CNN that “thousands of rockets” flew over the village, while fires broke out everywhere around them.
With no response to his repeated calls to the army and emergency services, who were dealing with ongoing attacks in multiple locations, Gofer finally called a bus company manager he knew.
“He told me none of his bus drivers were willing to come… everyone was terrified.”
Two drivers from the bus company eventually volunteered to evacuate the children to another village further north, he added. “They told me if they’re not out of here in two, three minutes they would go without the students.”
Karpin recalled: “We had several minutes to pack our clothes and run for the buses. I got the most essential stuff and that’s it. In an hour or two we were in Netanya.”
Four days later, Karpin’s parents, back in Ukraine, insisted that he leave Israel with other relatives for Europe.
“After three weeks I started to feel that I wanted to return (to Israel),” he said of his time in Greece and Germany. “I missed my studies and my friends. It was getting a little safer in Israel, so I convinced my family I needed to get back.”
In common with some other foreign boarders, 17-year-old Maria, who asked not to give her surname for privacy reasons, was staying with a nearby “host family” because of the religious holiday when Hamas launched its assault on October 7.
“At six in the morning we were all running to the shelter and you could hear sirens,” she said.
Originally from the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, Maria and her younger brother had moved to their father’s home in Kyiv following the Russian invasion. Eventually the two siblings left the country via Moldova and flew to Israel.
“When war broke out in Ukraine it was like life fell apart and this time it was very similar - I had flashbacks,” she said. “I was scared but also thought if I tried to distance myself as much as possible everything would be OK.”
She remained with the family, who live in Ashkelon, for several days before heading north to join the evacuees, including her brother. There they remained until last month when they returned to the school.
“My mum was worried about us,” she said, adding that their mother suggested they return home to Ukraine.
“I told myself I could go back but that I’d be going back to war and I couldn’t possibly know if it’s safer. At the same time, I didn’t want to leave Israel. I thought ‘do I need to flee again to start life again once more?’”
After lengthy family discussions, the siblings decided to stay.

“In some ways I’d rather be here,” said Maria. “I just wish for my family to be brought together again in peace.”
Fellow Ukrainian Sviatoslave Kulyk, 17, told CNN he had “not been afraid at all” about leaving his family for Israel back in 2022.
“I understood that it was better to live in a country with no war,” he said.
That all changed when he woke up at his friend’s house in Ashkelon on October 7.
“I had flashbacks to Ukraine, especially when we watched TV about what was happening,” said Kulyk, who told CNN he had witnessed Russian forces roll into his street from his home in Kharkiv.
“My mum was really afraid of me being in Ashkelon but I was trying to explain that I had a bomb shelter here,” he said, adding that Ukrainian homes are not equipped with so-called safe rooms. All Israeli homes built after 1993 must have such a shelter, designed to protect residents from rocket attacks.
With the village now at “95% operational,” according to Gofer, counsellors, social workers and psychologists are on hand to support pupils as they navigate the mental and emotional fallout of the war.
Kulyk said he feels safe but admitted that “sometimes it’s really hard for me to live in Israel.” However, he added: “I’m not sure I’ll go back to Ukraine. My main goal is to finish school right now.”
In the immediate aftermath of Hamas’ attack “hundreds of terrorists were caught in the area,” said Gofer, who told CNN that around 35 pupils at Kfar Silver had relatives who were murdered or kidnapped.
Many families and staff remain evacuated from their homes, while some teachers are serving in the IDF reserves.
Rockets continue to fly, though less frequently, while some staff – including Gofer – now have access to long-range rifles.

“Everyone’s on high alert,” he said. “People aren’t afraid of sirens – they’re afraid of terrorists.”
And yet the situation has not dented the optimism and determination of these four youngsters.
Both Maria and Kulyk are interested in studying international relations – something they are surely more qualified for than most teenagers.
Reider has other ideas. “When the war started here there was relative silence in Ukraine and my family felt more safe,” he said.
“They were very worried (about me) but I didn’t want to go back. I’m a Jew and Israel is my country. If Israel calls me to the army, I’ll go.” A period of military service is compulsory for most Israelis when they turn 18.
Karpin plans to study electrical engineering in Israel.
“I want to go back home once I have two university degrees so I can work on rebuilding and improving Ukrainian infrastructure and make my country a safe and better place,” he said."
SXOZYDPTZI_0F8LWI8WIKOSLMM,"FTC bans TurboTax from advertising ‘free’ services, calls it deceptive","By Ramishah Maruf, CNN","3 minute read Updated 7:18 PM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/22/business/ftc-turbotax-free-services/,"The Federal Trade Commission ruled in a final order and opinion Monday that TurboTax, the popular tax filing software, engaged in deceptive advertising and banned the company from advertising its services for free unless it is free for all customers.
By running ads for “free” tax services that many customers were not qualified for, the tax filing software violated the FTC Act and deceived consumers, the agency said.
The FTC had first sued Intuit, TurboTax’s owner, for its deceptive advertising in 2022. The FTC staff alleged most tax filers couldn’t use the company’s “free” services — “such as those who get a 1099 form for work in the gig economy, or those who earn farm income.” TurboTax advertising their products as free misled those customers, according to the FTC.
The FTC Administrative Law Judge D. Michael Chappell announced the initial decision in September, which the commission upheld Monday. Intuit had appealed to the FTC as part of the process.
In a statement Monday, Intuit said it has appealed “this deeply flawed decision” to federal circuit court outside of the FTC.
“Absolutely no one should be surprised that FTC Commissioners — employees of the FTC — ruled in favor of the FTC as they have done in every appeal for the last two decades. This decision is the result of a biased and broken system where the Commission serves as accuser, judge, jury, and then appellate judge all in the same case,” an an Intuit spokesperson said.
Intuit cannot advertise or market any goods or services as free unless it’s free for all customers, the FTC ordered.
It could also clearly disclose the percentage of customers that actually do qualify for the free service, somewhere close to the “free” claim advertised, the commission said. The FTC added if the service isn’t actually free for the majority of consumers, TurboTax could state that as well.
The FTC ordered Intuit to “disclose clearly and conspicuously all the terms, conditions, and obligations that are required in order to obtain the ‘free’ good or service.”
“The order also prohibits Intuit from misrepresenting any material facts about its products or services such as the price, refund policies or consumers’ ability to claim a tax credit or deduction or to file their taxes online accurately without using TurboTax’s paid service,” the release from the FTC said.
Last May, roughly 4.4 million people were to receive checks from TurboTax, following a 50-state settlement with parent company Intuit for allegedly steering millions of low-income Americans away from free tax-filing services.
The investigation opened after a 2019 ProPublica report that accused the company of steering eligible clients away from federally supported tax filing products by making them difficult to find in web searches — instead directing them toward the paid version of the company’s filing services.
Most customers will get about $30, with some customers that used TurboTax for three consecutive years getting up to $85. A website has also been set up for more information.
“TurboTax’s predatory and deceptive marketing cheated millions of low-income Americans who were trying to fulfill their legal duties to file their taxes,” said New York Attorney General Letitia James in a May 4, 2023, press release. “Today we are righting that wrong and putting money back into the pockets of hardworking taxpayers who should have never paid to file their taxes.”

T1DKJR3NZF_VBP3UCCCGND19JH,Larry Summers blasts Harvard over antisemitism: ‘I have lost confidence’,"By Matt Egan, CNN","5 minute read Updated 1:46 PM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240122,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/22/business/larry-summers-harvard-antisemitism/,"Famed economist Larry Summers slammed Harvard’s top leaders  on Sunday over concerns about how the Ivy League school is fighting antisemitism.
Summers, a former president of Harvard, strongly criticized the selection of Harvard professor Derek Penslar as the co-chair of a newly-formed presidential task force on antisemitism.
“I have lost confidence in the determination and ability of the Harvard Corporation and Harvard leadership to maintain Harvard as a place where Jews and Israelis can flourish,” Summers said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.
The backlash underscores how Harvard remains under close scrutiny even after the resignation earlier this month of Claudine Gay as university president. Lawmakers and federal officials are investigating Harvard’s handling of antisemitism on campus and a House panel is probing how the school handled the plagiarism allegations surrounding Gay.

Even efforts to fight antisemitism are creating controversy.
Summers, a former top adviser to Presidents Clinton and Obama, argued that Penslar is “unsuited” to co-chair the task force because he has “publicly minimized” Harvard’s antisemitism problem.
“Could one imagine Harvard appointing as head of anti-racism task force someone who had minimized the racism problem or who had argued against federal anti-racism efforts?” Summers said.
Earlier this month, Penslar suggested the problem of antisemitism at Harvard may have been exaggerated by “outsiders.”
“Yes, we have a problem with antisemitism at Harvard, just like we have a problem with Islamophobia and how students converse with each other,” Penslar told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. “The problems are real. But outsiders took a very real problem and proceeded to exaggerate its scope.”
In December, Penslar wrote an op-ed in The Crimson calling for a rethink of definitions of antisemitism that include criticism of Israel.
Before the October 7 Hamas attacks on Israel, Penslar was also one of many academics who signed an open letter arguing that Israel’s “long-standing occupation” of Gaza has “yielded a regime of apartheid.” That same letter, titled “The Elephant in the Room,” stated that the ultimate purpose of the controversial judicial overhaul is to “ethnically cleanse all territories under Israeli rule of their Palestinian population.”
Although Summers said Penslar is a “person of good will without a trace of personal” antisemitism, the economist still called for him to step aside as co-chair of the task force.
Hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman, a frequent critic of Harvard leaders, responded to the appointment of Penslar by posting on X: “Harvard continues on the path of darkness.”
Penslar, a professor of Jewish history, referred questions from CNN to Harvard’s media office.
Harvard representatives declined to comment.
The American Academy for Jewish Research, which describes itself as the “oldest organization of Jewish studies in North America”, issued a statement on Sunday defending Penslar, who previously led the group.
“Professor Penslar is a prolific scholar with a stellar international reputation,” the group said. “It is precisely this kind of expertise that is needed in the current moment.”
The American Academy for Jewish Research added that it was “dismayed by the attacks being leveled against Penslar’s scholarship and his commitment to the task force’s work.”
Two Harvard professors, Alison Frank Johnson and Steven Levitsky, penned an op-ed in the Crimson on Monday defending Penslar as the “right choice” and arguing his “academic credentials stnd out even by Harvard’s standards.”
“Unfortunately, the leadership of the antisemitism task force was immediately attacked by outside political forces,” they wrote, “threatening to undermine its work before it even begins.”
Alan Garber, Harvard’s interim president, unveiled a pair of presidential task forces on Friday designed to fight both antisemitism and Islamophobia. The task forces will be charged with examining bias, determining root causes and compiling recommendations to combat hate.
“Reports of antisemitic and Islamophobic acts on our campus have grown, and the sense of belonging among these groups has been undermined,” Garber said in the announcement. “We need to understand why and how that is happening—and what more we might do to prevent it.”

Notably, Summers directly criticized the Harvard Corporation, the secretive yet powerful board that runs the university.
The Corporation, run by billionaire former Obama Cabinet secretary Penny Pritzker, has faced scrutiny for how it handled the crisis at the school.
Summers said he hopes “Harvard’s leadership will recognize that they have exacerbated Harvard’s credibility problems on anti-Semitism with the Penslar appointment and take steps to retore their credibility.”
The former Harvard president noted that amid the turmoil, the school’s early admissions applications tumbled through November 1.
“As things currently stand, I am unable to reassure Harvard community members, those we are recruiting or prospective students that Harvard is making progress in countering anti-Semitism,” Summers said.
Harvard officials recently met with executives from social media app Sidechat to discuss concerning content on the platform that allows users to make anonymous posts.
The meeting comes amid concerns about a spike in antisemitic messages on Sidechat, which is popular among college students.
A Harvard spokesperson confirmed to CNN on Monday that the university has “taken steps to address the concerning content,” including by meeting with Sidechat leaders.
Harvard received “reassurances that content will be moderated according to their terms of use and community guidelines, and that membership in the Harvard community space will be strictly limited to current College students,” the spokesperson said.
Harvard has also forwarded a sample of content to the university’s police department to determine whether the posts warrant law enforcement action, the spokesperson said, adding that going forward concerning content will be escalated directly to Sidechat leaders.
The Harvard Crimson previously reported on the university’s interface with Sidechat. Executives from Sidechat did not respond to requests for comment from CNN.
Sidechat is a social media platform that allows students to log in with their university email addresses to make anonymous posts. It has in the past been hailed as a way for students to combat mental health struggles, giving them an outlet to vent about struggles they may not want their Instagram followers to know about.
However, some students have described a surge in antisemitic posts on Sidechat recently.
A lawsuit filed against Harvard earlier this month by Jewish students over alleged antisemitism on campus stated that after Claudine Gay resigned as president “antisemitic messages were plastered all over Harvard’s community group” on Sidechat.
That lawsuit listed multiple examples, including one message on Sidechat that said: “All you Zionists are the same. Killers and rapists of children!”
Another message, according to the lawsuit, expressed support for Hamas and for the October 7th attack as “a moment of decolonization.”
“The antisemitism on Sidechat is appalling,” Jacob Miller, who chairs the Crimson’s editorial board and previously served as president of the Harvard Hillel, said in a post on X."
T2DRGCKSYF_7Q4NF5XBQ30AW63,China takes delivery of Boeing 737 Max in show of support for troubled plane maker,"By Xiaofei Xu and Chris Isidore, CNN","2 minute read Published 10:10 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/25/business/china-boeing-737-max-delivery-hnk-intl/,"Boeing has delivered its first 737 Max to a Chinese airline for the first time in nearly five years, according to flight data, in a rare spot of good news for the embattled company.
The delivery is seen as an important affirmation from a key market for the plane maker, whose reputation for safety and quality in its commercial jets was dealt a massive blow following a terrifying accident aboard a 10-week-old 737 Max 9 flight on January 5.
According to flight tracking website Flightradar 24, China Southern Airlines flight CZ5073 departed from Boeing Field in Seattle, Washington, on Wednesday for China via Honolulu. The use of the airline’s flight number, instead of a Boeing one, suggests the ownership of the plane has already been transferred.
Boeing (BA) declined to comment on the apparent delivery.
The plane, a 737 Max 8 according to flight data, was built in September 2019 and has been parked in Boeing’s Seattle factory since then, according to flight tracking sites Flightradar 24 and Aviation Flights.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grounded the aircraft in March 2019 after 346 people died in two separate fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia. It was discovered that a safety feature meant to stop the plane from climbing too fast and stalling had improperly forced the nose of the plane down, causing the crashes, as CNN reported previously.
Chinese aviation authorities instructed its airlines in March 2019 to ground all their 737 Max 8 aircraft, citing the need for “strict control of safety risks.” That ban was lifted in 2021, following the model’s clearance by the FAA, but there haven’t been any new deliveries of the model to China until now.
In December, the trade publication the Air Current said Boeing had won a key clearance from China’s aviation regulator, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), allowing Boeing to prepare Max aircraft for delivery, Reuters reported."
T3XNNLLKM9_MDMHJJEPAY50HHG,Efforts to secure hostage deal and pause in Gaza fighting step up as Biden dispatches CIA chief for crucial talks in Europe,"By Kevin Liptak, Alex Marquardt and Becky Anderson, CNN","6 minute read Updated 10:30 PM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/26/politics/israel-hamas-hostage-talks-bill-burns-europe/,"Efforts to secure the release of hostages held in Gaza and broker a prolonged pause in fighting are at an important juncture as President Joe Biden deploys his point person on hostage talks to Europe for multiparty talks on the contours of a possible agreement.
CIA Director Bill Burns’ meetings over the coming days with the Israeli and Egyptian intelligence chiefs and the Qatari prime minister are a sign of ongoing progress as the White House presses for a deal.
Whether they prove decisive in striking an agreement remains to be seen, and officials voiced caution that discussions so far have been volatile, and that hurdles remain in coming to a deal that all sides can agree on.
Among the central sticking points: Israel has been adamant that it cannot agree to a permanent ceasefire in Gaza, which has been a key demand of Hamas. It’s unclear how that major difference would be resolved.
Still, progress has been made on the parameters of a hostage deal that would occur in three stages, and include the release of civilians, soldiers and the bodies of those hostages who have died while being held in captivity.
Burns’s meetings with Mossad director David Barnea, Egyptian intelligence director Abbas Kamel and Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani are expected to take place in France over the weekend, according to two sources familiar. The CIA declined to comment on his travel.
Burns and Barnea were central to a November agreement that resulted in a week-long pause in fighting in exchange for the release of more than 100 hostages.
The talks are the latest in a spate of recent diplomatic efforts to free the more than 100 remaining hostages while moving toward a more prolonged cessation of hostilities.  The flurry of activity amounts to the most intensive effort in months to strike an agreement that could significantly alter the trajectory of the war in Gaza.
Speaking from the White House on Friday afternoon, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby described the ongoing talks as productive but not yet reaching the point of success.
“We’re hopeful about the progress, but I do not expect – we should not expect – any imminent developments,” Kirby said.
He said on Friday, Biden had spoken to Egypt’s President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi as well as Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani to discuss ongoing hostage talks.
“We continue to do everything we can to facilitate another hostage deal just like we did back in November,” Kirby said.
A readout from the White House Friday said that Biden and Al Thani “affirmed that a hostage deal is central to establishing a prolonged humanitarian pause in the fighting and ensure additional life-saving humanitarian assistance reaches civilians in need throughout Gaza.”
Both leaders “underscored the urgency of the situation” in their conversation, the readout noted.
Kirby also said Brett McGurk, the White House coordinator for the Middle East, was returning to Washington on Friday from meetings in the region.
He described those talks as a “good set of discussions.”
“At every level, from the president right on down, we’re doing everything we can to bring these moms and dads, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters back home to their families,” Kirby said. “Our thoughts remain with them, of course their loved ones, as well as all of the innocent Palestinians that continue to be caught up in this war.”
Qatar’s prime minister is expected to travel to Washington next week, a diplomatic source told CNN. Qatar has acted as a key broker in talks with Hamas.
US officials are now hopeful for a much longer cessation in the fighting, believing it could provide space for more humanitarian aid to flow into Gaza as well as continued discussions about the future of Israel’s campaign against Hamas and the future of Gaza.
Qatar, Egypt and the US have been working toward trying to find common ground in proposals that were put forward several weeks ago by both Hamas and Israel, according to an official familiar with the ongoing discussions. In the past week, Qatar sent back ideas to each of them, including a time frame of a two-month ceasefire that would see hostages released in phases.
First to be released would be the remaining women, children and the elderly, followed by another phase that would include Israeli soldiers and the bodies of dead hostages.
In exchange, Palestinians held in Israeli jails would be released in around a three-for-one exchange, akin to the deal struck last year, a second source familiar with the matter said, who said the process would take around a month.
Each stage would come with a pause in fighting and the delivery of aid to the North and South of Gaza.
The major sticking point for Hamas has been Israel’s refusal to discuss an end to the war past a temporary ceasefire. Israel’s focus, the official said, has been to try to discuss one phase at a time – with accompanying pauses and prisoner releases - while Hamas has pushed for a comprehensive plan that would include Israel agreeing to end the war against Hamas.
As part of proposals currently being discussed, the end of the hostage release process would come with a permanent ceasefire, a step Israel has been unwilling to agree to.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his defense minister, Yoav Gallant, have said the war may continue for the rest of the year, if not into 2025. And Netanyahu has been increasingly public in his rejections of a Palestinian state, a priority item for Biden and the US.
The Biden administration has been openly pressuring Israel to transition to a lower-intensity phase of operations, including in telephone calls between Biden and Netanyahu.
Aside from the Biden administration’s own interest in seeing a half dozen Israeli-American hostages released, US officials see a ceasefire deal and hostage release as the key to getting to a significant pause in the fighting that will help the flow of humanitarian aid and allow Palestinians to return to their homes, many of which have been destroyed.
But with two key parties who have their own priorities, in addition to at least three main mediators, there is a complex array of ideas, proposals and initiatives being put forward.
“These things are very fluid, they change every single minute,” the official said.
Whether all parties can reach an agreement remains to be seen, and the talks will occur against the backdrop of renewed tensions between Israel and Qatar, sparked by leaked recording purported to be Netanyahu criticizing the Gulf state.
Burns and McGurk’s discussions with regional players come amid tensions between Israel and Qatar over a leaked recording said to be of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticizing Qatar.
On the recording, which aired on Israeli television, a voice purportedly Netanyahu’s describes Qatar as “problematic.” The speaker also says he is “very mad at the Americans” for renewing a lease on their military base in Qatar without extracting a concession on hostages from the country. CNN cannot verify that the voice on the leaked recording belongs to Benjamin Netanyahu.
Responding to the tape, Qatar said Netanyahu was undermining mediation efforts in the Israel-Hamas war.
The White House on Thursday reiterated its gratitude for Qatar — which has acted as a key mediator in hostage talks — in response to the leaked recording.
“Qatar is a key partner in the region. We’re grateful for their support of our continued efforts to try to get hostages out of Gaza and reunited with their families,” Kirby said in a statement Thursday evening.

Back in 2019, the Paris Criminal Court convicted Ian Bailey in absentia of the murder of TV producer Sophie Toscan du Plantier and sentenced him to 25 years’ imprisonment.
Bailey, a former journalist, had denied involvement in the murder, which has been the subject of a popular podcast series and two TV documentaries, including one on Netflix.
On December 23, 1996, 39-year-old Toscan du Plantier was found bludgeoned to death near the gate of her vacation home near Toormore, in Ireland’s West Cork region. Police found some 50 wounds on her body.
The case was widely publicized as the victim had been married to Daniel Toscan du Plantier, a well-known French film producer.
Days after the murder, local police began questioning Bailey, who lived nearby and had been tasked with reporting on the killing for a national paper. He was arrested twice: first in February 1997 and then in January 1998.
No forensic evidence linked Bailey to the scene of the crime, and he was released without charge. He spent years denying any involvement in the murder.
News of Bailey’s death emerged on Sunday, when his lawyer made a statement to the PA Media news agency.
Frank Buttimer, who had known Bailey since March 1997, said his client had a severe heart condition.

He told PA: “I knew Ian was very unwell, we were in communication in the past five days, but I didn’t know he was terminally unwell.
“He had a very severe heart condition, a very bad heart condition, and had cardiac events prior to Christmas.
“He was a candidate for surgical intervention but wasn’t well enough, so he was trying to become well enough.”
No one else has ever been charged over Toscan du Plantier’s death and her family had long pushed for Bailey to be brought to trial in France.
Under French law, authorities can investigate crimes against French citizens committed outside of its borders, although they cannot insist that witnesses travel for questioning.
Toscan du Plantier’s family responded to the news of Bailey’s death in a statement sent to CNN.
A press release from the group known as The Association for the Truth About the Murder of Sophie Toscan du Plantier said Bailey’s death means they “will never be able to obtain a confession.”
It said that, over the years, “Bailey refused to answer the questions of French investigators, entangling himself in lies and contradictions. Provoking and taunting the police, the judiciary, and the media, Ian Bailey always avoided telling the truth about this murder, of which, beyond any reasonable doubt, he knew every detail.”

The statement continued: “An investigation is underway in Ireland, and we are confident that the discovery of new elements, the hearing of new witnesses, and the revelation of possible complicity will enable Irish police to close the case, 27 years after the murder.”
At the time of the Paris trial, Buttimer told CNN that the murder conviction  was a “grotesque miscarriage of justice.”
Despite insisting on his innocence, many locals said Bailey’s actions over the years created a cloud of suspicion, which continued to follow him around in West Cork for more than two decades.
Weeks after the murder, Bailey’s editor at the now defunct Sunday Tribune told police that he told her that he killed Toscan du Plantier to resurrect his career. According to police documents, Bailey admitted making the comment but said it was a joke.
In the years following his arrests, Bailey alleged he was wrongfully arrested and a victim of police corruption. In 2015, he lost a civil action in the High Court on those claims. A subsequent review by the Irish policing watchdog found problems in the way that Bailey’s arrest was handled, but concluded in 2018 that there was no evidence of police corruption.
No one else has ever been charged with the murder.

Red flags about Trump’s mental fitness can’t be ignored,Opinion by Dean Obeidallah,"6 minute read Published 6:49 PM EST, Sun January 21, 2024",20240122,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/21/opinions/nikki-haley-trump-mental-fitness-obeidallah/,"Editor’s Note: Dean Obeidallah, a former attorney, is the host of SiriusXM radio’s daily program “The Dean Obeidallah Show.” Follow him on Threads. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.
GOP presidential candidate Nikki Haley raised an important issue Saturday about former President Donald Trump that demands far more media attention. After an alarming series of recent verbal missteps by Trump, Haley questioned whether he is “mentally fit” to serve in the White House.
Haley — who is challenging Trump for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination — raised questions about Trump’s mental acuity, pointing to a major slip-up he made related to the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol in which he appeared to confuse her with Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic former speaker of the House.
At the Trump event on Friday, Trump told the audience, “By the way, they never report the crowd on January 6. You know, Nikki Haley, Nikki Haley, Nikki Haley … did you know they destroyed all of the information, all of the evidence, everything, deleted and destroyed all of it?”
He added: “All of it, because of lots of things, like Nikki Haley is in charge of security, we offered her 10,000 people, soldiers, national guards, whatever they want. They turned it down.”
The 77-year-old Trump then repeated the glaring error, stating, “Nikki Haley is in charge of security. We offered her 10,000 people, soldiers, national guards, whatever they want. They turned it down.”
Back in the real world, Haley — a Republican former governor of South Carolina who served as Trump’s UN ambassador from 2017-2018 and who did not hold public office on January 6, 2021 — had nothing to do with security at the Capitol that day. Yet Trump invoked her name multiple times during that speech. That’s why Haley spoke at length the following day expressing doubts regarding Trump’s mental fitness.
“Last night, Trump is at a rally and he’s going on and on, mentioning me several times as to why I didn’t take security during the Capitol riots. Why I didn’t handle January 6 better. I wasn’t even in DC on January 6. I wasn’t in office then,” Haley said. “They’re saying he got confused. That he was talking about something else. That he was talking about Nancy Pelosi. He mentioned me multiple times in that scenario.”
Haley told the crowd that the confusion by the president is beyond worrisome. “The concern I have is — I’m not saying anything derogatory — but when you’re dealing with the pressures of a presidency, we can’t have someone else that we question whether they’re mentally fit to do it.”

As controversy over his misstatements swirled, Trump later Saturday boasted about his cognitive abilities, saying, “A few months ago I took a cognitive test my doctor gave me … and I aced it.”
He continued: “I’ll let you know when I go bad; I really think I’ll be able to tell you. Because someday we go bad,” he said at a campaign event in Manchester, New Hampshire. “I feel my mind is stronger now than it was 25 years ago.”
Meanwhile, a senior Trump campaign adviser, Chris LaCivita, glossed over the error on Saturday, posting on X, “Nancy … Nikki … its a distinction without a difference.”
In truth, the differences between Haley and Pelosi are substantial and the two prominent politicians are hard to mix up — starting with the fact Pelosi is a frequent Trump antagonist who served as Democratic speaker of the House, while Haley is a Republican who once served in Trump’s own administration.
Trump’s often cited claim that Pelosi oversaw January 6 security is a lie that has been fact checked numerous times. This raises another valid question about Trump’s mental state: Is he knowingly lying, or does he sincerely believe facts that are detached from reality?
Haley is 100% correct to raise red flags about Trump’s cognitive abilities. The president of the United States must be mentally fit to do the job. To be clear, Haley also raised questions during her campaign event about President Joe Biden’s potential cognitive issues. But to be blunt, those issues — as well as concerns about Biden’s age — have been litigated extensively in the media, which allows voters to make up their own minds on the subject.

By contrast, Trump — who will turn 78 in June — has been subjected to much less scrutiny about his mental acuity, despite a series of mental gaffes that led conservative television host Megyn Kelly to raise alarm bells last month.
Speaking on conservative pundit Glenn Beck’s radio show, the former Fox News anchor said of the former president ,“There’s no question that Trump has lost a step or multiple steps.” Kelly cited a number of errors by Trump, including instances when he claimed to have defeated former President Barack Obama at the ballot box and when he said he’s currently running against Obama.
Trump, Kelly remarked, “is confusing Joe Biden for Obama. I know he’s now saying he intentionally did that — go back and look at the clips, it wasn’t intentional.”
Kelly is correct about Trump’s long and growing list of mental glitches. For example, in October, he misstated what country his longtime ally Viktor Orban — the prime minister of Hungary — is the ruler of, wrongly telling voters that Orban was the leader of Turkey.
That same month, Trump greeted a crowd of supporters with the words, “Hello, to a place where we’ve done very well, Sioux Falls! Thank you very much.” In reality, Trump was in Sioux City, Iowa — not in Sioux Falls, a city in South Dakota — prompting a local elected official to whisper in his ear where he actually was at the time so that he could clean up his remarks.
And the list goes on.
This is not the first time one of his opponents for the GOP presidential nomination has raised the issue of Trump’s mental sharpness. In November, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’s campaign posted on social media a thread of more than two dozen confusing remarks Trump had made, claiming this was the reason “why his handlers won’t let him debate.”

But given the fact that Trump handily won last week’s Iowa GOP caucus and is well positioned to wrap up the GOP presidential nomination shortly, it’s imperative that the media robustly cover the issue, so that GOP voters can be fully informed about the mental fitness of the person they may nominate to be president. This is especially true for conservative media outlets, since that is where Republican voters are likely gathering their information.
True, these conservative media outlets may be reticent to cover negative stories about Trump out of fear of potentially upsetting their viewers. But this is an issue that transcends partisan lines.
If there’s anything that ought to outweigh party identity, it’s our collective concern about the potential threat posed to our nation by a future president who might not be up to doing the job mentally of being commander in chief."
T57DNPW9XO_2CT4J9581AIZT9T,Royal Mail is on the brink. Cutting letter deliveries to 3 days a week could save it,"By Anna Cooban, CNN","3 minute read Published 10:45 AM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20230124,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/24/business/royal-mail-cut-letter-delivery/,"Royal Mail could ditch its near-daily deliveries of letters as the centuries-old British institution attempts to modernize its service and plug a growing hole in its finances.
Ofcom, the UK regulator overseeing the postal service, published proposals to rescue the beleaguered company Wednesday. It said Royal Mail could save as much as £650 million ($828 million) a year if it cut letter deliveries to three days a week from the current six.
The company’s business model is “getting out of date” and risks becoming “unsustainable” as people send fewer letters and receive more parcels, Ofcom said.
The number of letters sent via the Royal Mail network had halved since 2011, and financial losses have ballooned.
Among its other proposals, Ofcom suggested that Royal Mail could save up to £200 million ($255 million) a year by cutting its letter deliveries down to five days a week, or by extending the time it takes to get mail to customers.
“Something’s got to give, or the service is going to be too costly, and either stamp prices will go up or it will become unsustainable,” Melanie Dawes, Ofcom’s chief executive, said in an interview with the BBC Wednesday.

Any changes to Royal Mail’s Monday-Saturday letter delivery schedule would need to be approved by lawmakers because the company’s service obligations are set out in legislation. It delivers parcels five days a week, Monday to Friday.
Kevin Hollinrake, the United Kingdom’s postal services minister, told the BBC Wednesday that it was important to maintain a six-day service, and that Saturday deliveries were “sacrosanct,” in part, because many businesses, such as those producing magazines and greeting cards, required deliveries over the weekend.
Ofcom said Royal Mail was not currently providing a “reliable service” and change was urgently needed, a view shared by the company’s parent — International Distribution Services (IDS).
“It is not sustainable to maintain a network built for 20 billion letters when we are now only delivering 7 billion,” IDS CEO Martin Seidenberg told CNN in a statement.
The regulator fined the company, which was owned by the UK government until its privatization around a decade ago, £5.6 million ($7 million) last year for failing to deliver mail on time.
At the time, Ofcom said the pandemic had significantly hampered Royal Mail’s operations, but that the firm could “no longer use that as an excuse” for poor performance.
Royal Mail reported an operating loss of £319 million ($407 million) in the six months to the end of September, up 46% from the loss it recorded during the same period a year earlier. Its parent company, International Distribution Services, said low revenues and the cost of a pay deal agreed with a major postal workers’ union were behind the loss.
Ofcom said its proposals were meant to start a “national discussion” about the future of Royal Mail — an institution that is more than 500 years old — and that it would hold events in the next few months with individuals and businesses to ask for feedback."

T6T20XQYJM_BHJBW3FYRMLSWT3,Government warns funeral homes to stop misleading bereaved customers about pricing,"By Ramishah Maruf, CNN","2 minute read Updated 6:14 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/25/business/government-warns-funeral-homes-on-pricing/,"A government agency warned 39 funeral homes across the US that they risk hefty penalties if they fail to disclose accurate pricing information to customers, the Federal Trade Commission announced Thursday.
The FTC conducted an undercover phone sweep of more than 250 funeral homes, placing calls to obtain pricing information. For 38 calls, the agency said the funeral homes either refused to answer questions about pricing or gave inconsistent information about identical services.
Funeral homes have to follow the FTC’s “Funeral Rule,” which provides bereaved consumers rights during the process and holds the business  to strict requirements. One of the caveats is that funeral homes must give customers a general price list, and customers have the right to choose which services they want.
Funerals can be a major financial burden for families, and they are getting more expensive. The median cost of a funeral is $7,848 and the median cost of a funeral with cremation is approximately $6,971, according to the National Funeral Directors Association. Funeral prices rose 4.7% between December 2022 and December 2023, according to CPI data.
“Telephone inquiries are particularly important for people who are grieving a loss or making arrangements for a loved one in a different city. That’s why the Funeral Rule requires funeral homes to provide accurate price information over the phone,” Lesley Fair, a senior attorney with the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, wrote in an online post.
On one call, the funeral home said local health code required the body to be embalmed, the process of preserving a body after death. Most states’ health code, including that one, actually do not require embalming, the FTC said, and most states that do only require it in certain circumstances.
Yet another funeral home promised to send a general pricing list but instead sent a list of package prices. That broke the requirements, the FTC alleged.
The agency listed the funeral homes it sent warning letters to on its site, the locations ranging from Laredo, Texas, to Philadelphia. Funeral homes that don’t comply could pay up to $51,744 per violation."
TC8FGTXCIE_C3FH1H2GL9EM146,Who invented butter chicken? Indian judge to rule on dispute over global favorite,Story by Reuters,"2 minute read Published 9:42 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/travel/butter-chicken-inventor-india-dispute/,"Butter chicken – one of India’s best-known dishes globally – is delicious and apparently also contentious, with two Indian restaurant chains doing battle in court over claims to its origins.
The lawsuit – which has become a hot topic in India – was brought by the family behind Moti Mahal, a famed Delhi restaurant brand that has counted late US President Richard Nixon and India’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru among its guests.
It claims restaurant founder, Kundan Lal Gujral, created the curry in the 1930s when the restaurant first opened in Peshawar before it moved to Delhi. In a 2,752-page court filing it has sued rival chain Daryaganj, accusing it of falsely claiming to have invented the dish as well as dal makhani, a popular lentil dish that is also laden with butter and cream.
The Gujral family is seeking $240,000 in damages, also alleging that Daryaganj has copied the layout of Moti Mahal’s website and “the look and feel” of its restaurants.
“You cannot take away somebody’s legacy … The dish was invented when our grandfather was in Pakistan,” said Monish Gujral, managing director at Moti Mahal.

Daryaganj – which was established relatively recently in 2019 – counters that its late family member, Kundan Lal Jaggi, had partnered with Gujral to open the Delhi restaurant in 1947, and the dish was invented there. That gives it the right to also lay claim to the creation of the dish, it argues.
Daryaganj shared with Reuters a faded, hand-written partnership document registered in 1949 to back its argument.
The dispute has captured the nation’s attention with Indian TV broadcasters running segments on the history of the dish and debate raging on social media.
“It’s an offbeat, unique case. You really don’t know who created the first dish of butter chicken. The court will be hard pressed and will need to rely on circumstantial evidence,” said Ameet Datta, an intellectual property lawyer at India’s Saikrishna & Associates.
Testimonies of people who can link the brand to the dish they consumed decades ago could be critical proof, Datta added.
Made with tandoor-cooked chicken pieces mixed in a tomato gravy with dollops of cream and butter, the dish was ranked 43rd in a list of world’s “best dishes” by TasteAtlas as rated by nearly 400,000 users.
It was the second-ranked Indian food after butter garlic naan bread. The two are often paired together.
The case was first heard by the Delhi High Court last week and the next hearing is scheduled for May."

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’s exit from the Republican nomination fight Sunday gives his former rival, former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley, the one-on-one shot against former President Donald Trump she claimed to crave from the stage following the Iowa caucuses last week. But the former South Carolina governor is only likely to be hurt by the nomination race moving in that direction.
DeSantis’s supporters, limited though they were, comprise one more group of voters from which Trump can add to his already healthy lead over Haley. And DeSantis himself is no longer around as a political deflector shield as Haley heads into Tuesday’s crucial New Hampshire primary.
A CNN poll released Sunday, before DeSantis withdrew from the race, found he was the first choice of 6% of likely New Hampshire GOP primary voters. That put him far behind in the poll, conducted by the University of New Hampshire, with 50% of likely New Hampshire GOP primary voters backing Trump and Haley garnering 39%.
When DeSantis’s supporters were reallocated to their second-choice candidate, however, Haley’s support widened slightly, to 41%. But Trump’s support ticked up to 54%. Another 3% of likely GOP primary voters said they’d vote for someone else.
This isn’t particularly surprising, since the whole concept of DeSantis’s campaign was being a Trump mini-me. In Florida, he picked culture issue fights over the content of social studies textbooks, played up Covid-19 pandemic issues and tangled with the state’s largest employer, Disney, among other actions that were likely to play well with the populist right.

In his GOP nomination bid, DeSantis — who endorsed Trump on Sunday — even tried to chastise the former president from the right for his administration’s supposedly insufficient results in converting MAGA policy proposals into law.
But Haley was eager to show that DeSantis, who was only able to eke out a second-place showing in Iowa despite camping out in the state and at one point leading Trump in the polls, was flagging at the same time she was rising. She seemed to think this would give her more momentum and credibility as the race turned to friendlier territory in New Hampshire.
The make-up of New Hampshire’s Republican primary electorate and Haley’s stronger showing in the polls there also likely factored into Haley’s possible miscalculation. Trump lost New Hampshire in the general elections of both 2016 and 2020. And the state, which doesn’t have as many of the evangelical voters who favor the former president, does have a large independent voter pool. In a reflection of how she’s potentially a better fit for the Granite State than Trump, New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu has been a prominent endorser of Haley.
Some of Haley’s tactics also may have backfired, like pulling out of two debates with DeSantis in recent days unless Trump participated. The idea was to emphasize that her real opponent is Trump. But in doing so, Haley relinquished two high-profile chances to present herself to the undeclared part of the New Hampshire electorate her campaign is now courting so aggressively.

Haley risks being victimized by the “bandwagon” effect some researchers have identified in which voters want to go with the perceived winner. A 2014 paper by Neil Malhotra of Stanford and David Rothschild of Microsoft Research showed that some voters do switch sides to feel accepted and to be a part of the winning team. To them, DeSantis dropping out (and quickly endorsing Trump) wouldn’t make Haley look like the safer bet, but Trump.
Haley tried to make the best of DeSantis’s move.
“We’re not a country of coronations,” Haley said in a late afternoon statement. “Voters deserve a say in whether we go down the road of Trump and Biden again, or we go down a new conservative road.”
But with DeSantis’s departure coming a bit over 48 hours before polls close in New Hampshire on Tuesday night, she may be hard-pressed to do better than a second-place finish behind Trump if he indeed gets 50% or more.
While finishing a relatively close second would normally allow for bragging rights against a former president who is effectively a quasi-incumbent, she faces a serious calendar and geography challenge. The South Carolina primary, in Haley’s home state, isn’t until February 24. That gives Trump plenty of time to build on his already considerable Palmetto State Republican support, with lots of GOP elected officials, backing him and no other early states where she looks to have a shot at finishing first.
Moreover, it’s not just Trump’s campaign that is galvanizing against her. With DeSantis out, the Republican establishment is rallying hard behind Trump. Sen. Steve Daines of Montana, who heads the Senate Republican campaign arm, made that point explicitly in an X post late Sunday afternoon less than two hours after DeSantis quit.

“Donald Trump is the presumptive nominee. I am encouraging every Republican to unite behind him because it will take all of us to defeat Joe Biden, take back the Senate, and hold the House,” wrote Daines, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee.
This rally-around-Trump message likely makes Haley supporters even more of an isolated minority in the GOP firmament. Heading into voting Tuesday, DeSantis’s withdrawal only exacerbates her challenge."
TJLOYYWK3E_0LN1YQA76P4YU6N,Top UN court says Israel must take ‘all measures’ to prevent genocide in Gaza but stops short of calling for ceasefire,"By Christian Edwards, CNN","5 minute read Updated 1:58 PM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/26/middleeast/israel-genocide-case-icj-hague-ruling-south-africa-intl/,"The UN’s top court ordered Israel to prevent genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, but stopped short of calling for Israel to suspend its military campaign in the war-torn enclave, as South Africa had requested.
In a hearing in The Hague, the Netherlands, on Friday, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) said Israel must “take all measures” to limit the death and destruction caused by its military campaign, prevent and punish incitement to genocide, and ensure access to humanitarian aid.
South Africa had accused Israel of violating international laws on genocide, written in the wake of the Holocaust, and wanted the court to order Israel to cease fire in Gaza.
While the ICJ did not order Israel to end its war, the ruling represents a blow to Israel, which had hoped the case would be dismissed outright.
Friday’s decision related only to South Africa’s request for emergency measures, which act like a restraining order while the court considers the full merits of the genocide case, which could take years.

“The catastrophic humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip is at serious risk of deteriorating further before the court renders its final judgment,” Judge Joan Donoghue, the ICJ’s president, said Friday.
By an overwhelming majority, the court’s 17-judge panel voted in favor of six emergency measures, ordering Israel to “take all measures within its power” to prevent acts which could fall foul of the 1948 Genocide Convention, and to ensure its military does not commit genocidal acts in Gaza.
It also ordered Israel to “prevent and punish the direct and public incitement to commit genocide,” and to guarantee the “provision of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance” in the enclave.
Israel was also ordered to preserve evidence related to allegations of genocide and report back to the court on its compliance with these measures in a month.
The ICJ’s decisions are binding and cannot be appealed, but it has no way of enforcing them. In 2022 it ordered Russia to immediately suspend its invasion of Ukraine, but Moscow’s war rages on nearly two years later.
Israel had already indicated it would not accept the ICJ’s orders. “Nobody will stop us – not The Hague, not the axis of evil and not anybody else,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office wrote on X.
The court’s panel ordinarily comprises 15 judges, but was expanded in this case by additional judges from South Africa and Israel.
Israel’s judge Aharon Barak, an 87-year-old Holocaust survivor and former president of the country’s Supreme Court, voted in favor of two of the emergency measures, ordering Israel to curb incitements to genocide and to ensure aid can enter the enclave.
Apart from its call for a halt in fighting, the bulk of South Africa’s nine requests to the court were granted.
The Palestinian Authority Foreign Minister, Riyad al-Maliki, said the ICJ had “ruled in favor of humanity and international law” and thanked South Africa for bringing the case to the court.
South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa called the ruling a “victory for international law, for human rights, and above all for justice.”
While South Africa said it was “disappointed” that the court did not order a ceasefire, its Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor said she believes Israel will have to observe one if it is to comply with the other measures ordered.
“In exercising the order, there would have to be a ceasefire,” she said after the hearing. “Without it the order doesn’t actually work.”
Despite the court’s ordering emergency measures, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed the ruling as a rejection of discrimination against his country.
“Like every country, Israel has an inherent right to defend itself,” he said in a short video message. “The vile attempt to deny Israel this fundamental right is blatant discrimination against the Jewish state, and it was justly rejected.”
However, not all members of Netanyahu’s cabinet welcomed the ruling. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant criticized the court’s decision to hear the case altogether, claiming the ICJ “granted South Africa’s antisemitic request to discuss the claim of genocide in Gaza, and now refuses to reject the petition outright.”
Israeli war cabinet minister Benny Gantz said, “Those truly needing to stand trial are those that murdered and kidnapped children, women and the elderly,” referring to those killed and taken hostage by Hamas on October 7.
Palestinian militant group Hamas also welcomed the court’s decision in a statement on Friday, saying it anticipates further court decisions convicting Israel “of genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.”
Legal experts have said that, while the court did not grant the most explosive of South Africa’s requests, in finding that Israel is “plausibly” violating laws on genocide, its decision is damning.
“Even though it is not a definitive verdict, it is a very significant rebuke for the armed forces of a democratic state that sometimes says it has the most moral army in the world,” Janina Dill, co-director at Oxford University’s Institute for Ethics, Law and Armed Conflict, told CNN.
“The world court looked at (Israel’s) actions in Gaza and said it is not implausible that it’s violating the Genocide Convention. I don’t see how that can possibly be a victory. In some sense it’s a rebuke, and it is also a rebuke to the governments of the world that support Israel in its actions in Gaza,” she said.
In the initial hearing two weeks ago, South Africa alleged that Israel’s leadership was “intent on destroying the Palestinians as a group in Gaza,” and that its aerial and ground assaults aimed to “bring about the destruction” of Palestinians in the enclave.
South Africa and Israel are both parties to the Genocide Convention, meaning they are obliged not to commit genocide and to prevent and punish it.
Israel reacted furiously to the accusation and rejected what it called South Africa’s “grossly distorted story,” telling the court its war in Gaza was fought in self-defense, that it was targeting Hamas rather than Palestinian civilians, and that its leadership had not displayed genocidal intent.
It said the accusation of genocide was an attempt to “pervert the meaning” of the term and empty it of its “unique force.”
Israel claimed if genocidal acts had been committed, they were “perpetrated against Israel” on October 7, when Hamas fighters stormed into the country from Gaza, killing more than 1,200 people and taking 240 hostage, according to Israeli officials. Israel’s retaliatory offensive in Gaza has since killed more than 26,000 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in the enclave.

TKRRUTGSZQ_A97UGFXRKS0C6W4,Sri Lanka passes controversial bill to regulate online content,"By Morayo Ogunbayo and Rhea Mogul, CNN","2 minute read Published 11:14 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/25/media/sri-lanka-online-safety-bill-pass-intl-hnk/,"Sri Lanka’s lawmakers passed a bill on Wednesday regulating internet use among its citizens, in a move that has sparked fears among rights groups of a free speech crackdown.
The Online Safety Bill, which passed with 108-62 votes, aims to “make provisions to prohibit online communication of certain statements of fact in Sri Lanka” and “prevent the use of online accounts and inauthentic online accounts for prohibited purposes.”
The bill will also create an “Online Safety Commission,” a five-member committee appointed by the president, to “issue directives to persons who communicate prohibited statements under this Act to stop the communication of any such statements.”
Sri Lanka’s government says the bill will provide protection against online abuse, but rights groups have criticized its position, claiming the bill is instead aimed at stifling dissent and criticism.
“Sri Lanka is still reeling from an economic crisis partly caused by misgovernment and failures of accountability,” said Human Rights Watch Deputy Asia Director Meenakshi Ganguly in a statement Tuesday. “In 2022, months-long protests demanding reform toppled the prime minister and president. Since coming to power that year, President (Ranil) Wickremesinghe has moved to stifle dissent.”
The Asia Internet Coalition, an industry group, opposed the bill when it was first announced in September last year.
Managing Director Jeff Paine said in a statement at the time that “the bill provides for a draconian system to stifle dissent and Sri Lankans’ rights to expression.”
He added: “While our member companies take seriously the online safety of those who use their services, legislation should not dampen innovation by restricting public debate and the exchange of ideas that can consequently impact the digital economy.”
The United Nations Human Rights Office also spoke against the bill in October.
Raising issue with its proposed punishments for violators, the organization said it “includes an overly broad definition of terrorism and grants wide powers to the police - and to the military - to stop, question and search, and to arrest and detain people, with inadequate judicial oversight.”
Nearly two years ago, Sri Lanka was rocked by monthslong protests over the country’s worst economic crisis in 73 years.
Then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa was forced to flee the country after angry protesters, who blamed him for the financial situation, stormed his residence.
Rajapaksa resigned from his post, paving the way for current President Wickremesinghe to take over. But rights groups have accused him of cracking down on dissent and silencing protesters.
“Sri Lanka’s repressive laws have facilitated widespread human rights violations for decades and contributed to economic and political crises,” said Ganguly."
TNTWIFLRCP_JU37U353RXDETCR,"Ian Bailey, suspect in notorious Irish murder case, dead at 66","By Lianne Kolirin and Kara Fox, CNN","4 minute read Updated 6:13 AM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240122,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/22/europe/ian-bailey-murder-dead-scli-intl/,"A British man long suspected of killing the wife of a famous French film producer in Ireland has died at age 66, according to his lawyer.
Back in 2019, the Paris Criminal Court convicted Ian Bailey in absentia of the murder of TV producer Sophie Toscan du Plantier and sentenced him to 25 years’ imprisonment.
Bailey, a former journalist, had denied involvement in the murder, which has been the subject of a popular podcast series and two TV documentaries, including one on Netflix.
On December 23, 1996, 39-year-old Toscan du Plantier was found bludgeoned to death near the gate of her vacation home near Toormore, in Ireland’s West Cork region. Police found some 50 wounds on her body.
The case was widely publicized as the victim had been married to Daniel Toscan du Plantier, a well-known French film producer.
Days after the murder, local police began questioning Bailey, who lived nearby and had been tasked with reporting on the killing for a national paper. He was arrested twice: first in February 1997 and then in January 1998.
No forensic evidence linked Bailey to the scene of the crime, and he was released without charge. He spent years denying any involvement in the murder.
News of Bailey’s death emerged on Sunday, when his lawyer made a statement to the PA Media news agency.
Frank Buttimer, who had known Bailey since March 1997, said his client had a severe heart condition.

He told PA: “I knew Ian was very unwell, we were in communication in the past five days, but I didn’t know he was terminally unwell.
“He had a very severe heart condition, a very bad heart condition, and had cardiac events prior to Christmas.
“He was a candidate for surgical intervention but wasn’t well enough, so he was trying to become well enough.”
No one else has ever been charged over Toscan du Plantier’s death and her family had long pushed for Bailey to be brought to trial in France.
Under French law, authorities can investigate crimes against French citizens committed outside of its borders, although they cannot insist that witnesses travel for questioning.
Toscan du Plantier’s family responded to the news of Bailey’s death in a statement sent to CNN.
A press release from the group known as The Association for the Truth About the Murder of Sophie Toscan du Plantier said Bailey’s death means they “will never be able to obtain a confession.”
It said that, over the years, “Bailey refused to answer the questions of French investigators, entangling himself in lies and contradictions. Provoking and taunting the police, the judiciary, and the media, Ian Bailey always avoided telling the truth about this murder, of which, beyond any reasonable doubt, he knew every detail.”
Related article More than two decades after a woman was killed in an Irish village, French prosecutors hope to close the case
The statement continued: “An investigation is underway in Ireland, and we are confident that the discovery of new elements, the hearing of new witnesses, and the revelation of possible complicity will enable Irish police to close the case, 27 years after the murder.”
At the time of the Paris trial, Buttimer told CNN that the murder conviction  was a “grotesque miscarriage of justice.”
Despite insisting on his innocence, many locals said Bailey’s actions over the years created a cloud of suspicion, which continued to follow him around in West Cork for more than two decades.
Weeks after the murder, Bailey’s editor at the now defunct Sunday Tribune told police that he told her that he killed Toscan du Plantier to resurrect his career. According to police documents, Bailey admitted making the comment but said it was a joke.
In the years following his arrests, Bailey alleged he was wrongfully arrested and a victim of police corruption. In 2015, he lost a civil action in the High Court on those claims. A subsequent review by the Irish policing watchdog found problems in the way that Bailey’s arrest was handled, but concluded in 2018 that there was no evidence of police corruption.
No one else has ever been charged with the murder.

TR5HW4QL3H_EQVL0R0BR98PYGC,Five takeaways from the New Hampshire primary,"By Eric Bradner, CNN","6 minute read Updated 11:37 PM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/23/politics/takeaways-new-hampshire-primary/,"Former President Donald Trump took a huge step toward winning a third consecutive Republican presidential nomination Tuesday, winning the New Hampshire primary in a one-on-one matchup with his last challenger standing, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley.
Haley vowed to remain in the Republican race, saying she’ll now focus on the February 24 primary in her home state of South Carolina.
But she’ll be battling history: In modern presidential campaign history, no non-incumbent has won the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary without going on to win his party’s nomination.
Trump, who took the stage shortly after Haley spoke, seethed over her decision to continue her campaign.
“She had to win,” the former president said. “She failed badly.”
As Haley seeks to prove she remains a viable contender, President Joe Biden began preparations for a general election rematch with Trump — dispatching senior White House staffers to work on his campaign and holding an event in Virginia where he hammered Trump on abortion rights.
Here are five takeaways from the New Hampshire primaries:
In what were expected to be celebratory remarks Tuesday night in New Hampshire, Trump instead sounded annoyed that Haley had not yet dropped out of the Republican primary race.
He mocked Haley, calling her an “imposter” who had “claimed victory” despite doing “very poorly.” (Haley, in fact, had congratulated Trump for his victory at the beginning of her remarks.)
His remarks made plain that Haley’s attacks on Trump’s age, his verbal miscues and Republican losses during his time as the party’s leader have frustrated the former president.
It was a jarring contrast from Trump’s election night remarks eight days ago in Iowa, when he praised his rivals as “very smart people, very capable people” and predicted that Republicans are “going to come together. It’s going to happen soon, too.”
He invited two former 2024 GOP contenders, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, to attack Haley on stage Tuesday night.
“What we see right now with her continuing in the race is the ugly underbelly of American politics,” Ramaswamy said, blaming Haley’s decision to continue her candidacy on “megadonors” who are out of step with what Americans want. “What we saw tonight is America first defeating America last.”
Later, he gave Scott, who stood on stage behind him days after endorsing the former president, the chance to jab at Haley. He noted that Haley had appointed the South Carolina Republican to the Senate in 2013.
“Did you ever think that she actually appointed you, Tim?” Trump said. “You must really hate her.”
Scott diplomatically stepped to the microphone to interject. “I just love you,” he said.
Though Trump is eager to move past the Republican primary, and Biden’s campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said Tuesday night that Trump “has all but locked up” his party’s nomination, Haley insisted she won’t leave the race.
“New Hampshire is first in the nation. It is not the last in the nation. This race is far from over. There are dozens of states left to go,” Haley told supporters in her election night speech Tuesday in New Hampshire.
What’s not clear, though, is where Haley could actually notch a victory against Trump. She isn’t participating in the Nevada caucuses on February 8 (she will instead be on the state’s primary ballot, which won’t lead to her winning any delegates), and polls in her home state of South Carolina — where the February 24 primary will be the next major showdown — show Trump with a huge lead.
Haley is likely to face immense pressure to depart the race in coming days. She’ll face questions about whether she’ll follow a path similar to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who vowed to continue on after his second-place finish in last week’s Iowa caucuses — and then he dropped out days later.
Haley’s campaign said Tuesday it is placing $4 million in television advertising reservations in South Carolina. She has also scheduled a rally Wednesday night in North Charleston.
Mark Harris, executive director of the pro-Haley super PAC SFA Fund, told CNN the group is “on to South Carolina” and plan to spend millions on ads, mail and more.
Haley used her Tuesday night speech to make her most pointed argument yet about electability — blaming Trump for Republicans’ disappointing performances in the 2018 and 2022 midterms and the 2020 presidential election.
“With Donald Trump, Republicans have lost almost every competitive election,” she said, ticking through GOP failures during Trump’s time as the party’s leader. “The worst-kept secret in politics is how badly the Democrats want to run against Donald Trump.”
A supporter shouted: “He’s a loser!”
The former South Carolina governor called Trump “the only Republican in the country who Joe Biden can defeat.”

She also highlighted their ages. Trump will be 78 on Election Day in November; Biden will be 81. She also questioned Trump’s mental competency, and challenged him to debate her. (Trump skipped all five Republican primary debates, and has shown no indication he’d consider participating in one.)
Trump is dominating Republican primary polls. But polls also show Haley outperforms the former president in a hypothetical general election matchup with Biden — something Haley has frequently noted in recent days.
“The first party to retire its 80-year-old candidate is going to be the party that wins this election,” she said Tuesday night. “And I think it should be the Republicans that win this election. So our fight is not over, because we have a country to save.”
Though Trump’s win was a huge step toward cementing the GOP nomination, there were warning signs for his general election hopes within CNN’s exit polls of New Hampshire Republican primary voters.
Haley won the 29% of the electorate that identified themselves as moderate by a 3-to-1 margin.
On the issue of abortion, Trump was the strong favorite of those who support banning most or all abortions nationwide, but Haley edged him out among the 67% of the primary electorate that said they would oppose a ban. Biden’s campaign on Tuesday signaled its intent to make abortion rights a central focus of the general election.
“Let there be no mistake: The person most responsible for taking away this freedom in America is Donald Trump,” Biden told supporters at a rally in Manassas, Virginia.
There were other potential signs of trouble with moderate voters for Trump. Among them: 44% of the primary electorate said Trump is not fit for the presidency if he is convicted of a crime, and Haley won 84% of those voters. Haley won 79% of the votes of those who said Biden legitimately won the 2020 election — showing a potentially limited appetite among voters for Trump’s lies about widespread election fraud.
Biden won the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday night, but he had been at risk for blowback in New Hampshire after he led the Democratic push to demote the state in the party’s nominating process — elevating South Carolina’s primary to become the first contest with delegates on the line.
The Democratic National Committee had called the vote “meaningless” and had urged presidential candidates to “take all steps possible not to participate.” Still, Biden’s allies launched a low-key effort to get Democrats to write in Biden, and it paid off with an easy victory.
It was a reminder that even though Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips and author Marianne Williamson are challenging Biden, there is no drama: Biden’s path to the Democratic nomination for a second term is clear.
Biden’s campaign, meanwhile, is preparing for an early start of the general election, moving two senior aides from the White House to his reelection campaign in Wilmington. Jen O’Malley Dillon, who was campaign manager for Biden’s 2020 campaign, is poised to transition to a role as Biden’s campaign chair, while Mike Donilon, a long-time Biden messaging guru, will be chief strategist."
TW1U662LLU_VRDEKS3AFMS1311,Unruly passengers were a problem before the pandemic. Now they’re even worse,"By Francesca Street, CNN","11 minute read Published 8:11 AM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/travel/unruly-airplane-passengers-post-pandemic-problem/,"Passenger Philip Baum recently experienced one of the most uncomfortable flights of his life.
To Baum, it was obvious his seatmate, a stranger, was drunk. Flight crew, he says, “denied him alcohol.”
“But in front of me, he managed to sneak more alcohol off the trolley,” Baum recalls.
For Baum, who was seated in the economy cabin, being in such close proximity to the “unruly” passenger for multiple hours wasn’t pleasant.
“I actually thought I’d throw up,” he tells CNN Travel. “The guy pulled out his nails. He was bleeding. He stank, and he was blind drunk.”
Moreover, Baum was worried the passenger, who didn’t seem fully in control, “was going to completely lose it” at any moment.
“In the end, I spent about four hours talking to him and calming him down,” Baum recalls.
Throughout the flight, Baum felt himself working hard to control his own reaction to the situation. He felt, at several points, on the precipice of giving in to his own anger and frustration.
“The only reason I didn’t become unruly was because I thought, ‘Philip, you know better. You can’t suddenly become unruly,’” he says.
Baum is an aviation security expert, the founder of DISPAX World, the international conference on Unruly Airline Passenger Management and Restraint.
Given his background, Baum found himself wondering – only half-jokingly – whether the whole incident was some kind of “test.”
Pre-pandemic, statistics recorded by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) indicated unruly airplane passengers were on the rise. Discussions about the issue were ramping up, with the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) launching its #notonmyflight initiative in 2019, aiming to increase passenger awareness.
During the peak Covid years, fewer flights didn’t equal fewer problems – at least not in the US, where reported incidents ballooned. In early 2021, Federal Aviation Authority data reached what an FAA spokesperson tells CNN Travel was “record highs,” with many altercations based around the then-mandated face mask rule. As American flight attendant Susannah Carr told CNN Travel that year: “I come in expecting to have a passenger that could potentially get violent.”
Reported incidents in the US have since fallen, but remain notably higher than pre-pandemic levels. IATA and FAA data can only tell us so much (not every airline that’s part of IATA submits data, while not every airline records every instance of unruly behavior) but the conversation around disruptive passengers remains heated.
As incidents regularly hit the headlines (including passengers sliding down the evacuation slide, hitting and biting flight attendants and forcing aircraft to divert from their intended destination, to name but a few) aviation authorities are clamping down, flight attendants are speaking up and aviation experts are questioning how we got here, and whether we can change the tide.
IATA classifies unruly behavior incidents into four levels. Level 1 is “minor” (IATA’s “Cabin Operations Safety Best Practice Manual” suggests this could be argumentative behavior or non-compliance with safety regulations). Level 2 is “moderate” (physically aggressive behavior, for example). Level 3 is “serious” (i.e. dangerous behavior, an “intent or threat to injure,” as IATA puts it). Level 4 is “flight deck breach” (which IATA classifies as “credible threat of death).
The latest available IATA data, from 2022, indicates most disruptive passenger incidents involved non-compliance, verbal abuse and intoxication. These incidents are less extreme, but are still seen as potentially detrimental to flight safety.
In a 2023 document called “Even safer and more enjoyable air travel for all: A strategy for reducing unruly and disruptive passenger incidents,” IATA states that while “only a tiny minority” of passengers behave badly, these travelers “have a disproportionate impact.”
Incidents could “threaten the safety and security of the aircraft, other passengers, and crew,” says IATA. There’s also the mental health impact on crew and passengers, and increased likelihood of inconvenient diversions, delays or cancellations.
Unruly passengers, “can compromise the ability for cabin crew to undertake their safety duties,” former flight attendant Liz Simmons, who flew for 17 years, tells CNN Travel.
Simmons, who is Australian, is now working on a PhD examining the physical and psychosocial well-being of cabin crew in Oceania, and how that intersects with performance and safety behaviors.
Simmons says disruptive passenger incidents can cause “physical, emotional or psychological injury,” for flight attendants and other passengers alike.

Of the 5,981 unruly passenger incidents reported to the FAA in 2021, 4,290 were face mask-related.
It’s not surprising then, that as the pandemic waned and mask mandates were lifted, aviation workers and officials alike assumed the situation would improve.
European flight attendant Kris Major, who sits in groups within the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) recalls conversations about pandemic bad behavior being “kind of a blip” and assumptions that they’d quickly be a “bounceback.”
Short answer, there wasn’t. The pandemic, as former Japan Airlines flight attendant Mizuki Urano puts it, was a “turning point.”
John Franklin, head of safety promotion at EASA, tells CNN Travel he believes the uptick in unruly passenger behavior correlates with a more general societal behavior shift that’s taken place in the last couple of years.
“It has become clear that the increase in unruly passenger behavior matches what police see in general society since the Covid pandemic,” says Franklin, who says EASA’s been discussing the rise of disruptive behavior with European law enforcement.
People behaving badly in public spaces is a conversation that’s taken place beyond the aviation industry. In the UK, for example, there’s been an increase in what performing arts union Bectu calls “extreme anti-social behavior” among theater goers. Meanwhile, 2023 saw a slew of reports of tourists behaving badly across the globe – damaging heritage sites, eating endangered species and stealing.
Aviation psychologist Aleksandra Kapela posits that “prolonged online work and limited social interactions” might have impacted our “comfort levels in close spaces, such as airplanes.”
Kapela also attributes the increase in unruly passenger behavior to some “now viewing travel as both a right and a privilege after enduring uncertainty and restrictions.”
That outlook brings “heightened expectations to their journeys,” Kapela tells CNN Travel.
Anti-social behavior has negative impacts in any setting, but as IATA notes, “behaviors which some people may deem to be acceptable on the ground take on a completely different complexion in the confines of an aircraft traveling at 500 miles per hour six miles above the ground.”

During the pandemic years, airlines and airports furloughed staff. Many didn’t return. Then, when international air travel started to ramp up, restaffing quickly proved tricky.
It’s a vicious circle, suggests flight attendant Kris Major. Staffing issues, he says, are behind several general issues with the aviation industry right now – “flight delays, cancellations” – and such problems can also be the source of passenger tension and lead to unruly incidents.
Fewer staff, says Major, also means less “vigilance in the terminals” – meaning it’s harder for ground crews to spot and weed out a potential disruptive passenger.
Newly hired staff and cabin crew also bring less experience to the table. Former flight attendant Simmons suggests that no matter how good training might be, experience is often integral in handling unruly passenger incidents.
And while practical training – on how to restrain passengers, for example, and self defense – is mandatory for flight attendants, Simmons says “emotional intelligence” is one of the key skills needed by cabin crew.
Human skills are part of the training programs, but they’re often honed on the job.
“Time and exposure makes for a better diffuser,” she says. “We’re trained on the ground, but then you go into the air and everything you encounter on a daily basis could be considered on the job training as well.”
In recent years, airlines and airports have also increasingly relied on automated processes – think self check-in, automated gates. DISPAX World organizer Philip Baum says automation “dehumanizes the whole experience” of flying.
Passengers may not directly interact face-to-face with another person until they’re at the gate or boarding the aircraft. When they finally do, air rage hits.
“The passenger could be carrying all types of grievances about the booking process, the security screening – something may have happened in their life – and it’s just that buildup of anxiety and anger that compounds with other issues,” says Simmons.

Bearing the brunt of disruptive passenger incidents places “a significant emotional burden” on cabin crew, as aviation psychologist Kapela puts it.
“Their already demanding job, focused on ensuring safety, becomes even more challenging when dealing with disruptive passengers.”
There’s also a knock-on impact on other passengers, who could follow in the disruptive passenger’s footsteps – a potential that crossed Philip Baum’s mind when he was seated next to a drunk passenger and actively worked to control his own frustrations.
There’s also the potential physical and emotional threat to aviation workers – as evidenced in the news reports of flight attendants at the receiving end of violence – and other passengers.
At the 2023 iteration of DISPAX World – Baum’s conference on unruly passenger behavior – presenter Polly Hilmarsdóttir, from Icelandair, said the airline’s ground staff are instructed, when they encounter an unruly passenger, to consider the question “Would you be happy for this passenger to sit next to a child you care about?” If the answer is ‘no’, Icelandair staff are instructed to deny boarding.
Their already demanding job, focused on ensuring safety, becomes even more challenging when dealing with disruptive passengers.
Aviation psychologist Aleksandra Kapela, on flight attendants
Daniela Modonesi, who works at an Italian airport and who is chair of the European Transport Workers’ Federation (ETF)’s Ground Staff Committee, agrees ground staff have an important role to play. She adds that disruptive passenger-related issues are also prevalent on the ground and can cause knock-on effects.
“If (passengers are) in a line with somebody screaming, they don’t want to go on board with this person,” Modonesi tells CNN Travel.
Unruly passengers also lead to attrition across the aviation industry, says Modonesi. She regularly sees fellow ground staff leaving work, crying, following interactions with aggressive passengers. Often they hand in their notice not long after.
“You start thinking, ‘Why should I do this? I could change jobs so that this goes away,’” says Modonesi.

Disruptive behavior at 30,000 feet isn’t without consequences.
An FAA representative told CNN Travel they review every unruly passenger report received from airlines. The FAA will investigate further when they believe a passenger “may have violated a regulation or federal law.”
Unruly passengers in the US face fines of up to $37,000 per incident, as well as criminal prosecution.
“While we do not have criminal prosecution authority, the FAA is working closely with the FBI and TSA to ensure unruly passengers face additional punishments when warranted,” the FAA spokesperson told CNN Travel.
Airlines can also choose to place disruptive travelers on internal no-fly lists. These may be shared with partner airlines – for example, Dutch airline KLM shares this data with its low cost sister airline Transavia, and passengers are banned from flying with either airline for a minimum of five years if they misbehave on a Transavia or KLM flight.
However, penalizing disruptive passengers – particularly on international flights – can be complicated. Under existing international law (the Tokyo Convention 1963), offenses committed on board an aircraft are under the jurisdiction of the authorities in the state in which the aircraft is registered.
Essentially it’s “quite a legal minefield,” as flight attendant Major puts it.
The Montreal Protocol 2014 seeks to get around this issue by enabling prosecution in the state where the airplane lands, but not every nation has ratified this protocol.
The FAA uses the threat of steep fines in its digital signage and public service announcements – which aim to clamp down on disruptive passengers.
The FAA’s also created social media memes, with the FAA spokesperson pointing CNN Travel to one made especially for Halloween 2023, depicting a “police officer and unruly passenger” couple’s costume.
In Europe, EASA’s Not on my Flight Campaign also draws attention to the safety implications of people behaving badly on board via online advertisements.
Baum is skeptical about the potential positive impact of these campaigns.
“If you are a potentially unruly passenger, do you really not become unruly because you saw some zero tolerance unruly behavior video?” he questions.
Instead, Baum thinks the focus should be on the aviation industry’s approach to alcohol – which can be free flowing in the airport and on the plane and is often cited as a factor in unruly passenger incidents – and as a general threat to cabin safety. IATA says it’s working with airports and duty-free retailers to encourage responsible sales and marketing of alcohol, as often it’s the alcohol consumed prior to the flight that causes issues on board.
Former flight attendant Simmons thinks the FAA memes are effective – “visual images are such a powerful tool,” she says. But Simmons suggests there should also be reminders within the airport. Preboarding announcements that “crew are there for safety, first and foremost, and they’re not there as an outlet for aggression” could also be helpful, she says.
Simmons also encourages airlines and airports emphasizing cabin crew’s role as safety professionals.
“The way that flight attendants are represented in advertising, or onboard safety demonstrations sends a very powerful message to passengers,” she says.
Aviation psychologist Kapela agrees that “pre-flight education” is key, suggesting “ensuring passengers get why safety measures are in place, the important role of cabin crew, and the reasons behind actions like fastening seatbelts or delays can clear up misunderstandings.”
I feel we’ve been incredibly lucky that an aircraft has not been brought down because of unruly behavior in the skies.
Philip Baum, organizer of DISPAX World, the international conference on Unruly Airline Passenger Management and Restraint
EASA’s Franklin says it’s still too early to know if there will be a sea change in 2024 – not all data is yet available from 2023, for one.
He says EASA hopes “to see a reduction, particularly in events involving physical violence” and believes the industry will get there “through proactive passenger behavior management that deals with situations early before they escalate.”
So far in 2024, the problem doesn’t seem to have gone anywhere. In January, an American passenger bit an All Nippon Airways (ANA) flight attendant, forcing the plane to return to Tokyo, and an American Airlines flight was diverted to a Texas airport mid-flight after a passenger punched a flight attendant multiple times and assaulted at least one police officer.
“We’ve got a problem,” says Philip Baum, who fears that “one day there will be a disaster because of an unruly passenger incident.”
“At the moment, I feel we’ve been incredibly lucky that an aircraft has not been brought down because of unruly behavior in the skies.”"

The team at the BioRescue project successfully impregnated a southern white rhino via in vitro fertilization (IVF), according to a press release, creating a possible path for restoring the northern white rhino species.
Northern white rhinos are critically endangered and the only two remaining rhinos, Najin and Fatu, are infertile females that live under constant surveillance in Kenya.
However, there are living cells from 12 different northern white rhinos stored in liquid nitrogen in Italy and Germany.
The impregnation of the southern white rhino was an international effort to save the species.
The sperm was collected from a southern white rhinoceros named Athos, who lives at Zoo Salzburg in Austria. The egg cells were retrieved from Elenore, a southern white rhinoceros living in the Pairi Daiza Zoo in Belgium. The samples were then transferred to Italy and fertilized in vitro.
Two embryos were transferred to Kenya and implanted in a surrogate mother, named Curra, at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in September 2023. The process of implanting the embryos included using a male “teaser” bull, named Ouwan, to stimulate typical mating behaviours.
Thomas Hildebrandt, the project head of BioRescue, described the process as “uncharted territory,” with the procedures, protocols, methods and equipment developed from scratch.
Unfortunately for the rescue project, both Curra and Ouwan were found dead in November. It’s believed the pair fell ill due to a severe bacterial infection following extremely heavy and climate change-related rains, which flooded the surrogate enclosure.
However, it was revealed at the time that Curra was pregnant with a 70-day-old male fetus. Tissue taken from the fetus confirmed that the pregnancy was a result of the embryo transfer.
Scientists said the next steps of this research program will be to select a new southern white rhino surrogate mother and teaser bull. They will then develop a northern white rhino embryo to implant in the surrogate.
Hildebrandt said they hope the offspring would then be able to live with Najin and Fatu to learn the behaviors of the northern white rhino species.

TX7PLG56IT_7D12MCR1XG2JM6O,‘I don’t know why I’m not arrested.’ Anti-war presidential candidate ignites Russian anger,"By Clare Sebastian, CNN","3 minute read Updated 2:42 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/25/europe/russia-anti-war-presidential-candidate-boris-nadezhdin-intl/,"For the past week cities and towns across Russia have witnessed an unusual display of defiance.
No protests or picket lines, just patient, orderly queues. Dozens, if not hundreds of people lining up in freezing conditions to try to ensure an anti-war presidential candidate has enough signatures to get on the ballot for the vote in March.
It’s even happening outside of Russia, with volunteers collecting expats’ signatures in cities from London and Paris to Georgia’s capital Tbilisi.
Key endorsements from other Russian opposition figures, including associates of jailed Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny have helped. But the deadline to submit 100,000 signatures, with strict rules on quality and regional quotas, is January 31 – and time is running short.
The candidate is Boris Nadezhdin, on the surface an unlikely opponent for Vladimir Putin.
He’s a physicist by training, served one term in the state Duma 20 years ago, and by his own account joined the ranks of Russia’s opposition after the arrest of exiled oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky in 2003.
He went on to become an adviser to opposition leader Boris Nemtsov, assassinated within view of the Kremlin in 2015. “I know Putin very well from the 90s” he told CNN in an interview from Moscow on Wednesday, in which he spoke English.
“He was a normal Russian bureaucrat, and I was a normal Russian bureaucrat.”
He believes this may be why he can get away with publishing a manifesto calling Russia’s so-called “special military operation” a “fatal mistake,” in a country where spreading “false” information about the army carries a maximum 15-year prison sentence, and the most prominent opposition figure, Navalny, is serving a multi-decade prison term beyond the Arctic Circle.
Ultimately he admits, “I don’t know why I’m not arrested.”
The Kremlin says it doesn’t see him as a rival, but the speculation is that they are allowing Nadezhdin to continue, either so that Putin can win against an anti-war candidate, thereby affording himself a mandate to keep the war going, or to provide a release valve for an undercurrent of anti-war sentiment, to prevent it descending into mass protests.
Related article Putin’s election plan, Navalny’s disappearance. It’s no coincidence, Russian former minister says
Nadezhdin maintains his movement is real. “Millions of people understand,” he says, “we have to change the way Russia is going now, because Putin forced Russia into this track of militarization, this track of isolation.”
His plan, if elected, is to free all political prisoners on day one (including Navalny), call an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine and start peace talks.
For those waiting in line in the Moscow snow, this is not about Nadezhdin himself. Elizaveta from Bryansk, who declined to give her second name and from a border region now under regular drone attack, says the war has hit home.
“My town is in a special situation,” she tells us, “my main wish is that it should stop as soon as possible.”
Another supporter, who also wanted to be identified only as Ivan, tells us he doesn’t care if Nadezhdin is a Kremlin plant or not.
“I am prepared even for the candidate to be, as we say here, a representative of one of the Kremlin towers. For me the most important thing is that military action should stop and any vote in support of that will be valid.”
For several people we spoke to, whether Nadezhdin ends up on the ballot or not, this is a rare opportunity to play a part in Russian political life.
Gripping her hot tea handed out by volunteers, Elena puts it simply. “I think people should see that we want to show our position, that we exist.”

TXW1FL7TO8_AJ102T5RX8UNKQT,Pakistan accuses India of extrajudicial killings on its territory,"By Sophia Saifi, Sania Farooqui, Michael Rios and Rhea Mogul, CNN","2 minute read Published 10:08 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/26/asia/pakistan-accuses-india-extrajudicial-killing-intl-hnk/,"A top Pakistan official on Thursday accused India of killing two Pakistani nationals on its soil, citing what he called “a pattern” of alleged Indian assassination plots overseas and raising tensions between the two nuclear-armed rivals.
In a news conference, Pakistani Foreign Secretary Muhammad Syrus Sajjad Qazi claimed Islamabad has “credible evidence” linking Indian agents to the killing of Muhammad Riaz in Pakistan-administered Kashmir on September 8 last year and of Shahid Latif in the city of Sialkot, near Kashmir, a month later.
“These were killings-for-hire cases involving a sophisticated international setup spread over multiple jurisdictions,” Qazi said.
He accused two Indian agents of recruiting assassins to kill the men – both slain in the vicinity of mosques – but did not provide further information about the victims or suggest why New Delhi might have targeted them.
India has long accused Pakistan of harboring terrorists, particularly in the disputed and heavily militarized region of Kashmir, which both countries claim in its entirety. A de facto border called the Line of Control divides it between New Delhi and Islamabad. The dispute has led to three wars between the two nations.
Qazi on Thursday compared the alleged killings in Pakistan to other purported recent Indian assassination plots in North America.
“They fit the pattern of similar cases which have come to light in other countries including Canada and the United States,” Qazi said. “Clearly the Indian network of extrajudicial and extraterritorial killings has become a global phenomenon.”
India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) rejected Qazi’s allegations, calling them “Pakistan’s latest attempt at peddling false and malicious anti-India propaganda.”
“As the world knows, Pakistan has long been the epicenter of terrorism, organized crime, and illegal transnational activities. India and many other countries have publicly warned Pakistan cautioning that it would be consumed by its own culture of terror and violence,” MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.
“Pakistan will reap what it sows.”
Last November, the US accused an Indian government official of being involved in a conspiracy to kill an American citizen on its home soil.
The revelation came a little over a month after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau publicly alleged that India may have been involved in the murder of a Canadian national on its territory, prompting a furious response from New Delhi and a diplomatic fallout between the two countries.
The Indian government has denied involvement in the American and Canadian cases and has set up a high-level committee to investigate the accusations in the US."

TZ1UD40M07_6OBFWHXR4MLT1K4,An Alabama inmate was executed with nitrogen gas. How does it work?,"By Lauren Mascarenhas, CNN","5 minute read Updated 11:11 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/25/us/nitrogen-gas-execution/,"Alabama inmate Kenneth Smith was put to death Thursday night, marking the nation’s first known execution using nitrogen gas.
Smith, who was sentenced to death for his role in a 1988 murder for hire and already survived a botched execution attempt by lethal injection, was at the center of a heated debate over whether the execution method constitutes cruelty.
Smith’s lawyers made several eleventh-hour attempts to prevent the execution. A federal appeals court on Wednesday and the US Supreme Court on Wednesday and Thursday declined to halt it.
Related article Alabama plans the first nitrogen gas execution this week in largely secret process experts say raises concerns about cruelty
“Execution is a very specific kind of punishment, and no punishment, according to the US Constitution, can be carried out in a cruel fashion,” Dr. Joel Zivot, an associate professor of anesthesiology and surgery at Emory University, told CNN. “And so the only real question is: Is execution with nitrogen gas cruel?”
Officials started using lethal injection to kill people on death row about 40 years ago, and it’s since become the most widely used execution method across the 27 states where capital punishment is legal.
Around 2009, the drugs used to carry out lethal injections became harder to access, and states began turning to alternative drugs – a shift that has been tied to a surge of complications with the procedure.
That’s what happened when Alabama first tried to execute Smith in November 2022, and officials were unable to set an intravenous line before the execution warrant expired.
Only three states – Alabama, Oklahoma and Mississippi – have approved the use of nitrogen gas for capital punishment, and experts say there is no real blueprint for the execution method. Alabama has published a protocol for the procedure, though it contains redactions the state says are meant to maintain security.
Alabama officials planned to use a mask to administer the nitrogen to Smith. Smith likely would have been strapped down when this occurred, Zivot said before the execution.
Nitrogen hypoxia would occur when a high concentration of the gas is inhaled, replacing oxygen in the body and causing death.
The process essentially disables the respiratory system, said Dr. Jonathan Groner, a professor of surgery at The Ohio State University College of Medicine.
Some officials say that a person would likely lose consciousness shortly into the procedure, making it more humane than other execution methods. However, doctors have said that they could not pinpoint if or when a person will lose consciousness when exposed to high concentrations of nitrogen gas.
On Thursday night, the execution process started at 7:53 p.m. CT, and a physician pronounced Smith dead at 8:25 p.m. CT, Alabama Department of Corrections Commissioner John Hamm said. Nitrogen flowed for about 15 minutes during that time, and “nothing … out of the ordinary” happened compared to “what we were expecting,” Hamm said.
According to witnesses from the news media, Smith “appeared conscious for several minutes into the execution.”
“For about two minutes following that, Kenneth Smith shook and writhed … on a gurney,” the media witnesses said in a joint report. “That was followed by several minutes of deep breaths on the gurney.”
“Following that, his breath slowed until it was no longer perceptible for media witnesses,” the journalists said in their joint report.
Asked whether the shaking and writhing was evidence that Smith suffered, Hamm said: “(It) appeared that, one, Smith was holding his breath has long as he could.”
“And then there’s also information out there that he struggled against his restrains a little but, but there’s some involuntary movement and some agonal breathing, so that was all expected and is in the side effects that we’ve seen or researched on nitrogen hypoxia,” Hamm said. Agonal breathing is usually described as a kind of gasping seen in people who are dying.
This month, United Nations experts raised the alarm that Smith’s execution could constitute torture, saying in a news release, “We are concerned that nitrogen hypoxia would result in a painful and humiliating death.”
While doctors couldn’t say definitely, ahead of the execution, what would happen to Smith, the possibilities left many concerned.
If a mask is not secured tightly enough, oxygen could leak in, prolonging the death, experts say.
“When we put 100% non-rebreather face masks on our patients, they never get 100%, because there’s some leakage,” Groner said before Smith’s execution. “I feel pretty confident that he’s not going to just take a deep breath and go to sleep. I think that’s unlikely.”

Doctors say the lack of oxygen could lead to seizures, which have been observed in patients experiencing hypoxia.
There’s also a possibility that a person being executed with this method could vomit into the mask, which could cause choking or asphyxiation if inhaled into the lungs.
The Department of Corrections altered Smith’s last meal schedule after concerns were raised that he had been “vomiting repeatedly.”
Even if a person is fasting, they can still vomit water or stomach fluids, experts say. If stomach acid is aspirated, it could burn the lungs, Zivot noted.
The stress, anxiety or flat-out fear that a person might feel before execution shouldn’t be ruled out, Groner said.
“When we have an operation and someone’s totally terrified, they actually respond differently to anesthetics, so a lot of times we’ll give them a sedative before we even go into the operating room,” he said before Smith’s execution. “There’s no talk anywhere of giving (Smith) anything to relax him.”
With most lethal injections, a person is first given an anesthetic to render them unconscious.
Increased stress has been linked to heart attacks and other medical events.
In a botched 2014 execution, Oklahoma death row inmate Clayton Lockett was declared dead of a heart attack more than an hour after being strapped to a gurney for an attempted lethal injection.
Officials say what happened in the Alabama execution chamber Thursday night could set a precedent for other death row prisoners in the state and beyond.
If the procedure did not kill Smith, complications could have left him injured or with serious brain damage, experts said before the execution.
“If they produce a corpse, then the states that want to do this will start doing it,” said Zivot.

U1S2P4D3HU_8ROQI0YCYOP1500,FDA warns of secondary cancer risk tied to CAR-T therapies that treat cancer,"By Jacqueline Howard, CNN","5 minute read Updated 4:36 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/24/health/fda-car-t-therapies-secondary-cancer-risk/,"The US Food and Drug Administration has issued a new warning about the possible risk of secondary cancers in cancer patients who have been treated with a form of immunotherapy called chimeric antigen receptor T-cell, or CAR-T cell, therapy.
The FDA sent notification letters this week and last week to several manufacturers of these therapies, requiring them to add a “boxed warning” to the products’ prescribing information. The warnings say that some T-cell malignancies, which in some cases led to hospitalization and death, have happened after treatment with BCMA- and CD19- directed genetically modified autologous T-cell immunotherapies.

“We would like to underscore that the overall benefits of these products continue to outweigh their possible risks,” FDA spokesperson Carly Pflaum said in an email Wednesday.
As of Monday, the agency has received 25 reports of T-cell malignancy after treatment with CAR-T cell immunotherapies, according to the email.
T-cells, a type of white blood cell, are the backbone of CAR-T therapies. These work by harnessing a patient’s T-cells, altering them in a lab so that they will attack cancer cells and then giving those modified T-cells back to the patient through an infusion.
Currently approved CAR-T cell immunotherapies are Abecma, Breyanzi, Carvykti, Kymriah, Tecartus and Yescarta. Kymriah, the first CAR-T cancer therapy approved by the FDA for leukemia treatment, was approved in 2017. The initial approvals of these therapies included an FDA requirement for 15-year follow-up studies to assess long-term safety and risk of secondary cancers after treatment.
Previously, the risk of secondary malignanices was included as a “class warning” in the US prescribing information for these CAR-T therapies.

“The FDA considers the serious risk of T cell malignancy to be applicable to all BCMA- and CD19-directed genetically modified autologous T cell immunotherapies,” the FDA said in a news release Tuesday. “The letters notify manufacturers of each such licensed product to update the package insert to include available information related to the risks and to update the Medication Guide for these products to identify the possibility of the increased risk of getting cancers, including certain types of cancers of the immune system.”
Patients and people participating in clinical trials who are receiving these therapies should be monitored “life-long” for any new malignancies, according to the FDA. If a new malignancy develops after treatment, health-care providers are urged to contact the manufacturer to report the event and get instructions on how to collect samples from the patient for testing.
“On an individual basis, a patient should not be too worried about this specific risk of developing treatment-induced T cell lymphoma after receiving CAR-T cell therapies, the risk appears to be extremely low,” Dr. Joshua Brody, director of the lymphoma immunotherapy program at the Tisch Cancer Institute at Mount Sinai, who was not involved in the FDA warning, wrote in an email Wednesday. “The real impact of this new safety label is that it will push CAR-T developers to even safer versions for future patients.”

In November, the FDA announced that it was investigating the risk of secondary cancers after treatment with certain CAR-T cell therapies.
As of the end of last year, the agency had received 22 reported cases of different types of T-cell malignancies possibly associated with CAR-T therapies, Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said in a presentation at the Alliance for Regenerative Medicine this month.
He added that there were more than 27,000 people treated with these CAR-T therapies in the United States.
“So the rate of a few of these cases, with tens of thousands of individuals treated, it’s not overly concerning to us in this malignant setting right now,” he said.
“We’ve put out some initial guidance here about what we’re asking for: long-term monitoring; asking that providers, if they see a new T-cell malignancy, contact manufacturers, contact us so that we can get the data we need to understand the frequency of these events. But just make no mistake, the overall risk benefit profile here is still incredibly beneficial,” Marks said. “Over the coming months, as we learn more, we will adapt and update our information.”
This secondary cancer risk associated with CAR-T therapies will not necessarily change the way oncologist Dr. Eric Smith treats his patients, he said.
“The benefits of CAR T cell therapies continue to substantially outweigh the risks for our patients,” Smith, director of translational research for immune effector cell therapies, like CAR-T cell therapies, at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, said in an email Wednesday.
“These cases, and the potential for secondary cancers is and should be taken seriously, however, it will not have a major impact on treatment approaches for the FDA-approved therapies. Patients who require these therapies often have a high chance of dying from their current cancers and CAR T cell therapies have been transformative in terms of the response rates and durability of responses for patients with these relapsed or refractory blood cancers,” he said. “Given the low rate of these secondary malignancies, it is important that we can continue to administer CAR T cell therapies to our patients in need of them.”
Dr. Mikkael Sekeres, professor and chief of the Division of Hematology at the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center in Miami, said he doesn’t think patients should be any more concerned about the risks associated with CAR-T therapy than they would be for other cancer therapies.

“When we offer treatments for cancer, unfortunately there are no free rides – every effective cancer therapy has the potential to cause side effects. CAR-T cell therapies are often offered to people who have lymphomas, leukemia, or multiple myeloma that has returned after standard therapy, and they work really, really well,” he said in an email Wednesday.
“I will still recommend CAR-T cell therapies for my patients as I always have, and will incorporate a discussion of the risk of another cancer, just as I do with other cancer treatments,” Sekeres said. “I applaud the FDA for including the additional risk in the safety labeling for CAR-T Cell therapy so all of us – physician and patient alike – go into a treatment approach with eyes wide open.”"
UBRIIQOTXU_Y2023L6EDDG3E8B,Macy’s rejects a $5.8 billion unsolicited takeover offer,"By Jordan Valinsky, CNN","2 minute read Published 7:21 AM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240122,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/22/business/macys-rejects-arhouse-bid/,"Macy’s has rejected a $5.8 billion offer to take the 165-year-old retailer private, announcing late Sunday that the “unsolicited proposal lacks compelling value.”
Last month, Arkhouse Management, a real estate-focused investing firm, and Brigade Capital Management, a global asset manager, offered to buy the remaining Macy’s shares it doesn’t own at a 32% premium.
The company on Sunday responded to the proposal more than a month after it was offered, disclosing in a statement that its board of directors and management “has determined not to enter into a non-disclosure agreement or provide any due diligence information to Arkhouse and Brigade.”
Macy’s CEO Jeff Gennette said the proposal is “not actionable and that it fails to provide compelling value to Macy’s shareholders,” adding that the retailer continues “to be open to opportunities that are in the best interests of the company and all of our shareholders.”
Arkhouse, however, isn’t backing down. The firm responded to Macy’s late Sunday, saying that it sees a potential for a “meaningful increase to our original proposal if we are granted access to the necessary due diligence.”

The firm also cited Macy’s shares soaring 17% after the proposal was revealed in December, adding that Arkhouse believes “Macy’s investors support a privatization given the stock’s largest single-day gain in more than two years following media reports of our interest in acquiring the company.”
Macy’s (M) shares fell about 12% in the past month but bounced 2% higher in premarket trading.
Last week, Macy’s announced it was laying off about 3.5% of its workforce, or roughly 2,350 employees, and closing five stores as it continues to shrink its massive retail business amid the online-shopping era.
The company first opened in 1858 and now operates about 500 Macy’s branded stores, as well as 55 of the more upscale Bloomingdale’s chain.
Macy’s has attempted numerous strategies in recent years to revitalize its business, such as new brands and smaller stores, but the moves have not altered its long-term trajectory.
Its stock price has dropped 75% from a peak of $73 a share in 2015. Since then, it has closed nearly 300 stores — almost one-third — leaving about 700 across its brands.

UD8Y7JHGOW_LO1TL70N893JVXE,Gaza endgame: Inching toward a deal to end the war,"Analysis by Elliott Gotkine, CNN","5 minute read Published 1:55 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/25/middleeast/gaza-endgame-analysis-intl/,"As the Gaza war nears its fifth month, with more than 25,000 Palestinians - civilians and combatants - dead and Israel nowhere close to achieving its objective of destroying Hamas, no one seems to have come up with a concrete proposal that’s palatable to both parties to pause the conflict, let alone end it. But there are suggestions, however half-baked, from both sides, that show a willingness to talk.
Indeed, Qatar - the main go-between - says there are “serious discussions” with Israel and Hamas, and is receiving “constant replies” from both sides. They’re not “negotiations” yet, says the White House. But with indirect talks ongoing, we seem to be inching towards what Ofer Shelah, Senior Researcher with Israel’s Institute for National Security Studies (INSS), describes as a “Zopa” - a zone of possible agreement.
On Monday Axios reported Israel had proposed a two-month truce in exchange for the release of all the 100-plus hostages still held in Gaza. Later that day CNN learned that Mossad chief David Barnea had suggested allowing Hamas leaders to go into exile as part of a broader ceasefire. On Tuesday, The Wall Street Journal said Hamas was now open to releasing some of the hostages in exchange for a pause in the fighting. And Reuters reported that Israel and Hamas had agreed in principle to a one-month truce, during which abductees would be freed and Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails released.
The sticking point there appears to be that Hamas wants a “package deal” which would include a second-phase agreement to end the war. But even if Israel were to okay this, it’s unlikely to feel compelled to keep its word. “I don’t think even [Hamas leader Yahya] Sinwar is under the impression that any hostage deal would in fact end the Israel-Hamas conflict,” Shelah tells CNN. “Either they don’t want to do a deal,” he says, or it’s just posturing for domestic consumption.
So how about exile? For now, at least, that seems a non-starter. Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani reportedly told US Secretary of State Antony Blinken that it “would never work.” Hamas leaders, it’s understood, would rather go down fighting in Gaza. They know living abroad wouldn’t stop them being knocked off by the Mossad. Unlike PLO founder Yasser Arafat, who went from exile in Beirut to exile in Tunis, Gaza is home to Hamas’ senior leadership. Moreover, even Israel doesn’t seem overly keen. “The exile of Sinwar is not Israel’s position and has not been offered by Israel,” a senior Israeli government official told me.
Related article Exclusive: Israel’s spy chief proposed  Hamas leaders leave Gaza as part of broader ceasefire talks
And while emissaries are talking, and the IDF and Hamas are fighting, pressure on the Israeli government to bring the hostages home is growing. Over the weekend, protesters camped outside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s home to demand a deal to bring them home. “Right now someone is being raped in a tunnel,” former hostage Aviva Siegel told the Knesset on Tuesday. On Wednesday, they held a day of action, blocking roads. On Thursday, they blocked humanitarian aid deliveries to Gaza. It also emerged that Netanyahu had taken to blaming Qatar for slow progress in getting the hostages freed - prompting a rebuke from the emirate’s foreign ministry.
An all-for-all deal is another option that’s been mooted since October 7. In other words, freeing all Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails - including those whom Israel says have blood on their hands - in exchange for freeing all the hostages. But even if such a scenario were on the table, a survey published by the Israel Democracy Institute on Wednesday found more than half of Israelis would be against it.
For now, though, such talk remains moot, with an Israeli official telling CNN there’s no concrete deal on the table. Pummeling Hamas, says former IDF General Israel Ziv, ought to help. “There is no doubt there’s not a single Israeli who doesn’t want the hostages home,” he tells CNN. “But at the same time we can’t gamble on the future of Israel [by leaving Hamas in control of Gaza]. And to have both we need to apply the most military pressure in order to get the maximum position in negotiations.”
Ziv reckons it will take up to a month longer for the IDF to crush Hamas brigades in Khan Younis, in southern Gaza, where intense fighting has been taking place; an UNRWA shelter there was struck on Wednesday, killing at least a dozen displaced Palestinians. Any deal Israel is looking to seal, says Ziv, would be more likely to come into effect once the Khan Younis operation is complete.
Of course, the endgame in Gaza isn’t only subject to military considerations, hostage families demanding a deal, or even pressure from the United States to wind things down. There’s also politics. The latest polls spell disaster for the career of Israel’s longest-serving leader. One recent survey found more than half of all Israelis believe Netanyahu’s war policies are born of self-interest. Gadi Eisenkot, a former chief of staff who sits in the war cabinet and whose own son was recently killed in Gaza, says he doesn’t believe that’s the case, but he does say that destroying Hamas is unrealistic.
With that in mind, this round of the Israel-Hamas war probably won’t be the last. “Israel should agree to almost any kind of deal that brings the hostages home,” says the INSS’s Shelah. “Because it won’t be the end of the war anyway.”"
UH7WEFE3W3_NG61UTB4SJKV1JB,GOP senators seethe as Trump blows up delicate immigration compromise,"By Manu Raju, Melanie Zanona, Lauren Fox and Ted Barrett, CNN","7 minute read Updated 8:52 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/25/politics/gop-senators-angry-trump-immigration-deal/,"Senior Senate Republicans are furious that Donald Trump may have killed an emerging bipartisan deal over the southern border, depriving them of a key legislative achievement on a pressing national priority and offering a preview of what’s to come with Trump as their likely presidential nominee.
In recent weeks, Trump has been lobbying Republicans both in private conversations and in public statements on social media to oppose the border compromise being delicately hashed out in the Senate, according to GOP sources familiar with the conversations – in part because he wants to campaign on the issue this November and doesn’t want President Joe Biden to score a victory in an area where he is politically vulnerable.
Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell acknowledged in a private meeting on Wednesday that Trump’s animosity toward the yet-to-be-released border deal puts Republicans in a serious bind as they try to move forward on the already complex issue. For weeks, Republicans have been warning that Trump’s opposition could blow up the bipartisan proposal, but the admission from McConnell was particularly striking, given he has been a chief advocate for a border-Ukraine package.
Now, Republicans on Capitol Hill are grappling with the reality that most in the GOP are loathe to do anything that is seen as potentially undermining the former president. And the prospects of a deal being scuttled before it has even been finalized has sparked tensions and confusion in the Senate GOP as they try to figure out if, and how, to proceed – even as McConnell made clear during party lunches Thursday that he remains firmly behind the effort to strike a deal, according to attendees.
“I think the border is a very important issue for Donald Trump. And the fact that he would communicate to Republican senators and congresspeople that he doesn’t want us to solve the border problem because he wants to blame Biden for it is … really appalling,” said GOP Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, who has been an outspoken critic of Trump.
He added, “But the reality is that, that we have a crisis at the border, the American people are suffering as a result of what’s happening at the border. And someone running for president not to try and get the problem solved. as opposed to saying, ‘hey, save that problem. Don’t solve it. Let me take credit for solving it later.’”
GOP Sen. Todd Young of Indiana called any efforts to disrupt the ongoing negotiations “tragic” and said: “I hope no one is trying to take this away for campaign purposes.”
“I would encourage (chief Senate GOP negotiator) James Lankford and other conservatives to produce a work product with which they will shortly allow conservatives like myself to review it and take heart that there are a number of us who won’t be looking to third parties and assessing the propriety of passing this bipartisan proposal,” Young said.
It’s an all-too-familiar dynamic for the Republicans who served while Trump was in office, where he could easily derail legislative action on Capitol Hill with the blast of a single tweet or stir up a new controversy that Republicans were forced to respond to. And with Trump now marching toward the presidential nomination, Republicans are once again bracing for life with him as the nominee.
Underscoring just how damaging Trump’s comments and campaign to kill the border deal have been in the Senate, one GOP senator on condition of background told CNN that without Trump, this deal would have had overwhelming support within the conference.
“This proposal would have had almost unanimous Republican support if it weren’t for Donald Trump,” the Republican senator said.
GOP Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina – who has also been involved in the talks – said he didn’t know if anyone could convince Trump to not kill the deal. But he acknowledged that it would take some “courage” for members to be able to press ahead at this point in defiance of Trump – though Tillis argued it would ultimately be beneficial for Trump for them to pass a border security deal and help address the flow of migrants trying to enter the country.
“I think this is when members of the Senate have to show some courage and do something that at the end of the day will be very helpful for President Trump,” Tillis said.
Asked whether it was a mistake for Trump to be assailing this deal, Tillis said: “I’ll leave it to him to figure out how he needs to get into office. I hope you’ll leave it to some of us who would support that effort to give him the tools he needs to really manage the border and the abuse and the dangerous situation we have today.”
For his part, McConnell – who has had zero relationship with Trump since the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack – downplayed Trump’s opposition saying, “It’s not anything new,” and insisting they were not abandoning the talks.
“We’re still working,” McConnell said. “Trying to get an outcome.”
Sen. John Thune, the no. 2 Senate Republican, said the discussions have reached a critical moment but acknowledged they may need to turn to a “plan B.”
“If we can’t get there, then we’ll go to plan B,” Thune said. “But I think for now at least, there are still attempts being made to try and reach a conclusion that would satisfy a lot of Republicans.”
In the latest sign that the emerging border deal faces an uphill climb, a senior leadership aide to House GOP Leader Steve Scalise told a group of Senate Republican chiefs of staff on Thursday that it was dead on arrival in the House, according to a source familiar.
Senate Republicans on the fence about the proposal may be less inclined to back it, knowing it’s going nowhere in the House and knowing Trump wants a border deal killed.
Frustration reigned inside the Senate GOP on Thursday amid lingering confusion over the status of a deal.
While McConnell has said the talks are still proceeding, Young warned Republican leadership against pulling the plug before they’ve taken a thorough temperature check inside the conference, where a contingent of Republicans are still fighting for a deal.
“I think leadership needs to count noses before they make any impulsive decisions,” he said.
Pressed on whether it was realistic to pass a border deal with Trump opposing it, Young said: “It may be possible. Listen, I’m very much attuned to the political realities, but I think before you make these consequential decisions on behalf of this conference, you’ve got to consult with the conference.”
Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who has been openly critical of McConnell, said he was “puzzled” by the leader’s comments during the closed-door meeting on Wednesday, which was supposed to be focused on Ukraine.
“I mean, we were talking about funding for Ukraine and all of the sudden he brings up the border and then, again, lays out what I consider a pretty lame excuse, trying to shift blame to President Trump for, I would say, his failed negotiation, not James Lankford,” Johnson said. “James Lankford has worked his tail off. It’s McConnell that took away the leverage by not tying Ukraine funding to actually securing the border.”
Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who has made no secret of her frustration with Trump over the years, said members need to remember how big this moment is for the border and for Ukraine and put their own politics aside.
“I’m not giving up. This is not about Trump and this is not about me. This is about our country. This is about democracy around the world. This is about security for our own country and so let’s keep pushing to get this border deal,” she said. “Let’s stand by the commitments that we have made for our friends and our allies so that our word actually means something.”
This is the second time in six years Trump killed or was actively trying to kill a bipartisan immigration deal as it emerged. Back in 2018, Murkowski was part of bipartisan talks over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. The bill got 54 votes in the Senate, but not enough to get it over the finish line.
Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, one of the Democrats involved in the border talks, expressed frustration about Trump seeking to inject chaos into the situation.
“I think over the next 24 to 48 hours, they are going to make a decision as to whether they want to do this, or whether the forces surrounding Donald Trump – who want to keep chaos at the border – win,” Murphy said. “So they have a decision to make. I hope they make that decision very quickly. We have an agreement that is 95% written and is ready to get to the floor if Republicans decide that they actually want to solve the problem.”

UI2QMB44MK_S04XZXPWJSZSXNX,Klimt portrait missing for nearly a century could sell for $54 million,"By Lianne Kolirin, CNN","4 minute read Published 8:21 AM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/26/style/klimt-portrait-missing-auction-intl-scli/,"A portrait by Gustav Klimt that was unseen for almost a century is expected to fetch millions when it goes up for auction this spring.
The “Portrait of Fräulein Lieser,” thought to be one of the Austrian painter’s final works, is expected to fetch up to $54 million at a sale that has created huge excitement in the art world.
Related article Klimt’s ‘last masterpiece’ sells for record-breaking $108.4 million
The painting had long been considered lost, according to Vienna auction house im Kinsky. However, it has now emerged that it had been privately owned by an Austrian  citizen.
“The rediscovery of this portrait, one of the most beautiful of Klimt’s last creative period, is a sensation,” the auction house said in a press statement on its website.
The intensely vivid and colorful piece had been documented in catalogues of the artist’s work, but experts had only seen it in a black and white photo.
The sitter is known to have been a member of a wealthy Austrian Jewish family who were then part of the upper class of Viennese society, where Klimt found his patrons and clients. Nevertheless, her identity is not completely certain.
Brothers Adolf and Justus Lieser were leading industrialists in the Austro-Hungarian empire. Catalogues of Klimt’s work state that Adolf commissioned the artist to paint his teenage daughter Margarethe Constance. However, new research by the auction house suggests Justus’ wife, Lilly, hired him to paint one of their two daughters.
The statement on the auctioneer’s website reveals that the sitter - whoever she was - visited Klimt’s studio nine times in April and May 1917. He made at least 25 preliminary studies and most likely began the painting in the May of that year.
“The painter chose a three-quarter portrait for his depiction and shows the young woman in a strictly frontal pose, close to the foreground, against a red, undefined background. A cape richly decorated with flowers is draped around her shoulders,” the auction house said.

It added: “The intense colors of the painting and the shift towards loose, open brushstrokes show Klimt at the height of his late period.”
When the artist died of a stroke the following February, the painting was still in his studio - with some small parts not quite finished. It was then given to the Lieser family.
Its exact fate after 1925 is “unclear,” according to the auction house.
“What is known is that it was acquired by a legal predecessor of the consignor in the 1960s and went to the current owner through three successive inheritances,” the statement said.
The painting is to be sold on behalf of its Austrian owners, who have not been named, along with the legal successors of “Adolf and Henriette Lieser based on an agreement in accordance with the Washington Principles of 1998,” the auction house said.
Established in 1998, the Washington Principles charged participating nations with returning Nazi-confiscated art to their rightful owners.
Claudia Mörth-Gasser, specialist in modern art at im Kinsky, explained the situation in an email to CNN.

She said the auctioneer checked the painting’s history and provenance “in all possible ways in Austria,” adding: “We have checked all archives and have found no evidence that the painting has ever been exported out of Austria, confiscated or looted.
But by the same token, she added: “We have no proof that the painting has not ever been looted in the time gap between 1938 and 1945.”
And this  is the reason “why we arranged an agreement between the present owner and all descendants of the Lieser family in accordance to the ‘Washington Principles,’” she said.
Klimt’s portraits of women “are seldom offered at auctions,” the press release states. It continues: “A painting of such rarity, artistic significance, and value has not been available on the art market in Central Europe for decades.
The painting will tour internationally ahead of the sale on April 24, stopping in Switzerland, Germany, Britain and Hong Kong.
The last portrait completed by Klimt became the most expensive artwork ever to sell at a European auction, when it fetched a staggering £85.3 million ($108.4 million) in London last year.
Depicting an unidentified female subject, “Dame mit Fächer” (Lady with a Fan) also established a new record for Klimt, outselling “Birch Forest,” which went for $104.6 million in a sale from the collection of the late Microsoft co-founder Paul G. Allen in 2022."
ULDR9O9WAZ_BB1HJJPTNQ99LJI,British zoo has new plan to rehabilitate its potty-mouthed parrots,"By Issy Ronald, CNN","3 minute read Published 12:11 PM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/23/travel/lincolnshire-wildlife-park-potty-mouthed-parrots-intl-scli-scn-gbr/,"A British wildlife park has hatched a new plan to rehabilitate its potty-mouthed parrots after they unleashed a tide of expletives.
Back in 2020, five foul-mouthed African gray parrots, donated to Lincolnshire Wildlife Park in eastern England, were isolated from the flock in an attempt to improve their language.
But, from Tuesday, the team is adopting a different, riskier approach of integrating three newly donated, cuss-happy birds – named Eric, Captain and Sheila – alongside the original five miscreants into the flock.
“When we came to move them, the language that came out of their carrying boxes was phenomenal, really bad. Not normal swear words, these were proper expletives,” the park’s chief executive, Steve Nichols, told CNN.

“We’ve put eight really, really offensive, swearing parrots with 92 non-swearing ones,” he said.
If the new strategy works, the eight parrots could learn “all the nice noises like microwaves and vehicles reversing” that the other parrots in the flock favor, Nichols added. But if the other 92 instead pick up the expletives, “it’s going to turn into some adult aviary.”
After some time in isolation, integrating the five original birds into the flock was “mostly” successful, Nichols said, but they still curse sometimes, and even laugh afterward, mimicking the most common reaction to their foul language.
Parrots precisely echo the sounds they hear, so “six of them have got men’s voices, two of them have got ladies’ voices and when they’re all swearing it does sound really bad,” Nichols explained.

The park has installed large signs warning visitors about the parrots’ language, but Nichols said it hasn’t received a single complaint.
In fact, historically, “we did hear a lot more customers swearing at parrots than we did parrots swearing at customers,” Nichols said.
African grays are highly social parrots, forming groups of up to 1,000 birds to roost at night in the wild, and communicating with each other through various calls.
Researchers believe their intelligence is almost unparalleled in the animal kingdom, comparable to that of apes, whales and dolphins.
Expletives are particularly easy to mimic for African grays since they are almost always said in the same tone and context, without any other words surrounding them, Nichols explained.
“When you tell someone to eff off, you usually say it the same every time,” he said.
For now, the park is hoping they will learn the sounds of the flock, and mend their potty-mouthed ways.
“I’ve just left them up there and there’s lots of noises, which is brilliant … from squeaking gates to doors slamming, people laughing and mobile phones,” Nichols said.
“I’m hoping that’s part of the settling-in period, but I don’t think they will ever lose the swear because as soon as somebody swears, they’ll be swearing as well.”"

BFMTV reported that the boy had been left to live alone in the family’s apartment in the town of Nersac in the Charente region for two years, from 2020 to 2022, and appeared to survive on cake, canned goods, and stolen tomatoes.
According to BFMTV, the child’s mother lived with her partner in another apartment five kilometers (3.1 miles) away and would only visit the child from “time to time.”
The Mayor of Nersac, Barbara Couturier, as reported by BFMTV, said the child often did not have hot water or heating. Nevertheless, he continued attending school during this time and was a good student, Couturier also stated.
Couturier said she alerted the local and national police about the situation after the mother asked social services to help buy food.

“I met his mom on May 2022. She came to tell us that she had financial problems, and we gave her four vouchers for food, but she took some processed food products instead so that got me suspicious. Some residents told me that there was a child living alone, so I connected the two things and I called the local police and the national police,” Couturier explained.
Couturier stated that the child had been under the care of social services since September 19, 2022.

UNT1MQAOXR_8M4096B8AGYSSBR,Former Trump adviser Peter Navarro sentenced to 4 months in jail for defying congressional subpoena,"By Devan Cole and Holmes Lybrand, CNN","4 minute read Updated 11:33 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/25/politics/peter-navarro-contempt-congress-sentence/,"Peter Navarro was sentenced Thursday to four months in jail for contempt of Congress after defying a subpoena related to the congressional investigation into the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack.
Navarro was convicted on two counts of contempt of Congress in September for not complying with a subpoena from the House select committee that investigated the attack.
The judge overseeing Navarro’s case said Thursday that the former Trump adviser’s sentence is of his “own making” as he tore into Navarro for claiming that his prosecution was politically motivated.
“I guess what bothers me ultimately is that here we are after a year and a half plus and you still want to suggest to me that this is a political prosecution. You want me to believe this is a political prosecution,” US District Judge Amit Mehta said during the sentencing hearing, raising his voice. “When the evidence is completely to the contrary.”
“You are not a victim. You are not the object of a political prosecution,” the judge said. “These are the circumstances of your own making.”
Mehta also fined Navarro $9,500.
Navarro quickly appealed the case on Thursday to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. His attorneys have long said they plan to file an appeal to raise issues related to his claim that he didn’t comply with the subpoena because Trump had invoked executive privilege.
Each count carries a mandatory minimum sentence of one month in prison, but prosecutors had asked Mehta to sentence Navarro to six months for each count – running concurrently – and fine him $200,000.
They told the judge last week that a sentence of one month apiece for the two counts “is insufficient to account for, punish, and deter the Defendant’s criminal offenses,” arguing that Navarro’s decision to not comply with the subpoenas was akin to the conduct of some of the people who participated in the riot.
“The Defendant, like the rioters at the Capitol, put politics, not country, first, and stonewalled Congress’s investigation,” prosecutors wrote. “The Defendant chose allegiance to former President Donald Trump over the rule of law.”
Navarro’s conviction and sentence represents another key victory for the now-disbanded House January 6 committee in its efforts to have the Justice Department criminally pursue individuals who refused to cooperate with its probe.

Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon was convicted in 2022 on two contempt counts and later sentenced to four months in prison. Bannon’s case is currently on appeal.
Navarro’s attorneys are seeking a sentence of no more than six months of probation for each count, and they asked Mehta last week to pause the sentence he imposes as they appeal the conviction.
Navarro’s trial last September moved quickly, with it taking less than a day for the jury to hear all the evidence in the case.
Prosecutors put just three witnesses on the stand, all former staff members of the House January 6 committee. The Justice Department used its testimony to make the case that the committee had good reason to subpoena Navarro and that he was informed repeatedly of its demands.
Prosecutor Elizabeth Aloi told the jury in closing arguments that Navarro “had knowledge about a plan to delay the activities of Congress on January 6,” and that he was “more than happy” to air that knowledge in public remarks, but not to the House committee.
Navarro’s attorneys did not put on any witnesses of their own, instead focusing on part of the contempt charge that required a showing that Navarro was willful and deliberate in his decision not to comply with the subpoena – meaning that his lack of compliance was not the result of an inadvertent mistake or accident.

Navarro has insisted that he didn’t comply with the subpoena at the direction of Trump, who he claimed invoked executive privilege in the matter. But ahead of trial, Mehta concluded that Navarro had not carried his burden in proving that Trump had formally asserted a privilege or a testimonial immunity that would have allowed his former aide to not even appear to answer the committee’s questions.
The former aide has said he plans to raise that issue and others on appeal.
“The appeal of this case will definitely answer what is required of a former President to invoke executive privilege as to their senior advisors and no future advisor will be in the same position of not knowing that the President they served had not properly invoked the privilege,” his attorneys wrote in court papers.
The federal appeals court in DC is currently considering Bannon’s bid to overturn his own contempt of Congress conviction.
During oral arguments last year, some members of a three-judge panel handling the appeal appeared skeptical of arguments advanced by Bannon’s attorney that the trial court judge who oversaw Bannon’s criminal case erred when they declined to let him assert executive privilege as part of his defense, and that the ex-adviser was simply acting on the advice of his then-attorney when he didn’t comply with the subpoena.

UPCH5E5FHM_24E0NS3UGX4BZ4G,Why both South Africa and Israel are welcoming the UN court’s ruling in a landmark genocide case,"Analysis by Nadeen Ebrahim and Abbas Al Lawati, CNN","4 minute read Updated 10:13 AM EST, Sat January 27, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/26/middleeast/israel-genocide-case-icj-ruling-analysis-mime-intl/,"Editor’s Note: A version of this story appears in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here.
A historic ruling by the United Nations’ top court in a genocide case against Israel on Friday was welcomed by the three main parties it involved: Israel, South Africa and the Palestinians. But at the same time, no one got what they asked for.
The International Court of Justice in The Hague, the Netherlands, ordered Israel to “take all measures” to prevent genocide in Gaza after South Africa accused Israel of violating international laws on genocide in its war in the territory.
It rejected Israel’s request for the case to be thrown out, but it also stopped short of ordering Israel to halt the war as South Africa has asked.
“I would have wanted a ceasefire,” said South African foreign minister Naledi Pandor after the ruling in The Hague. She said that she was still satisfied with the outcome.
Israel went to war with Hamas in Gaza after the Palestinian militant group launched a brutal attack on the country on October 7, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 people hostage.
The war has resulted in the death of more than 26,000 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, and left much of the enclave in ruins. Israel has pledged not to stop its campaign until all the remaining hostages are released and Hamas is destroyed.

The case at the ICJ marks  the first time Israel has been brought before the court on accusations of violating the 1948 UN Genocide Convention, which was drafted in part due to the mass killings of Jewish people in the Holocaust during the Second World War.
Still, many Israelis hailed the ruling on Friday as a win for the Jewish state. Eylon Levi, an Israeli government spokesperson, said the court “dismissed (South Africa’s) ridiculous demand to tell Israel to stop defending its people and fighting for the hostages.” Avi Mayer, the former editor in chief of the Jerusalem Post called it “a devastating blow to those accusing the Jewish state of ‘genocide’.”
“The most dramatic thing is that no ceasefire was ordered,” Shelly Aviv Yeini, head of the international law department at the Hostages and Missing Persons Families Forum, told CNN, adding that a potential ceasefire order was Israel’s biggest fear, especially as it would have come as over a hundred hostages remain in Gaza.
The discourse in Israel has so far focused on only ending the war once the hostages are freed, she said, adding that Israel would have “struggled to live” with a ceasefire order that doesn’t guarantee the return of the captives.
“So, I think this is quite (an) expected outcome, and something that Israel will be able to comply with,” she said, adding that the court’s order for Israel to deliver humanitarian aid and report back to the ICJ on its actions is “doable.”
Despite the outcome being perceived by some as being in Israel’s favor, experts warned of the reputational damage faced by the Jewish state.
“I would not call it a win, but I would say it could have been worse,” Robbie Sabel, professor of international law at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, told CNN. “The fact that in public eyes there’ll be an association that Israel’s acts could have led to genocide, clearly this is harmful public relations.”
Friday’s measure was an interim measure by the ICJ as the court considers a full ruling on whether Israel is guilty of violating the Genocide Convention. That ruling could take years.
Sabel said that while he is “absolutely convinced” that the ICJ will eventually find Israel not guilty of genocide, he worries that by that time “the public may have forgotten that.”
“If they had asked us to stop defending ourselves, we would have had a problem, and at least we don’t have that problem,” he said.
Yeini said it was nonetheless a “a very dark day” in Israel’s history.
For some Palestinians, however, the court’s ruling didn’t go far enough.
Mohammed el-Kurd, a Palestinian activist from Jerusalem, said the ICJ failed on South Africa’s “most important request” to suspend the military operations. “Not shocking, but stings nonetheless,” he said on X, formerly Twitter.
“Until the Israeli regime’s genocidal assault on Gaza stops, we should keep protesting and disrupting in every way possible. This is today’s lesson,” he said.

UQ3DCJ3VEU_PZ5UHYG2KXAMW0N,Austin delivers virtual remarks in first public appearance since hospitalization,"By Haley Britzky, CNN","2 minute read Published 9:22 AM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/23/politics/lloyd-austin-public-appearance/,"Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Tuesday made his first public appearance since he was hospitalized over complications of a procedure to treat prostate cancer, delivering opening remarks at a virtual meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group.
Speaking from a nondescript white room with the Department of Defense seal behind him, and small American and Ukrainian flags set on what appeared to be a printer or fax machine, Austin reiterated his support for Ukraine and thanked foreign allies for their security assistance.
The meeting comes as Congress continues debating a national security supplemental aid package, which would include funding for Ukraine assistance. In his remarks, Austin called for more aid to Ukraine and said that there has been “no credible evidence of the misuse or illicit diversion of American equipment” provided to Ukraine.
“If we lose our nerve, if we flinch, if we fail to deter other would-be aggressors, we will only invite even more bloodshed and more chaos. So a sovereign and secure Ukraine is critical to global security,” Austin said. “And we must not waver in our support for Ukraine.”
Austin is working remotely from home since he was released from the hospital on January 15, where he spent two weeks being treated for complications from a prostate cancer procedure in December. A Pentagon statement earlier this month said he would have “full access” to secure communications capabilities while he was working remotely.
His doctors have said that he is expected to “make a full recovery” and that his cancer prognosis is “excellent.”
Austin’s failure to notify the White House, Congress and the media about his hospitalization for several days has resulted in a number of inquiries and probes. Lawmakers have requested answers about the notification process and Austin’s chief of staff — who was identified as the point of failure for notifying other officials because she was sick — announced an internal review of notification procedures. The Pentagon inspector general announced it will be carrying out its own review of what happened.
After it was revealed he was in the hospital, Austin said he took “full responsibility for my decisions about disclosure” and committed to “doing better.”"
UY3TO3D52W_SJRICJZQKX9M13B,Judge puts deposition of Fulton County DA on hold while ordering divorce records of her lead prosecutor unsealed,"By Holmes Lybrand, Hannah Rabinowitz, Nick Valencia and Jason Morris, CNN","3 minute read Updated 2:43 PM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240122,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/22/politics/fani-willis-nathan-wade/,"The deposition of Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis has been put on pause in the divorce proceedings of her lead prosecutor in the Georgia election subversion case, a judge decided Monday.
Willis’ testimony is being sought by the wife of special prosecutor Nathan Wade, who was hired by Willis several years ago to pursue the criminal case against former President Donald Trump and his allies over efforts to overturn the 2020 election.
Allegations of an improper romantic relationship between Willis and Wade first came to light in the Trump case as part of an effort to get that case dismissed. The alleged affair also has been raised in Wade’s divorce from Joycelyn Wade, who is seeking more information about Nathan Wade’s finances.
Judge Henry Thompson said during the hearing in Cobb County Superior Court on Monday that “it seems to me that Mr. Wade would be the first and best source of what his income has been and how he’s been spending it, and that he would have firsthand knowledge of whether he is engaged in an extramarital affair.”
“Only after I hear what Mr. Wade has to say do think I can make a determination of whether the proposed opponent has any unique knowledge about these issues,” Thompson said of Willis’ potential testimony.
In a court filing Friday, Joycelyn Wade included credit card statements showing Nathan Wade purchased airline tickets for Willis to accompany him on trips to Miami and San Francisco in recent years.
For her part, Willis has suggested in court filings that Joycelyn Wade is using the divorce proceedings to harass the district attorney and damage her reputation and is “obstructing and interfering with an ongoing criminal prosecution.”
On Monday, Joycelyn Wade’s attorneys pushed the judge to order Willis to testify, saying the district attorney “is trying to hide under the shield of her position” to avoiding sitting for a deposition that had been set for Tuesday in the divorce case.
“We’re not seeking her deposition as the district attorney of Fulton County,” Joycelyn Wade’s attorney Andrea Dyer Hastings said. “We’re seeking her deposition in her individual capacity as the alleged paramour of my client’s husband.”
Thompson also ruled Monday that records in the divorce proceedings should be unsealed, noting that court rules require a hearing before sealing such records and that such a hearing never took place.
The judge said he’d put in a written order regarding the unsealing later Monday.
The controversy surrounding the alleged affair between Willis and Nathan Wade has led to the circulation of a comment Willis made in 2020, when she told a local public access station that it would be “inappropriate for the No. 1 law enforcement officer in the state” to have a relationship with an employee. She added that she would not date people “that work under me” and reposted clips from the interview on her Facebook page in April of that year.
Willis’ office has not responded to multiple CNN requests for comment about the video.

UZG8VUAIS4_22JGY1O4KZ47RCE,Biden’s abortion rights rally in Virginia beset by repeated protests over his handling of Gaza,"By Michael Williams and Donald Judd, CNN","5 minute read Updated 8:27 AM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/23/politics/biden-harris-abortion-rights/,"President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris rallied voters in Virginia during their first joint campaign appearance on Tuesday, seeking to emphasize the stakes for reproductive rights in the 2024 election.
“The Supreme Court did what it had never done before,” Biden said at the Manassas rally, which came one day after what would have been the 51st anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision, which had established a constitutional right to abortion. “They ripped away a fundamental constitutional right that was in place for nearly 50 years.”
“Let there be no mistake: The person most responsible for taking away this freedom in America is Donald Trump,” Biden added.
But as Biden sought to reinforce his administration’s biggest selling point against the Republican front-runner, its biggest weakness with young voters was on full display in the crowd, as protesters who oppose his support for Israel in its war against Hamas repeatedly interrupted the president.
The interruptions began as Biden was delivering his first line. A male protester unfurled a Palestinian flag and shouted, “Genocide Joe — how many Palestinian children have to die?” The president paused his speech and looked toward the man.
A second and third protester followed shortly after, prompting chants from the crowd of “Four more years!”
After a fourth protester, Biden broke from his prepared remarks to say, “They care deeply.” And at protester five Biden acknowledged, “This is going to go on for a while.”
All told, the president was interrupted about a dozen times. Eventually, the crowd urged Biden to keep speaking, and the president ignored further outbursts from the crowd.
The hectic rally and Biden’s seemingly futile attempts to keep the crowd focused on reproductive rights represent a new normal for the president, who has repeatedly been interrupted by protesters criticizing his administration’s stance on Israel and his refusal to call for a ceasefire in Gaza.
He was also interrupted by protesters while delivering a speech on democracy near Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, and while speaking at a church in Charleston, South Carolina, earlier this month.
He’s often appeared conciliatory toward those protesters. “I understand the passion and I’ve been quietly working – been quietly working with the Israeli government to reduce – significantly get out of Gaza,” Biden said as the protesters were led out of his South Carolina remarks.
But still, the protests provide a window into Biden’s potential problems among young voters, Arab Americans and the most progressive flank of the Democratic Party.
At the rally, Harris also delivered a stark warning on abortion access in the wake of the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision, which overturned Roe.
“We all know 19 months ago, the highest court in our land – the court of Thurgood (Marshall) and RBG – took a constitutional right from the people of America, from the women of America, and in the 19 months since, in states across our nation, extremists have proposed and passed laws that criminalize doctors and punish women, laws that make no exception even for rape and incest,” she said.
The vice president blasted Trump for his role in gutting abortion rights, warning even more restrictive measures would follow if Republicans have their way.
“Across our nation, women are suffering – and let us be very clear about who was responsible: Former President Trump hand picked three Supreme Court justices because he intended for them to overturn Roe,” she said.
“He intended for them to take your freedoms, he is the architect of this health care crisis, and he is not done — and the extremists are not done,” she said.
Looking forward, Harris pledged the Biden administration’s support for safeguarding abortion access.
“We have a president who has a vision for our future, a future where reproductive freedom is protected for every woman, every person in America,” she said. “And we have a president who has – and this is so critically important – the compassion, as well as the determination and skill, to make our vision for our country and our future real.”
The Biden campaign is banking on abortion rights being one of the pivotal issues driving voters out against the GOP nominee in November. Nearly two-thirds of Americans polled after the 2022 decision that overturned Roe said they disagreed with the decision, according to a CNN Poll conducted by SSRS in the decision’s aftermath.
Biden’s campaign has also been homing in on recent comments made by Trump taking credit for the decision that overturned Roe. The former president faces a crucial night Tuesday in New Hampshire in his two-person race against Nikki Haley for the Republican nomination.
Harris, the administration’s point person on abortion rights, kicked off a “reproductive freedoms tour” this week with a Monday stop in Wisconsin. She is expected to travel “across the country” to hold a number of events bringing together “thousands of people,” her office previously said.
The campaign began hitting the airwaves in battleground states this week with ads featuring emotional testimony from a Texas woman who had to travel out of state to seek an abortion because of a state law banning abortions after six weeks of pregnancy.
“Donald Trump is the reason that more than 1 in 3 American women of reproductive age don’t have the freedom to make their own health care decisions. Now, he and MAGA Republicans are running to go even further if they retake the White House,” said Julie Chavez Rodriguez, the Biden campaign manager. “In 2024, a vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris is a vote to restore Roe, and a vote for Donald Trump is a vote to ban abortion across the country.”

V0FPXQBK5Z_01L9ONR424N83S1,Biden spoke with ceasefire advocates as his team grapples with reality of regular protests,"By MJ Lee and Kevin Liptak, CNN","4 minute read Published 7:00 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/25/politics/biden-ceasefire-advocates-protests/,"President Joe Biden was working a photoline backstage on Wednesday after receiving the United Auto Workers’ coveted political endorsement at its’ annual conference in Washington, DC, when a small group of union members supporting a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war approached him.
Biden briefly spoke with the members about their concerns, in an exchange that multiple people – including Michigan Rep. Debbie Dingell, who was present – described as “respectful” and “cordial.” The president also shook hands with the group and poised for photos, according to one source familiar with the matter. (Dingell declined to share other details with CNN, saying private conversations should remain precisely that.)
One attendee told CNN that prior to the UAW conference, they had reached out to the White House to offer them a courtesy note of caution: There were certain to be pro-ceasefire protesters in the audience. The union itself had endorsed a ceasefire in December.
The White House responded that the president was prepared to take some time to speak with those individuals if they asked to have that conversation with him, according to that attendee.
That attendee happened to be right: Biden’s remarks to the union members were interrupted by protesters, including one who unfurled a Palestinian flag and shouted: “Call for a humanitarian ceasefire!” The group was quickly led out of the room as Biden paused his speech.
Afterward, however, the president listened closely to the concerns of some union members backstage about the situation in Gaza before departing the venue to return to the White House.
“I know, he knows how to talk to people. It’s an issue we’re going to have to talk about and deal with,” Dingell said Wednesday on CNN.
Even as Biden remains staunchly supportive of Israel in its campaign against Hamas, aides say he is acutely aware of the anger and passion the war has generated, particularly among young progressives. The outcry would be hard for him to miss: protests have now sprung up during private fundraisers, at a Christmas tree lighting, outside the White House and ever near his secluded home in Delaware.
Biden’s conversation with the UAW members backstage following the speech interruption came the day after a campaign rally in northern Virginia that was paused more than a dozen times, including by people unfurling a banner reading “Genocide Joe.”
Advisers say the president and his team are prepared for his speeches to be interrupted going forward as the war in Gaza rages on, even if exactly when and where can be hard to predict. While aides have been irritated when protests obscure the message of the president’s speech, they say the moments aren’t out of the ordinary for a public figure.
Biden is also open to meeting with critics of his policies, White House officials say, as he navigates the fraught politics of the Gaza war.
At previous speeches, Biden has sought to succinctly explain his position to the people shouting in the audience: “I understand the passion and I’ve been quietly working with the Israeli government to reduce – significantly get out of Gaza,” Biden said as the protesters were led out.
At Tuesday’s speech – which was intended as a fiery defense of abortion rights, a galvanizing issue for Democrats – Biden flashed moments of irritation as protester after protester prevented him from proceeding with his speech.
“This is going to go on for a while,” he said when it had become clear the protesters had carefully planned their one-after-another interruptions.
Yet he did not publicly tell the protesters to quiet down or leave the venue – a distinction with his predecessor that his team has been eager to highlight. Volunteers and staff at events have also not attempted to bar people from attending, even if they suspect they will disrupt the president’s speech.
“I think what you saw yesterday was a president who understands and respects Americans’ fundamental First Amendment rights to peacefully protest. I think that stands in stark contrast to Donald Trump and the Republicans, who don’t seem to understand the same thing, who only want to use these situations to fan the flames and further divide people,” Biden campaign communications director Michael Tyler said Wednesday.
Since the October 7 Hamas terror attacks that launched the Gaza war, the administration has sought to engage Arab and Muslim American leaders in conversations about the conflict, including a meeting in October between Biden and leaders of community groups.
At that session – during which the leaders called for a ceasefire and encouraged Biden to show more empathy for Palestinians – the president listened and sought to clarify some of his positions, attendees said afterward.
Since then, however, the White House hasn’t publicly disclosed additional meetings between Biden and activists who are calling for a ceasefire.
“I can’t speak to a direct conversation that he’s had, but he hears from Americans all the time about their different views that they have,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said this week. “That is something that the president is very aware of.”"
V14R90QC10_1EMQFWQR0UZTSSI,Klimt portrait missing for nearly a century could sell for $54 million,"By Lianne Kolirin, CNN","4 minute read Published 8:21 AM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/26/style/klimt-portrait-missing-auction-intl-scli/,"A portrait by Gustav Klimt that was unseen for almost a century is expected to fetch millions when it goes up for auction this spring.
The “Portrait of Fräulein Lieser,” thought to be one of the Austrian painter’s final works, is expected to fetch up to $54 million at a sale that has created huge excitement in the art world.
Related article Klimt’s ‘last masterpiece’ sells for record-breaking $108.4 million
The painting had long been considered lost, according to Vienna auction house im Kinsky. However, it has now emerged that it had been privately owned by an Austrian  citizen.
“The rediscovery of this portrait, one of the most beautiful of Klimt’s last creative period, is a sensation,” the auction house said in a press statement on its website.
The intensely vivid and colorful piece had been documented in catalogues of the artist’s work, but experts had only seen it in a black and white photo.
The sitter is known to have been a member of a wealthy Austrian Jewish family who were then part of the upper class of Viennese society, where Klimt found his patrons and clients. Nevertheless, her identity is not completely certain.
Brothers Adolf and Justus Lieser were leading industrialists in the Austro-Hungarian empire. Catalogues of Klimt’s work state that Adolf commissioned the artist to paint his teenage daughter Margarethe Constance. However, new research by the auction house suggests Justus’ wife, Lilly, hired him to paint one of their two daughters.
The statement on the auctioneer’s website reveals that the sitter - whoever she was - visited Klimt’s studio nine times in April and May 1917. He made at least 25 preliminary studies and most likely began the painting in the May of that year.
“The painter chose a three-quarter portrait for his depiction and shows the young woman in a strictly frontal pose, close to the foreground, against a red, undefined background. A cape richly decorated with flowers is draped around her shoulders,” the auction house said.

It added: “The intense colors of the painting and the shift towards loose, open brushstrokes show Klimt at the height of his late period.”
When the artist died of a stroke the following February, the painting was still in his studio - with some small parts not quite finished. It was then given to the Lieser family.
Its exact fate after 1925 is “unclear,” according to the auction house.
“What is known is that it was acquired by a legal predecessor of the consignor in the 1960s and went to the current owner through three successive inheritances,” the statement said.
The painting is to be sold on behalf of its Austrian owners, who have not been named, along with the legal successors of “Adolf and Henriette Lieser based on an agreement in accordance with the Washington Principles of 1998,” the auction house said.
Established in 1998, the Washington Principles charged participating nations with returning Nazi-confiscated art to their rightful owners.
Claudia Mörth-Gasser, specialist in modern art at im Kinsky, explained the situation in an email to CNN.

She said the auctioneer checked the painting’s history and provenance “in all possible ways in Austria,” adding: “We have checked all archives and have found no evidence that the painting has ever been exported out of Austria, confiscated or looted.
But by the same token, she added: “We have no proof that the painting has not ever been looted in the time gap between 1938 and 1945.”
And this  is the reason “why we arranged an agreement between the present owner and all descendants of the Lieser family in accordance to the ‘Washington Principles,’” she said.
Klimt’s portraits of women “are seldom offered at auctions,” the press release states. It continues: “A painting of such rarity, artistic significance, and value has not been available on the art market in Central Europe for decades.
The painting will tour internationally ahead of the sale on April 24, stopping in Switzerland, Germany, Britain and Hong Kong.
The last portrait completed by Klimt became the most expensive artwork ever to sell at a European auction, when it fetched a staggering £85.3 million ($108.4 million) in London last year.
Depicting an unidentified female subject, “Dame mit Fächer” (Lady with a Fan) also established a new record for Klimt, outselling “Birch Forest,” which went for $104.6 million in a sale from the collection of the late Microsoft co-founder Paul G. Allen in 2022."

Now — amid declines reported in many pollinator populations — a new study on the evolution of one flower species’ mating system has revealed a remarkable shift that  could exacerbate the challenges faced by the plants’ insect partners.
The flowers’ reproductive evolution may be linked to environmental changes such as habitat destruction and rapid ongoing decreases in pollinator biodiversity, according to Samson Acoca-Pidolle, who led the study published December 19 in the journal New Phytologist.

Comparing seeds of wild field pansies collected decades ago in France with the plants’ modern descendants, Acoca-Pidolle and his colleagues discovered that today’s flowers are smaller and produce less nectar as a result of increased self-pollination, which has direct impacts on pollinator behavior. The pansies of the past self-fertilized less and attracted far more pollinators than those of the present, according to the study.
“It seems that it’s only traits that are involved in plant-pollinator interaction that are evolving,” said Acoca-Pidolle, a doctoral researcher at the University of Montpellier. The changes could constrain the plants’ ability to adapt to future environmental changes and have implications for “all of floral biodiversity” — potentially diminishing flowering plants’ genetic, species and ecosystem variation.
“This may increase the pollinator decline and cause a vicious feedback cycle,” study coauthor Pierre-Olivier Cheptou told CNN. If plants produce less nectar, there will be less food available to pollinators, which will in turn accelerate the rate at which the animals’ numbers dwindle, he explained.
“The major message is that we are currently seeing the evolutionary breakdown of plant pollinators in the wild,” said Cheptou, an evolutionary ecologist at the French National Centre for Scientific Research and professor at the University of Montpellier.
Using a method called “resurrection ecology” to conduct the research, the study team germinated the seeds of four populations of wild field pansies, scientifically known as Viola arvensis, that were collected in the 1990s and early 2000s in the Paris region.
Some propagules, or parts of a plant that can be used to grow a new plant, can stay in a seed stage for a “very long time,” Acoca-Pidolle explained. They are living, but at a very low metabolic rate. “It’s like a long nap,” he said.

In 2021, the team sourced field pansies from the exact spot the ancestral seeds were collected 20 to 30 years earlier. The scientists then conducted a population genetic analysis that looked at self-pollinating rates and changes in heterozygosity, or genetic variability, as well as changes in floral traits that are associated with pollinator attraction.
In a sample of 4,000 flowers, rates of self-fertilization went from around 50% for the flowers collected two to three decades beforehand to roughly 80% for their naturally occurring descendants, the authors found. Meanwhile, the “resurrected” flowers’ surfaces were 10% bigger, produced 20% more nectar and were frequented by more bumblebees than their modern counterparts.
An increase in a flowering plant species self-pollinating, or “selfing,” isn’t always a bad thing, said Gretchen LeBuhn, a professor of biology at San Francisco State University who has studied interactions between pollinators and plants.
“The way to think of (selfing) is it’s sort of like a holding-on strategy,” said LeBuhn, who was not involved with the study. Although increasing selfing does often lead to a decline in genetic variation in a population, among several other negative consequences, it also can maintain the population, she added. “Like an insurance policy.”
Declining genetic variation within a plant population matters because those with a reservoir of genetic variation can better respond to major environmental changes, effectively reducing extinction risk.

But when reading the new paper, part of her “actually thought an increase in selfing means that the population is going to be preserved,” LeBuhn said. “If plants can persist through time, and pollinator populations increase again, it would say that this is a mechanism for preservation of species.”
It’s unclear whether that evolutionary shift can be reversed, however — although the new research suggests there is an expectation for a depletion in a plant population’s genetic diversity at term, according to Acoca-Pidolle.
“Some scientists believe there may be a tipping point after which a plant cannot go back,” he noted, adding that the evolutionary transition is classically considered to be “irreversible.” Investigating whether these wild pansies have the ability to recover from the impacts of selfing is the next big question, Acoca-Pidolle said.
In the meantime, it’s important to acknowledge that the authors don’t really have the data on what was happening with pollinators 20 to 30 years ago, LeBuhn said. “The one thing that they can’t document is the magnitude of difference in pollinators in these sites in that time and now,” she said — which stems from gaps in historic widespread pollinator monitoring.
“(The study) is a really important demonstration of the tight linkages between plant and pollinator communities,” LeBuhn said. “I think the next step in the research is understanding what the implications are for pollinators.”
Other recent studies have found that declining pollinator populations, an offshoot of harmful human activities, threaten the future of food crops and the survival of the many species that depend on them.
The growing body of research bolsters the case for urgent conservation measures — like developing and protecting flower-rich habitats that act as floral and nesting resources — to help stymie global pollinator declines, according to Acoca-Pidolle.
“Our impact is not only killing some individual plants … we are putting them on an evolutionary path that could be bad for them,” Acoca-Pidolle told CNN. “And even after we disappear, for a long time, we will have a footprint on this evolutionary trajectory of many species, of the biodiversity of the planet.”

The lone survivor of Tuesday morning’s crash was initially taken to Fort Smith Health Centre and then transported by medevac to Stanton Territorial Hospital in Yellowknife, the Northwest Territories Coroner Service said in a statement. The survivor’s condition was not publicly released.
The plane was “en route from Fort Smith to the Diavik Diamond Mine” when the crash happened, the coroner’s office said. The global mining company Rio Tinto said it had employees on the aircraft.
“We have been informed by authorities that a plane on its way to our Diavik mine, carrying a number of our people, crashed near Fort Smith, Northwest Territories, Canada, resulting in fatalities,” the company said in a statement Wednesday.
Fort Smith is on the border with Alberta.

“As a company we are absolutely devastated by this news and offering our full support to our people and the community who are grieving today,” Rio Tinto Chief Executive Jakob Stausholm said in the statement. “We are working closely with authorities and will help in any way we can with their efforts to find out exactly what has happened.”
CNN has reached out to Rio Tinto for more information.
The Northwest Territories Coroner Service said its representatives are working with local authorities to access the crash site and start the recovery process.
“The NWT Coroner Service would like to express our condolences to the families and community of Fort Smith during this very tragic and difficult time,” the statement said.
On Tuesday morning, the Canadian Rangers and the Royal Canadian Air Force responded to a report of lost contact with an aircraft outside of Fort Smith, an RCAF spokesperson in Winnipeg, David Lavallee, told CNN Canada news partner CBC News.
Visibility was poor during the early hours Tuesday morning but improved by around 10 a.m., according to CNN’s weather team.
The Fort Smith Health Centre activated its mass casualty protocol around 8:50 a.m. on Tuesday, according to the Northwest Territories Health and Social Services Authority.

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the Canadian Rangers and the Royal Canadian Air Force also responded. Investigators with the Transportation Safety Board were also sent to Fort Smith following the crash.
The aircraft involved is a British Aerospace Jetstream registered to Northwestern Air Lease, according to the Transportation Safety Board of Canada, which said it is investigating the crash. The aircraft can carry up to 19 passengers, according to Northwestern Air Lease’s website.
The coroner’s office said the two crew members worked for Northwestern Air Lease. CNN has reached out to Northwestern Air Lease for comment.
R.J. Simpson, the premier of the Northwest Territories, released a statement extending his condolences to the families, friends and loved ones of those who were aboard the airplane. He also encouraged affected residents to seek support and use mental health resources provided by the government.
“The impact of this incident is felt across the territory,” Simpson said. “The people we lost were not just passengers on a flight; they were neighbors, colleagues, friends, and loved ones. Their stories and contributions to our communities will not be forgotten.”

V5GLF5ESSR_6JQV2VTWZ9IME2K,The end of one key experiment in American democracy is at hand,"Analysis by Zachary B. Wolf, CNN","6 minute read Updated 6:34 PM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/22/politics/voting-experiment-primaries-what-matters/,"A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.
One of the more interesting long-term experiments in the American version of democracy is on the verge of ending, but not before inspiring change elsewhere in the country.
The experiment in Louisiana, which has been ongoing in various iterations for most of the past 50 years, is this: Rather than a traditional party primary system in line with the one Americans use in presidential elections, for nonpresidential offices, Louisiana has given every voter the option of every candidate, regardless of party. If no candidate gets a simple majority, the top two candidates take part in a runoff.
For presidential primaries, on the other hand, Louisiana is among the states that closes its primary off to independent voters.
Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, a Republican, has pushed to replace the unique open primary system used for most elections with a closed primary system open only to party members, arguing that it is a matter of fairness to political parties and complaining that Louisiana lawmakers may not have their elections determined until December.
Unwilling to go as far as the full-on closed primary system pushed by Landry, legislators have instead agreed to scale back the open primary system for congressional and some other races. The open primaries will remain for statewide races, including governor.
Other states, including California and Washington, have followed Louisiana’s lead and adopted their own versions of the system. In California, for instance, it’s now commonplace to see two Democrats emerge from an open primary to square off on Election Day.
Changing the system could have a real effect in Louisiana, where the open primary system has verifiably led to less extreme lawmakers, according to Christian Grose, a political science professor at the University of Southern California who has studied the effect of open primaries.
Grose looked at voting records in Congress for states with completely open primaries and compared them with states that still conduct closed primaries and found the states with open primaries produced more moderate lawmakers.
It is not guaranteed that voters will choose a more moderate candidate, but it is a more likely possibility, Grose told me in an email, arguing open systems provide “an opportunity to elect candidates who are less extreme. In closed systems, this rarely happens.”
There are those that argue the opposite, that party leaders have essentially lost control of the primary process, which has led to more extreme candidates.
Republican Party leaders tried and failed to derail Donald Trump’s candidacy in 2016. Now he has essentially remade the party around himself.
Plus, most states, to varying degrees, have opened their primaries to independent voters, even if they do not have a fully open, nonpartisan primary system like Louisiana or California.
Grose noted that Louisiana’s senators are both Republican, but one of them, Bill Cassidy, voted to remove Trump from office after the January 6, 2021, insurrection and the other, John Kennedy, did not.
Cassidy was actually only one of seven Republican senators to vote to remove Trump from office during his second impeachment trial.
Of those seven, three have since left office. Another, Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, has said he will not run for reelection. The remaining three, Cassidy, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, are all from states that do not have traditional partisan primaries.
Murkowski was reelected to a fourth term in Alaska’s new ranked-choice voting system in 2022. In that system, voters pick a first-, second- and even third-choice candidate. If no candidate gets to 50%, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated and voters who ranked that candidate first will have their vote counted for whoever was their next choice.
That’s the same system by which Alaska elected Mary Peltola as its first Democratic member of Congress in decades (and she made history as the first Alaska Native in Congress). And yet, while Peltola is a Democrat, she has worked with Republicans in the state.
Alaska’s legislature, however, is in the process of trying to undo the ranked-choice system, which was narrowly approved by voters in a 2020 ballot initiative.
Ranked-choice voting is also the system by which New Yorkers picked the Democrat Eric Adams as their mayor.
That’s what happened in Maine in 2016 and Alaska in 2020. Voters in Nevada approved a ranked-choice system once already but must do so again in 2024 for it to take effect.
Meanwhile in Arizona, where Republicans suffered in 2022 by picking more extreme candidates in partisan primaries, there’s an effort to put ranked-choice voting on the ballot in 2024.
The partisan primary system in the US has been cited as one driver of growing partisanship in the US. That’s on display at the national level as Trump consolidates his control over the Republican Party with a message of “retribution” against his opponents if he’s able to win the White House again in 2024.
Adding the voices of independent voters into the primary system is something Trump has been complaining about in New Hampshire.
After Trump romped in Iowa’s caucuses, New Hampshire’s primary could represent the last real chance for former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley to put Trump’s third straight Republican nomination in question.

Primaries continue until June, but Haley is now Trump’s only remaining major Republican opponent, and New Hampshire, where most voters are not registered with either political party, represents a unique opportunity for her.
Trump told supporters at a rally in New Hampshire Sunday that the inclusion of non-Republicans in the primary is equal to bringing “liberals and (Joe) Biden supporters” into the Republican process, but that’s probably in large part because polling suggests independent voters in the state prefer Haley.
Gallup tracks party identification in the US. Those identifying as independent first outnumbered Democrats and Republicans back in 1991 and have continued to do so for all but a few years. In 2023, Democrats reached a new low in party identification (27%), the same as Republicans.
The secret, of course, is that most Americans who describe themselves as independent aren’t really. In a follow-up question, they will routinely tell Gallup they either lean toward Republicans or Democrats. Last year, 45% either identified or leaned toward Republicans, compared with 43% who either identified or leaned toward Democrats.
In 2020’s presidential election, 26% of all voters identified as independent, according to CNN’s exit polls, fewer than the portion who identified as either Republicans or Democrats. But in New Hampshire specifically that year, 46% of voters identified as independent.
In New Hampshire’s Democratic primary in 2020, only about half the people who voted said they were Democrats, according to exit polls. Most of the rest (45%) were independents. Sen. Bernie Sanders, the independent from neighboring Vermont, who describes himself as a democratic socialist, won the Democratic primary in New Hampshire that year, but lost the nomination to Biden."
V7IJZ6XZQL_EUS38JJLN4KB6AE,Emma Stone and more react to their Oscar nominations,"By Marianne Garvey, CNN","4 minute read Updated 1:40 PM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/23/entertainment/emma-stone-react-oscar-nominations/,"Those who were lucky enough to hear their names read among the Oscar nominees on Tuesday morning are expressing their gratitude for the honor.
“Poor Things” star Emma Stone gave a shout-out to her fellow nominees and called the movie’s 11 nominations “a surreal dream.”
“I am beyond grateful to the Academy for including me as both an actress and producer among this group of exceptional nominees and for recognizing our film in so many categories,” she said in a statement provided to CNN. “The team of artists who contributed to ‘Poor Things’ gave it everything and I am forever thankful for the opportunity to play Bella and see the world through her eyes. She has shown me that life is so much more than just sugar and violence.”
“Poor Things” was the second-most nominated film, behind “Oppenheimer.”
Netflix received 18 nominations across 10 films, including nods for “Nyad,” Maestro,” and “El Conde.”
Annette Bening, nominated for best actress for “Nyad,” said in a statement she was “thrilled and over the moon with excitement” to be nominated for an Academy Award. This is the “American Beauty” star’s fifth nomination. Bening’s “Nyad” costar Jodie Foster also scored a nomination.
One of Stone and Bening’s competitors for lead actress, Carey Mulligan, said she was “brimming with gratitude today” after scoring her nomination, her third in the category after 2009’s “An Education” and 2020’s “Promising Young Woman.” This year, she’s up for her role in Bradley Cooper’s “Maestro,” and said in her statement shared with CNN that she feels “huge pride for the rest of the Maestro team! Thank you to Bradley for handing me this gift of a role and an experience.”
“Maestro” creator Bradley Cooper, nominated for best picture, best original screenplay and best actor said, “We are all so grateful to be recognized along all of these incredible works of art this year. And the performances from every actor who I so admire. Thank you to Jamie, Alex & Nina Bernstein for allowing their parents’ story to be out there in the world and thank you to the Academy. We are very honored to be included.”
Colman Domingo, who made history on Tuesday as only the second out LGBTQ+ actor nominated for playing a real-life LGBTQ+ character (in the film “Rustin”), said in a statement shared with CNN, “To be amplified for my work for portraying this American Hero is everything to me. When my name is called, so is BAYARD RUSTIN’s. What an extraordinary honor. My heart is bursting with joy.”
Musician Jon Batiste’s “It Never Went Away” from the film “American Symphony,” that in part chronicles his wife’s battle with cancer, was nominated for best original song.
“Making music is an act of survival. There was a stretch of time during which my wife Suleika was in the hospital and we weren’t sure she’d make it,” Batiste said in a statement to CNN. “This song began as a lullaby, so she could have a restful aura in the hospital room…We are grateful to be surrounded by love.”
Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt, nominated for their song “I’m Just Ken” from “Barbie,” said in a joint statement they were “excited and grateful beyond words.”
“This really is the highest honour to be recognized by our peers and heroes from the Academy. And in a year of so many extraordinary songs - including those from our incredible fellow Barbie contributors,” the statement said. “It’s a testament to Greta Gerwig’s power to inspire and bring out the very best in everyone around her. Thank you so much.”
Billie Eilish and her brother Finneas, who previously won in the best original song category for “No Time to Die,” said, “As lifelong fans of film, music in film and the Academy Awards, this means everything to us.”
Celine Song, who scored her first nomination in the best original screenplay category for “Past Lives,” said she is “overwhelmed” by the recognition.
“Some of the experience working on a debut film is secretly questioning if you belong, if people will support your vision. It has been equal parts scary and rewarding to make this film and release it into the world,” she wrote in a statement. “It is with immense gratitude to those who championed my vision that I now get to be among these giants of screenwriting.”
She added: “There’s an Eastern concept in our film called In-Yun, which is the miraculous connection and love we have with each other just by being in the same place at the same time. It’s the result of thousands of lives we’ve shared before this one. Our entire filmmaking team felt this deeply while making Past Lives. Today’s news makes me feel like many of our filmmaking peers felt the same way. Thank you.”"

Dozens of people have been killed and wounded in the latest offensive in western Khan Younis, according to the Hamas-controlled health ministry in Gaza. Medical facilities including the Nasser Medical Complex, Al Amal Hospital and the Palestine Red Crescent Society headquarters are located in the area.
“The situation here is completely catastrophic. We didn’t sleep last night. The hospital is entirely besieged,” Ahmad Al Moghrabi, a doctor at the Nasser Medical Complex said in a video shared to his Instagram page Monday.
“There is no way for us to escape the hospital and no way for evacuation. The troops are all around, and the only roads for evacuation are filled with dead bodies,” he said.
The Nasser Medical Complex is receiving more serious injuries than it can accommodate, the health ministry said, adding that intensive care units are at capacity.
Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) staff at the Nasser hospital said “there is a sense of panic among staff, patients and displaced people sheltering inside the building,” as they could feel the ground shaking during the strikes, MSF said on social media.
The hospital wards are full and exit routes are blocked, preventing the evacuation of medical staff and patients from the hospital, MSF added.
Health officials also said that Israeli forces Monday stormed the Al Khair Hospital, west of Khan Younis, and detained a number of its medical staff, amid an ongoing “siege” of the area.
The Israeli military said it was targeting Hamas outposts, infrastructure, and command and control centers in Khan Younis and the action demanded “precise operations” due to the densely populated civilian areas.
﻿The military operation, which was launched on Sunday, is being led by Israel’s 98th Paratroopers Division and is expected to last for several days, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said, without providing further details on the timeline.
“Dismantling Hamas’ military framework in western Khan Younis is the heart of the logic behind the operation,” the statement added.
The IDF said it had seen militants at “sensitive sites” such as hospitals and shelters in the tightly packed civilian areas.
The Palestine Red Crescent Society said its headquarters and the Al-Amal Hospital, located in the same neighborhood, are “under siege” by Israeli forces, and soldiers are “targeting anyone who tries to move in the area.”
A field ambulance point has been established outside the Al-Amal neighborhood, where the medical facilities are located, to ensure a continuity of operations.
But the organization said the situation remains “extremely dangerous” and around 80 percent of the entrances and exits to Al-Amal are obstructed. Ambulance teams are facing “significant difficulties in reaching the wounded and injured due to the continuous bombardment in the governorate.”
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said he is “deeply concerned” by reports of the fighting, warning that that violence near Al-Amal hospital and the raid on Al-Khair not only “put patients and people seeking safety within these facilities at risk, but they also prevent newly injured people outside the hospitals from being reached and receiving care.”
Israel’s siege in Gaza has devastated swathes of the territory, diminished food, fuel and water supplies, and crushed the enclave’s medical system. Over 1.9 million Palestinians have been forcibly displaced, many multiple times, according to the UN’s agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA).
There are 16 out of 36 hospitals partially functioning across the strip, including nine in southern Gaza and seven in the north, the UN’s humanitarian affairs office reported on Sunday.
In southern Gaza, three hospitals – Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir El-Balah, and Nasser and Gaza European hospitals in Khan Younis – are “at risk of closure due to the issuance of evacuation orders in adjacent areas and the ongoing conduct of hostilities nearby,” OCHA said.
The Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza has been functioning to a “limited degree” since mid-January, added OCHA.
The Health Ministry said Monday that the number of Palestinians killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since October 7 rose to 25,295, with at least 63,000 injuries recorded. At least 190 people were killed and 340 injured in the last 24 hours, the Ministry statement said.

CNN cannot independently verify casualty figures in Gaza due to limited access to the area.
Hamas’s militant wing, the Al Qassam Brigades, said in a statement Monday that they were fighting in the western Khan Younis area, killing a number of Israeli soldiers with anti-personnel missiles.
Ahmed Naseem, a resident of Al-Amal neighborhood in Khan Younis, told CNN Monday that “intense” shelling of the area started in the early hours of Monday.
“There was heavy shelling in the area since the early hours of Monday. I could feel it intensely from the building I live in,” Nassem said. “We don’t even dare open the windows to see where these attacks are happening,” he said.
He said that he is “terrified of filming the scenes taking place nearby” because he fears he will be shot at, if a drone catches him in the act.
“We can’t even go to the rooftop because we cannot determine if drones will fire at us,” he said. “A few days ago water tanks were damaged, after drones fired right at them. My cousin, who was filling water at the time of the strike, was close to getting hit, but survived,” he added.

VGRNYOIL0W_JARN7G6RXS41605,A Colorado pastor says God told him to launch a crypto venture. He’s now accused of pocketing $1.3 million from his followers,"By Faith Karimi, CNN","4 minute read Updated 10:14 AM EST, Sun January 28, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/24/us/colorado-pastor-crypto-fraud-cec/,"Denver pastor Eli Regalado had an exciting message for his congregation.
After months of prayers and cues from God, he was going to start selling cryptocurrency, he announced in a YouTube video last April. The Signature and Silvergate banks had collapsed weeks earlier, signaling the need to look into other investment options beyond financial institutions, he said. With divine wisdom, he said, he was “setting the rails for God’s wealth transfer.”
Shortly afterward, Regalado and his wife, Kaitlyn Regalado, launched a cryptocurrency, INDXcoin, and began selling it to members of his Victorious Grace Church and other Christian communities in the Denver area. They sold it through the Kingdom Wealth Exchange, an online cryptocurrency marketplace he created, controlled and operated.
The Regalados raised more than $3.2 million from over 300 investors,  Tung Chang, Securities Commissioner for Colorado, said in a civil complaint.
The couple’s sales pitches were filled with “prayer and quotes from the Bible, encouraging investors to have faith that their investment … would lead to ‘abundance’ and ‘blessings,’” the complaint said.
But Colorado state regulators say that INDXcoin was “essentially worthless.” Instead of helping investors acquire wealth, the Regalados used around $1.3 million of the investment funds to bankroll lavish expenditures, including a Range Rover, jewelry, cosmetic dentistry and extravagant vacations, the complaint said. The money also paid for renovations to the Regalados’ Denver home, the complaint said.
In a stunning video statement posted online on January 19 — several days after the civil charges were filed — Eli Regalado did not dispute that he and his wife profited from the crypto venture.
“The charges are that Kaitlyn and I pocketed 1.3 million dollars, and I just want to come out and say that those charges are true,” he said, adding, “A few hundred thousand dollars went to a home remodel that the Lord told us to do.”
The Colorado Division of Securities started investigating the Regalados after it received complaints from an anonymous investor, a state spokesperson told CNN.
Chan filed civil fraud charges last week against the pastor and Kaitlyn Regalado,  accusing them of violations of the anti-fraud, licensing and registration provisions of the state’s Securities Act.
CNN has reached out to the Regalados for comment. It was unclear Wednesday whether they have retained an attorney.
In video statements, Eli Regalado has said that God led him to open INDXcoin and convinced him that it was a safe and profitable investment venture.
He told investors that INDXcoins “were highly sought after and offered an unparalleled risk-to-return ratio,” the complaint said.
But the state says INDXcoin was not backed by assets, making it a risky currency. There was no market for it or interest in it beyond its pool of investors, the complaint said.
The Regalados used technical terms to confuse investors and misled them into believing that the coins were valued at between $10-$12 even though they were purchased for $1.50 or, at times, given away, the complaint said.
“Regalado took advantage of the trust and faith of his own Christian community and … peddled outlandish promises of wealth to them when he sold them essentially worthless cryptocurrencies,” Chan said in a statement.
The Regalados failed to explain to investors how the INDXcoin market would work or that their Kingdom Wealth Exchange was the only platform “upon which anyone could buy, sell, or trade the currency,” the complaint said.
When INDXcoin failed to yield financial returns, Eli Regalado posted videos reassuring investors and saying, according to the complaint, they just “had to wait for God’s plan to unfold.”
In his video last week, Regalado addressed the accusations and acknowledged that people who bought INDXcoin are stuck because they are unable to sell.
“We launched an exchange,” he said. “The exchange technology failed. Things went downhill. And from that point forward, we’ve just been waiting on the Lord.”
“I know this looks bad,” he said later in the clip. “I know this looks terrible.”
Regalado also said that he and his wife used about half a million dollars of their investors’ funds to pay taxes to the IRS.
He reiterated that God led him and his wife to leave their marketing company in 2021, get into cryptocurrency and multiply investors’ money. God told them to trust him to provide the funds, he said.
Investigators found that investors began sending money in June 2022 via Eli Regalado’s Venmo account or wire transfers, long before Regalado announced the launch of the trading platform in April.
It’s unclear when an investor first complained to state officials. In November, Regalado announced that the INDXcoin and Kingdom Wealth Exchange networks were down and asked people to “stop being ruled by mammon (chasing material wealth).”
As recently as last week, Eli Regalado expressed hope that divine intervention would bail out him and his investors.
“Either I misheard God … or God is still not done with this project, and He is going to do a new thing,” he said in the video posted January 19. “What we’re praying for, and what we’re believing for still, is that God is going to do a miracle. God is going to work a miracle in the financial sector … (and that) everyone (who invested) … is going to be able to receive money back.”

The overhaul would effectively pause the federal approval process for a massive and controversial gas export project known as CP2, the source said – a facility that is being proposed for the southwest Louisiana coast, as well as other natural gas projects that are pending federal approval.
The administration’s potential change in posture on these facilities comes as President Joe Biden gears up for a tough reelection campaign, seeking to win the support of young, climate-minded voters. Environmental groups have recently turned their focus to the surge of new and planned fossil fuel infrastructure along the Gulf Coast – and the Biden administration’s role in approving it.
The administration is considering a broad overhaul of how the Department of Energy makes so-called public interest determinations – a key step needed to approve liquified natural gas facilities. This could include updating how the administration determines climate impacts of these projects, modernizing and updating the climate impact considerations, and considering the full upstream and downstream life cycle impacts of these projects, the source said.

The Energy Department, which is responsible for making public interest determinations as one step in the approval process, has never rejected a proposed natural gas project on these grounds.
The White House declined to comment. The Department of Energy did not return CNN’s request for comment. The New York Times and Bloomberg also reported the administration is considering changes to how it approves natural gas projects.
Natural gas is big business for the US fossil fuel industry, which has been exporting much of the product to other countries, particularly after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Europe’s subsequent move away from Russian gas. US companies have stepped in to fill that gap, compressing or freezing gas at export terminals and shipping it across the ocean in enormous tankers.
Biden is facing pressure on all sides as climate groups push back on the continued greenlighting of natural gas projects and the fossil fuel industry continues to invest in them. The CP2 project, which could export up to 20 million tons of natural gas a year, is the largest natural gas export facility proposed to date in the US and has been the subject of contentious debate.
Shaylyn Hynes, a spokesperson for CP2’s owner Venture Global, said the reported plans from the Biden administration would “create uncertainty about whether our allies can rely on US LNG for their energy security” and would “shock the global energy market.”
Environmental groups, who maintain the US is already producing and exporting enough gas to satisfy the energy needs of its foreign allies, cheered the plan.
“That decision would be one we would get behind; these LNG export projects have been rubber stamped up to this point,” said Mahyar Sorour, the director of beyond fossil fuels policy at the Sierra Club. “We’re encouraged.”

VJIHW2PWLV_O8K2224T0LPJ4H0,Maine’s top court won’t review Trump ballot eligibility for now,"By Colin McCullough and Marshall Cohen, CNN","2 minute read Published 9:42 AM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/25/politics/maine-ballot-trump-14th-amendment/,"The Maine Supreme Judicial Court declined to weigh in on whether former President Donald Trump should be removed from the state’s ballot, rejecting a request that they decide on the question now.
The ruling leaves in place a prior judge’s decision that froze the state-level proceedings until the US Supreme Court issues its ruling in a similar case from Colorado, which found that Trump is ineligible to hold public office based on the 14th Amendment’s “insurrectionist ban.” Oral arguments are scheduled in that case for February 8.
Maine is the second state to remove Trump’s name from the ballot, after Colorado’s Supreme Court declared Trump ineligible for the presidency using similar reasoning. Other judges and election officials across the country have dismissed related anti-Trump challenges on procedural grounds.
Maine’s Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, a Democrat, had reached the same conclusion and barred Trump from the Republican primary ballot. Trump appealed in state court, and last week, a judge paused the proceedings, pending the outcome of the Colorado case. But Bellows appealed the freeze to Maine’s highest court, and asked the justices to immediately decide whether Trump is disqualified due to his role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection. The high court on Wednesday unanimously declined to take up the appeal.
“There is at least as great a risk of additional process and delay if we consider this appeal and reach an ostensibly final decision, and then the (US) Supreme Court’s decision makes additional court or administrative action necessary to comply with the federal law,” the ruling said. “… Given the high level of uncertainty, the Secretary of State has not identified a concrete and irreparable harm arising from our decision not to review this matter immediately.”
Bellows said in a prior filing to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court that the lower court’s decision to stay the former president’s removal from the ballot pending a decision from the US Supreme Court “is contrary to the statutory design and would sow public confusion.”
The Supreme Judicial Court argued the contrary in its opinion.
“The Secretary of State suggests that there is irreparable harm because a delay in certainty about whether Trump’s name should appear on the primary ballot will result in voter confusion. This uncertainty is, however, precisely what guides our decision not to undertake immediate appellate review in this particular case,” the court wrote."
VKPLE7EDW3_SWZGX7O5M8YAY09,From ‘Barbie’ to ‘Bob the Builder’: All about Mattel’s next big movie (and how Jlo is involved),"By Elizabeth Wagmeister, CNN","2 minute read Updated 11:21 AM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/25/entertainment/bob-the-builder-jennifer-lopez/,"Mattel struck gold – or pink – with “Barbie,” which was the first major feature film to come from the toy company and made nearly $1.5 billion worldwide, becoming the biggest movie of 2023 and racking up eight Oscar nominations earlier this week.
Now, CNN has learned that Mattel hopes to maintain that momentum with a cinematic adaptation of another kids’ character: Bob the Builder. An animated movie based on the long-running animated children’s series is in development, with Jennifer Lopez attached to executive produce and “In the Heights” star Anthony Ramos set to voice the beloved titular cartoon contractor.
In the animated movie, Roberto “Bob” travels to Puerto Rico for a major construction job, takes on issues affecting the island and digs deeper into what it means to build, according to a press release from Mattel. This new take on “Bob the Builder” will “celebrate the vibrant and colorful textures of the Caribbean Latin nations and their people.”
Aside from voicing Bob the Builder, Ramos will also serve as a producer. In a statement, Ramos said that the movie will focus on friends working together and how love can help conquer any obstacle.
“For years, Bob the Builder’s characters have inspired young people around the world,” the actor said, noting that he will bring “elements of life that are inspired by my own” into the film.
Lopez will produce through her production company, Nuyorican Productions, along with her producing partners Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas and Benny Medina.
The “Bob the Builder” television series ran in worldwide syndication for over a decade in the early aughts, and is known for its popular catchphrase, “Can we fix it? Yes, we can!”
“Bob the Builder” is the first animated theatrical movie to come from Mattel, but following the huge success of “Barbie,” the company has plans to bring more toys to the big screen, with films based on everything from American Girl dolls and Magic 8 Ball to “Masters of the Universe” and the card game UNO in the works, according to their release.
A Mattel source also says the  company is developing a “Hot Wheels” movie with J.J. Abrams, “Rock ‘Em Sock ‘Em” with Vin Diesel, “Barney” with Daniel Kaluuya, “Polly Pocket” from Lena Dunham with star Lily Collins and “Major Matt Mason” starring Tom Hanks."
VKSANFY2HL_S9UOZGP3RRBI1D1,Former NRA President Oliver North says he was ousted after he raised concerns about corruption within the organization,"By Sabrina Souza, CNN","4 minute read Updated 11:51 AM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/24/us/oliver-north-ousted-nra-corruption-trial/,"Former National Rifle Association President Oliver North was ousted after he raised concerns about corruption within the gun-lobbying group, he testified Tuesday at a civil corruption trial in New York.
Prosecutors allege that top NRA members used the non-profit organization as their “personal piggy bank,” through years of illegal self-dealing and financial misconduct.
North, who gained national attention as a central figure in the Iran-Contra scandal in the 1980s, served as NRA president for less than a year, between 2018 and 2019.
He grew concerned about financial improprieties within the organization after an NRA attorney was fired and replaced by an outside law firm, the Brewer firm, he said.
After many rejected attempts to uncover details on legal spending and rebuffs by NRA Executive Vice President and CEO Wayne LaPierre, North recommended an independent review be conducted of the NRA, specifically of the Brewer firm, North testified.
Related article Civil trial alleging top NRA officials used the organization as ‘personal piggy bank’ begins
LaPierre, a defendant in the trial who became the face of the gun rights movement over three decades, stepped down earlier this month, effective January 31.
In February 2019, North said, he asked NRA general counsel John Frazer, another defendant, for legal invoices. Frazer said no, telling him it was at LaPierre’s direction, North testified.
“We want to bring in a reputable outside firm to do an audit of not just the Brewer bills but of the whole mess,” North said, raising his arms in the air. “What we were trying to do was throw you a lifeline,” he said.
“What was your reaction to LaPierre’s personal expenses?” Monica Connell, special counsel with New York Attorney General Letitia James’ office, asked North.
“I was stunned … this was corruption,” he said.
“I was still trying to save Wayne LaPierre, a friend’s, job – that’s why I was throwing him a lifeline,” North added.
One of those lifelines was a letter to LaPierre in February 2019, in which North said he addressed the legal spending and the Brewer firms’ invoices of more than $100,000 in expenses. LaPierre replied with a cease and desist letter and again refused to make the Brewer bills available, North said.
LaPierre told him, “Brewer is the reason why I am not going to spend the rest of my life in an orange jumpsuit,” North testified.
“He’s now in a situation I never wanted to see him in,” North said glancing at LaPierre in the courtroom.
In a response to request for comment, the Brewer firm on Wednesday provided CNN with a statement from the NRA’s Andrew Arulanandam. “The firm’s bills have always been reviewed, vetted and approved at the highest levels of the organization, period,” he said.
Arulanandam will replace LaPierre as interim CEO and executive vice president, NRA announced this month.
North testified his goal as president was “to try and stop this circular firing squad” that the parties involved were in at the time, calling for a “ceasefire.”
According to North, LaPierre also helped draft his employment contract with Ackerman McQueen, the NRA’s former advertising firm, saying, “I’ll take care of it,” referring to both North’s employment and his nomination as president.
LaPierre didn’t follow procedure when he hired him, North suggested, ignoring the NRA’s audit committee which was supposed to supervise hires. It wasn’t solely North’s employment LaPierre pushed for but his nomination for NRA president as well, North testified.
“Of course, it should have (been approved), that’s the rules,” North said. “They retroactively approved my contract.”
When asked by Connell about allegations that he attempted a coup, North replied, “It never happened, all a big-faced lie. This whole thing was concocted along the lines of being a coup participant and spreading nasty rumors about Mr. LaPierre, which is the last thing I’d done,” he said.
In the spring of 2019, North wrote a detailed memorandum titled, “The NRA Faces a Crisis,” where he asked for a formation of a crisis committee, he testified.
“I knew by the time I wrote this … I knew that I was finished,” he said, adding he knew LaPierre wouldn’t support his renomination. “This is my last act.”
He resigned but is still an NRA member, he said.
“Did you consider yourself a whistleblower?” Connell asked.
“I certainly became one,” North said."
VONNBSF2ZS_ERSRZUZJQ25WXC6,"Netanyahu must be removed, top former Israeli national security officials say","By Alex Marquardt, CNN","5 minute read Published 5:00 AM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/26/middleeast/netanyahu-letter-israel-national-security-intl/,"More than 40 senior former Israeli national security officials, celebrated scientists and prominent business leaders have sent a letter to Israel’s president and speaker of parliament demanding that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu be removed from office for posing what they say is an “existential” threat to the country.
The signatories on the letter include four former directors of Israel’s foreign and domestic security services, two former heads of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and three Nobel Prize winners.
The letter blasts the coalition Netanyahu assembled to form the most right-wing government ever in Israel, along with his highly controversial efforts to overhaul Israel’s judiciary that they say led to security lapses that resulted in the October 7 attacks, the deadliest day in Israel’s history.
“We believe that Netanyahu bears primary responsibility for creating the circumstances leading to the brutal massacre of over 1,200 Israelis and others, the injury of over 4,500, and the kidnapping of more than 230 individuals, of whom over 130 are still held in Hamas captivity,” it reads. “The victim’s blood is on Netanyahu’s hands.”
Related article Israeli government divisions deepen as cabinet minister says defeating Hamas is unrealistic
The letter was sent to Israeli President Isaac Herzog on Thursday and to Knesset Speaker Amir Ohana on Friday.
Netanyahu’s popularity has fallen dramatically since starting his sixth term as prime minister, just over a year ago. Critics have blasted his judicial reform efforts – which threatened to trigger a constitutional crisis and divided the country, with months of massive, regular demonstrations.
“Leaders of Iran, Hezbollah, and Hamas,” the letter says, “openly praised what they correctly saw as a destabilizing and erosive process of Israel’s stability, led by Netanyahu, and seized the opportunity to harm and damage Israel’s security.”
Among the 43 signatories are former IDF chiefs Moshe Ya’alon and Dan Halutz, Tamir Pardo and Danny Yatom, who ran the Mossad intelligence agency, and Nadav Argaman and Yaakov Peri, who were directors of the domestic security service, Shin Bet.
Former CEOs, ambassadors, government officials and three Nobel laureates for chemistry - Aaron Ciechanover, Avram Hershko and Dan Shechtman - also signed the letter.
A poll released this week by Israel’s Channel 13 suggests that Netanyahu’s political party, Likud, would now come in a distant second if elections were held today. The frontrunner in the poll was the National Unity party led by former IDF chief of staff Benny Gantz, currently a member of Netanyahu’s war cabinet.
The next elections aren’t planned until late 2026, though there have been protests and calls for early elections, including from one of Israel’s main opposition leaders, Yair Lapid.
“The situations that brought Israel to elections beforehand are almost nothing in comparison to what Israel is going through now,” said Haim Tomer, a longtime Mossad officer who retired after heading the agency’s intelligence division and who signed the letter demanding Netanyahu’s removal.
“Everybody understands that Netanyahu is incompetent to lead Israel,” Tomer told CNN.
In the past week Netanyahu has repeatedly expressed his opposition to Palestinian sovereignty for security reasons, as Israel’s main ally, the United States, continues to call for a two-state solution.
The letter’s signatories accuse Netanyahu of spending years propping up Hamas in Gaza at the expense of the Palestinian Authority, which the US has argued should be revitalized to govern both the West Bank and Gaza.
CNN has reported that for years Qatar delivered cash-filled suitcases to Gaza with Netanyahu’s blessing, despite concerns from his own government. The money was intended to pay civil servants’ salaries and retirees’ benefits. It is now delivered via bank transfers rather than in cash, and as recently as last month, Qatar said it was continuing to pay it.
To form his current government, Netanyahu brought together other parties well to the right of Likud and assembled the most right-wing government in Israeli history. Two of its most prominent members, Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben Gvir, have been called out by the Biden administration for arguing that Palestinians should leave Gaza.
The letter accuses Netanyahu of refusing to take responsibility for the October 7 attacks, instead “blaming others and inciting against those who had fought to save the Israeli democracy from his destructive actions and plans, and now mobilize whole heartedly to support Israel’s national war efforts.”
It concludes with a plea to the Israeli president and Knesset speaker to replace the prime minister, as well as a warning: “The Israeli nation and Jewish history will not forgive you if you don’t fulfill your utmost national responsibility.”
Neither the president nor the speaker has the power to remove a prime minister from office unilaterally, but the letter was also to be distributed by the speaker to Knesset members who can remove and replace a prime minister.
The right people need “to get their hands on the steering wheel,” said Tomer, the former Mossad official.
“I think people start to look from the outside towards Israel and ask themselves what happened to this country,” Tomer said. “What’s happened to this country with very, very smart people that are now being led with some idiots?”
“The word that we have been using in the circles that I’ve been participating in is: we need a restart, we need a restart.”

Israel has come under intense international criticism for its war in Gaza, which has killed more than 25,000 Palestinians and displaced almost two million people since the October 7 Hamas attacks.
Israel has repeatedly insisted that its war is not against the Palestinian people but Hamas militants who are holding more than 130 hostages in dire conditions in the war zone.
Netanyahu told a news conference last week that politicians who are asking him to step down are essentially asking for a Palestinian state.
Israel’s actions in Gaza are the subject of a genocide case in the International Court of Justice (ICJ), initiated by South Africa that accuses the country’s leadership of intending to “bring about the destruction of its Palestinian population.”
Israel denies the allegations, arguing that the war is being fought in self-defense and that its leadership has not displayed genocidal intent."
VP85DZPBZP_FHC9FJQNLLTWLSW,The deepfake era of US politics is upon us,"Analysis by Zachary B. Wolf, CNN","8 minute read Published 12:00 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/24/politics/deepfake-politician-biden-what-matters/,"A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.
One distressing headline out of New Hampshire as voters prepared to cast in-person primary ballots was that a fake version of President Joe Biden’s voice had been used in automatically generated robocalls to discourage Democrats from taking part in the primary.
It’s not distressing because of the message, per se – Democrats had penalized New Hampshire for insisting on holding its primary Tuesday. Biden was not even on the ballot, although a write-in campaign was launched on his behalf.
The distressing thing is that while the audio appears to be fake, it sounds just like the president and even uses his trademark “malarkey” catchphrase. Listen to it here.
Who created the audio? Who is behind the robocall? There have been warnings for years about a new era of deepfakes being used to manipulate US elections, from within or outside the country. That era is undeniably here.
I talked to Donie O’Sullivan, CNN’s correspondent covering both politics and technology, who has been on this story for years. Excerpts of our conversation are below.
WOLF: You cover this stuff every day. What crossed your mind when you saw this headline?
O’SULLIVAN: It’s probably one of the first of many, many, many headlines and stories like this that we are going to be seeing this year.
If we’re not already in it, we’re on the precipice of an explosion of AI-generated disinformation.
It’s most likely that this audio was created using artificial intelligence. I think we’ve all kind of become familiar with the fact that this technology is out there, but I think we’re ready to kick into gear with this current election campaign.
Importantly, there’s been a lot of focus on fake videos over the past few years.
But from the experts and other folks we’ve been speaking to, I think there’s a big concern about audio.
WOLF: Terms like “deepfake” are probably new to a lot of people. What is the basic glossary people need to know to stay on top of things?
O’SULLIVAN: “Deepfake” normally refers to a fake video that has been created using artificial intelligence. It is basically a fake video that looks very realistic.
Over the past few years, artificial intelligence has made the creation of fake images, videos and audio way easier.
AI makes fake videos, images and audio differently than how it has been done traditionally, which was by slicing audio together or by Photoshop. This is the machines, the computers themselves, making the images and audio.
This is a fundamentally different type of technology, and it is a lot more realistic.
WOLF: What do we know about who might be behind this? Not this specific instance, because we don’t know, but what do we know about who is doing this type of thing?
O’SULLIVAN: Anybody and everybody. The challenge we’re going to have in 2024 is that really anybody can make these pretty convincing deepfakes.
A few years ago we did stories about the threat of this type of technology. But then it might only be the likes of a nation-state, Russia or China or somebody else who really has access to this technology.
I think we’ve all seen over the last 14 months or so with ChatGPT that now we all tend to have access to this crazy and powerful technology.
I will give an example for this time last year:
I tried out fake audio creation software, which is widely available online, and then called my parents back in Ireland with my fake voice, and my dad fell for it. My mom kind of knew something was up, but she wasn’t quite sure what was going on. My dad fell for it and had a full conversation with my AI voice.
We were able to make that just by taking a few minutes of a recording of my voice. So basically, you can take anybody’s voice, you can pick up all the clips online of candidates, and you can essentially get him to say anything.
WOLF: I don’t think anybody expects this robocall to change the outcome of an election where Biden isn’t even on the ballot. What is the ultimate threat?
O’SULLIVAN: We’re seeing underlying reporting already about how this type of technology is being used in scams, particularly to target people making it sound like a loved one is calling them and getting them hand to over money. Things like that.
I think if you just look back at political campaigns – 2012 and Mitt Romney’s 47% comment (when he argued that nearly half of Americans were dependent on the government), which was caught on audio. Donald Trump of course, with the “Access Hollywood” tape back in 2016.
All throughout modern American political campaign history, audio and tapes have played fundamentally important roles in campaigns. The concern is that tapes start emerging online that make it sound like Biden or Trump have said something that they didn’t really say, maybe something that’s quite incriminating.
Now, obviously, we have checks and balances in place for that. We consult AI experts and other digital forensic experts that can say, well, this doesn’t sound quite right here. There’s also some technology that’s been developed to try and detect these fakes.
We all know that now in this modern era of mis- and disinformation, even when something is fact checked, millions or tens of millions of people can hear a piece of fake audio before that happens, and it can still place doubts in people’s minds.
WOLF: So what is your advice to people? How should they approach something they see?
O’SULLIVAN: Especially since 2016, over the past decade, I think a lot of us, particularly people who are more and more clued into politics, we’re getting used to this era of mis- and disinformation and knowing that you can’t trust everything you read on the internet.
But now you can’t trust everything you physically hear or watch on the internet or elsewhere either.
That is easier said than done. It is just a general, absolute – being diligent, getting your information from reliable sources, etc. Here’s the thing: I do think that this type of technology allows for a profoundly different form of disinformation.
Because it’s one thing to read something, but if you hear a tape or you watch a video, I think that resonates in a very different way.
There is a lot of disinformation particularly on the political right, but anybody can fall for this stuff, and particularly if it’s playing into an existing narrative.
We all have people in our families who are one way politically inclined, and we like to think it’s the other side who is getting misinformed, but I don’t think that’s the case. And especially with this kind of technology.
WOLF: Have we seen the other side of things where someone created a deepfake to essentially lie about themselves in their own interest?
O’SULLIVAN: I haven’t really seen an example of that.
What I will say is the most mind-bending, dystopian element of all of this is that we all need to be aware that this technology is out there – so we’re living in this kind of new reality, or unreality, as people become more aware that this technology exists, that gives politicians and others the ability to deny something that might really have happened.
For instance, you can imagine that if the “Access Hollywood” tape arrived in 2024, Trump could say that’s a deepfake.
In addition to creating the possibility of fake scenarios, it also allows people the space to deny real scenarios.
There is a tape that is now being investigated by some federal authorities of (pro-Trump political operative) Roger Stone allegedly speaking about assassinating members of Congress.
He denies that he ever said that. So you can already see this kind of defense being utilized.
WOLF: The next-generation version of “my Twitter account was hacked” when it wasn’t.
WOLF: The frightening thing to me is that we only know what we know. We know this particular robocall exists, but we don’t really know what else is out there. We can’t say for sure where it came from or who is behind it.
You described a lag time of being able to verify something when people are exposed to it. And that’s an important thing. We assume it was to push down turnout for a write-in campaign for Biden, but we don’t know that to be true. It’s a mystery. And the more of these things that are out there, we won’t have any idea.
O’SULLIVAN: I think because this stuff is so easy to make, especially when it comes to audio, this is not just going to happen on a presidential level. This can happen all the way to dogcatcher.
If something happens involving Biden and Trump, there are going to be lots of eyeballs and people calling it out.
But I think it’s going to be at every level – state, county, township, city – and that’s going to be harder to catch.
If you want a visual example to point to, there was a lot of disinformation on the elections in Taiwan a few weeks back. There is a video of a US congressman that turned out to be a deepfake where he’s saying he’s soliciting votes for Taiwan’s presidential candidate.
WOLF: This has been a very depressing conversation. Is there an optimistic note you can leave us on?
O’SULLIVAN: You can take some bit of comfort from the fact that my mom was able to figure out that something was up with the deepfake.
I think people are also becoming more aware. Don’t trust everything you read on the internet. And I’d like to think as a society we’re getting a bit better at being a bit more skeptical.
The fact that we’re having these conversations now in January is better than all of us learning about this technology in September or October of this year."
VPH0TZSDYL_EY9RZUCJFFRGEVL,"New Hampshire exit poll: Majority of GOP primary voters aren’t MAGA, but most would be satisfied with Trump nomination","By Ariel Edwards-Levy, CNN","5 minute read Updated 11:05 PM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/23/politics/exit-poll-new-hampshire-primary/,"The voters who turned out for New Hampshire’s GOP presidential primary on Tuesday were less staunchly conservative and less closely tied to the Republican Party than the electorate in last week’s Iowa caucuses, according to the early results of CNN’s exit poll. But even in a state less naturally inclined to serve as a stronghold for former President Donald Trump, GOP primary voters proved largely willing to embrace him over his remaining rival, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley.
Related article Trump will win New Hampshire Republican primary, CNN projects
About two-thirds of New Hampshire GOP primary voters described themselves as conservative, according to the early results of the exit poll, with about one-quarter calling themselves very conservative. Most said they did not consider themselves a part of the MAGA movement, referring to the “Make America Great Again” slogan popularized by Trump in 2016. Those numbers form a substantially different backdrop than in Iowa’s caucuses, where nearly 9 in 10 described themselves as conservative, and nearly half identified themselves as MAGA.
But roughly 6 in 10 New Hampshire GOP primary voters said they’d be satisfied to see Trump as the Republican Party’s eventual nominee, and most said they’d consider him fit to return to the presidency even if convicted of a crime.
Exit polls are a valuable tool to help understand primary voters’ demographic profile and political views. Like all surveys, however, exit polls are estimates, not precise measurements of the electorate. That’s particularly true for the preliminary set of exit poll numbers, which haven’t yet been weighted to match the final results of the primary. But the results provide a glimpse of the types of voters turning out to participate.
Voters who were registered as Republicans broke heavily for Trump, the exit poll finds, with roughly three-quarters favoring him. Voters registered as undeclared – the state’s term for independent voters – favored Haley by a wide, if less overwhelming, margin, with about two-thirds backing her.
And echoing a frequently seen split in the Republican Party, there was a sharp educational divide among the state’s GOP primary voters. About two-thirds of voters without college degrees backed Trump, while roughly 6 in 10 college graduates supported Haley.

Roughly 7 in 10 of the New Hampshire voters backing Trump said they were registered as Republicans. And about 8 in 10 of Trump’s voters denied the legitimacy of President Joe Biden’s election win in 2020, highlighting the election denialism that remains widespread among his supporters. There is no evidence of widespread election fraud in 2020. Haley’s backers present a near mirror image: about 7 in 10 said they were registered as undeclared prior to Tuesday, and the vast majority acknowledged the results of the 2020 election.
Most Trump voters in New Hampshire made up their minds early and cast their votes with little hesitation: about three-quarters say they decided on Trump more than a month ago. A similar share said that they cast their vote for the candidate they “strongly favored,” with only a few saying they liked Trump with reservations, or that their vote was driven largely by dislike of his rivals. By contrast, Haley voters decided later – most in the last month – and often with some reluctance: roughly 4 in 10 Haley voters in New Hampshire attributed their support of her mostly to distaste for her opponents, with about 3 in 10 saying they liked her with reservations, and only about a third that they strongly favored Haley.
Asked which of four personal qualities mattered most to them in a candidate, roughly 3 in 10 voters said they wanted to see a candidate who would fight for them and a similar share that they wanted someone who shared their values, with fewer looking for a candidate who had the right temperament or could defeat Biden.
Trump’s voters said they most prized a willingness to fight for them; by contrast, Haley’s voters were more likely to cite temperament as key than to say the same of any other characteristic.
The primary electorate as a whole was a largely unhappy one – about 8 in 10 expressed dissatisfaction with the state of the country. But Trump voters were more than three times likelier than Haley voters to describe themselves as angry about the way things are going in the US. And although only a small share of the electorate felt that their family was falling behind substantially, that group broke heavily for Trump.
New Hampshire’s Republican primary voters largely cited the economy or immigration as their top issue in the election, with fewer citing abortion or foreign policy as their top concern. But Trump and Haley voters diverged widely in their attitudes across the spectrum of issues. Roughly 8 in 10 Trump voters said that most undocumented immigrants in the US should be deported from the country, while about two-thirds of Haley voters said that undocumented immigrants should be given the chance to apply for legal status. About half of Trump voters said the US should take a less active role in world affairs than it currently does, with only 3 in 10 Haley voters saying the same.
While supporters of both candidates in the state largely said they’d oppose a federal law banning most or all abortions – another difference from Iowa, where a majority of caucusgoers supported such a ban – Haley’s backers in New Hampshire opposed the idea by a much broader margin.
The exit poll for New Hampshire’s Republican presidential primary was conducted by Edison Research on behalf of the National Election Pool. It includes 2,029 interviews with Republican primary voters across 40 different polling places. Results for the full sample have a margin of error of plus or minus 4.0 percentage points; it is larger for subgroups.

VQAIN9QR70_WAF8RMC0XXDFJVP,Boeing faces new safety alert over earlier generation of 737s,"By Gregory Wallace and Hanna Ziady, CNN","3 minute read Updated 5:09 AM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240122,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/22/business/boeing-737-earlier-generation-faa/,"(CNN) — The US Federal Aviation Administration has urged airlines to inspect so-called door plugs on an earlier version of Boeing 737 airplanes, after one blew out of the side of the newer Max model during an Alaska Airlines flight earlier this month.
The FAA on Sunday said airlines operating the Boeing 737-900ER model should “visually inspect mid-exit door plugs to ensure the door is properly secured,” referring to the panel that plugs the hole where a mid-plane exit would be.
“The Boeing 737-900ER is not part of the newer Max fleet but has the same door plug design,” the US aviation regulator added in what is known as a safety alert for operators.
Boeing’s shares fell almost 3% in premarket trade Monday. The safety alert on a plane that has been in service for almost two decades will deal a fresh blow to the company, which has faced repeated quality and safety issues with its aircraft in recent years, leading to the long-term grounding of some jets and delayed deliveries of others.
The planemaker’s stock has declined about 14% since a door plug on one of its Max 9 airplanes shot out from the side of the fuselage only a few minutes into a flight from Portland, Oregon, to Ontario, California, forcing the pilot to make an emergency landing.
In a statement shared with CNN, Boeing said it “fully” supports the FAA and its own customers in the regulator’s latest action.
Since the terrifying incident just over two weeks ago, some airlines have inspected the earlier-built Boeing planes and observed “findings with bolts” holding the door plugs in place, according to the FAA. The regulator did not specify what the findings were.
After recent inspections of the newer Max 9s, United Airlines and Alaska Airlines have also both found loose bolts.
United, Delta Airlines and Alaska Airlines told CNN Monday that they had already started inspections of their Boeing 737-900ER aircraft and did not anticipate any disruptions to operations. “We have had no findings to date,” Alaska Airlines said.
According to data on Boeing’s website, it has delivered a total of around 500 of these airplanes to carriers that also include Turkish Airlines.
Alaska said in a statement it began inspecting its 737-900ER planes several days ago and had “no findings” so far. It expects to complete the remainder of its 737-900ER inspections without pulling the planes from service.
The FAA notice does not ground the earlier generation of plane. Instead, it recommends that airlines inspect the door plugs and the bolts “as soon as possible.”
The newer Max 9 aircraft continue to be grounded in the United States. The agency said it continued to review data collected from inspections of 40 sample aircraft as it considered how to determine if the planes were safe to fly again.

VRITKTXNGS_2YHX5M8TFK49IZ8,Why are measles cases popping up across the United States? Here’s what to know about the highly contagious virus,"By Amanda Musa and Carma Hassan, CNN","7 minute read Updated 3:13 PM EST, Mon January 29, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/23/health/measles-cases-xpn-wellness/,"Nearly two dozen cases of measles have been reported since December 1, according to an alert from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. International travel, coupled with declining global vaccination rates, is probably behind this spate of cases, experts say.
The Philadelphia Department of Public Health has confirmed at least nine cases of measles over the past month after a person contracted the highly contagious virus outside the United States and exposed a parent and child at a children’s hospital, according to health department spokesperson James Garrow. That exposure then led to a Philadelphia day care outbreak that includes at least five children.

Health officials in Virginia are also warning people who recently traveled out of two D.C.-area airports – Dulles International Airport on January 3 and Reagan Washington National Airport on January 4 – of potential exposure to the virus after someone returning to the US from abroad traveled through Northern Virginia.
Additionally, a single case of measles has been confirmed in “an unvaccinated resident of the metro Atlanta area,” the Georgia Department of Public Health announced this month.
“The individual was exposed to measles while traveling out of the country,” a news release said. “DPH is working to identify anyone who may have had contact with the individual while they were infectious.”
It’s not only the United States. In the UK, a measles outbreak continues to widen: As of January 18, there have been 216 confirmed cases and 103 probable cases reported since October. The UK Health Security Agency has declared a national incident to signal the growing public health risk.
“It’s always concerning when we have a case of measles because of the probability that it’s going to spread to other individuals,” said Dr. Thomas Murray, a professor of pediatrics at the Yale School of Medicine who focuses on infectious diseases and global health.
“About 90% of susceptible people who are exposed will come down with signs and symptoms of the disease, so it’s very contagious.”
Measles was eliminated in the United States in 2000, after zero virus spread for more than a year, largely due to a “highly effective vaccination campaign,” according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

However, clusters in the US are still possible because the virus is not eliminated worldwide. There are several countries with active outbreaks.
“Many of the diseases for which we have vaccines have virtually disappeared from the United States but certainly not in other places around the world,” Murray said.
If an unvaccinated person goes to a country where a disease is still common, becomes infected and brings it back to the US, Murray notes, they can spread the virus to other unvaccinated people.
“There’s a lot of travel back and forth,” he said. “If there are pockets of unvaccinated individuals that are congregating closely together and that disease gets introduced into that population, you can have large clusters of cases.”
Vaccination rates in the US also remain low, particularly among children, according to American Academy of Pediatrics spokesperson Dr. Christina Johns, a Maryland-based pediatric emergency physician at a PM Pediatric Care urgent care.
The CDC noted in its alert that the majority of the measles cases “were among children and adolescents who had not received a measles-containing vaccine (MMR or MMRV), even if age eligible.”
About 92% of US children have been vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella (called the MMR vaccine) by age 2, according to a 2023 report from the CDC – below the federal target of 95%.

The percentage of kindergartners who got their state-required vaccines for measles also remained below the federal target for the 2022-23 school year, according to CDC data. And the rate of vaccine exemptions for children has reached the highest level ever reported in the US.
Children should get two doses of the MMR vaccine, according to the CDC: the first dose at 12 to 15 months of age and the second at 4 to 6 years of age.
Before the nation’s measles vaccination program, about 3 million to 4 million people got the virus every year, and about 400 to 500 died.
The last significant measles outbreak in the US was in 2018-19 in Rockland County, New York, focused among unvaccinated children in Orthodox Jewish communities.
Although the CDC reported only 56 measles cases in 2023, Johns says that is too many when a highly effective vaccine exists.
“Most people haven’t seen a case of measles,” she stressed. “They don’t really have an appreciation for the severity of the illness.”
The measles virus can spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes, lingering in the air for up to two hours after they leave a room, according to Murray. The virus can also live on surfaces such as doorknobs for about the same amount of time.

When symptoms begin, they’re similar to those of many respiratory illnesses – high fever, cough, red eyes, runny nose and congestion – followed by a “fairly characteristic” rash, Murray said.
“You get flat red lesions, flat red spots that typically start on your face and move down across the body across the chest and trunk and extremities,” he said. “It can be a total body rash, and it’s pretty severe.”
The incubation period for measles is very long, Murray adds. It takes about 10 to 12 days for initial symptoms to appear after exposure.
Because of this, most infected people assume their respiratory symptoms are nothing but a cold until the rash appears three to five days after the initial illness begins, according to Murray. Even then, most people – including some doctors – will not recognize a measles rash.
“Infected people are contagious from 4 days before the rash starts through 4 days afterwards,” the CDC says.
“The younger the health care provider, the less likely they are to have seen a case,” Murray said. “But certainly, when it’s circulating, we do everything we can to get the word out on what to look for.”
The CDC advises health-care workers to isolate patients who may have measles in specific isolation rooms or private rooms instead of having them waiting in common areas; to test patients with suspected cases; and promptly alert state and local health departments.
Lower MMR vaccination rates can put unvaccinated and undervaccinated individuals at risk, Johns says, especially children and those with immune system problems.
Measles can lead to serious complications, especially in children under 2, such as blindness, encephalitis or inflammation of the brain, and severe pneumonia, according to Murray.
“Measles is also a virus that knocks down parts of the immune system,” he said. “There’s recent evidence that having measles increases your susceptibility to other infections.”
A rare complication called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis can also happen seven to 10 years after infection and may result in seizures as well as behavioral and mental deterioration.
Additionally, someone who doesn’t get the MMR vaccine is at risk of contracting mumps and rubella, which are rare but still in circulation in the US due to international travel.
In 2023, 436 mumps cases were reported by 42 jurisdictions, according to CDC data. Rubella is less common, with fewer than 10 people in the US getting the virus each year.
If you’re fully vaccinated against measles, your chance of infection after exposure is very low because the two childhood doses typically confer lifelong immunity, experts say.
Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.
“It’s not impossible, but it’s very, very low,” Murray notes.
But for people who aren’t unvaccinated or who have weak immune systems, the risk increases – “especially if they know they’re in an area where measles has been circulating,” he said. “In that case, what you would do is, you would call your health care provider and work with [them] to determine next steps.”
If you think you might have been exposed to measles, stay home until a plan is in place, Murray advises.
“Call ahead before you go to any health care facility, because that health care facility can anticipate your arrival and make sure you are placed in the appropriate isolation rooms,” Murray said. “The last thing we want to do is have someone with measles sitting in the emergency room waiting room.”
Unvaccinated people who know when they were exposed can get the MMR vaccine within 72 hours of exposure to prevent the disease altogether or lessen the severity of the illness, Murray adds.
As for treatment, the virus simply has to run its course, he says. There is no specific antiviral treatment, and medical care is mainly supportive: staying home from school or work to rest and drink plenty of fluids.
If a person infected with measles is showing symptoms of encephalitis, such as a headache, high fever or seizures, they should be taken to a hospital immediately.
“Typically, hospitalization for measles occurs when children are in respiratory distress from lung involvement like pneumonia or are dehydrated and need IV fluids,” Johns said.
Severe measles cases among children can also be treated with vitamin A, according to the CDC, to support the immune system.
“Vitamin A should be administered immediately on diagnosis and repeated the next day,” the agency said.

Terry Martin, 76, pleaded guilty to theft in October.
He stole the shoes from the Judy Garland Museum in Grand Rapids, Minnesota, – Garland’s hometown – after being approached by a person he calls “an old mob associate,” offering him “a job,” Martin told authorities.
“While Terry had been crime free for years, the addict’s rush of anticipation was too much, and he gave into the temptation of ‘one last score,’” Martin’s attorneys wrote in a statement to the court.

According to Martin, the man who first proposed the theft – whom Martin has refused to name – wanted the shoes not for their value as cultural artifacts, but because he mistakenly thought the slippers contained real rubies that could be sold as valuable gems.
Martin admitted to taking the slippers after he entered the closed museum on August 27, 2005, by breaking through a door, then breaking the plexiglass enclosure that held the shoes with a sledgehammer. He claims they were in his possession for only two days.
The slippers were recovered by the FBI in a sting operation in 2018 when other suspects attempted to collect an insurance reward for their return, according to Martin’s plea agreement.
Despite a lengthy criminal history, prosecutors agreed to recommend no jail time for Martin because of his poor health. “Martin is on oxygen at all times … and a medical determination was made that Martin’s illness is terminal, and his life expectancy is less than six months,” prosecutors said in a court filing.
Martin’s sentencing is scheduled for January 29.
The stolen slippers are one of four pairs still known to exist that were used in the 1939 film that starred Garland as Dorothy Gale, according to the US Attorney’s Office for Minnesota.
The magical shoes are used in the movie to send Dorothy back to Kansas as she repeats, “There’s no place like home.”"

Before his death, Tatarsky was one of Russia’s most outspoken and ultranationalist military bloggers, known for his ardent pro-war commentary and occasional criticism of Moscow’s battlefield failures.
He was killed in the April 2023 blast, which came during an event at the cafe.
Trepova was arrested soon after on suspicion she had handed over the explosive device, hidden in a statue, to Tatarsky, state media Tass reported at the time.
Trepova’s husband, Dmitry Rylov, told an independent Russian publication that he is convinced she was set up.
Tatarsky supported the war in Ukraine and had gained popularity by providing analysis and commentary on Telegram, much of which advocated for a harsher approach towards Ukraine.
Tatarsky, whose real name is Maxim Fomin, created his Telegram channel in 2019, naming it in honor of the protagonist of Victor Pelevin’s novel “Generation ‘P,’” according to Russian state news agency Vesti. He had since written several books and previously fought among Russian forces in Donbas, eastern Ukraine, in 2014.

It cites crime as the problem","By Jordan Valinsky, CNN","3 minute read Updated 6:49 AM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/23/food/in-n-out-oakland-closure-crime/,"In-N-Out is permanently closing one of its restaurants for the first time ever, announcing that its Oakland location will soon shutter because of rampant crime in the California city.
The burger chain said in a statement that “despite taking repeated steps to create safer conditions, our customers and associates are regularly victimized by car break-ins, property damage, theft, and armed robberies.”
The location, which has been open for nearly two decades, will close on March 24. It’s the city’s only In-N-Out and is near the airport.
Crime has indeed substantially increased in Oakland: Burglaries were up 23% and motor vehicle thefts were up 44% in 2023 compared to a year prior, according to Oakland Police Department data obtained by CNN affiliate KGO-TV.
In-N-Out said in a statement that while “several” of its locations have relocated in its 75-year history, the Oakland closure is the first restaurant it has closed.
“We feel the frequency and severity of the crimes being encountered by our customers and associates leave us no alternative,” said Chief Operating Officer Denny Warnick, in the statement.
Notably, Warnick said its Oakland location was “busy and profitable,” but it can’t ask its customers or employees to “visit or work in an unsafe environment.” Affected employees, which amount to about 100, will transfer to a nearby restaurant in San Francisco or receive severance.

A diner told CNN affiliate KPIX-TV that someone broke into their car recently while they were eating inside the In-N-Out location. “They were trying to steal my vehicle, but I had a kill switch on. So they couldn’t get my vehicle, but they took all my belongings out,” the diner said.
An In-N-Out employee also told the station they’ve seen armed robberies at the restaurant’s parking lot.
Councilwoman Treva Reid said she’s been asking Oakland’s mayor’s office for more police in the area but hasn’t received the support. “We’re in a state of emergency. Should it have to take a declaration to deliver (services) when we’re living this? My district has been in crisis,” she told KPIX-TV.
In-N-Out is a privately held company with roughly 400 locations around the United States, mostly on the west coast. It made national headlines last year when it banned its employees in five states from wearing masks as part of new company guidelines that “emphasize the importance of customer service,” notably showing their smiles.
In 2021, its locations in Contra Costa county (also near Oakland) temporarily closed because it didn’t want to verify customers’ vaccination status, which was required during that time for indoor dining.
Starbucks, Target and other stores have closed in Oakland and other cities recently over concerns about crime.
Target said in September that it was closing nine stores in major cities across four states, claiming theft and organized retail crime have made the environment unsafe for staff and customers – and unsustainable for business.
Crime rates vary from city to city, however. Nationally, violent crime fell 8.2% in 2023 for the second straight year after a rise in 2021, according to the FBI.
But crime has increased in Oakland. Violent crime increased 21% in 2023 from the year prior, according to the Oakland Police Department."

With the waves growing as the day ran on, powered by storms battering western Europe this week, no one could stop Chianca from winning a consecutive title in the men’s competition.
He then continued his impressive track record at the event by winning the team competition alongside compatriot Pedro Scooby.
“This is a dream for me, I never expected to win so many times here,” Chianca said, per the World Surf League (WSL).
“This place is magical, Nazaré has given me everything in my life. This win is probably the most special to me because we were a 100% Brazilian team.
“It was such a pleasure to tow with Scooby, one of the guys who pushed me, helped me and inspired me when I started surfing big waves. I’m really happy to give him back a little bit with our performance today.”
There was yet more success for Brazil, with Gabeira winning the women’s competition.
The Brazilian held her nerve after being wiped out earlier in the day, recovering to secure a “rewarding” win.
“I’ve been injured for what seems like forever now so it was great to compete again and to get the win is a great way to come back,” Gabeira said, per the WSL.
“Today was a very difficult day to surf and especially to perform rail surfing. And to do that under a time pressure is tough, normally in the free surf when you’re tired you rest, here you have to go and you tend to take more risk than you probably should. It’s very difficult but so very rewarding in the end.”
Europe has witnessed extreme weather this week, as Storm Isha caused havoc with flights, with dozens of cancelations, diversions and go-arounds in western Europe.
While bad news for some, it was perhaps good news for surfers with the swell on Monday providing thrilling competition for spectators who had flocked to Nazaré.
While the waves were big, they are known to get much bigger on the coastline.
Nazaré is a notorious hunting ground for big wave surfers with storms out in the Atlantic creating huge breakers – the waves are also magnified by an underwater canyon five kilometers deep, according to Reuters.

In 2017, Brazilian surfer Rodrigo Koxa broke the then world record for the biggest wave surfed, after riding a wave measuring 80 feet (24.38 meters) tall in the Portuguese fishing village.
Koxa’s record beat the previous mark of 78 feet (23.77 meters) surfed in 2011 by American Garrett McNamara, also in Nazaré.
In 2020, Sebastian Steudtner broke the world record again, surfing a wave 86 feet (26.21 meters) tall, equivalent to an eight-story building.
While the coastline is considered a paradise for big wave surfers, it’s also incredibly dangerous. Multiple surfers have been injured and even died tackling the infamous waves.
Last year, for example, veteran Brazilian surfer Marcio Freire died while practising tow-in surfing on the giant waves."
W2OVV7SK2D_SL56USCKHGR0S35,Opinion: Democrats could be repeating their mistake from 2016,"Opinion By Julian Zelizer, CNN","5 minute read Updated 3:27 PM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/25/opinions/trump-haley-biden-democrats-zelizer/,"Editor’s Note: Julian Zelizer, a CNN political analyst, is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University. He is the author and editor of 25 books, including The New York Times bestseller “Myth America: Historians Take on the Biggest Lies and Legends About Our Past” (Basic Books). The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.
Democrats should not make the mistake of underestimating former President Donald Trump. This is exactly what the party did in 2016, when former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was the Democratic nominee, and there are some who currently risk repeating the error.
Following Trump’s strong showing in the New Hampshire primary, which has effectively knocked his final opponent — former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley — out of the race, some of his critics continue to search for slivers of good news.
They point to the fact that despite “almost” being an incumbent, he didn’t receive a share of the vote on par with what previous incumbents have encountered in primary contests. Incumbents usually bring to the table unequaled name recognition, fund-raising capacity and the benefit of looking presidential as they run for reelection. Trump has most of this, with his supporters holding on to the memory of him in the Oval Office, and with many of his backers believing he literally won the presidency in 2020, yet Haley pulled a decent part of the electorate away from him.
Moreover, they note, Haley was able to win independent voters who theoretically would be more amenable to President Joe Biden than Trump in the fall. Moreover, the number of Republicans who keep saying they won’t vote for Trump under any circumstances, gives Democrats hope that on Election Day, many voters in the GOP won’t turn out.
Related article Opinion: Are Biden and Trump too old to run?
But these arguments downplay the threat Trump will pose to Biden in November by ignoring several fundamentals. In fact, given the extraordinary baggage and problems Trump brings to the table, it is remarkable that the former president is doing so well and points to the formidable threat he poses.
Most important, Trump is not an incumbent; he is a one-term president who lost to the person he is running against just four years ago. Moreover, he is polling well and defeating his primary opponents despite the fact that the GOP suffered stunning blows to their congressional power, costing the party control of the Senate in 2020 and again in the midterm elections of 2022, and hurting them in state offices in a number of special elections.
Trump is succeeding even though the United States has never had a major presidential candidate saddled with so much legal baggage. Trump is not just a defeated one-term president, but a one-term president who allegedly attempted to overturn an election he lost — a period that can truly be called unprecedented in American history. As if that was not enough, he has subsequently been indicted four times, including on charges that revolve around an alleged massive abuse of presidential power (he has denied all wrongdoing).
Meanwhile, two states have decided to ban him from the ballot based on allegations of insurrection (he is appealing). And civil cases about sexual assault, tax fraud and defamation are also underway (he has challenged these as well). Yet, not only is Trump defeating his Republican opponents despite these legal challenges, but they keep defending him and rallying to his side even in the heat of political battle.
Related article Opinion: Nikki Haley’s right. Red flags about Trump’s mental fitness can’t be ignored
Indeed, Donald Trump continues to win as Donald Trump. There has been no turning point, no shift to acting presidential and no serious effort to abide by the traditional norms of national politics. He has continued to blast his opponents with name-calling insults, to spread disinformation and falsehoods and to conduct politics in the spirit of a WWE cage match rather than a forum of serious deliberation. Trump 2024 is acting very much like Trump 2020 and 2016.
That’s no doubt because the qualities that propelled him in the past to command media attention continue to be effective. Even if he has lost many steps as a result of age — as Haley and others have argued — Trump continues to retain all of his talents as a showman. Trump still knows how to do television. He is the entertainer in chief.
Trump’s enduring ability to garner attention through provocative performances was clear right after the media projected Trump as the winner in New Hampshire. Instead of a standard victory speech, Trump lit into Haley. He unleashed a series of vindictive comments about her, even going so far as to insult her clothing. Though some analysts were surprised by his decision and noted that he might have goaded Haley into continuing to run, they missed the point. The point was to do and say things that drew attention to him, that created 24 hours of social media conversation about Trump, that took attention from everyone else on the playing field.
Related article Opinion: In victory, Trump loses it
Trump, who lives by the maxim that all publicity is good publicity, will no doubt create similar obstacles for Biden in communicating his message and securing national attention as the race heats up.
Finally, by most indications, Trump still has strong support in the Republican Party. It is not clear whether those currently telling pollsters they would never vote for Trump will feel the same way by November, once Trump has unleashed his scorched-earth attacks on Biden and depicted him in conservative circles as the second coming of Karl Marx.
When voters go to vote on November 5, many of those Americans might very well decide that tax cuts, deregulation and conservative justices are much more important than any concerns they have about what a second term Trump presidency would do.
And despite the legislative success of the Biden presidency, as well as strong economic indicators, Trump benefits from the fact that many Republicans perceive the pre-Covid years of his presidency to have been much more prosperous than today, when they see higher prices, major wars abroad and chaos at the borders as well as in cities as a result of undocumented immigration. To them, it is “American carnage” all over again.
In 2016, many observers wondered if the election would be like 1964, when President Lyndon Johnson trounced right-wing Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater, who many saw as an extremist and dangerous to the nation. The answer was no. Most Republicans came home.

None of this is to say that Trump is invincible. He is not. Indeed, 2020 proved the point. Polls for 2024 show that the race is close and will probably come down to turnout in a handful of swing states. A few swing state polls have Biden ahead. As Democratic strategist Simon Rosenberg recently told The New York Times’ Ezra Klein, Democrats have been doing extraordinarily well in national elections.
Trump can be defeated with a massive voter turnout operation. But his performance thus far in the caucuses and primaries, especially given the context of what he faces, has been notable for the underlying strength behind his candidacy that the contests have revealed."
W6HIVHII3C_FRZ27MD57BV5GKS,Why airlines plug up emergency exits,By Amy Fraher,"4 minute read Published 6:59 AM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/travel/why-airlines-plug-up-emergency-exits/,"Editor’s Note: The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer. CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation, a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation.
The aviation industry is still in shock from a near disaster on January 5, 2024, in which a 60-pound “door plug” blew out from a nearly new Boeing 737 MAX 9 in flight at 16,000 feet, leaving a gaping hole in the fuselage.
In response, the Federal Aviation Administration grounded all 737 MAX 9 planes with such plugs, and aviation authorities in other countries have followed suit.
The industry is watching closely.
A lot of news coverage has emphasized the impressive safety record of the global airline industry, particularly since an Alaska Airlines crew managed to land the plane with no fatalities. I commend the outstanding performance of airline employees, air traffic controllers and emergency responders who achieved this impressive feat.
However, as a former United Airlines pilot now lecturing in Yale University’s School of Management, I believe the wrong questions are being asked about what happened on Alaska Airlines Flight 1282. As the National Transportation Safety Board and numerous news outlets have explained, door plugs are commonly used to seal unused exits on commercial airliners. The question we need to ask is: Why wouldn’t an airline use all of an aircraft’s emergency exits? Wouldn’t that make passengers safer?
It’s all about money.
Airlines have lots of expenses. Some, such as jet fuel, are easier to calculate. Others, such as emergency exits, are more opaque to travelers.
Believe it or not, every functioning emergency exit comes at a price for an airline. Each requires routine maintenance and frequent inspections – for example, to make sure that emergency evacuation slides work properly – and flight attendants must staff emergency exits during takeoff and landing for safety reasons.
In other words, every working exit comes with associated costs in salaries, health benefits, pension plans, training and related expenses. Sealing off an emergency exit cuts costs.
But is every one of those emergency exits crucial? From the US government’s perspective, not necessarily.
In the US, airlines must comply with federal aviation regulations, which dictate aircraft maintenance procedures and in-flight personnel assignments – and minimum standards for emergency exits.
The issue is that Boeing sells the same airplane to different airlines with different needs.
Boeing notes that its 737 MAX 9 can carry up to 220 passengers, which, under US regulations, requires it be built with a specific number of emergency exits. This dense seating configuration is common among lower-cost global airlines such as Jakarta-based Lion Air.
However, given Americans’ desire for legroom, most US carriers are equipped with considerably fewer than 220 seats – and when there are fewer than 190 seats, the rules allow fewer emergency exits to be in service. The Alaska Airlines Max 9 had just 178 seats.
Under these conditions, the federal rules allow air carriers to disable these exits and plug the openings. That’s precisely what happened with Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 – and how “door plug” suddenly entered the American vernacular.
Although this sort of workaround is authorized, it’s unclear to me that this is in the best interest of air safety. Wouldn’t it be better for the FAA to require that all exits are available for use in an emergency, regardless of aircraft seating capacity, even if it required some additional expense for airlines?
The 737 MAX is a plane of many firsts – not all of them positive.
The MAX is the latest addition to Boeing’s 737 family of aircraft. The 737 family has far eclipsed all rivals as the most popular commercial airliner ever built, with over 10,000 sold worldwide since its introduction in 1967.
Some carriers, such as Southwest Airlines in the United States and Ryanair in Ireland, fly only 737s; it’s a critical element of their low-cost business strategy. By flying just one type of aircraft, these airlines significantly improve scheduling flexibility while cutting maintenance and training costs.
That’s all to say that demand for the latest 737 was high. In 2017, when the FAA certified the 737 MAX safe for flight, Boeing had already received more than 3,600 new orders from 83 customers.
But very shortly afterward, two crashes that together killed 346 people grounded the 737 MAX for nearly two years – another first as the longest airline grounding in aviation history. Destined to profit US$12 million on the sale of each $121 million MAX, there was significant incentive for Boeing to press on with MAX development even though it had already proved to be a dangerously problematic aircraft design.
In 2020, the FAA recertified the MAX as “safe for flight”; by 2023, Boeing had logged more than 7,000 total orders for the MAX, far eclipsing the sale of any other type of airliner. This fact alone ought to raise safety concerns. It may soon prove impossible to avoid flying on a 737 MAX, particularly in the U.S. domestic market. United, American, Southwest and Alaska airlines all currently fly the MAX.
When airplane parts and passengers’ cellphones are raining from the sky, it could be a sign that the industry needs to think harder about unintended costs – and consequences.

W761BOZH3P_BHMROL83RAMEUXM,Groundwater levels are rapidly declining around the world — with a few notable exceptions,"By Katie Hunt, CNN","3 minute read Updated 8:27 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/24/climate/groundwater-global-study-scn/,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.
Many parts of the world are experiencing a rapid depletion in the subterranean reserves of water that billions of people rely on for drinking, irrigation and other uses, according to new research that analyzed millions of groundwater level measurements from 170,000 wells in more than 40 countries.
It’s the first study to piece together what’s happening to groundwater levels at a global scale, according to the researchers involved, and will help scientists better understand what impact humans are having on this valuable underground resource, either through overuse or indirectly by changes in rainfall linked to climate change.
Groundwater, contained within cracks and pores in permeable bodies of rock known as aquifers, is a lifeline for people especially in parts of the world where rainfall and surface water are scarce, such as northwest India and the southwest United States.
Reductions in groundwater can make it harder for people to access freshwater to drink or to irrigate crops and can result in land subsidence.
“This study was driven by curiosity. We wanted to better understand the state of global groundwater by wrangling millions of groundwater level measurements,” said co-lead author Debra Perrone, an associate professor in University of California’s Santa Barbara’s Environmental Studies Program, in a news release on the study that published in the journal Nature on Wednesday.

The authors found that groundwater levels declined between 2000 and 2022 in 71% of the 1,693 aquifer systems included in the research, with groundwater levels declining more than 0.1 meter a year in 36%, or 617, of them.
The Ascoy-Soplamo Aquifer in Spain had the fastest rate of decline in the data they compiled — a median decline of 2.95 meters per year, said study coauthor Scott Jasechko, an associate professor at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at University of California Santa Barbara.
Several aquifer systems in Iran were among those with the fastest rate of groundwater decline, he added.
The team wasn’t able to gather data from much of Africa, South America and southeast Asia because of a lack of monitoring, but Jasechko said the study included the countries where most global groundwater pumping takes place.
The study also highlighted some success stories in Bangkok, Arizona and New Mexico, where groundwater has begun to recover after interventions to better regulate water use or redirect water to replenish depleted aquifers.
“I was impressed by the clever strategies that have been put into action to address groundwater depletion in several places, though these ‘good news’ stories are very rare,” Jasechko said via email.
To understand whether the declines seen in the 21st century were accelerating, the team also accessed data for groundwater levels for 1980 to 2000 for 542 of the aquifers in the study.
They found that declines in groundwater levels sped up in the first two decades of the 21st century for 30% of those aquifers, outpacing the declines recorded between 1980 and 2000.
“These cases of accelerating groundwater-level declines are more than twice as prevalent as one would expect from random fluctuations in the absence of any systematic trends in either time period,” the study noted.
Donald John MacAllister, a hydrologist at the British Geological Survey who wasn’t involved in the research, said it was a really “impressive” set of data, despite some gaps.
“I think it’s fair to say this global compilation of groundwater data hasn’t been done, certainly on this scale, at least to my knowledge before,” he said.
“Groundwater is an incredibly important resource but one of the challenges is… because we can’t see it, it’s out of mind for most people. Our challenge is to constantly bang the drum for policymakers — that we have this resource that we have to look after, and that we can use to build resilience and adapt to climate change.”"
WANDLWCMFZ_HFF1HJKSHM5TVGP,Israeli hostage posters at Harvard vandalized with antisemitic messages,"By Matt Egan and Paul Murphy, CNN","4 minute read Updated 2:42 PM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/23/business/harvard-israeli-hostage-posters-vandalized/,"Israeli hostage posters that were hung up at Harvard University had been vandalized with antisemitic messages just as students returned from winter break.
Harvard condemned the vandalization on Tuesday and said university police are investigating the incident.
“The University strongly condemns the senseless and horrific vandalization on Harvard’s campus of posters displaying the faces of Israeli hostages,” a university spokesperson told CNN in a statement.
Footage shared with CNN by Harvard student Alexander Kestenbaum shows a handful of hostage posters defaced with messages such as “Israel did 9/11.” A poster of a four-year-old Israeli hostage was defaced, while “LIES FAKE” was scrawled over another hostage poster.
Photos and videos geolocated by CNN indicate the vandalized posters were hung just outside Holworthy Hall, a first-year student dorm located on the northern edge of Harvard Yard.
The Harvard spokesperson said the vandalized posters near the Thayer Gate have been removed and the Harvard University Police Department is investigating the incident.
At this time, there is “no indication” whether the perpetrator is affiliated with Harvard, the spokesperson said.
It’s not clear whether the posters were vandalized by students or outsiders on campus, which is located in the middle of Cambridge, Massachusetts. Visitors are able to walk through the gates into Harvard Yard. It’s also not clear how widespread the vandalism was.
Kestenbaum, a Harvard student who was one of the plaintiffs in a lawsuit recently leveled against the university over antisemitism, alerted Harvard officials to the vandalism on Sunday night, according to emails Kestenbaum shared with CNN.
Harvard’s Office for Equity, Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging (OEDIB) responded to Kestenbaum in an email on Monday afternoon saying officials are investigating the matter and explaining how bias-related incidents and formal complaints on discrimination can be filed.
The incident comes as Harvard is hoping to turn the page on a tumultuous period marked by soaring tensions over the Israel-Hamas war, a backlash from donors and politicians and the sudden end of Claudine Gay’s tenure as university president.
Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, called the hostage poster vandalism a “truly depraved and hideous act” and demanded Harvard leaders speak out on the incident.
“This is not political speech, but pure, unadulterated, inexcusable evil,” Greenblatt told CNN in a statement on Tuesday. “This needs to be called out forcefully by all, but especially by the Harvard leadership, particularly because the university has failed time and again when faced with similar instances.”
“Jewish students at Harvard returned from winter break this week excited to start the spring term,” said Getzel Davis, the Harvard Hillel campus rabbi, in a statement to CNN. “Instead, they were confronted with vandalism, the defacement of hostage posters, and vile antisemitic conspiracy theories. This is inexcusable and intolerable.”
Davis called on Harvard to “step up and do more” to defend students against antisemitism, both on campus and online.
Harvard told CNN on Monday that it recently met with executives from social media app Sidechat to discuss “concerning content” on the platform. Some students have complained about a surge in antisemitic posts on Sidechat, which is popular at colleges and allows users to make anonymous posts.
Alan Garber, Harvard’s interim president, unveiled a pair of presidential task forces late last week aimed at fighting both antisemitism and Islamophobia.
“Reports of antisemitic and Islamophobic acts on our campus have grown, and the sense of belonging among these groups has been undermined,” Garber said in the announcement. “We need to understand why and how that is happening—and what more we might do to prevent it.
However, famed economist Larry Summers slammed Harvard’s leaders for the selection of professor Derek Penslar as the co-chair of the antisemitism task force. Summers, a former president of Harvard, argued Penslar is “unsuited” for the key role because he previously “publicly minimized” the university’s antisemitism problem.
Some Harvard professors, students and the American Academy for Jewish Research rushed to Penslar’s defense, saying his academic credentials make him the right choice to lead the task force.
The Israel-Hamas war is fueling tensions at other major universities as well.
Last week, Columbia University students attending a pro-Palestinian protest sought medical treatment after saying they were sprayed by a foul-smelling substance. The NYPD said it received reports from six different victims who reported smelling an unknown odor, feeling nauseous and experiencing burning sensation in their eyes.
Columbia on Monday described the incident as “deeply troubling” and announced it has banned the “alleged perpetrators” from campus.

The French Data Protection Authority, or the CNIL, said in a statement Tuesday that Amazon France Logistique gave warehouse staff scanners that recorded their periods of inactivity and how quickly they performed certain tasks, such as removing an item from shelves or putting an item away.
The CNIL ruled the scanner system to be “excessive” partly because it measured “work interruptions with such accuracy, potentially requiring employees to justify every break or interruption.”
Amazon (AMZN) said in a statement posted on its European Union site: “We strongly disagree with the CNIL’s conclusions … and we reserve the right to file an appeal.
“Warehouse management systems are industry standard and are necessary for ensuring the safety, quality, and efficiency of operations and to track the storage of inventory and processing of packages on time and in line with customer expectations.”

The scanners used in France measure whether a worker scanned an item less than 1.25 seconds after scanning the previous item, based on the assumption that scanning too quickly increases the risk of error, the regulator said.
Amazon said this indicator was important to ensure that “employees take enough time to store the products so they can follow our safety guidelines” and to properly inspect each parcel before it is stored. But the company has decided to deactivate the collection of this data following the CNIL’s questions, it added.
Secondly, staff were judged to be “idle” if their scanners had been inactive for at least 10 minutes, the regulator found. Amazon said the data allowed its teams to “spot problems” that posed a risk to the firm’s operations or the safety of its employees. The company will now raise the threshold for logging “idle time” to 30 minutes, it noted.
A third indicator used by Amazon signaled when a worker’s scanner was interrupted anywhere between one and 10 minutes, according to the CNIL.
“Such systems kept employees under close surveillance for all tasks carried out with scanners and thus put them under continuous pressure,” the CNIL said, adding that the monitoring gave the company “a competitive advantage” over other companies in the online sales market.
The regulator fined Amazon France Logistique in late December following several investigations into the firm’s practices in its warehouses and complaints from employees. The CNIL found that the warehouse operator had kept data on the performance of its staff for 31 days — a length of time it also deemed “excessive.”
The regulator ruled that the firm had breached several elements of EU data protection law.
In the United States, Amazon has long faced scrutiny for the working conditions inside its warehouses, with employees complaining of punishing hours and close surveillance by bosses."
WG037GAYXX_UI6960FY9JI68HZ,"Philadelphia authorities arrest man suspected of helping escaped juvenile homicide suspect, who remains at large","By Danny Freeman and Aya Elamroussi, CNN","5 minute read Updated 7:54 PM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/25/us/philadelphia-suspect-escape/,"An 18-year-old has been arrested in connection with the Philadelphia killing suspect who escaped custody during a medical transport, the city’s police department announced Friday.
Authorities say they arrested Michael Diggs for allegedly picking up Shane Pryor, 17, after Pryor ran from two Philadelphia Juvenile Justice Services Center counselors in the driveway of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.
Pryor, who is suspected of killing a woman in 2020, escaped just before noon Wednesday while he was being transported to the hospital in the University City neighborhood for a hand injury, police said.
Police said Diggs picked up Pryor in a “cream-colored Ford” shortly after his escape, and officers were able to find the car and Diggs the same day.
Diggs is being charged with hindering apprehension, escape, use of a communication facility and criminal conspiracy, according to authorities.
“The arrest marks a significant step forward in the ongoing efforts to bring all those involved in the incident to justice,” according to a news release from police.
CNN was unable to determine whether Diggs has an attorney.
Pryor remained on the loose, authorities said. The US Marshals Service announced a $5,000 reward Thursday for information leading to the capture of Pryor, who authorities have described as dangerous.
The US Marshals Service said it believes Pryor may be receiving other help as he continues to evade custody.
“One hundred percent, he’s being helped by someone out there on the street,” Supervisory Deputy Marshal Rob Clark said at a news conference Friday afternoon.
Clark said Pryor has been in jail since he was 14, so “he surely has help aiding his flight,” adding, “how much of the city does he really know?”
Clark emphasized that, like Diggs, “anyone (else) helping him, no questions asked, you’re going to be prosecuted.”
As Pryor was getting out of a vehicle in the driveway of the hospital, he escaped from detention center staff, Frank Vanore, deputy commissioner of investigations for Philadelphia police, said in a news conference Wednesday afternoon.
Five minutes after his escape, Pryor was seen on video in the lobby of the hospital’s Hub for Clinical Collaboration building asking an employee to use the phone, and he left the building after being denied, the US Marshals Service said in a statement Thursday.

Pryor ran from the hospital, and he was seen on surveillance video entering various buildings trying to get resources, police said.
When Pryor left the vehicle, he did not appear to have any handcuffs or restraints on him, Vanore said. Investigators believe he wasn’t restrained during the transport either, a law enforcement source close to the manhunt told CNN.
Philadelphia police are investigating if Pryor broke free of his restraints, or if restraints were not used in transporting the 17-year-old to hospital, according to Sgt. Eric Gripp, a spokesperson for the Philadelphia Police Department.
Gripp told CNN it is standard practice for suspects to be handcuffed and shackled when transported. There were two juvenile services counselors in the medical transport vehicle with Pryor, which also is standard practice, Gripp said.
On Friday, US Marshals shed light on the moments immediately after Pryor escaped and the pursuit that followed.
The two counselors who were in charge of escorting Pryor to the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia chased after him and were “extremely close,” according to Clark, but they “may have slipped,” allowing Pryor to get away.
“Wherever he’s going, we’re going to pursue him,” Clark said.
Investigators believe Pryor injured himself to prompt the trip to the hospital and are “highly confident” he has received help from an accomplice to evade police, a source said.
He weighs about 180 pounds, and he’s about 5 feet, 7 inches tall, Vanore said, adding that he was wearing a dark blue sweatsuit when he fled.
Pryor was being held on a murder charge in the 2020 killing, and has been in the juvenile detention center awaiting trial since he was 14, Vanore said.
CNN has contacted the Philadelphia Department of Human Services, which runs the juvenile justice center, for comment.

“We are looking in parking garages, which are very, very large – they’re multiple levels – just to see if he’s still in the area,” Vanore said. However, officials did not believe he was in the area of the hospital as of Wednesday afternoon, the deputy commissioner said.
No lockdown was in effect Wednesday in connection with the escape. But Pryor is considered dangerous, and the public should call 911 if he is seen, police said.
“Obviously we don’t want anyone to approach him,” Vanore said. “We’re hoping that if somebody sees an individual walking without a coat – because he doesn’t have one at this point – and a blue sweatsuit, they give us a call.”
In a phone interview Thursday afternoon, defense attorney Paul DiMaio told CNN his juvenile client has “always maintained his innocence” in the murder charges he’s facing.
“He said, ‘I didn’t do this,’ and he said it over and over again,” DiMaio said. “I have no idea why he ran.”
DiMaio told CNN neither he nor Pryor’s family have heard from Pryor since he escaped, but DiMaio said he thinks Pryor may have run because of a December court ruling that kept his murder case out of juvenile court.
“The only thing I can speculate is I know from talking to his mother and talking to him (that) he was really scared and really frustrated that the system kind of failed him (by trying him as an adult),” Pryor’s attorney said.
DiMaio said while he found Pryor to be “mild mannered” and not “dangerous,” he would still advise him to turn himself in. “It could be that this fear, this frustration might have driven him – with no one really watching him – to walk away,” he said.

WL9FTN0IYX_BOCW2GCS5IVY4LN,The world successfully tackled a dangerous pollutant. But did it accidentally warm the planet in the process?,"By Laura Paddison, CNN","5 minute read Published 4:00 AM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/26/china/shipping-pollution-global-warming-climate-intl/,"The huge cargo ships that criss-cross the world’s oceans sometimes leave “tracks” in their wake — long, wispy clouds that trail through the sky, lasting for a handful of days at most before disappearing.
These ghost clouds look beautiful, but they are a visible sign of deadly air pollution. They form when tiny sulfur dioxide particles belched out from ships’ smokestacks interact with water vapor in the atmosphere, creating low-lying, highly reflective clouds.
Ships’ sulfur pollution causes tens of thousands of premature deaths a year. But in what may seem a cruel twist — especially from an industry responsible for around 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions — this type of pollution also helps cool the planet by brightening clouds and reflecting the sun’s energy away from the Earth.
So, when in 2020 the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the United Nations body regulating shipping, slashed sulfur content permitted in ships’ fuel by 80%, it was a victory for human health. An estimated 30,000 premature deaths will now be avoided each year.
But it was “a silver cloud with a dark lining,” said Michael Diamond, assistant professor at Florida State University’s Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Science. The regulations ended a vast, accidental geoengineering project. Ship tracks reduced sharply, and with them, the cooling impact of this pollution.
As global temperatures soar, it has left scientists﻿ trying to unpick whether these shipping regulations may be inadvertently fueling an alarming acceleration of global warming — a controversial hypothesis that has divided some experts.
It’s a debate made more urgent by last year’s record-breaking heat. “Scientists are amazed at the outlier that 2023 was,” said Olaf Morgenstern, a scientist at the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research in New Zealand.
The heat was especially pronounced in some parts of the oceans, where water temperatures in areas including the North Atlantic shot wildly off the charts.
Scientists say the surge in global temperature was primarily driven by two factors: the impacts of El Niño, a natural climate phenomenon that tends to have a global heating impact, combined with the backdrop of long-term global warming caused by burning fossil fuels.
But some have speculated the heat spiked so abnormally high that other influences may also be at play. Theories include a lack of sunlight-reflecting dust from the Sahara, a change in wind patterns, and the January 2022 eruption of the Hunga Tonga underwater volcano, which injected enough planet-warming water vapor into the atmosphere to fill 58,000 Olympic-size swimming pools.
Of all of the theories, however, the impact of shipping regulations is swiftly becoming one of the most discussed. Scientists have long known that reducing this particle pollution﻿ would have a warming effect, but by how much “is where the controversy starts,” Morgenstern said.
In November, the prominent climate scientist James Hansen co-authored a paper which argued the curtailing of shipping pollution was the main driver of an alarming acceleration in global warming that goes beyond what climate models have predicted.
The IMO shipping regulations were “an unintentional scientific experiment,” Hansen told CNN. His research predicted global temperatures would breach 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming above pre-industrial levels in the 2020s and 2 degrees in the 2050s — a catastrophic level of warming that could trigger a slew of climate tipping points.
But other scientists have urged caution, not least because the relationship between pollution particles and clouds is extremely complex. Unraveling it is “one of the biggest challenges in climate science,” Diamond said.
Piers Forster, a professor of climate physics at Leeds University in the UK, said the reduction in shipping pollution is likely to have a very small warming influence.
Related article The 1.5-degree climate goal may be ‘deader than a doornail,’ and scientists are bitterly divided over it
According to Forster’s calculations, the regulations will increase global warming by around 0.01 degrees Celsius, which could grow to about 0.05 degrees by 2050 — equivalent to around two additional years of human-caused emissions.
However, he added, the uncertain effect of the pollution on clouds means there’s a possibility the warming impact could be much larger — an additional 0.1 or 0.2 degrees by 2050.
Diamond, whose own work estimates the regulations will bring levels of warming over the next few decades of between 0.05 and 0.1 degrees, said this heat won’t be “a showstopper” but is important. Every fraction of a degree matters when the world is hurtling towards levels of warming to which even humans will increasingly struggle to adapt.
Diamond, along with most of the other scientists CNN spoke to, doesn’t believe the decline in shipping pollution was a major factor in last year’s global heat, not least because there is usually a time lag before changes in the atmosphere are reflected in the Earth’s temperature.
“But I think it could have mattered quite a bit more regionally,” he said. Shipping is unevenly distributed, with much of it concentrated between Europe, North America and Asia, meaning air pollution impacts are also likely to be skewed.
In areas such as the North Atlantic, where temperatures soared several degrees above usual in 2023, Diamond said, “shipping is a decent explanation for part of why that was so warm.”
There are only a few years of data so far, and it will take time for scientists to unravel the exact impact of the fall in shipping pollution.
But it is clear that particle pollution from all sources, including burning fossil fuels, has had a cooling impact. Without it, the world would be about 0.4 degrees hotter, according to a 2021 report from Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. And pollution decreases in the future could have a big impact.
Annica Ekman, professor of meteorology at Stockholm University in Sweden, said her research has found that decreases in human-caused particle pollution between 2015 and 2050 could warm the planet as much as 0.5 degrees.
But this is not an argument against cutting air pollution, Diamond said, it’s an argument for tackling it alongside reducing carbon emissions.
The cooling impact of air pollution is far outweighed by the heating impact of burning fossil fuels. It’s when air pollution is tackled without also reducing carbon emissions, that “we can get into trouble,” Diamond said.
That is what’s happening in this shipping industry, where huge container vessels are still propelled across the oceans by hundreds of millions of tons of fossil fuels.
“We must not forget why the regulation exists,” Forster said. “It is there to save lives from air pollution.” While reducing this pollution will have a small warming impact, immediate action to reduce emissions will both slash the rate of global warming and improve air quality, he said. We are not “on some doomed trajectory,” he added."
WP5ADNTO6K_2KQ5G5P0XQ6AV9Z,Groundwater levels are rapidly declining around the world — with a few notable exceptions,"By Katie Hunt, CNN","3 minute read Updated 8:27 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/24/climate/groundwater-global-study-scn/,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.
Many parts of the world are experiencing a rapid depletion in the subterranean reserves of water that billions of people rely on for drinking, irrigation and other uses, according to new research that analyzed millions of groundwater level measurements from 170,000 wells in more than 40 countries.
It’s the first study to piece together what’s happening to groundwater levels at a global scale, according to the researchers involved, and will help scientists better understand what impact humans are having on this valuable underground resource, either through overuse or indirectly by changes in rainfall linked to climate change.
Groundwater, contained within cracks and pores in permeable bodies of rock known as aquifers, is a lifeline for people especially in parts of the world where rainfall and surface water are scarce, such as northwest India and the southwest United States.
Reductions in groundwater can make it harder for people to access freshwater to drink or to irrigate crops and can result in land subsidence.
“This study was driven by curiosity. We wanted to better understand the state of global groundwater by wrangling millions of groundwater level measurements,” said co-lead author Debra Perrone, an associate professor in University of California’s Santa Barbara’s Environmental Studies Program, in a news release on the study that published in the journal Nature on Wednesday.

The authors found that groundwater levels declined between 2000 and 2022 in 71% of the 1,693 aquifer systems included in the research, with groundwater levels declining more than 0.1 meter a year in 36%, or 617, of them.
The Ascoy-Soplamo Aquifer in Spain had the fastest rate of decline in the data they compiled — a median decline of 2.95 meters per year, said study coauthor Scott Jasechko, an associate professor at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at University of California Santa Barbara.
Several aquifer systems in Iran were among those with the fastest rate of groundwater decline, he added.
The team wasn’t able to gather data from much of Africa, South America and southeast Asia because of a lack of monitoring, but Jasechko said the study included the countries where most global groundwater pumping takes place.
The study also highlighted some success stories in Bangkok, Arizona and New Mexico, where groundwater has begun to recover after interventions to better regulate water use or redirect water to replenish depleted aquifers.
“I was impressed by the clever strategies that have been put into action to address groundwater depletion in several places, though these ‘good news’ stories are very rare,” Jasechko said via email.
To understand whether the declines seen in the 21st century were accelerating, the team also accessed data for groundwater levels for 1980 to 2000 for 542 of the aquifers in the study.
They found that declines in groundwater levels sped up in the first two decades of the 21st century for 30% of those aquifers, outpacing the declines recorded between 1980 and 2000.
“These cases of accelerating groundwater-level declines are more than twice as prevalent as one would expect from random fluctuations in the absence of any systematic trends in either time period,” the study noted.
Donald John MacAllister, a hydrologist at the British Geological Survey who wasn’t involved in the research, said it was a really “impressive” set of data, despite some gaps.
“I think it’s fair to say this global compilation of groundwater data hasn’t been done, certainly on this scale, at least to my knowledge before,” he said.
“Groundwater is an incredibly important resource but one of the challenges is… because we can’t see it, it’s out of mind for most people. Our challenge is to constantly bang the drum for policymakers — that we have this resource that we have to look after, and that we can use to build resilience and adapt to climate change.”"

But for a small marsupial in Australia, sex is a higher priority than getting some shut-eye — and it is willing to sacrifice hours of it daily to reach its happy ending.
Scientists based in Australia have found that mouse-sized male antechinus trade sleep to leave more time for reproductive activities during mating season, with one male who was monitored halving his sleep time during that period.
The study, published Thursday in the journal Current Biology, is the first to show direct evidence for this type of “extreme” sleep restriction in any land-dwelling mammal, according to the researchers.
“Animals need to reproduce to pass on their genes, but they also need to sleep to survive,” Erika Zaid, lead author and animal behavior researcher at La Trobe University in Melbourne, told CNN.
“Animals that are long-lived like humans and elephants don’t have this pressure to reproduce in a short period of time. They have the luxury of being able to sleep as long (as) they want (and) need each day,” she said.
Males antechinus, unlike their female counterparts, are semelparous, which means they can only breed once during their lifetime, making lengthy sleep a luxury that could cost them their opportunity to pass on their genes, Zaid explained. Non-breeding dusky antechinus spend an average of 15.3 hours of the day asleep, according to the researchers.
“Sleep restriction in breeding male antechinus is likely to be an adaptive behavioral response driven by strong sexual selection,” the paper said. This drives them to compete with other males to reproduce with as many females as possible, before dying shortly after their first — and last — mating season.
To study the semelparous marsupials, researchers examined two antechinus species: dusky antechinus (Antechinus swainsonii) and wild agile antechinus (Antechinus agilis) both captive and wild.

Researchers found that males from both species were not only more active during mating season, but also slept less during the same period.
Data showed that males were sleeping three hours less per night, every night, for three weeks — approximately the length of the mating period. Males, which only live for 11 months, reproduce once in their lifetime before dying while females can reproduce more than once, Zaid said.
Sleep is “an essential and seemingly universal behavior in the animal kingdom,” said John Lesku, associate professor of zoology at La Trobe University and a sleep scientist, who was involved in the study.
“Sleeping three hours less per night impacts waking performance in humans, (while) antechinus did this for three weeks. Therefore, antechinus may be resilient to sleep loss and have an unknown mechanism to thrive on less sleep during this time, or they may accept the physiological costs of staying awake to secure paternity before they die,” Lesku told CNN.
The paper suggests that sleep reductions were due to the reproductive pressures on the males during their only breeding season, with increased sexual activity positively related to increases in testosterone, the male sex hormone, during the same length of time.
Using accelerometers — instruments used to measure the acceleration of a moving body — the researchers tracked the movement of 15 dusky antechinus (10 male) before and during mating season.
Researchers took blood samples to measure any changes in hormones and took electrophysiological recordings from four males to measure how much they were sleeping.
Blood samples were also taken from 38 wild agile antechinus (20 male) to see if oxalic acid, a biomarker for sleep loss, similarly decreased during the mating period.
While the decrease in oxalic acid suggests the agile antechinus were sleep deprived during mating season, the results show that the difference between males and females was not significantly different, which Zaid points out may suggest that females in the wild are similarly sleep deprived due to male harassment during the mating period.
“Our study is the first to compare male and female activity levels before, during, and after the breeding season, and to reliably relate restfulness with sleep using accelerometry, electrophysiology, and metabolomics,” researchers said in the paper.
Volker Sommer, a professor of evolutionary anthropology at University College London, told CNN: “It rather seems that this is some pre-breeding stale-mate in not letting one’s guard down: males are forced to stay awake because their competitors also do.” Sommer was not involved in the study.
While the results don’t pinpoint a reason for the post-breeding male die-off, there are multiple possibilities, such as elevated corticosteroids — steroid hormones — and sleep deprivation.
Lesku said researchers would next like to examine how male antechinus deal with restricting their sleep for three weeks.

WPW8XO01NE_2FKGSWN79K7CM6G,"Megalodons were skinnier than we previously thought, new study suggests","By Jack Guy, CNN","3 minute read Published 7:00 PM EST, Sun January 21, 2024",20240122,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/22/world/megalodon-body-shape-study-scli-intl-scn/,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.
Megalodons, the huge prehistoric sharks depicted in movies such as “The Meg,” had more slender bodies than was previously thought, according to a new study.
Many mysteries remain about the biology of megalodons, but until now, great white sharks had been used to model their appearance. But new research from a team led by Kenshu Shimada, a paleobiologist at DePaul University in Chicago, and Phillip Sternes, a doctoral candidate at the University of California at Riverside, suggests megalodons would have had skinnier bodies than great whites.
The Otodus megalodon lived more than 23 million years ago. Fossils of the extinct giant are hard to come by. While there are plenty of fossilized shark teeth, their bodies mainly consist of cartilage rather than bones, and are rarely preserved.
This new research is based on the reappraisal of an incomplete set of fossil vertebrae found in Belgium.
While previous research estimated that this particular megalodon would have measured 9.2 meters (30.2 feet) in length, Shimada and his coauthors say the individual would have in fact measured at least 11.1 meters (36.4 feet).
Shimada told CNN that the fossil vertebrae would not have been strong enough to support a shark of this length if it had the same body shape as a great white.
“If the body form of the great white shark is directly applied to the vertebral column, the diameter of the vertebrae would then be unrealistically small for the shark to be able to support its body,” he said.
Shimada explained that a vertebral column of this diameter would not provide sufficient support for the muscles of a body shape like that of a great white, and would also increase the risk of spinal cord injuries.

“This is particularly important considering that shark skeletons are not as strong as bones because they are cartilaginous (made of cartilage),” he added.
He did note, however, that some shark species, including megalodon, exhibit some strengthening of this cartilage through calcification, or a build-up of calcium that can then harden.
“The new study considers the size proportion between the vertebrae and body in a more biologically realistic manner, which would indicate a leaner body at least compared to the modern great white shark,” he said.
The research suggests that “the modern great white shark may not necessarily serve as a good modern analog for assessing at least certain aspects” of megalodon biology, said Shimada.
“There are still many misconceptions or unanswered questions about the biology of megalodon, and we would like to continue to scientifically correct or elucidate them based on the fossil record,” he said.
As things stand, there is only a partial fossil record for the megalodon, and Shimada hopes a complete skeleton will be discovered someday.
The study was published Sunday in the journal Palaeontologia Electronica.

Previous research published in August 2022 estimated the megalodon would have been able to devour prey the size of orca whales – which can be up to 26 feet long and weigh more than 8,000 pounds – in just five bites.
The megalodon went extinct around 3.6 million years ago, according to the United Kingdom’s Natural History Museum, for reasons scientists are still trying to understand.
One theory is that their demise was linked to the fact that they were warm-blooded.
Previous research by Shimada and others concluded that being warm-blooded may have been one of the key drivers fueling megalodons’ massive size and overall prowess as predators, but it also made them sensitive to environmental changes.
“The fact that megalodon disappeared suggests the likely vulnerability of being warm-blooded because warm-bloodedness requires constant food intake to sustain high metabolism,” Shimada told CNN in July last year.
“Possibly, there was a shift in the marine ecosystem due to the climatic cooling,” causing the sea level to drop, altering the habitats of the populations of the types of food megalodon fed on such as marine mammals and leading to its extinction.

Hockney, 86, painted “California,” showing two naked figures in an outdoor swimming pool, in 1965 after his first trip to Los Angeles and it has been held in a private collection since 1968.
The painting, last seen in public in 1979, is a highlight of auction house Christie’s “20th/21st Century: London Evening Sale” on March 7. It is listed with “a price on request,” with an estimate in the region of £16 million ($20.37 million).
“This is one of the earliest examples (of Hockney’s pool paintings),” Tessa Lord, a senior specialist and director of the post-war contemporary department at Christie’s London, told Reuters at a press preview on Thursday.
In 2018, Hockney’s 1972 piece “Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)” sold for $90.3 million, setting a then record for the highest price ever paid at auction for a work by a living artist.
“There is a lot of crossover between the two works but also we’ve seen since that world record price in 2018 a real broadening of the market for David Hockney,” Lord said.
Hockney: An encounter with the world’s most popular artist
“We have sold works from the Paul Allen estate over the past few years, which in particular shone a light on his later practice, his landscapes and what we’re coming to feel is a real international recognition amongst collectors of Hockney’s contribution to 20th and 21st century art, and a real drive to seek out the best examples of his practice.”
“California” will go on a touring exhibition to Paris and New York next month before returning to London to go on public view before the sale."
WVZT9ZYVND_LPRGRPFGPS1FL81,"They fell in love on vacation but went their separate ways. Four years later, she sent him an email: ‘Remember me?’","By Francesca Street, CNN","16 minute read Updated 9:53 AM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/scotland-romance-lost-touch-reunited-chance-encounters/,"Gabriella Vagnoli never forgot that trip to Scotland.
She tried not to think about it, to “remove that chapter completely.” She’d known Dan Watling for only a few days. He lived in the US. She figured she’d never see him again.
But as her long-term relationship in Italy started to dwindle, Gabriella’s mind returned to how it felt walking around Loch Ness with Dan in the spring of 2002. She thought about his eyes, “very blue, beautiful, striking.” She remembered the way they’d sat together, on the mountainous Old Man of Storr, looking out over the Isle of Skye, sharing stories about their lives.
It was mid-2006 when Gabriella finally typed Dan’s name into Google. Social media was pretty new at the time. She wasn’t sure anything would come up. She’d convinced herself Dan would have long moved on. They weren’t 22 anymore.
“I was just like, ‘Oh I’m just going to see – because by now he’s probably married – Americans marry early. Who knows what he’s doing,” Gabriella recalls to CNN Travel.
To her surprise, Dan popped up right away. Photos of him on a three-month trip around Europe a couple of years earlier.
“He looked different, more rugged, more experienced,” says Gabriella.
He still had the same kind eyes. To Gabriella, he looked “more handsome.”
Gabriella decided to send Dan a message.
“Remember me?” she wrote.
Gabriella and Dan first connected on the banks of Loch Ness, the large body of water in the northerly Scottish Highlands, known as the home of the mythical Loch Ness monster.
At the time, Gabriella was midway through her college degree in Italy, finishing up a year spent studying in the UK.
“Me and a bunch of friends from Italy, Germany and Portugal decided to do this trip to Scotland together,” recalls Gabriella.
The group headed to Edinburgh to join a tour bus traveling further north. It was a three-day trip, with several stops to take in the Highland highlights.
Dan was on the same tour. Dan says his brother Bill “kind of forced” him to join the trip to Scotland. Dan was very committed to his job as a software developer in Chicago. He’d never traveled much.
“He bought my ticket and helped me get the passport and everything else. So essentially, I had no choice but to go,” Dan tells CNN Travel today.
Bill did all the planning too. He picked the backpackers tour. He made sure they got on the bus.
The whole thing was a bit outside of 22-year-old Dan’s comfort zone, but Dan was excited to be there.
There were around 15 people on the tour, including Gabriella and her gang of college friends. When the group boarded the bus, the tour guide suggested the travelers take it in turns to introduce themselves.
Gabriella was one of the first up. She told the group she was from Pisa, in Italy. She talked about her love of music.
“I remember being ‘struck’ when Gabi introduced herself,” Dan recalls. “I thought she was very pretty and interesting.”
When Dan stood up front and nervously introduced himself, Gabriella was struck by him too.
“I noticed Dan because of his eyes,” she recalls. He seemed shy, a bit embarrassed to be talking in front of a group of strangers. Gabriella found she couldn’t stop looking at him.
The first stop on the tour was Loch Ness. The tour guide and most of the group went down to the shore of the Loch, but Gabriella and Dan didn’t join them right away.
“Instead, we hung back and started talking,” says Dan.
Their first conversation was a little awkward – in his nervousness, Dan asked Gabriella what it was like living in Rome. She assumed he hadn’t been listening when she’d introduced herself as sharing a home with the famous Leaning Tower.
After that, things warmed up. Gabriella and Dan carried on chatting as they admired the sweeping expanse of Loch Ness, the imposing ruins of Urquhart Castle in the distance.

Back on the bus, Gabriella and her friends sat with Dan and his brother Bill. The group started playing the card game Uno to pass the time. As the bus headed northwest, the roads got narrower, the scenery glimpsed from the bus window more staggering. Eventually, the bus crossed the bridge to Skye, the famous Scottish island known for its spectacular scenery – think dramatic mountains, picturesque glens and ancient castles.
Gabriella couldn’t believe the vastness of the landscape. It felt worlds away from the city living she was used to.
“It really struck me and it was beautiful,” she says.
But while Dan remembers being immediately enamored with “the rocks, and the hills, the waterfalls, and the clouds and everything,” his main memory of Skye is falling for Gabriella.
“I just remember being with her most of all,” he says.
Skye was a “key moment,” agrees Gabriella.
Their tour guide took them to the Old Man of Storr, a rock formation offering incredible views of Skye’s misty hills and crags, the sea stretching out ahead. The group set out to hike to the pinnacle.
Dan’s brother and Gabriella’s friends strode ahead. But Gabriella and Dan took it slow, more focused on each other than the views.
“We were just walking a lot and asking a lot of questions to each other,” says Gabriella.
In the end, Gabriella and Dan stopped before they reached the top of the ridge, sitting on one of the lower crags together, completely caught up in one another.
“Going up to the Old Man of Storr, that, for me, that’s when I really felt a connection,” says Dan.
He barely knew Gabriella, but felt like he could be himself with her. He’d never really experienced anything like it.
Gabriella really liked Dan.
“We talked a lot,” says Gabriella. “He was very sweet.”
But for Gabriella, the situation was more complicated. She was dating someone back in Italy. And while Dan was a romantic, Gabriella was more pragmatic. She didn’t think their connection would outlast their time in Scotland.
“We had this trip that was very romantic. There was this big connection, but it was a short trip,” says Gabriella. “It wasn’t going to lead anywhere.”

When the tour came to an end and the group returned to Edinburgh, Gabriella and Dan said goodbye, not sure exactly where they stood. They swapped email addresses.
“I remember emailing her almost as soon as I arrived back home,” Dan says.
Dan and Gabriella “kept in touch for a little bit,” says Gabriella.
But before long, she cut things off.
“I shortly after decided it was better not to keep in touch,” she says. “I wanted to focus on my life in Italy.
“I had no desire to move to America. I had a different life and I was like, ‘You know this is not going anywhere. It’s better that we don’t keep this thing going.’”
To Gabriella, her life in Italy felt real, and the time with Dan in Scotland felt like a dream. She tried to draw a line and move on. To make it final, she blocked Dan’s email address.
When Dan received Gabriella’s goodbye email, he was “a little distraught.”
He tried to move on too, but it wasn’t easy.
“I was always thinking about her,” he says.
The trip to Scotland had also opened up Dan’s world and given him a bit of wanderlust. The following year, in 2003, he returned to Europe, backpacking through various European cities for three months.
Dan incorporated Gabriella’s hometown of Pisa into the itinerary – partly to see the Leaning Tower, but mostly because he hoped, against the odds, that he might bump into the girl he’d met the summer before in Scotland.
When his train pulled into Pisa station, Dan couldn’t help but glance around, hopefully, for Gabriella.
“She had told me that she had worked at the Pisa train station as a barista,” he says. “But of course, she wasn’t there.”
Back in the US, Dan dated a couple of other people, but it never got serious.
“There wasn’t that connection. It definitely was not the same. And not what I felt with her.”
He created a website, adding the photos from his three-month European trip.
And then, in 2006, Gabriella’s surprise email landed in his inbox.
When Dan read Gabriella’s email, he was in disbelief.
“She was always in the back of my mind,” he says. “I always hoped that we could reconnect somehow. And so of course, when I got the email, I was overjoyed.”
He replied right away. Gabriella wrote back. The two started emailing regularly, “chatting a lot,” as Gabriella puts it.
“It’s just so crazy that he hadn’t forgotten about me, because as I said, it was a short trip. But he’d been thinking about me,” she says.
They tried video calling – a relatively new concept in 2006. It was hard to get much detail from the grainy, webcam images. But hearing each other’s voices again was special.
“We literally talked about everything,” says Dan.
By coincidence, when Gabriella re-entered Dan’s life, he was in the middle of planning a trip to Oktoberfest in Munich, Germany.
“I had no plans to go to Italy when I started planning it. But then when I got the email from her, I decided, ‘Well, I’m going to make my way down to Italy, for sure,’” says Dan.
Dan and Gabriella agreed to meet in the Tuscan hilltop town of Siena, not far from her home city of Pisa, in September 2006.
On the bus to Siena, Gabriella told herself, “We’re just going to meet and I’ll show him around.” While Gabriella had enjoyed speaking with Dan online, she was “still very much in denial” about what might happen next.
The moment Gabriella and Dan saw one another again was charged.
“When I saw her get off the bus, I cried,” says Dan. “I was just incredibly happy to see her again.”
“I didn’t expect it to be so emotional when I actually saw him and I didn’t expect to be so struck by him,” says Gabriella. “I was struck by his eyes again. It was just romantic. I didn’t think it would be so striking, but it was. There was just something between us.”
“A connection,” says Dan.
“Something very, very unique,” agrees Gabriella. “From the moment we saw each other. It’s hard to explain.”
Gabriella and Dan spent the day wandering around Siena together. They couldn’t stop looking at each other and smiling, almost giddy with excitement.
“I remember walking around Piazza del Campo and how happy I was to be there with her,” says Dan.
When they said goodbye, things were still “open-ended,” says Dan. But unlike when they parted ways in Scotland, there seemed to be a promise of a future.
“I believe Siena was the moment that the wheels started turning for the both of us, as far as beginning to actually think about what it would mean to pursue a real relationship with one another,” Dan says.
For Gabriella, the years apart, the unexpected reunion, and the fact the connection was still there gave her the confidence to embrace her feelings for Dan.
“I do think we both needed those few more years of growth to truly find each other,” she says.

A couple of months later, Gabriella planned a trip to the US to visit Dan in Chicago. She intended to stay for almost a month.
“Three, four weeks, something like that – which was a pretty crazy thing to do for a guy that I didn’t know that well,” says Gabriella.
On Gabriella’s first evening, Dan took her out for dinner with his brother Bill and his wife, and his mother.
“It was a bit overwhelming to meet his mom the first night I got there,” says Gabriella.
But despite being tired from the flight, Gabriella felt immediately welcomed by Dan’s family. It was great to see Bill again. It was exciting to be in the US. And Dan held her hand all evening.
The only hiccup during the four-week trip was Gabriella discovering Dan’s cooking ability – or lack thereof.
“I always say that I saved him because he was so deprived, he ate so bad,” says Gabriella, laughing. “He told me, ‘I’m going to take you to have the best breakfast ever.’ And he took me to McDonald’s.”
As an Italian foodie, Gabriella was slightly horrified. But part of her also found it endearing. And over the course of her trip, she taught Dan to cook pasta.
The following year, in 2007, Gabriella returned to the US, taking some time off work to stay with Dan for three months. While she was there, Gabriella studied for a qualification to teach Italian as a foreign language.
By then, Gabriella and Dan were talking about their future and what being together long-term might look like. They didn’t want to date across continents for too long. They talked about Dan moving to Italy, or Gabriella moving to the US.
“It was pretty fast, but at the same time, we knew that it was serious,” says Gabriella.
As Dan was more settled in his job, and owned a house, Gabiella moving to the US felt like the obvious choice.
“He had the more stable life,” says Gabriella.
So she made plans to move, getting a job as an Italian teacher at a language school in the Chicago area. And in November 2007, Dan proposed. The couple were on vacation in the historic town of Galena, Illinois.
“We had a nice, romantic evening at the house that we’re staying at,” recalls Dan. “I felt that was the time and so I proposed to her in Italian. And she said yes.”
Dan and Gabriella had a small wedding ceremony in the US in 2008 and then a big wedding party in 2009 in Italy, at “a beautiful Renaissance villa in the countryside with wonderful frescoes,” called Villa di Corliano, in the Tuscan town of San Giuliano.
Gabriella’s college friends who’d been there when she first met Dan in Scotland came along to celebrate.
“It was a fun reunion,” says Gabriella.
Gabriella and Dan’s wedding celebration was characterized by happy tears.
“When I walked in, we were both crying,” says Gabriella. “Dan cried when he saw me. I was crying the moment I walked in anyway. So it was just really sweet.”
Dan didn’t know much Italian – despite his best efforts to learn. He’d started calling Gabriella “mi amore” – which, as Gabriella pointed out to him, is “grammatically wrong.” But she found it adorable.
“I had that engraved inside my wedding ring,” she says. “And then I call him ‘sweetie.’ So he has ‘sweetie’ inside his ring.”
While Dan struggled with Italian, he wanted Gabriella to hear wedding vows in her first language.
So he wrote down what he wanted to say, translated the phrases into Italian and memorized them.
“It was just very, very sweet,” says Gabriella.
At the wedding, Gabriella and Dan also shared with their guests some additional happy news – Gabriella was pregnant.
“It was cute for us to announce it at the wedding,” says Gabriella.

Newly married, Gabriella and Dan started a new chapter together in the US. They were excited to be together, and thrilled about the upcoming birth of their child.
But for Gabriella, moving abroad was tough.
“I know a lot of people dream of moving to the States, but it wasn’t one of my dreams,” she says. “It was pretty tough because Chicago is a super-duper cold place.”
Gabriella was aware, before she moved, that relocating across the world was a big step. She wanted to be with Dan, but she knew she’d miss Italy and her family and friends.
Before making the decision, Gabriella spoke with her mother, who she figured would be able to empathize with her mixed emotions.
Gabriella’s mother was from Brazil, and her father is from Italy. In the mid-1970s, Gabriella’s mother moved across the globe from Brazil to Italy to be with him. The couple met a few years earlier, when Gabriella’s dad was visiting Rio de Janeiro.
“She showed him around Rio and he said he would come back in two years and marry her,” says Gabriella. “Two years later they were in fact married. I of course don’t know all the details, as a kid I thought it was the most romantic story ever.”
Her parents’ love story meant Gabriella grew up thinking “the idea of someone moving away to be with someone” wasn’t “completely implausible.” But it also meant Gabriella knew some of the challenges of leaving one’s own country behind.
Gabriella’s mother cautioned Gabriella to consider the decision carefully.
“She did say that I had to think about it, because it was a big choice to move.”
But Gabriella’s mother also told her daughter to follow her heart. Her dad agreed.
“They both saw that Dan was special and very committed – the love was showing,” says Gabriella. “They liked him right away.”
As Gabriella and Dan established their family in the US – welcoming their first child in 2009 and their second a few years later – they made regular trips back to Italy to visit whenever they could. Gabriella taught her children Italian, and educated them on their Brazilian heritage.
And while adjusting to cold Chicago was tough, Gabriella credits moving to the US with discovering an unexpected new career.
She’d always loved drawing and doodling, but until she lived in the US, she never considered turning that hobby into a job. Living in Italy, she associated art with “Michelangelo.”
“For good or bad, there’s the weight of Italian history and all the art that came before,” says Gabriella.
Calling herself an artist in Italy felt wrong. But in the US, she found a “different mentality.” To Gabriella, American art and design felt “a lot more innovative.”
So when her kids were little, Gabriella went back to school to study children’s book illustration. Now she draws for a living.

Today, Gabriella and Dan live in Seattle with their two teenage kids. They moved to Seattle a couple of years ago, and realized the landscape reminded them a bit of Scotland, the place where they’d first met and fell in love.
“We were both so drawn to it, because there’s a similarity – not only the weather, it’s kind of rainy, gray – but also the ocean, the rocks, the wilderness,” says Gabriella.
While Gabriella and Dan haven’t returned to Scotland together, they would love to. They want to go to Skye and make it to the top of the Old Man of Storr this time round.
In the meantime, they’ve been focusing on exploring new places together.
“We have that in common that we like to travel a lot, explore new things, new places,” says Gabriella.
While a love of adventure unites them, Gabriella and Dan insist they’re quite different in many other ways. He’s a self-described computer programming “nerd.” She’s passionate about art and music. He’s a romantic. She’s more pragmatic.
But there’s “something deeper that we have in common,” as Gabriella puts it.
“Maybe just our perspective on what is important in life,” says Gabriella. “We both think that our family is the first thing – our kids are the first thing – and not work.”
They support each other through the tough times too, such as when Gabriella’s mother passed away in 2022.
Today, after 15 years of marriage, Gabriella likes to say her relationship with Dan is a “vacation fling gone wrong.”
“Because a vacation fling, it’s supposed to end on vacation,” she says, laughing. “How crazy that is that he’s the guy that I met in Scotland on that trip and we’re married and have kids and we’re happy.”
Dan says if you told 22-year-old him, sitting on the Old Man of Storr next to Gabriella, that he’d end up married to this Italian stranger, he’d have absolutely believed you. He never got over that first meeting.
“I immediately felt that connection,” he says, adding that reuniting with Gabriella and building a life with her feels like “winning the lottery.”
“I feel incredibly lucky to have met Gabi back in 2002 and incredibly lucky that we reconnected again years later,” says Dan. “I would not be who I am today without having had her by my side.”
“I also feel like we were incredibly lucky,” says Gabriella. “I look at my kids and think about all the incredible coincidences that had to happen just for them to be here now and it blows my mind.
“I can’t believe how lucky we have been, but also I think that when you know you know. I’m glad I followed my heart.”"

The USS Gravely, which was nearby at the time, shot down two of the missiles and one landed in the water, the officials said. There were no injuries or damage to the ship, CENTCOM said in a statement.
The missile attack is the Houthis’ first successful launch since January 18, and comes just days after the US and the UK launched strikes against eight Houthi targets in Yemen. The US has also been trying to destroy Houthi missiles on the ground in Yemen as they see the Iran-backed militant group preparing to launch them and has successfully targeted several in recent weeks.
The M/V Maersk Detroit was traveling along with the Maersk Chesapeake at the time of the missile attacks on Wednesday, according to a statement from Maersk. The ships turned back from their planned voyage after seeing “explosions” on their way toward the Red Sea on Wednesday, according to the company.
The vessels are enrolled in the US Maritime Security Program and VISA (Voluntary Intermodal Sealift) and were set to transit the Bab el-Mandeb strait as part of a scheduled US Navy accompaniment.
“While en route, both ships reported seeing explosions close by and the US Navy accompaniment also intercepted multiple projectiles,” Maersk said in a statement shared with CNN. “The crew, ship, and cargo are safe and unharmed.”
Following the explosions, the US Navy turned both ships around and is escorting them back to the Gulf of Aden, according to Maersk.

X3YDS9U4GJ_HTPN0VQDFV0FC0X,"White House clinic handed out medications with little oversight during past administrations, new investigation shows","By Brenda Goodman, CNN","6 minute read Updated 4:58 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/24/health/white-house-medical-unit-report/,"During previous presidential administrations, the White House Medical Unit operated a pharmacy where staff members freely distributed prescription and non-prescription drugs – including controlled substances – without adequate record-keeping and sometimes to people who weren’t legally eligible to get them, according to a report released this month.
The report – from the independent Office of the Inspector General of the US Department of Defense, which oversees the Military Health System and thus the White House Medical Unit – says the clinic also misused taxpayer funds by dispensing brand-name drugs instead of less expensive generics and providing free medical care to staff who weren’t allowed to get it.
The Office of the Inspector General said in a news release that the problems it uncovered in the White House clinic were “severe and systemic.”
The report is based on reviews of records from the White House Medical Unit, including prescriptions, from between 2017 and 2019. In addition, investigators interviewed more than 120 officials, including hospital administrators, military medical providers and pharmacists. The office also reviewed the transcripts of 70 previous interviews with former members of the White House Military Office who served there between 2009 and 2018.

The interviews indicated that medication was often dispensed without any written records. Before “we would get ready for a big overseas trip,” staffers were directed to make “prepacks” that consisted of plastic sandwich bags containing the sleeping drug Ambien as well as the stimulant Provigil, which is meant to help people stay awake. Both are categorized as controlled substances, meaning they require special handling and record-keeping by pharmacies because they carry a risk for dependence and abuse.
These prepacks would often be handed out to senior staff or their assistants without any record of who was ultimately getting them, the testimony said.
The directive to give medication, “including all controlled substances,” to patients’ representatives “without the need to present the patient’s ID card” was also found by investigators on a handwritten note dated March 21, 2014.
In one case, according to the excerpted testimony, a doctor in the medical unit asked a staffer if they could “hook up” someone with some Provigil “as a parting gift for leaving the White House.”
The report, published January 8, found that the “White House Medical Unit’s controlled substance records did not accurately reflect the unit’s procurement, inventory, or disposal of controlled substances.”
The report says the practices it documents did not comply with guidance from the government or the Department of Defense. Rather, it says, the problems occurred because officials in the medical unit “did not consider their operations to be a pharmacy,” despite the fact that the medications were kept and dispensed behind a door marked “pharmacy” and that medications were handed out in pill bottles that bore the logo of the White House Medical Unit.
However, there was no pharmacist on staff at the medical unit, although officials said controlled substance audits are performed quarterly, according to the report. Staff members testified that they submitted a request to get a pharmacy technician assigned to the White House, but it still had not been filled during the period of the investigation.
The unit’s lax prescribing practices were allowed to go unchecked because the office lacked oversight, according to the report. None of the senior Military Health System leaders interviewed for the report could identify which division was responsible for the medical office.
The investigation was launched after the Defense Department received complaints that a senior military medical officer assigned to the unit had “engaged in improper medical practice,” the report says.
In May 2018, the Office of the Inspector General began a separate inquiry into complaints about Dr. Ronny Jackson, who had previously served as physician to the president and head of the White House Medical Unit.

Several of the complaints alleged improper medical and pharmaceutical practices as well as problems with Jackson’s behavior. They also called into question the eligibility of some patients to be seen at the executive medical facilities in the National Capital Region.
Jackson, who is not named in the new report, was director of the White House Medical Unit from 2010 through 2014 and served as physician to the president for both Barack Obama and Donald Trump.
He stepped back from his role as physician to the president in March 2018, after Trump nominated him to helm the Department of Veterans Affairs. But he withdrew from consideration for that role after the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs interviewed 23 current and former colleges of Jackson’s who alleged that he led a hostile work environment and allowed overprescribing of medications.
He was named chief medical adviser to the president in February 2019.
Asked whether he participated in the activities described in the report or was aware of them, a spokesperson for Jackson – who is now serving in Congress as a representative from Texas – noted in a statement that “Dr. Jackson was not the Director of the White House Medical Unit during the timeframe mentioned in the report (2017-2019). He was Physician to the President and later Chief Medical Advisor. The Chief Medical Advisor is a policy role, not clinical. This healthcare policy role had no association or involvement with the White House Medical Unit’s clinical delivery of care.”
According to a review of the clinic’s medical records detailed in the report, staffers dispensed brand-name medications instead of less-expensive generics in violation of Defense Department policy. Over the three years from 2017 through 2019, the brand-name drugs Ambien and Provigil cost taxpayers $144,520, but generic versions of those drugs would have cost $2,064, the report found.
The White House Medical Unit cost taxpayers in another way too, the report says: by routinely treating people who weren’t legally eligible for care through the Department of Defense. This was done at the direction of senior leaders of the medical unit, the report says.
Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.
According to the Code of Federal Regulations, people who can access care through the Military Health System include the president, the vice president, their spouses and their minor children; members of the Cabinet; officials of the Department of Defense who were appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate; assistants to the president; the director of the White House Military Office; and former presidents and their spouses, widows and minor children. Anyone needing emergency care can get it through Military Health Services, but they have to pay for their care.
According to the report, the White House Medical Unit has about 60 patients enrolled in its clinic but provided “health care by proxy” to 6,000 White House and other government and employees and contractors, many of whom were ineligible to receive it. These employees were given urgent care including the provision of cold medications, antibiotics or sleep aids, the report says, but this care was not tracked and couldn’t be billed. Records show that the Department of Defense waived nearly $500,000 in care for senior US officials over three years, according to the report.
The report makes recommendations that include:
The report says that the Department of Defense’s assistant secretary for health affairs agreed with all the recommendations and that they would be implemented, although it noted those tasks haven’t yet been completed.
The White House did not immediately offer comment to CNN on the report’s findings or any changes made in the medical unit made since the investigation was completed."
X6U3IUGGNN_51JP9WZXIZURP3D,UK pulls out of post-Brexit trade talks with Canada,"By Anna Cooban, CNN","3 minute read Published 10:15 AM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/26/business/uk-pauses-canada-trade-negotiations/,"Britain is finding out just how hard it can be to negotiate free trade deals, even with close allies and friends.
Nearly eight years after Brexit campaigners persuaded a slim majority to vote to leave the European Union, on a platform that included promises of a brighter future as a global trading nation, the UK government has walked away from talks to replace its legacy EU trade deal with Canada over disputes involving beef, cars and cheese.
The talks between the United Kingdom and Canada — which share a head of state (King Charles) and are both members of NATO and the Group of Seven forum of leading advanced economies — began in March 2022, two years after Britain officially left the EU. Goods and services have continued flowing between the two countries under the terms of the EU-Canada free trade deal.
But Britain had sought to negotiate a new trade deal with Canada that would improve upon the terms of the existing agreement. Parts of the current deal are also due to expire, or have already done so, with no new rules to replace them.
UK carmakers, which currently pay low or no import taxes when exporting to Canada, could face much higher taxes from April.
Meanwhile, rules governing the export of British cheese to Canada expired in December. Now, UK producers selling to Canada face paying tariffs of up to 245% of the value of their cheese.
Related article The UK economy still can’t cope with the consequences of Brexit
A key sticking point in the negotiations has been Britain’s refusal to relax a ban on hormone-treated beef, which at the moment effectively bars Canadian farmers from selling to British consumers.
“Trade negotiations are complex, but sometimes it is right to pause if progress is not being made. We remain open to restarting talks with Canada in the future,” a UK government spokesperson said in a statement.
A spokesperson for Canadian trade minister Mary Ng said Friday: “I am confident that we can negotiate an agreement that is win win for Canada and for the UK.”
“But let me be clear: we will not negotiate an agreement that is not good for Canadians, and not good for our Canadian businesses, farmers and workers,” the spokesperson said in a statement.
According to the UK government, total trade in goods and services with Canada was worth nearly £26 billion ($33 billion) in the year to the end of June and Canada is the UK’s 13th-biggest export market.
The stalled talks represent a “blow” to the UK’s ambitions to strike better trade deals now that it is outside of the EU, according to David Henig, a director of UK trade policy at the Brussels-based European Centre for International Political Economy.
“We won’t get an improved deal, we’ll actually have worse trading conditions than we did as EU members,” he told CNN.
An unnamed Canadian government official, speaking to Reuters, suggested the UK had only itself to blame for what is the first failed attempt to replace EU trading arrangements with a third country after Brexit.
“Britain did not act as fast as it should have in negotiations, and expects Canada to just give (it) these things,” the official told Reuters.
But Minette Batters, president of the National Farmers’ Union, which represents farmers in England and Wales, took a different view. “The prime minister put it in writing last year that he would not be importing hormone-treated beef or chlorine-washed chicken,” she told the BBC Friday.
“Canada has played hardball for a long time. It was always going to come to a crunch point as to who was going to capitulate.”"

X8LUMSLE7Z_CJCVSI8VYA2YZ3W,"With menthol cigarette ban still uncertain, American Lung Association calls for White House to act ‘swiftly’ to save lives","By Jacqueline Howard, CNN","10 minute read Published 12:01 AM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/24/health/american-lung-association-report-card-menthol/,"The American Lung Association is putting more pressure on the White House to finalize rules to end the sale of menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars in the United States.
A scathing edition of the association’s annual State of Tobacco Control report, published Wednesday, calls o﻿n the Biden administration to finalize the proposed rules and says that failing to do so will result in more death and disease caused by smoking, especially among historically marginalized Black communities.
Related article Dozens of health organizations pledge ‘full support’ for federal ban on menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars
“Menthol cigarettes make it both easier to start and harder to quit by reducing the harshness of the smoke and cooling the throat,” the report notes. Researchers estimate that a regulation banning menthol cigarettes would save about 654,000 lives over the next 40 years, especially those of Black smokers, who are disproportionately more likely to smoke menthols.
In October, the US Food and Drug Administration sent rules for banning the manufacturing and sale of menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars to the White House’s Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review. Within the OMB is the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, which is responsible for reviewing all regulatory action – and this review process is a key step before a final rule may be published in the Federal Register.
But no action on this regulation has been made since it was submitted to the OMB. Under a “timetable” for each rule – on menthol in cigarettes and flavors in cigars – a final rule action has been given the date of March.
“In an extremely disappointing end to 2023, the White House bowed to tobacco industry pressure and failed to move forward in 2023 with finalizing rules to eliminate menthol as a characterizing flavor in cigarettes and prohibit all characterizing flavors in cigars,” the new report says. “This lack of action prioritizes politics and tobacco industry profits over public health and if the White House fails to finalize the rules.”

Proponents of the regulation were hoping that the rule would be finalized by January 20. That would have given it exactly a year to be implemented ahead of Inauguration Day, when there could be changes coming to the White House.
“That would have given the FDA the year’s time it claimed was necessary to implement the regulation,” said Daniel Karon, an attorney based in Cleveland who has been following the menthol cigarette rule and who teaches consumer law at the University of Michigan Law School and The Ohio State University Moritz College of Law.
“Even if the Biden administration freed up the regulation to go forward, the question is, would that be sufficient time for the FDA to enact it? Or would it just die on the vine because Trump could come in and stop the rulemaking process in its tracks?” he said of the potential Republican nominee. “If the White House does not at least make an internal decision this week and Biden does not win a second term, a new president could kill the regulation before it ever gets started.”
Another hurdle if the rules are implemented: Tobacco companies will probably sue in federal court, Karon said.
“Big Tobacco will petition for two things: declaratory relief, that is, a declaration or order that what the FDA issued is illegal, and equitable relief, that is, an injunction requiring withdrawal of the regulation,” he said. “Declaratory and injunctive relief are likely going to be on Big Tobacco’s mind when it inevitably files its federal lawsuit against the federal government.”
Related article Critics charge political concerns have led Biden administration to delay long-awaited ban on menthol cigarettes
Menthol cigarettes have emerged as a pivotal issue for President Joe Biden, who is facing an election year with worries over diminished enthusiasm from Black voters.
Some civil rights leaders with ties to the tobacco industry have raised concerns with the White House that a ban would criminalize menthol cigarettes and lead to an increase in deadly police interactions. Meanwhile, the NAACP and the Congressional Black Caucus have endorsed the ban, along with dozens of public health experts, saying it would save hundreds of thousands of Black lives.
The FDA proposal would ban the manufacturing and sale of menthols but would not police smokers themselves. The rule explicitly states, “This regulation does not include a prohibition on individual consumer possession or use, and FDA cannot and will not enforce against individual consumers for possession or use of menthol cigarettes. FDA’s enforcement will only address manufacturers, distributors, wholesalers, importers, and retailers.”
The divide among Black leaders has made the proposed ban a ripe political issue for the administration. It has delayed a decision on the issue﻿ three times.

Tobacco remains the leading cause of preventable death and disease in the US, according to the new State of Tobacco Control report. About 16 million people in the US live with a tobacco-related disease.
“Tobacco use is responsible for 480,000 deaths each year, including 45,000 Black individuals. Right now, President Biden can take action and save lives if he finalizes the rules to end the sale of menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars,” Harold Wimmer, president and CEO of the American Lung Association, said in a news release Wednesday.
“Once these rules are final, fewer people will start smoking, millions will begin their journey to quit and lives will be saved,” he said. “We know that the tobacco industry will do anything to protect their profits at the expense of public health, so the White House must focus on implementing lifesaving policies and push back against the industry’s delay tactics.”
The State of Tobacco Control report acts as a “report card” that evaluates state and federal policies. In the new edition, the federal government gets an A grade for its mass media campaigns that encourage people to not smoke or vape. But it received a C grade for its federal regulation of tobacco products, a D grade for how federal health care plans may be required to cover tobacco cessation and an F grade for its tobacco tax policies.
Taxes are considered one of the most effective ways to reduce smoking, particularly among children, studies suggest. But Congress hasn’t raised federal tobacco taxes in 15 years, since 2009. The federal cigarette tax remains $1.01 per pack, and taxes can vary among other tobacco products.

In the new report, the American Lung Association lists five “key actions” for the Biden administration and Congress to take this year to help eliminate death and disease caused by tobacco use. These include for the FDA to finalize its premarket review of tobacco product applications, for Congress to at least maintain current funding for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Office on Smoking and Health and to pass the Helping Tobacco Users Quit Act, which would expand comprehensive Medicaid coverage for tobacco cessation. Another key action is for the FDA and Departments of Justice and Homeland Security to remove all illegal tobacco products from the marketplace.
The White House “swiftly” finalizing the two rules that will remove menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars from the market was No. 1 among those key actions.
“This report highlighted how the tobacco industry continues to exert its political and economic power to undermine, delay, or prevent the enactment of effective tobacco control policies in the US,” Daniel Giovenco, assistant professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia Mailman School of Public Health, who was not involved in the new report, wrote in an email.
“While tremendous progress has been made in reducing tobacco use over the last several decades, social inequalities in tobacco use persist, contributing to grave tobacco-related health disparities,” he said. “US lawmakers and public health agencies must double down on efforts to enact legislation and increase funding for tobacco control initiatives in order to mitigate a leading cause of preventable disease, disability, and death in the US.”
The State of Tobacco Control report also highlights how a decline in adult cigarette smoking rates has stalled, with about 11.6% of adults reporting smoking in 2022, compared with 11.5% in 2021, according to data from the CDC’s 2022 National Health Interview Survey. Overall tobacco use among adults increased in 2022, driven by a rise in e-cigarette use from 4.5% to 6%.
“The increases in e-cigarette use over the past two years have been driven by the 18- to 24-year-old age group and 65.5% of e-cigarette users in this age group did not smoke cigarettes previously in 2022,” the report says. “The increase in adult tobacco use in 2022 is a worrying sign, and an indication that state and federal lawmakers must redouble their efforts to prevent and reduce tobacco use in 2024.”

In the report’s evaluation of state-by-state tobacco control policies, Alabama and Georgia were rated the worst in the nation, scoring grades of F in all five categories: tobacco prevention and control funding, tobacco tax policies, state smoking restrictions for smoke-free air, access to cessation services and restrictions on flavored tobacco products.
The low grades given to many states stood out to attorney Karon.
“I was disappointed yet not surprised to see such meager activity at the state level. Under the 10th Amendment to the US Constitution, any power that is not specifically given to the federal government or withheld from the states is reserved for the states. To me, state involvement should be a bipartisan issue,” he said.
“Liberal states should want to participate in saving lives, while conservative states should want to act independently of the federal government,” he said. “That is something I would have liked to see more activity on.”
The report gave the best grades to California, which earned A grades for smoke-free air and access to cessation services; the District of Columbia, which earned A grades for tobacco tax policies, smoke-free air and restrictions on flavored tobacco products; and Massachusetts, which earned As for smoke-free air and flavored tobacco product restrictions.
California and Massachusetts are the only states with statewide bans on the sale of menthol cigarettes, according to the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. In 2020, Massachusetts became the first to ban flavored tobacco products. California’s ban went into effect at the end of 2022.
The American Lung Association has been joined by other public health groups – including the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids and the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, or ASTHO – in urging the White House to ban menthol cigarettes.

Last week, Michael Fraser, ASTHO’s chief executive officer, sent a letter to President Biden asking for the administration’s support in adopting and implementing the federal rule to prohibit the sale of menthol-flavored combustible cigarettes as soon as possible.
“The more time that passes, the more likely that more youth are going to be sort of addicted to cigarettes and creating a new generation of smokers. So we want to make sure that the momentum is really sharp right now,” said Jeffrey Ekoma, ASTHO’s senior director of government affairs.
“If [the White House is] talking about this and they’re actively talking to stakeholders, we want to make sure that they’re hearing not just the voice of the tobacco industry but also the voices of tobacco control advocates like ASTHO and others to make sure that they’re not just hearing one side of the issue,” Ekoma said.
RJ Reynolds, the manufacturer of Newport cigarettes, the most popular brand of menthol cigarettes in the US, said in a statement in December that it thinks a ban would ultimately do more harm to Black smokers than good.
“Reynolds has been clear on where it stands on banning menthol – we strongly believe there are more effective ways to deliver tobacco harm reduction than banning products. A ban on menthol cigarettes would harm, not benefit, public health,” the statement says.
ASTHO’s letter argues that although the tobacco industry and others who are against the ban claim that the rule would increase the potential for criminal charges in Black communities and create an underground market, the FDA has no authority to criminally charge consumers of banned products.

“It’s important to note that the regulations would not penalize the use or possession of these products among consumers, only companies that make or sell non-compliant products,” Columbia’s Giovenco said in his email.
“The tobacco industry and some organizations that have received tobacco industry funding have propagated a false narrative that the ban would contribute to over-policing, particularly in Black communities where menthol smoking is common. Unsurprisingly, the industry fails to acknowledge how their own targeted and exploitative marketing practices are directly responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Black Americans,” he said. “The proposed ban has the support of virtually every major public health and medical association, as well as many prominent civil rights and social justice advocacy groups, who understand the devastating health toll caused by menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars.”

Within a month, the figure nearly quadrupled as the entire Gaza Strip plunged into a humanitarian catastrophe.
Three months into the war, international donors, mostly governments, have provided just over half of the requested funds through the UN’s plan, according to data from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs’ (OCHA) Financial Tracking Service.
The figures reveal that only four-fifths of the emergency funding needed to ensure food security and roughly a quarter of what’s needed for shelter, water and sanitation have been provided.
Aid organizations say that nearly the entire population of the Gaza Strip faces a humanitarian crisis. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, a UN-backed food security agency, reported on December 21 that “virtually all households are skipping meals every day” in Gaza. The spread of diseases, including hepatitis, diarrhea and respiratory infections, is putting more lives at risk, according to the World Health Organization.
The UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East (UNWRA) is reporting that nearly 80% of Gaza’s civilian population of roughly 2.2 million has been displaced since Israel launched its military operation in response to Hamas’ assault on October 7, when militants killed around 1,200 people and took more than 200 others hostage, according to Israeli authorities.
Many are sheltering in tents or overcrowded accommodations in Rafah in southern Gaza, after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told people to flee both northern Gaza and Khan Younis in the south. Displaced Palestinians, many of whom left their homes with little or nothing, say they are struggling to stay dry and warm as winter temperatures and rains set in.
Meanwhile, the UN agency which provides services to more than half of Gaza’s civilians is on the verge of collapse, its leader said in a letter to the President of the UN General Assembly on December 7. As of January 12, more than 150 staff members have been killed — more than in any other conflict — and at least 70% of the remaining staff are displaced, according to the UNRWA.
The IDF has begun pulling its soldiers out of Gaza, but has said it expects fighting to continue throughout 2024. On December 22, the UN Security Council passed a resolution calling for further extended humanitarian pauses to allow more aid into Gaza. There has been no pause in fighting since a seven-day span at the end of November which was negotiated as part of an Israel-Hamas hostage release deal.
Gaza’s long dependence on aid
Gaza has been among the world’s top recipients of aid per capita for years. Before the war, four in five people depended on international help and as many as 1.84 million people were food insecure, according to the World Food Program.
The unemployment rate for Gaza was as high as 45% in 2022, according to the Palestinian Bureau of Statistics. In 2022, according to the World Bank, South Africa had the highest unemployment rate in the world at 29.8%, and Gaza and the West Bank together were third at 25.7%.
In 1993, Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) signed the Oslo Accords. Under the agreement, the PLO gave up armed resistance against Israel in return for promises of an independent Palestinian state. The accords also established the Palestinian Authority (PA) as the limited self-rule government for Gaza and the West Bank. Hamas, an Islamist organization established in 1987, opposed the accords. Its charter calls for the destruction of Israel and the group sees Israel as an illegitimate state occupying the West Bank.
Rising frustration with the PA on a number of fronts, including the lack of change, led to Hamas winning the majority of seats in the 2006 Palestinian Legislative Council election. Fatah, the political party forming the backbone of the PA, and Hamas formed a short-lived coalition government. The latter forcefully took control of Gaza in June 2007. Since then, the PA only exercises limited self-rule in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
“From mid-1990s to early 2000s, Palestine is in this state-building project and a lot of (development) aid goes towards that,” said Yara Asi, an assistant professor at the University of Central Florida who studies Palestinian health and human rights. “In the early 2000s, you start seeing disillusionment — the promises of Oslo did not come to fruition.”
In 2007, Hamas militants seized control of Gaza from forces loyal to the PA. Within months, Israel’s security cabinet would designate Gaza as “hostile territory.”
Israel then instituted an ongoing blockade, severely limiting the movement of people and goods by land, sea or air, which it argues is essential to prevent Hamas from arming itself. Restrictions extend to goods the Israelis consider as having a dual civilian and military use, such as concrete, agricultural fertilizer compounds and some medical equipment.
“Lots of everyday goods and especially building materials could not enter the Gaza Strip because they are on the so-called ‘dual-use material’ list,” said René Wildangel, an adjunct fellow at the International Hellenic University in Thessaloniki, Greece, and a former human rights expert for the Middle East at Amnesty International.
This makes reconstruction difficult, Wildangel said.
The UN said in a 2022 report that the restrictions have had a “profound impact” on daily living conditions in Gaza and “undermined Gaza’s economy, resulting in high unemployment, food insecurity and aid dependency.”
In the wake of the blockade, trade stalled, jobs disappeared, and more and more families fell into poverty, while the population in Gaza grew by nearly 60%, according to an analysis of Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics data.
With Hamas classified as a terrorist organization by the United States and European Union, most of the international community cut off direct investment to Gaza after 2007.
But the magnitude of need in Gaza meant emergency and humanitarian assistance had to keep coming. Data published by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) shows total foreign aid to the Palestinian territories has been notably higher since the Hamas takeover compared with the post-Oslo era.
But even as foreign aid to Gaza rose in the wake of the Hamas takeover, the amount of aid fluctuates annually, OECD data shows.
“Aid to Palestinians is adhoc, it depends on who the (US) president is, depends on who is in charge in Europe; Qatar may wake up one day and decide they want (to help),” Asi told CNN. “So, Palestinians are not given any ability to plan things for the future.”
After 2007, the US bolstered its economic assistance to strengthen the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank.
In 2018, the Trump administration cut about $200 million in Palestinian aid and halted contributions to UNRWA. Though Biden reinstated assistance in 2021, the amounts have never returned to Obama-era levels, which reached as high as $1 billion in 2009.
Qatar has also been a major donor to Gaza, contributing about $1.3 billion since 2019, according to OECD data. The country has even provided cash to pay civil servants’ salaries and shipped fuel to help with generating electricity since at least 2018 with Israel’s approval.
The PA opposed the funding of its rival, and the Israeli intelligence community didn’t back it, according to a former senior defense ministry official, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at the time that he supported the Qatari payments, “to return calm to (Israeli) villages of the south, but also to prevent a humanitarian disaster (in Gaza).” Israeli and international media reported Netanyahu hoped that an emboldened Hamas and divided Palestinian factions would prevent efforts to create a Palestinian state, CNN has reported.
Qatar maintains close ties with both Hamas and Western states, including the United States.
Qatar’s funding has been “a lifeline to the Hamas government” ever since its takeover in 2007, Wildangel said, but added that these funds — some of which have been delivered in suitcases full of cash — have been very hard to track.
Israeli leadership fought over post-war plans for Gaza during a security cabinet meeting on January 4, CNN reported, and ministers have outlined conflicting plans for its future governance.
Meanwhile, civilians in Gaza continue to face desperate hardship. The UN emergency relief chief said earlier last week that the “great majority” of 400,000 Gazans at risk of starving “are actually in famine, not just at risk of famine” while the enclave faces a continuing near-total communications blackout. Medicine for Israeli hostages and Palestinians entered Gaza last Wednesday after Qatar brokered a deal with Israel and Hamas. For every box of medication given to a hostage, Palestinians in Gaza would receive 1,000 boxes.

XGSJL054Y9_CR6S51FRYMH647A,This hidden BBQ joint is taking Dubai’s food scene by storm,"Story by Rebecca Cairns, CNN; Video by Ana DeOliva, CNN","5 minute read Published 4:27 AM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240122,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/travel/big-t-bbq-dubai-texas-hidden-barbecue-joint-hnk-spc-intl/,"Editor’s Note: This CNN series is, or was, sponsored by the destination it highlights. CNN retains full editorial control over subject matter, reporting and frequency of the articles and videos within the sponsorship, in compliance with our policy.
Al Quoz Industrial Area 4 looks much like the other three: a vast complex of low-rise warehouses, dusty roads passing factories and storage units, trucks and lorries ferrying goods to and fro. It looks nothing like the Dubai of travel brochures or Instagram — no iconic skyscrapers, no golden beachfront, no glitzy lights, no luxe resorts.
But among the clutter of concrete and corrugated iron of Al Quoz 4 is a restaurant that’s quickly turning the neighborhood into a must-visit for foodies: Big T’s BBQ.
The humble Texas-style barbecue joint, named after its owner, founder, and head chef Fadel “Big Tasty” Faour, is only open three days a week but has garnered a cult following of loyal customers who are willing to queue for up to an hour to grab a portion of its famous brisket.
“I’m proud and honored that I’ve received a lot of attention from people who love to explore food,” says the Palestinian chef, who grew up in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), adding that many of his regulars have now become friends.
One of the draws here is Faour’s 1,000-gallon Texan smoker — the largest of its kind in the UAE, he claims. Faour’s goal is to recreate the authentic flavors of the Lone Star state for his customers, down to the post-oak wood he imports from Texas for smoking.
“It’s what Texas uses. Think of oak as the spice — each wood will taste different. I try to keep it as original tasting as possible,” says Faour. “If you want to taste actual Texas barbecue, not any just state, but Texas barbecue, it’s this.”
Food runs in Faour’s family. His parents owned a chocolate factory and import business in Al Quoz Industrial estate, and he always had a passion for cooking. In 2016, after years of traveling and volunteering in kitchens, he joined the Institute of Culinary Education in Manhattan, and worked in prestigious New York kitchens. “I was just eager to jump at any chance to explore food,” he says.
It was a trip to Texas in 2019 that gave him his first taste of barbecue, and he spent months living with a friend and trying all the best spots for smoked and grilled meat. It was here Faour bought his famous smoker — long before he dreamt up Big T’s.
“Good Texas smokers are scarce” because they’re handmade and often have year-long waiting lists, he says. “I knew I wanted to open a restaurant but I didn’t have a plan on when or where,” he adds.
When the pandemic hit in 2020, Faour moved back to Dubai. Lockdowns and restrictions forced the family’s chocolate business to close — but Faour saw an opportunity to put his culinary training into action and make his dream of opening a restaurant a reality, utilizing the now-empty warehouse.
He transported the smoker to Dubai in 2022, opening Big T’s BBQ in December of that year. It was bare-bones: the sign above the door was handpainted, and a hand-written menu was taped by the cash register. Fluorescent tube lights bounced off the concrete floor and mismatched furniture.
But the sparse decor of the cafeteria-style restaurant didn’t matter to his diners. They were there for one thing: beef. Brisket, short ribs, pastrami, sausages, burgers, and double-fried beef tallow fries, along with a monthly and weekly rotation of specials. The brisket, which has become Big T’s signature, is smoked for 12 to 16 hours a day.
“We just cook it till it’s done. There is no time or temperature, we just keep checking. We know how it feels when it’s done. We go a lot on feeling,” Faour adds.
When Big T’s opened, Faour could barely keep up with demand, sometimes selling out by mid-afternoon. With the growing popularity, he bought not one, but two new smokers, tripling his capacity.
“Now we only sell out of everything once every three months,” Faour says. There may be less choice in the hour before it shuts but he’s quick to add: “You’ll always have something nice to eat till closing time.”
While Dubai’s food scene has captured international attention, dominating the 50 Best Restaurant list for MENA (Middle East and North Africa) and becoming the first city in the region to have its own Michelin guide, its budget dining venues are less well known.
The emirate is home to around 18,000 food outlets, and its culinary scene is a reflection of the 200 different nationalities living in the UAE — something that makes it “one of the best cities in the world for diversity of food,” says Alex Augusti, the Dubai-based food vlogger behind Just Food DXB. His videos often highlight low-cost eateries in unusual places, like Big T’s, which he calls his “go-to” for all things meat.
“It’s rustic, it’s rough around the edges and that’s why I love it,” says Augusti. “He’s got years of experience in the US and he really does inject that passion and that enthusiasm into his food.”
Augusti adds that Faour has “shaken up the food scene” and has raised the bar for barbecue in the city, “especially the smoked brisket scene, he’s really the leader in it.”
Through his videos and reviews, Augusti hopes he can convince visitors to look beyond the city’s malls and five-star resorts. “When you explore new foods and new cultures, that’s when you have the best experiences. And places like (Big T’s) are a perfect example — it’s in the middle of nowhere and you’ll probably get some of the best food in the city.”
The attention of adventurous foodies like Augusti has boosted Big T’s reputation in the city’s culinary scene, and Faour is now embarking on his second project, which he’s keeping under wraps until launch.
“I love barbecue, (but) I want to keep it interesting for me as a chef, and keep trying new things,” he adds."
XGTV5785L5_X77BU0V2SJTANSM,Former Trump adviser Peter Navarro sentenced to 4 months in jail for defying congressional subpoena,"By Devan Cole and Holmes Lybrand, CNN","4 minute read Updated 11:33 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/25/politics/peter-navarro-contempt-congress-sentence/,"Peter Navarro was sentenced Thursday to four months in jail for contempt of Congress after defying a subpoena related to the congressional investigation into the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack.
Navarro was convicted on two counts of contempt of Congress in September for not complying with a subpoena from the House select committee that investigated the attack.
The judge overseeing Navarro’s case said Thursday that the former Trump adviser’s sentence is of his “own making” as he tore into Navarro for claiming that his prosecution was politically motivated.
“I guess what bothers me ultimately is that here we are after a year and a half plus and you still want to suggest to me that this is a political prosecution. You want me to believe this is a political prosecution,” US District Judge Amit Mehta said during the sentencing hearing, raising his voice. “When the evidence is completely to the contrary.”
“You are not a victim. You are not the object of a political prosecution,” the judge said. “These are the circumstances of your own making.”
Mehta also fined Navarro $9,500.
Navarro quickly appealed the case on Thursday to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. His attorneys have long said they plan to file an appeal to raise issues related to his claim that he didn’t comply with the subpoena because Trump had invoked executive privilege.
Each count carries a mandatory minimum sentence of one month in prison, but prosecutors had asked Mehta to sentence Navarro to six months for each count – running concurrently – and fine him $200,000.
They told the judge last week that a sentence of one month apiece for the two counts “is insufficient to account for, punish, and deter the Defendant’s criminal offenses,” arguing that Navarro’s decision to not comply with the subpoenas was akin to the conduct of some of the people who participated in the riot.
“The Defendant, like the rioters at the Capitol, put politics, not country, first, and stonewalled Congress’s investigation,” prosecutors wrote. “The Defendant chose allegiance to former President Donald Trump over the rule of law.”
Navarro’s conviction and sentence represents another key victory for the now-disbanded House January 6 committee in its efforts to have the Justice Department criminally pursue individuals who refused to cooperate with its probe.

Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon was convicted in 2022 on two contempt counts and later sentenced to four months in prison. Bannon’s case is currently on appeal.
Navarro’s attorneys are seeking a sentence of no more than six months of probation for each count, and they asked Mehta last week to pause the sentence he imposes as they appeal the conviction.
Navarro’s trial last September moved quickly, with it taking less than a day for the jury to hear all the evidence in the case.
Prosecutors put just three witnesses on the stand, all former staff members of the House January 6 committee. The Justice Department used its testimony to make the case that the committee had good reason to subpoena Navarro and that he was informed repeatedly of its demands.
Prosecutor Elizabeth Aloi told the jury in closing arguments that Navarro “had knowledge about a plan to delay the activities of Congress on January 6,” and that he was “more than happy” to air that knowledge in public remarks, but not to the House committee.
Navarro’s attorneys did not put on any witnesses of their own, instead focusing on part of the contempt charge that required a showing that Navarro was willful and deliberate in his decision not to comply with the subpoena – meaning that his lack of compliance was not the result of an inadvertent mistake or accident.

Navarro has insisted that he didn’t comply with the subpoena at the direction of Trump, who he claimed invoked executive privilege in the matter. But ahead of trial, Mehta concluded that Navarro had not carried his burden in proving that Trump had formally asserted a privilege or a testimonial immunity that would have allowed his former aide to not even appear to answer the committee’s questions.
The former aide has said he plans to raise that issue and others on appeal.
“The appeal of this case will definitely answer what is required of a former President to invoke executive privilege as to their senior advisors and no future advisor will be in the same position of not knowing that the President they served had not properly invoked the privilege,” his attorneys wrote in court papers.
The federal appeals court in DC is currently considering Bannon’s bid to overturn his own contempt of Congress conviction.
During oral arguments last year, some members of a three-judge panel handling the appeal appeared skeptical of arguments advanced by Bannon’s attorney that the trial court judge who oversaw Bannon’s criminal case erred when they declined to let him assert executive privilege as part of his defense, and that the ex-adviser was simply acting on the advice of his then-attorney when he didn’t comply with the subpoena.

XGXMY4G5X1_UECS42JSIT3UOTI,Los Angeles Times slashes more than 20% of newsroom staff as the paper confronts a ‘financial crisis’,"By Oliver Darcy, CNN","4 minute read Updated 6:20 PM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240116,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/23/media/los-angeles-times-layoffs/,"The Los Angeles Times on Tuesday, facing what senior leadership described this week as a “financial crisis,” commenced a round of painful layoffs across the newsroom, a workforce reduction that is set to be one of the most severe in the newspaper’s 142-year history.
The cuts will impact at least 115 journalists, a person familiar with the matter told CNN, or slightly more than 20% of the newsroom. Some 94 of those cuts will be among unionized employees, union chief Matt Pearce said, meaning a quarter of the union will be laid off.
Pearce described the total number of employees being laid off as a “devastating” figure, but said it was “nonetheless far lower than the total number” expected last week.
Among those laid off Tuesday was Kimbriell Kelly, the newspaper’s Washington bureau chief, along with significant cuts to its business and sports desks.
“The LA Times Washington bureau was decimated,” Sarah Wire, a Washington-based reporter for the Times wrote on X.
“They haven’t been filling jobs for two years now and that reduced number was cut even more today. There are five reporters left covering DC.”
Brian Merchant, a Times tech columnist who said he had also been notified that he was being laid off, described the cuts as “a bloodbath.”
“My amazing editor… and the entire business desk as we know it, is gone too,” Merchant wrote.
A spokesperson for The Times, which is owned by biotech billionaire Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, did not immediately comment.
But Soon-Shiong spoke to Meg James, a media reporter at the Times, telling her that the cuts were necessary as the newspaper continues to lose $30 to $40 million each year.
“Today’s decision is painful for all, but it is imperative that we act urgently and take steps to build a sustainable and thriving paper for the next generation,” Soon-Shiong told James. “We are committed to doing so.”
In the interview, Soon-Shiong also expressed disappointment with the employees union and said a one-day walkout it staged last week “did not help” the situation.
The Los Angeles Times Guild, which represents editorial staffers, countered that its decision to go on strike “saved scores of newsroom jobs,” and pushed back on the assertions from the Times owner.
“This staffing cut is the fruit of years of middling strategy, the absence of a publisher, and no clear direction,” the union said in a statement. “But it’s clear that those entrusted to steward [the Soon-Shiong] family’s largesse have failed him — not the rank-and-file staff members with no say in editorial priorities.”
The newspaper, which houses the largest newsroom in the western US, has plunged into disarray in recent weeks as it faces a major financial shortfall, losing tens of millions of dollars a year. Its top editor, Kevin Merida, suddenly announced his departure. And two of the four members of an interim leadership team announced by Soon-Shiong have also abruptly exited in recent days.
Soon-Shiong told James on Tuesday, however, that he had lost the confidence of Merida and some high-ranking editors he had appointed. The owner also pushed back against the characterization that the newspaper is in trouble, telling James, “We are not in turmoil. We have a real plan.”
Staffers who spoke to CNN this week, however, described a different situation at the newspaper.
“I cannot overstate the level of chaos,” one staffer, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, told CNN.
The planned layoffs caught the eye of 10 Democratic members of Congress who represent California. The group on Monday wrote Soon-Shiong, expressing alarm over the planned layoffs, noting that during elections, “the role of news outlets in providing accurate and unbiased information becomes even more vital.”
“Our community relies on the newspaper to stay informed about local and national events, and a reduction in reporters could have a detrimental impact on the quality of reporting,” the congressional leaders wrote. “Preserving democracy is contingent upon a free and robust press, and the LA Times has been instrumental in upholding this democratic principle.”
“We urge you to consider alternative solutions that would allow the LA Times to navigate its financial challenges without compromising the integrity and strength of its newsroom,” they added.
In response, Soon-Shiong said he had invested hundreds of millions of dollars into the paper and suggested lawmakers should take action of their own to aid revenue-starved news organizations.
“I’d like to put the question to them: What can they do to help preserve a free and robust press, one that is instrumental in upholding our democracy?” he wrote. “All we are asking for is the opportunity for our newspaper and hardworking journalists to be fairly compensated, and for the L.A. Times to have a fair chance to become a self-sustaining institution.”
The Times is far from the only news organization struggling to keep its head above water amid a poor advertising climate, breakneck changes in consumer behavior, and technological advances that pose existential threats to the craft of journalism.
Most major newsrooms have been forced to undergo layoffs over the last year. In 2023, nearly 2,700 jobs were slashed in the journalism industry, the highest total since 2020 when the Covid-19 pandemic upended the industry.

XIYWTVIGL1_RIZSD2Z80MK1EPG,"Defying age and health difficulties, Pope Francis takes on vested interests to speak out on humanitarian crises",Analysis by Christopher Lamb,"5 minute read Published 10:53 AM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/23/europe/pope-francis-vatican-social-justice-intl/,"Pope Francis frequently speaks out on issues such as war, migration and climate change, according to a senior Vatican cardinal, to warn world leaders they are making “suicidal” decisions.
Cardinal Michael Czerny, who leads a Vatican department focused on social justice, stressed that while Francis might face criticism or being misunderstood, he has a moral imperative to speak out on behalf of Catholics.
“I think [what] he would say is, I speak out because of the commitment of the faithful. In other words, I’m not speaking because I have personally some kind of a special response to give. No, I speak out because there are millions of Catholics and other Christians and other believers and other people of good will for whom or in whose voice I’m speaking,” he told CNN. “And we’re trying to say to the world’s decision-makers that their decisions are anti-human, short-sighted, suicidal.”
The cardinal’s remarks came after the pope met with reporters on Monday January 22 at the Vatican, where he underlined the importance of responsible journalism in today’s world.
“Being a journalist is a vocation, somewhat like that of a doctor, who chooses to love humanity by curing illnesses,” the pope said. “In a certain sense, the journalist does likewise, choosing to touch personally the wounds of society and the world.”
From the moment of his election almost 11 years ago, the 87-year-old pontiff has been a newsmaker. His decision to avoid the trappings of office, live simply in a Vatican guesthouse and call for a “poor church for the poor” caught the attention of the world. But it’s been his willingness to address the pressing issues of the day that has made him a pope with a voice on the global stage.
He’s been ready to speak to on a range of topics from the death penalty to Artificial Intelligence while repeatedly calling for peace in Gaza and Ukraine, action on climate and greater efforts to help refugees fleeing war and poverty. Francis has given more media interviews than any other pope, always ready to meet and greet reporters on his trips abroad.
In a recent interview broadcast on Nove, which is owned by CNN’s parent company Warner Bros. Discovery, Francis addressed concerns about his health. Francis, who has recently recovered from a bout of bronchitis and had an abdominal operation in June, said he will remain in office for “as long as (he has) the ability to serve.”
The pope’s news making has helped him communicate the pillars of his papacy, chief among them being his consistent support for migrants.
Francis, whose grandparents narrowly escaped a deadly shipwreck when they migrated from Italy to Argentina, ensured that his first visit outside of Rome as pope was to the tiny Italian island of Lampedusa.
While there, he lamented the “global indifference” to refugees while remembering those who had died while trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea. In 2016, he described then-US presidential candidate Donald Trump’s anti-immigration rhetoric as “not Christian” and in the same year he bought back a dozen refugees on his papal plane after a visit to the Greeks island of Lesbos.
Czerny works closely with Francis in this area, and his office has been working to galvanize Catholics to welcome migrants in their communities.
“What we try to do is to help the church locally, wherever it is, to accompany the migrants and refugees, to welcome them, to protect them, to promote them and to integrate them,” he explains.
For Czerny, like Francis, migration is not about numbers but names, faces and people. His family fled Czechoslovakia for Canada when he was four years old. His grandmother was sent to Auschwitz and died soon after World War II.
“I wouldn’t be here talking to you if a family in Canada had not sponsored us,” he said.
The Canadian cardinal said Francis sees the migrant crisis as “a litmus test of our humanity” but one that the developed world is “largely failing.”
The issue is featuring in the US presidential race, with Republican candidate Trump making inflammatory claims that immigrants are “poisoning the blood of our country.” According to polls, 63% of white Catholics who attend Mass monthly or more often supported the former president in the 2020 election.
“It’s the church in the United States that needs to deal with this, needs to respond to it and needs to help God’s people to evaluate whether this discourse has any validity or whether it’s just ideology and fear,” Cardinal Czerny said when asked about the rhetoric being used. “Then they have to vote accordingly and I trust that they will.”
Another concern for the pope and the cardinal is Artificial Intelligence, with Francis recently calling for a treaty to regulate its use. Cardinal Czerny said the development of AI is “so fast in its evolution that for society to respond responsibly to the risks while benefiting from the benefits is not easy.” However, he stressed that countries need to work together to ensure that it “doesn’t become an affliction, a new suffering or a new risk for human life.”
But speaking with a prominent voice means facing criticism. Francis’ critiques of capitalism have led to accusations that he is a “communist,” while some politicians have questioned whether the pope was a credible voice to speak on climate change.
Czerny admitted there is “resistance” to Francis’ progressive message, but said the pope will “continue to be criticized” because he’s touching on “well-to-do-interests” that are both financial and political.
“Jesus had the same trouble in his time,” he said. “People were quick to apply labels and to try to corner him because the basic message was not to their liking.”
Some of the internal opposition to the pope has intensified following his move to authorize the blessings of same-sex couples. The Vatican doctrine office’s ruling that priests can bless couples in “irregular” situations saw bishops in Africa said they “generally prefer” not to bless same-sex couples.
“Yes, there will be criticisms,” said Czerny, who before coming to the Vatican worked in Africa and central America. He stressed Francis’ priority is not to avoid criticisms but “to include and console and bless and reconcile those who are suffering.”
Despite his age, the pope is far from slowing down. And despite his recent health problems, he’s unlikely to be cowed."
XKRQ27KPAK_JR3JB39C6VBCAUT,Justice Department settlement concludes Andrew Cuomo sexually harassed state employees,"By Holmes Lybrand and Devan Cole, CNN","3 minute read Updated 4:05 PM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/26/politics/doj-cuomo-sexual-harassment-new-york/,"The Justice Department concluded Friday that former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo sexually harassed state employees, supporting the findings of a previous state civil review of allegations against the former governor.
The department reached an agreement with the New York State Executive Chamber resolving the claims of sexual harassment and retaliation against the Democratic former governor, according to a release from the Justice Department on Friday.
The Justice Department found that during his time as governor, Cuomo subjected over a dozen women to a sexually hostile work environment, the department said Friday, reiterating many of the findings of New York Attorney General Letitia James’ 2021 report into the former governor.
“Governor Cuomo repeatedly subjected these female employees to unwelcome, non-consensual sexual contact; ogling; unwelcome sexual comments; gender-based nicknames; comments on their physical appearances; and/or preferential treatment based on their physical appearances,” the Justice Department found.
In August 2021, the New York attorney general’s office found that Cuomo had sexually harassed 11 women and created a “hostile” work environment for women. Cuomo resigned a week after the state’s report was released.
According to the findings from the Justice Department, Cuomo’s senior staff were told about the harassment but failed to report the incidents “to the appropriate investigative body.”
The Justice Department also noted that “Cuomo’s senior staff were aware of his conduct and retaliated against four of the women he harassed.”
Additionally, during his time as governor, Cuomo’s office did not have an HR department, according to the Justice Department.
An attorney for Cuomo, Rita Glavin, said in a statement Friday that Cuomo “did not sexually harass anyone” and that the Justice Department’s investigation “was based entirely on the NYS Attorney General’s deeply flawed, inaccurate, biased, and misleading report.”
Rich Azzopardi, a spokesperson for Cuomo, said in a separate statement Friday that the Justice Department’s work “isn’t worth the paper it’s printed on.”
Meanwhile, Mariann Wang, an attorney for two women who alleged Cuomo harassed them, said in a statement Friday, “We are pleased the US Attorney’s office and the Executive Chamber have taken serious steps to ensure nothing like the abuse Cuomo engaged in will happen again.”
“We hope these measures have real impact and prevent the kind of repeated abuse of power that resulted in so much harm to so many women,” Wang added.
Debra Katz, an attorney for Charlotte Bennett, one of the first women to accuse Cuomo of sexual harassment, similarly said Friday, “We are hopeful that this settlement with the DOJ will lead to lasting change that prevents any other woman from having to endure what our client has endured.”
The department said the agreement “memorializes” many of the reforms enacted by Cuomo’s successor, Gov. Kathy Hochul, “as well as additional reforms aimed at preventing sexual harassment and retaliation in the Executive Chamber.”
The reforms include the governor’s office creating a new “process for complaints against senior officials” so that individuals lodging complaints can have “confidence that their complaints will be handled as independently as possible,” the Justice Department said. The governor’s office will also have to build an “anti-retaliation monitoring policy” to help shield complainants from reprisal.
“With this settlement agreement, the Executive Chamber under Governor Hochul is undertaking additional actions that will address system failures of the past while helping prevent the recurrence of systemic sexual harassment and retaliation in the future,” Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke said in a statement.

XMYH211CY6_H07SBF96YD05DS8,Utility giant PG&E agrees to $45 million settlement related to California’s second-largest wildfire,"By Taylor Romine and Aya Elamroussi, CNN","3 minute read Published 1:39 AM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/26/us/pacific-gas-electric-settlement-dixie-fire-california/,"Pacific Gas and Electric will pay $45 million in penalties for its role in the Dixie Fire – the second-largest wildfire in California’s history – that started after a tree fell and hit the company’s equipment in 2021, state regulators said Thursday.
The massive inferno ignited on July 13, 2021, when power lines owned by PG&E came in contact with a tree, according to Cal Fire. The wildfire burned for more than 100 days, charring 963,309 acres across five counties in Northern California before it was contained on October 25, 2021, according to Cal Fire.
The fire destroyed more than 1,300 structures, including much of the small community of Greenville, about 170 miles north of Sacramento.
The settlement with PG&E allocates $40 million in shareholder funding to make hard copy records into an electronic system, which will improve “the timeliness of inspections and preventive maintenance,” the California Public Utilities Commission said Thursday in a news release.
The company will also pay $2.5 million in fines to the California General Fund and $2.5 million to tribal communities impacted by the fires, the utilities commission added.
PG&E is “committed to making it right and making it safe for our customers and hometowns” and has resolved claims with the five impacted counties and “numerous individuals and families,” the company said in a statement to CNN.
PG&E accepted Cal Fire’s conclusion that a tree falling on its powerline caused the fire, but the company believes it “acted as a prudent operator,” the company said in a statement Thursday.

“There is no evidence that PG&E consciously and willfully disregarded a known risk with regard to the ignition of the Dixie Fire,” the statement said. “We followed the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) requirements when inspecting, maintain and operating our system.”
PG&E noted the settlement will not impact costs for customers as it is not requesting rate recovery, adding that the agreement doesn’t “preclude PG&E from receiving cost recovery for costs related to the fire, including from the state’s Wildfire Fund.”
The utility company has been involved in several multi-million dollar settlements related to destructive wildfires in recent years.
In 2021, PG&E was fined $125 million for its role in the 2019 Kincade Fire in Sonoma County as part of a settlement with the California Public Utilities Commission.
And in 2020, PG&E pleaded guilty to 85 counts, including involuntary manslaughter and unlawfully starting the 2018 Camp Fire. The blaze was California’s deadliest, killing 85 people and destroying thousands of structures.
Last year, the company agreed to pay $50 million in a settlement connected to the deadly 2020 Zogg Fire and had criminal charges dropped against it.
Other penalties have included $1 million over the 2019 Easy Fire and fines over inspection issues, according to the utilities commission.
PG&E said Thursday that it is focused on reducing wildfire risk and cited its preventive power shutoffs during high fire risk conditions and its program to bury 10,000 miles of its power lines to reduce the risk of starting more blazes."

Nicholas Joseph Gutierrez is charged in the indictment with a felony count of vehicular manslaughter with gross negligence; a misdemeanor count of vehicular manslaughter with ordinary negligence; and nine counts of reckless driving on a highway causing a specified injury, the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office said Tuesday.
Gutierrez pleaded not guilty to the charges Tuesday and is scheduled to appear in court February 9 for a pretrial conference, the district attorney’s office said.
About 75 recruits for various California law enforcement departments were on a run near Whittier as part of their training on November 16, 2022, when Gutierrez drove in the wrong direction and hit some of them, authorities said.
One of the injured, Alejandro Martinez-Inzunza, a recruit for the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, died at a hospital of his injuries eight months later, authorities said. Nine others were severely injured, the district attorney’s office said.
“More than a year later, we are still grappling with the profound loss of a promising sheriff’s deputy recruit, Alejandro Martinez-Inzunza, and the other recruits who were seriously injured as a result of this tragic incident,” District Attorney George Gascón said Tuesday. “Today’s indictment is a significant step forward in the progress of this case.”
CNN has sought comment from Gutierrez’s attorney and is working to get a copy of the indictment.
At the time of the incident, Gutierrez showed no signs of impairment and blew a zero in the Breathalyzer test, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department said.
Alexandra Kazarian, an attorney for Gutierrez, told CNN affiliate KABC in November 2022: “I have no doubt that an in-depth investigation will confirm that Nicholas is a hard-working young man who holds no animosity towards law enforcement, and this was an absolutely tragic accident.”"
XPXZAXVTJC_CESC8WDHHJFUACB,"EXCLUSIVE: Willis, Wade and others expected to be subpoenaed for hearing on Fulton County DA affair allegations","By Zachary Cohen, Nick Valencia and Jason Morris, CNN","6 minute read Updated 9:04 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/25/politics/fulton-county-subpoenas-willis-wade-election-subversion/,"A current and former law partner to Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor leading the 2020 election subversion case in Georgia, have been told to expect a subpoena to testify at a hearing next month on whether he and the district attorney who brought the case should be disqualified over their alleged affair and financial ties, sources familiar with the matter tell CNN.
The district attorney, Fani Willis, also is expected to be subpoenaed, sources say, and possibly others in her office.
The Fulton County judge overseeing the criminal case against former President Donald Trump and his allies called for the hearing to address claims from one of Trump’s co-defendants that Willis and Wade have a conflict of interest. Citing financial statements turned up in Wade’s current divorce proceeding, lawyers for Trump’s co-defendant, Mike Roman, argue that Willis financially benefited when Wade took her on lavish vacations after she hired him as special prosecutor.
“We’ve got a lot of information. We’ve got a lot of documents and a lot of witnesses,” Roman’s defense attorney Ashleigh Merchant told CNN when asked if she will issue subpoenas for witness testimony at the hearing, scheduled for February 15.
Roman has argued that the entire criminal case against him should be dismissed because of the alleged conflict of interest. While those familiar with the case say the allegations are not likely to derail the sprawling racketeering case Willis has built against Trump and his 14 remaining co-defendants, they have proven a significant distraction and given Trump and his allies ample fodder to claim the case is the result of a corrupt justice system out to get him.
Merchant said the evidence she presents at the hearing, including who she may call to the witness stand, will in part depend on what Willis says in response to the allegations. Judge Scott McAfee has ordered Willis to respond in writing by February 2.
Willis would likely fight any subpoenas for her or her staff. She is already trying to quash a subpoena to be deposed in Wade’s divorce proceeding.
Willis has asked to go to trial in August, but a trial date hasn’t been set.
Like all hearings in the Georgia 2020 election case, any witness testimony about the alleged romantic relationship between Willis and Wade – claims that have already prompted immense public scrutiny since coming to light in recent weeks – would be broadcast in real time via live stream.
Speaking to CNN’s Dana Bash on Thursday, Michael Moore, a former US Attorney in Georgia and a CNN legal analyst, said the allegations aren’t “necessarily the death blow to whether or not a case can move forward but it’s becoming a distraction and a circus.”
Moore said it wouldn’t surprise him if the judge takes control of the hearing to limit the distraction. “And that is to say, look we’re not going to turn this into an episode of Knots Landing here in the courtroom,” Moore said.
Willis and Wade have not directly addressed the affair allegations.
Willis told a church congregation on January 14 that Wade is qualified for the job and that her adversaries were targeting her and Wade because of race, asking, “Isn’t it them playing the race card?”
Despite having more experienced felony prosecutors on her staff, Willis appointed Wade to the post in 2021 when her investigation into the actions of Trump and his allies following the 2020 election was heating up.
Wade has earned more than $650,000 for his work on the election case, according to Roman’s court filing, which includes invoices from Wade’s firm. The filing alleges that Wade made more than other prosecutors in the DA’s office.
Willis and Wade now face the prospect of having to potentially confront explosive witness testimony in front of an audience that extends well beyond the courtroom.
Merchant told CNN Wednesday that she would prefer to focus on the issue of potential financial impropriety rather than the alleged romantic relationship itself, saying: “I’m hoping that we don’t have to go into that.”
“I think the real issue here is not this relationship. I think it’s more about the impropriety of having him on the team and having him present this to the grand jury and the conflict of interest in the appearance of impropriety,” Merchant said.
In the days since leveling the allegations of the affair in her motion to dismiss the case, Merchant told CNN that she and her team have uncovered more evidence to buttress the claims, including confirming the trips Willis and Wade took were personal vacations, and not work-related business trips.
“I think what’s relevant is to look at the personal nature of the trips. These are trips that neither Fani nor Nathan got reimbursement for. They didn’t get reimbursement through the county, they didn’t get reimbursement through her campaign,” Merchant said when asked about the nature of the trips.
Wade bought tickets for Willis to accompany him on at least two out-of-state trips, court records released last week show.
The records appeared in a motion filed in Cobb County Superior Court last week by Wade’s current wife, Joycelyn Wade, as part of her divorce case. They include copies of credit card statements that show Wade purchased airline tickets for himself and Willis, including trips to Miami in October 2022 and San Francisco in April 2023.
Joycelyn Wade’s lawyer also sought a deposition from what appears to be a travel agency that Nathan Wade paid, according to his credit card statement.
Those statements also show payments to cruise lines and hotels in Aruba and Napa Valley, California, though more details about those trips don’t appear in court records. Roman’s court filing suggests Wade and Willis traveled together on cruises and vacationed in Napa Valley and the Caribbean, citing “information obtained outside court filings.”
Trump and 18 co-defendants were charged as part of a conspiracy stemming from the former president’s efforts to overturn his 2020 electoral defeat in Georgia, including the use of “fake electors.” Four of the 19 have since pleaded guilty in negotiations spearheaded by Wade, and the remainder have maintained their not-guilty pleas.
Roman, a Trump 2020 campaign official, was indicted for his role in the fake elector plot in Georgia. As CNN has previously reported, Roman was closely involved in the effort to ensure fake elector ballots arrived at the US Capitol in Washington ahead of the January 6 certification of the 2020 election.

XQSQ6AAINF_34OSGUBU40E9QNW,"Megalodons were skinnier than we previously thought, new study suggests","By Jack Guy, CNN","3 minute read Published 7:00 PM EST, Sun January 21, 2024",20240122,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/22/world/megalodon-body-shape-study-scli-intl-scn/,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.
Megalodons, the huge prehistoric sharks depicted in movies such as “The Meg,” had more slender bodies than was previously thought, according to a new study.
Many mysteries remain about the biology of megalodons, but until now, great white sharks had been used to model their appearance. But new research from a team led by Kenshu Shimada, a paleobiologist at DePaul University in Chicago, and Phillip Sternes, a doctoral candidate at the University of California at Riverside, suggests megalodons would have had skinnier bodies than great whites.
The Otodus megalodon lived more than 23 million years ago. Fossils of the extinct giant are hard to come by. While there are plenty of fossilized shark teeth, their bodies mainly consist of cartilage rather than bones, and are rarely preserved.
This new research is based on the reappraisal of an incomplete set of fossil vertebrae found in Belgium.
While previous research estimated that this particular megalodon would have measured 9.2 meters (30.2 feet) in length, Shimada and his coauthors say the individual would have in fact measured at least 11.1 meters (36.4 feet).
Shimada told CNN that the fossil vertebrae would not have been strong enough to support a shark of this length if it had the same body shape as a great white.
“If the body form of the great white shark is directly applied to the vertebral column, the diameter of the vertebrae would then be unrealistically small for the shark to be able to support its body,” he said.
Shimada explained that a vertebral column of this diameter would not provide sufficient support for the muscles of a body shape like that of a great white, and would also increase the risk of spinal cord injuries.

“This is particularly important considering that shark skeletons are not as strong as bones because they are cartilaginous (made of cartilage),” he added.
He did note, however, that some shark species, including megalodon, exhibit some strengthening of this cartilage through calcification, or a build-up of calcium that can then harden.
“The new study considers the size proportion between the vertebrae and body in a more biologically realistic manner, which would indicate a leaner body at least compared to the modern great white shark,” he said.
The research suggests that “the modern great white shark may not necessarily serve as a good modern analog for assessing at least certain aspects” of megalodon biology, said Shimada.
“There are still many misconceptions or unanswered questions about the biology of megalodon, and we would like to continue to scientifically correct or elucidate them based on the fossil record,” he said.
As things stand, there is only a partial fossil record for the megalodon, and Shimada hopes a complete skeleton will be discovered someday.
The study was published Sunday in the journal Palaeontologia Electronica.
Related article The extinct superpredator megalodon was big enough to eat orcas, scientists say
Previous research published in August 2022 estimated the megalodon would have been able to devour prey the size of orca whales – which can be up to 26 feet long and weigh more than 8,000 pounds – in just five bites.
The megalodon went extinct around 3.6 million years ago, according to the United Kingdom’s Natural History Museum, for reasons scientists are still trying to understand.
One theory is that their demise was linked to the fact that they were warm-blooded.
Previous research by Shimada and others concluded that being warm-blooded may have been one of the key drivers fueling megalodons’ massive size and overall prowess as predators, but it also made them sensitive to environmental changes.
“The fact that megalodon disappeared suggests the likely vulnerability of being warm-blooded because warm-bloodedness requires constant food intake to sustain high metabolism,” Shimada told CNN in July last year.
“Possibly, there was a shift in the marine ecosystem due to the climatic cooling,” causing the sea level to drop, altering the habitats of the populations of the types of food megalodon fed on such as marine mammals and leading to its extinction.

XRHAZ8W3WT_TPNKMYAY77QG3WL,Record turnout and no surge of independents. These maps explain Trump’s win,"Analysis by Zachary B. Wolf, Renee Rigdon, Matt Stiles and Ethan Cohen, CNN","5 minute read Updated 4:50 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/24/politics/new-hampshire-turnout-trump-what-matters/,"A version of this story appears in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.
A record number of New Hampshire voters – more than 320,000 when all votes are counted, according to CNN’s estimate – turned out to choose between former President Donald Trump and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley in the state’s Republican primary.
The increase in New Hampshire Republican primary turnout is a shift from last week’s Iowa caucuses. In Iowa, Republican caucus turnout was down compared with 2016, the most recent contested Republican primary with no incumbent.
The New Hampshire primary result is a second decisive win for Trump as he begins the process of building a delegate lead. No other non-incumbent Republican candidate has won the early contests in both Iowa and New Hampshire, although Trump, as a former president with almost universal name recognition, has some of the advantages of incumbency.
Turnout is generally higher for Republican primaries in years like this one when there is a hotly contested primary on the GOP side and less competition on the Democratic side. In 2016, when there were contested primaries for both Republicans and Democrats, and when Trump notched his first victory as a candidate in the New Hampshire primary, a then-record number of Republican primary voters – nearly 288,000﻿ – took part.
Trump performed better than he did in the 2016 primary in nearly every New Hampshire town, and most of those were by double-digit margins.
That’s partly driven by the dynamics of the race: This year, Trump faced a sole remaining major challenger, while several other contenders were still actively campaigning at the time of the New Hampshire primary in 2016.
In New Hampshire’s three largest cities (Concord, Nashua and Manchester), Trump performed nearly 20 percentage points better than he did in the 2016 primary.
With final votes still being tabulated and returns not complete in all of New Hampshire’s towns, Trump won a commanding majority of more than 54%. Haley, in placing second with more than 132,000 votes, about 43% of the total, got more support in 2024 than Trump got in his 2016 victory.
Trump’s vote total of more than 166,000 and counting also sets a new record for the most votes ever won by a candidate in the New Hampshire primary in either party.
The previous record was Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ roughly 152,000 votes in the 2016 Democratic primary, when he defeated former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
One major difference for Republicans is that the 2016 race was contested between a large number of candidates and Trump won the primary with less than 36% of the vote. By primary day this year, Haley was Trump’s only remaining major challenger, making the contest mostly a two-person race, although thousands of votes were also cast for other candidates.
In 2012, when there was a similarly crowded primary and hope among Republicans that they could oust a weakened President Barack Obama, more than 249,000 voters took part in the GOP primary. In 2008, when there was another contested primary, more than 241,000 voters took part.
Compare those figures with years in which there was an incumbent Republican president. Most recently, in 2020, nearly 159,000 voters took part in the GOP primary. In 2004, when George W. Bush ran without major competition, more than 67,000 people took part.
On the Democratic side, where Democratic Party officials had tried to force New Hampshire to delay the primary, and where President Joe Biden won as a write-in candidate, fewer than 89,000 total votes were recorded with 81% of the vote tabulated, according to CNN’s calculations.
That’s more than the nearly 62,000 who took part in 2012, when Obama was an incumbent running without major opposition. The Democratic counting process was slowed this year by the fact that Biden did not appear on the ballot and officials had to read his name as written on individual ballots.
The low turnout is likely the result of the standoff between the Democratic Party and New Hampshire’s state government over the primary date. Biden’s easy victory as a write-in candidate who boycotted putting his name on the ballot is a show of his strength in the party despite some angst among Democrats about the current state of his approval ratings.
While much has been made of Haley’s effort to bring independent voters into the primary, they represented similar portions of the Republican primary electorate.
In 2016, 36% of Republican primary voters in New Hampshire were registered as independents or “undeclared,” according to CNN’s exit polls at the time. In a much more crowded field that year, Trump won the largest portion of those independent voters (39% of them).
This year, the portion of registered independents was slightly higher at 46%, and Trump got a similar portion of them at 35%, although he lost the remaining independent voters to Haley, who got 64%. A major difference for Trump in 2024 is that he won nearly three-quarters of registered Republican voters compared with the 33% he got in 2016.
Two very different versions of American Republicans showed up at the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary, and turnout was not the only difference between them.
Trump has now won more than half the vote in Iowa, a state where the majority of Republican caucusgoers (61%) think most or all abortions should be banned nationwide, and also in New Hampshire, where more than two-thirds of Republican primary voters (67%) oppose such a ban.
In New Hampshire, only a little more than a third of Republican primary voters said they were part of the MAGA movement, referring to the “Make America Great Again” slogan that Trump popularized in 2016. In Iowa, it was nearly half of caucusgoers.
In Iowa, a third of Republicans don’t think he’d be fit for office if he’s convicted of a crime. In New Hampshire, 42% of primary voters feel that way."

More than 100,000 people in the US are on the transplant waiting list, and an average of 17 die every day while waiting. Doctors have spent decades experimenting with alternatives, and many now see potential in replacing failing human organs with genetically modified pig organs.

Xenotransplantation, as cross-species organ transplantation is called, is still in the early stages. There are no human clinical trials taking place that have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, but the researchers behind a study published Thursday in the Journal of Clinical Investigation say their findings might bring human trials even closer.
For the study, doctors at the University of Alabama-Birmingham’s Marnix E. Heersink School of Medicine transplanted genetically modified pig kidneys into three people who were brain-dead and showed that they could do so using the same FDA-approved drugs used in human-to-human donations.
With any kind of transplant, whether from a human or an animal, doctors have to give the recipient medications that suppress their immune system so their body doesn’t reject the unfamiliar organ. In some cases, when patients are particularly vulnerable to infection, they might get additional therapy to offer protection from encapsulated bacteria like Neisseria meningitidis, the germ that causes meningitis.

The researchers behind the new study compared results from two pig kidney recipients who got the standard immune-suppressing drugs and an additional FDA-approved therapy called eculizumab with results from someone who got only the immune suppression drugs. The combination appeared to work best.
The study showed that doctors didn’t need to use specialty or experimental drugs for this transplant process, which would make it easier to get the work into FDA-approved human trials, said study author Dr. Jayme Locke, a professor of surgery and director of the Division of Transplantation at the Heersink School of Medicine.
“When we move this into the living, the scientist in me thinks the best way to do this is that we should change only one thing at a time, and so in this case, the only thing that we will have to change and have to be different is the organ source,” she said.
Keeping things as similar and as simple as possible would also make the process generalizable, Locke said.

“Doing this using medications that transplanters across the globe know how to use, when you start thinking about scaling this up and being able to offer this to as many people as possible, that’s also very appealing,” she added. “It just decreases the complexity of what you’re trying to do.”
The new research is limited because it was demonstrated in only three patients. As with any science, the advance shows a stepwise progression, but doctors who work on research involving transplants complimented the team for what transplant surgeon Dr. Sheri Krams called “extraordinarily innovative work.”
What the paper adds to the body of knowledge is “somewhat incremental,” said Krams, senior associate dean of graduate education and postdoctoral affairs and a professor of surgery at Stanford Medicine, who did not work on the new research – particularly compared with a study published in August that showed how to test this kind of procedure in a model using brain-dead donors, what UAB calls the Parsons Model after the first person in the study whom Locke and her team transplanted with a modified pig organ in 2021. But Krams agreed that “anything we do in transplant is great.”
Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.
Dr. Mandy Ford, scientific director of the Emory Transplant Center, agreed that the extreme need for organs makes any advance in this area important.
“There’s a critical donor organ shortage in the United States and worldwide, and xenotransplantation really has the potential to be a revolutionary permanent solution to the problem,” said Ford, who did not work on the new study but characterized it as a “major advance.”
“Using this FDA-approved regimen, I think, gets us closer to the clinical reality of being able to start clinical trials and one step closer to making xenotransplantation a clinical reality,” Ford added."
XSPH6OUGJW_66GU31357FQQWHO,Trump wins New Hampshire Republican primary,"By Eric Bradner and Gregory Krieg, CNN","5 minute read Updated 5:56 AM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/23/politics/trump-new-hampshire-primary/,"Former President Donald Trump won New Hampshire’s Republican presidential primary on Tuesday, defeating former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and moving him closer to a rematch with President Joe Biden this fall.
Trump’s victory, after a big win in the Iowa caucuses, marks the first time in the modern primary era that the same non-incumbent candidate has won both the Iowa and New Hampshire Republican contests. His hold on the GOP further solidified, Trump’s campaign on Tuesday night sent a fundraising text to supporters declaring, “THIS RACE IS OVER!”
It’s a crushing blow to Haley’s 2024 hopes and those of the party’s anti-Trump factions. New Hampshire’s primary electorate is much more moderate than other early voting states, thanks to nearly 40% of the state’s voters being registered as “undeclared” and allowed to participate in the primary of their choosing. Polls consistently showed Haley, who was Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations, performing best among moderate voters and those eager to move on from the former president.

Haley, though, insisted Tuesday night that she plans to stay in the race and delivered, during her concession speech New Hampshire, some of her sharpest lines of attack on Trump since the campaign began nearly a year ago.
“New Hampshire is first in the nation, it is not the last in the nation,” Haley told supporters in Concord. “This race is far from over. There are dozens of states left to go. And the next one is my sweet state of South Carolina.”
Haley is the last candidate standing in the way of Trump’s third consecutive Republican presidential nomination, after entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy dropped out following a disappointing fourth-place finish in the Iowa caucuses and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis exited on Sunday.
She’d sought to portray Trump, who will be 78 by Election Day in November, and Biden, who will be 81, as past their primes and “equally bad.”
In her Tuesday remarks, Haley pinned recent Republican election failures on Trump, while also warning of the potential backlash to his criminal indictments and questioning his mental acuity following an incident in which the former president confused Haley with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
“With Donald Trump, you have one bout of chaos after another,” Haley said. “This court case, that controversy, this tweet, that senior moment. You can’t fix Joe Biden’s chaos with Republican chaos.”
Eight days after a delighted Trump gave a mostly gracious speech following his Iowa caucus victory, a plainly angry and frustrated Trump spent the majority of his New Hampshire speech railing against Haley.
“Who the hell was the impostor that went up on the stage that went before and claimed victory?” Trump said. “She did very poorly actually.”
Trump first responded – in real time as Haley spoke – in a series of social media posts calling her campaign a lost cause and demanding she drop out.
“Haley said she had to WIN in New Hampshire,” Trump wrote. “SHE DIDN’T!!!”
Moments after Haley began her remarks, he continued: “DELUSIONAL!!!” “SHE CAME IN THIRD LAST WEEK!” Trump wrote in a third post.
Outside groups aligned with Haley appear to disagree.
Mark Harris, executive director of the pro-Haley super PAC SFA Fund, told CNN they’re “on to South Carolina” and plan to spend millions on ads, direct mail and more.
“Trump struggled to get 50% in two states,” Harris said, suggesting that the twice-nominated former president is shedding overall support in the race, his third consecutive presidential campaign.
While Haley had a prominent supporter in New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu – as demonstrated by DeSantis’ loss in Iowa despite Gov. Kim Reynolds’ endorsement – there are limits to a popular Republican governor’s influence when stacked up against Trump.
It wasn’t enough to stop Trump from making history by becoming the first non-incumbent Republican in modern presidential politics — since the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary moved to the front of the nominating calendar — to win both states.
The campaign manager for Biden, who spent the day with Vice President Kamala Harris in Manassas, Virginia, rallying to “restore Roe” and codify abortion rights, said in a statement late Tuesday that the Democrat expects Trump to be his opponent in November.
“Tonight’s results confirm Donald Trump has all but locked up the GOP nomination, and the election denying, anti-freedom MAGA movement has completed its takeover of the Republican Party,” Julie Chavez Rodriguez said. “Donald Trump is headed straight into a general election matchup where he’ll face the only person to have ever beaten him at the ballot box: Joe Biden.”
The next contest is in Nevada — but Haley has already ceded that state to Trump. Circumventing the state’s primary, where Haley will on the ballot on February 6, the Nevada GOP opted to award its delegates instead through caucuses that will take place on February 8. Haley chose to file for the primary and not the caucuses, which means Trump is certain to dominate in the delegate-awarding contest.
Her next real shot at Trump would come on February 24, when her home state of South Carolina holds its primary.
The “first in the south” primary has a long history of picking presidential nominees. It’s where Biden cemented his status as the Democratic front-runner in 2020 and where Trump’s win thinned out a still-crowded GOP field in 2016.
Already, Trump has sought to embarrass Haley with a raft of Republican endorsements from her former allies in her home state. Sen. Tim Scott, who Haley appointed to the Senate when she was governor in 2013, and Rep. Nancy Mace, who Haley supported against a Trump-backed challenger in 2022, both endorsed Trump in recent days.
“I have watched the political class line up with Donald Trump. I have fought the political class all my life. You won’t see the political class with me in South Carolina,” Haley said at a Monday campaign stop in Franklin, New Hampshire.

XT67IKA8D0_MYIAMQ93HEHJ3CR,"Native American communities have the highest suicide rates, yet interventions are scarce","By Cheryl Platzman Weinstock, KFF Health News","8 minute read Updated 7:09 PM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240122,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/22/health/native-american-communities-suicide-rates-interventions-kff-health-news/,"Editor’s Note: If you or someone you know may be experiencing a mental health crisis, contact the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline by dialing or texting “988.” To reach the Native and Strong Lifeline, call “988” and press 4.
Amanda MorningStar has watched her children struggle with mental health issues, including suicidal thoughts. She often wonders why.
“We’re family-oriented and we do stuff together. I had healthy pregnancies. We’re very protective of our kids,” said MorningStar, who lives in Heart Butte, Montana, a town of about 600 residents on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation.
Yet despite her best efforts, MorningStar said, her family faces a grim reality that touches Native American communities nationwide. About a year ago, her 15-year-old son, Ben, was so grief-stricken over his cousin’s suicide and two classmates’ suicides that he tried to kill himself.
“Their deaths made me feel like part of me was not here. I was gone. I was lost,” said Ben MorningStar.
He spent more than a week in an inpatient mental health unit, but once home, he was offered sparse mental health resources.

Non-Hispanic Indigenous people in the United States die by suicide at higher rates than any other racial or ethnic group, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The suicide rate among Montana’s Native American youth is more than five times the statewide rate for the same age group, according to the Montana Budget and Policy Center. Montana ranked third-worst among states for suicide deaths in 2020, and 10% of all suicides in the state from 2017 through 2021 were among Native Americans, even though they represent only 6.5% of the state’s population.
Despite decades of research into suicide prevention, suicide rates among Indigenous people have remained stubbornly high, especially among Indigenous people ages 10 to 24, according to the CDC. Experts say that’s because the national strategy for suicide prevention isn’t culturally relevant or sensitive to Native American communities’ unique values.
Suicide rates have increased among other racial and ethnic minorities, too, but to lesser degrees.
Systemic issues and structural inequities, including underfunded and under-resourced services from the federal Indian Health Service, also hamper suicide prevention in Indigenous communities. “I worried who was going to keep my son safe. Who could he call or reach out to? There are really no resources in Heart Butte,” said Amanda MorningStar.
Ben MorningStar said he is doing better. He now knows not to isolate himself when problems occur and that “it is OK to cry, and I got friends I can go to when I have a bad day. Friends are better than anything,” he said.
His twice-a-month, 15-minute virtual telehealth behavioral therapy visits from IHS were recently reduced to once a month.
Mary Cwik, a psychologist and senior scientist at the Center for Indigenous Health at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, said the systemic shortcomings MorningStar has witnessed are symptoms of a national strategy that isn’t compatible with Indigenous value systems.
“It is not clear that the creation of the national strategy had Indigenous voices informing the priorities,” Cwik said.

The cause of high suicide rates in Indigenous communities is complex. Native Americans often live with the weight of more adverse childhood experiences than other populations — things such as emotional, physical, and sexual abuse, intimate partner violence, substance misuse, mental illness, parental separation or divorce, incarceration, and poverty.
Those adverse experiences stack upon intergenerational trauma caused by racial discrimination, colonization, forced relocation, and government-sanctioned abduction to boarding schools that persisted until the 1970s.
“There’s no way that communities shaped by these forces for so long will get rid of their problems fast by medical services. A lot of people in Indian Country struggle to retain hope. It’s easy to conclude that nothing can fix it,” said Joseph P. Gone, a professor of anthropology and global health and social medicine at Harvard University and member of the Gros Ventre (Aaniiih) tribal nation of Montana.
Most tribal nations are interested in collaborative research, but funding for such work is hard to come by, said Gone. So is funding for additional programs and services.
Stephen O’Connor, who leads the suicide prevention research program at the Division of Services and Intervention Research at the National Institute of Mental Health, said, “Given the crisis of suicide in Native American populations, we need more funding and continued sustained funding for research in this area.”
Getting grants for scientific research from NIMH, which is part of the National Institutes of Health, can be challenging, especially for smaller tribes, he said.
Officials at the NIMH and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration said that they continue to build research partnerships with tribal nations and that they recently launched new grants and multiple programs that are culturally informed and evidence-based to reduce suicide in tribal communities.
NIMH researchers are even adjusting a commonly used suicide screening tool to incorporate more culturally appropriate language for Indigenous people.
Teresa Brockie, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins School of Nursing, is one of a small but growing number of researchers, many of whom are Indigenous, who study suicide prevention and intervention strategies that respect Indigenous beliefs and customs. Those strategies include smudging — the practice of burning medicinal plants to cleanse and connect people with their creator.
Without this understanding, research is hampered because people in tribal communities have “universal mistrust of health care and other colonized systems that have not been helpful to our people or proven to be supportive,” said Brockie, a member of Fort Belknap reservation’s Aaniiih Tribe.
Brockie is leading one of the first randomized controlled trials studying Indigenous people at Fort Peck. The project aims to reduce suicide risk by helping parents and caregivers deal with their own stress and trauma and develop positive coping skills. It’s also working to strengthen children’s tribal identity, connectivity, and spirituality.
In 2015, she reported on a study she led in 2011 to collect suicide data at the Fort Peck reservation in northeastern Montana. She found that adverse childhood experiences have a cumulative effect on suicide risk and also that tribal identity, strong connections with friends and family, and staying in school were protective against suicide.
In Arizona, Cwik is collaborating with the White Mountain Apache Tribe to help leaders there evaluate the impact of a comprehensive suicide surveillance system they created. So far, the program has reduced the overall Apache suicide rate by 38.3 % and the rate among young people ages 15 to 24 by 23%, according to the American Public Health Association.
Several tribal communities are attempting to implement a similar system in their communities, said Cwik.
Still, many tribal communities rely on limited mental health resources available through the Indian Health Service. One person at IHS is tasked with addressing suicide across almost 600 tribal nations.
Pamela End of Horn, a social worker and national suicide prevention consultant at IHS, said the Department of Veterans Affairs “has a suicide coordinator in every medical center across the U.S., plus case managers, and they have an entire office dedicated to suicide prevention. In Indian Health Service it is just me and that’s it.”

End of Horn, a member of the Oglala Lakota Sioux Tribe of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota, blames politics for the discrepancy.
“Tribal leaders are pushing for more suicide prevention programs but lack political investment. The VA has strong proactive activities related to suicide and the backing of political leaders and veterans’ groups,” she said.
It is also hard to get mental health professionals to work on remote reservations, while VA centers tend to be in larger cities.
Even if more mental health services were available, they can be stigmatizing, re-traumatizing, and culturally incongruent for Indigenous people.
Many states are using creative strategies to stop suicide. A pilot project by the Rural Behavioral Health Institute screened more than 1,000 students in 10 Montana schools from 2020 to 2022. The governor of Montana is hoping to use state money to expand mental health screening for all schools.
Experts say the kinds of strategies best suited to prevent suicide among Native Americans should deliver services that reflect their diversity, traditions, and cultural and language needs.
That’s what Robert Coberly, 44, was searching for when he needed help.
Coberly began having suicidal thoughts at 10 years old.
“I was scared to live and scared to die. I just didn’t care,” said Coberly, who is a member of the Tulalip Tribes.
He suffered in private for nearly a decade until he almost died in a car crash while driving drunk. After a stay at a rehabilitation center, Coberly remained stable. Years later, though, his suicidal thoughts came rushing back when one of his children died. He sought treatment at a behavioral health center where some of the therapists were Indigenous. They blended Western methodologies with Indigenous customs, which, he said, “I was craving and what I needed.”
Part of his therapy included going to a sweat lodge for ritual steam baths as a means of purification and prayer.

Coberly was a counselor for the Native and Strong Lifeline, the first 988 crisis line for Indigenous people. He is now one of the crisis line tribal resource specialists connecting Indigenous people from Washington state with the resources they need.
“It’s about time we had this line. To be able to connect people with resources and listen to them is something I can’t explain except that I was in a situation where I wanted someone to hear me and talk to,” said Coberly.
Amanda MorningStar said she still worries about her son night and day, but he tries to reassure her.
“I go to sleep and wake up the next day to keep it going,” Ben MorningStar said. “I only get one chance. I might as well make the best of it.”

XWBN3VMX0E_IIYIM6LZKCD7ULD,Supreme Court takes up appeal of Oklahoma death row inmate after state attorney general admitted mistakes,"By Devan Cole, CNN","3 minute read Updated 11:21 AM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240122,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/22/politics/supreme-court-takes-up-appeal-of-oklahoma-death-row-inmate-after-state-attorney-general-admitted-mistakes/,"The Supreme Court agreed on Monday to take up the extraordinary appeal of an Oklahoma death row inmate named Richard Glossip, a man who even the state attorney general said should not be executed.
Last May the justices halted the pending execution while legal challenges played out.
Glossip has endured 26 years behind bars, nine execution dates, three last meals and two independent investigations that raised serious doubts about his conviction.
“We are grateful that the court is providing Richard Glossip the opportunity to argue that Oklahoma should not be permitted to kill him,” Glossip’s attorney, John Mills, said in a statement. “The court should reverse the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals, which has inexplicably refused to accept the state’s confession of error.”
Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner F. Drummond told the Supreme Court that the state had recently made the “difficult decision” to confess error in Glossip’s case and supports vacating the conviction of Glossip. The move was an about-face and came after review of new information that had come to light related to prosecutorial misconduct at Glossip’s trial.
The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals refused however, to accept the confession of error and determined the execution should go forward.
“That decision cannot be the final word in this case,” Drummond told the justices. “The injustice of allowing a capital sentence to be caried out where the conviction was occasioned by the government’s own admitted failings would be nigh unfathomable,” Drummond told the court in court papers.
The case dates back to 1997 when Justin Sneed murdered Barry Van Treese, the owner of a motel in Oklahoma City. After his arrest, and in exchange for avoiding the death sentence, Sneed implicated Glossip, who was serving as the motel’s manager. Sneed admitted to killing Van Treese. But at trial, prosecutors portrayed the killing as a murder-for-hire plot orchestrated by Glossip. Sneed secured a deal to avoid the death penalty: Plead guilty and testify against Glossip, then a 35-year-old whose criminal record included a single traffic ticket, per his attorneys.
Glossip’s conviction, according to the state, hinged almost entirely on Sneed’s credibility. But the state recently learned that the prosecution failed to disclose evidence related to Sneed’s credibility and failed to correct testimony it knew to be false.
Specifically, the state failed to release records that disclosed that Sneed was treated for a serious psychiatric condition.
Van Treese family members believe the execution should go forward.
“The State deeply respects the victim’s family’s concerns about ensuring justice be done,” Drummond told the justices, “but Justice would not be served by moving forward with a capital sentence that the State can no longer defend because of prosecutorial misconduct and cumulative error.”
Lawyers for Glossip say they only obtained files this year that revealed that Sneed saw Oklahoma’s only psychiatrist who diagnosed him with bipolar disorder and prescribed lithium. At trial, Sneed testified that after he was arrested he had “asked for some Sudafed because I had a cold, but then shortly after that somehow they ended up giving me Lithium for some reason, I don’t know why, I never seen a psychiatrist or anything.”
There were no noted dissents on Monday, although Justice Neil Gorsuch is recused from the case, likely because he dealt with it in some form before he took his seat on the high court.

XY6AJC46H8_SR7P7N49C3FA2BY,Efforts to secure hostage deal and pause in Gaza fighting step up as Biden dispatches CIA chief for crucial talks in Europe,"By Kevin Liptak, Alex Marquardt and Becky Anderson, CNN","6 minute read Updated 10:30 PM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/26/politics/israel-hamas-hostage-talks-bill-burns-europe/,"Efforts to secure the release of hostages held in Gaza and broker a prolonged pause in fighting are at an important juncture as President Joe Biden deploys his point person on hostage talks to Europe for multiparty talks on the contours of a possible agreement.
CIA Director Bill Burns’ meetings over the coming days with the Israeli and Egyptian intelligence chiefs and the Qatari prime minister are a sign of ongoing progress as the White House presses for a deal.
Whether they prove decisive in striking an agreement remains to be seen, and officials voiced caution that discussions so far have been volatile, and that hurdles remain in coming to a deal that all sides can agree on.
Among the central sticking points: Israel has been adamant that it cannot agree to a permanent ceasefire in Gaza, which has been a key demand of Hamas. It’s unclear how that major difference would be resolved.
Still, progress has been made on the parameters of a hostage deal that would occur in three stages, and include the release of civilians, soldiers and the bodies of those hostages who have died while being held in captivity.
Burns’s meetings with Mossad director David Barnea, Egyptian intelligence director Abbas Kamel and Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani are expected to take place in France over the weekend, according to two sources familiar. The CIA declined to comment on his travel.
Burns and Barnea were central to a November agreement that resulted in a week-long pause in fighting in exchange for the release of more than 100 hostages.
The talks are the latest in a spate of recent diplomatic efforts to free the more than 100 remaining hostages while moving toward a more prolonged cessation of hostilities.  The flurry of activity amounts to the most intensive effort in months to strike an agreement that could significantly alter the trajectory of the war in Gaza.
Speaking from the White House on Friday afternoon, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby described the ongoing talks as productive but not yet reaching the point of success.
“We’re hopeful about the progress, but I do not expect – we should not expect – any imminent developments,” Kirby said.
He said on Friday, Biden had spoken to Egypt’s President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi as well as Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani to discuss ongoing hostage talks.
“We continue to do everything we can to facilitate another hostage deal just like we did back in November,” Kirby said.
A readout from the White House Friday said that Biden and Al Thani “affirmed that a hostage deal is central to establishing a prolonged humanitarian pause in the fighting and ensure additional life-saving humanitarian assistance reaches civilians in need throughout Gaza.”
Both leaders “underscored the urgency of the situation” in their conversation, the readout noted.
Kirby also said Brett McGurk, the White House coordinator for the Middle East, was returning to Washington on Friday from meetings in the region.
He described those talks as a “good set of discussions.”
“At every level, from the president right on down, we’re doing everything we can to bring these moms and dads, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters back home to their families,” Kirby said. “Our thoughts remain with them, of course their loved ones, as well as all of the innocent Palestinians that continue to be caught up in this war.”
Qatar’s prime minister is expected to travel to Washington next week, a diplomatic source told CNN. Qatar has acted as a key broker in talks with Hamas.
US officials are now hopeful for a much longer cessation in the fighting, believing it could provide space for more humanitarian aid to flow into Gaza as well as continued discussions about the future of Israel’s campaign against Hamas and the future of Gaza.
Qatar, Egypt and the US have been working toward trying to find common ground in proposals that were put forward several weeks ago by both Hamas and Israel, according to an official familiar with the ongoing discussions. In the past week, Qatar sent back ideas to each of them, including a time frame of a two-month ceasefire that would see hostages released in phases.
First to be released would be the remaining women, children and the elderly, followed by another phase that would include Israeli soldiers and the bodies of dead hostages.
In exchange, Palestinians held in Israeli jails would be released in around a three-for-one exchange, akin to the deal struck last year, a second source familiar with the matter said, who said the process would take around a month.
Each stage would come with a pause in fighting and the delivery of aid to the North and South of Gaza.
The major sticking point for Hamas has been Israel’s refusal to discuss an end to the war past a temporary ceasefire. Israel’s focus, the official said, has been to try to discuss one phase at a time – with accompanying pauses and prisoner releases - while Hamas has pushed for a comprehensive plan that would include Israel agreeing to end the war against Hamas.
As part of proposals currently being discussed, the end of the hostage release process would come with a permanent ceasefire, a step Israel has been unwilling to agree to.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his defense minister, Yoav Gallant, have said the war may continue for the rest of the year, if not into 2025. And Netanyahu has been increasingly public in his rejections of a Palestinian state, a priority item for Biden and the US.
The Biden administration has been openly pressuring Israel to transition to a lower-intensity phase of operations, including in telephone calls between Biden and Netanyahu.
Aside from the Biden administration’s own interest in seeing a half dozen Israeli-American hostages released, US officials see a ceasefire deal and hostage release as the key to getting to a significant pause in the fighting that will help the flow of humanitarian aid and allow Palestinians to return to their homes, many of which have been destroyed.
But with two key parties who have their own priorities, in addition to at least three main mediators, there is a complex array of ideas, proposals and initiatives being put forward.
“These things are very fluid, they change every single minute,” the official said.
Whether all parties can reach an agreement remains to be seen, and the talks will occur against the backdrop of renewed tensions between Israel and Qatar, sparked by leaked recording purported to be Netanyahu criticizing the Gulf state.
Burns and McGurk’s discussions with regional players come amid tensions between Israel and Qatar over a leaked recording said to be of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticizing Qatar.
On the recording, which aired on Israeli television, a voice purportedly Netanyahu’s describes Qatar as “problematic.” The speaker also says he is “very mad at the Americans” for renewing a lease on their military base in Qatar without extracting a concession on hostages from the country. CNN cannot verify that the voice on the leaked recording belongs to Benjamin Netanyahu.
Responding to the tape, Qatar said Netanyahu was undermining mediation efforts in the Israel-Hamas war.
The White House on Thursday reiterated its gratitude for Qatar — which has acted as a key mediator in hostage talks — in response to the leaked recording.
“Qatar is a key partner in the region. We’re grateful for their support of our continued efforts to try to get hostages out of Gaza and reunited with their families,” Kirby said in a statement Thursday evening.

XYJ65TOPH3_ALYH40VX5YWKIA9,"Only five bodies delivered to Belgorod morgue after mysterious Russian plane crash, Ukrainian intelligence suggests","By Victoria Butenko, Andrew Carey, Christian Edwards, Olga Voitovych and Radina Gigova, CNN","5 minute read Updated 7:54 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/25/europe/russian-plane-crash-belgorod-ukraine-intl/,"Ukraine says it has intelligence suggesting only five bodies were delivered from the crash site of a Russian military transport plane to a nearby morgue, a Ukraine military intelligence official told CNN, casting doubt on Moscow’s claim that dozens of Ukrainian prisoners of war were killed in the explosion.
Moscow and Kyiv gave conflicting accounts of how the Ilyushin Il-76 was downed Wednesday in Russia’s Belgorod region, which neighbors eastern Ukraine. Moscow says the plane was transporting Ukrainian prisoners of war, while Kyiv says it was carrying Russian missiles to be used in further strikes on Ukraine.
But the latest comments indicate Kyiv’s growing confidence that the IL-76 plane, which crashed Wednesday morning in the village of Yablonovo in Russia’s Belgorod region, may not have been carrying Ukrainian prisoners of war ahead of an exchange, as Moscow claimed.
Andriy Yusov, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence (DI), told CNN the number of bodies brought to the morgue matched the number of crew members on the plane. “No other bodies were detected,” he said.
Moscow claimed all 74 people on board – comprising six crew members, three military escorts and 65 Ukrainian servicemen – were killed in the crash. A Russian regional governor posted a list of names of the people he said made up the six-person crew.
Pressed by CNN to account for the discrepancy between the number of crew members Russian authorities said were on board and the number of bodies Ukrainian intelligence suggests had arrived at the morgue on Wednesday, Yusov said he stood by his initial comments.
Russia initially failed to produce visual evidence to back up its claims there were Ukrainian soldiers on the plane. The first video that emerged from the crash site, of which some was broadcast on Russia state media, appeared to show several dead bodies on the ground, but no images appeared to suggest there were dozens of fatalities.
The Russian Investigative Committee released a second video on Thursday, which they claim is from the crash site, and appears to show human remains in the snow.
The video shows investigators measuring what appears to be a bloody human hand and a dismembered arm. In separate clips, the video also shows aerial footage of the crash site and remnants of the plane. It is unclear if the human remains in the video are in the same location as the remnants of the plane.
CNN geolocated the two videos released by Russia’s Investigative Committee of the crash site, which matches the location of a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image taken by Umbra Space for CNN.
The plane came down in a field in rural Belgorod oblast, just north of the small village of Yablonovo, according to CNN’s analysis of videos and the SAR image.
The SAR image shows a sprawl of debris littering the crash site of the Il-76. The debris field is just under a mile long, and stretches about 800 feet at its widest point.
Moscow also accused Kyiv of downing the plane with an anti-aircraft missile system from Ukrainian territory, claiming the radar equipment of the Russian Aerospace Forces detected two Ukrainian missiles. Ukraine’s military command said it regarded Russian military aircraft approaching Belgorod as legitimate target, but did not confirm it had fired at the plane.
CNN is unable to independently verify the claims made by the two sides.
Both Moscow and Kyiv agree that a prisoner exchange had been planned for Wednesday, with the swap due to take place some 60 kilometers west of Belgorod city. Ukraine’s ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said Thursday in a televised interview that the swap was planned and the “representatives of our institution were present.”
But Yusov said Ukraine had not received notification that the prisoners would be flown into the region, rather than being transferred by road or rail. In the only other recent prisoner of war exchange, which happened earlier this month, Russia had sent a deconfliction alert to Ukraine to keep Belgorod’s airspace free, Yusov said, which Ukraine had observed.
Yusov also claimed that Russian IL-76 aircraft were often used to carry S-300 missiles to forward positions, and that Russia was restocking its missiles in Belgorod region after several waves of attacks on the nearby Ukrainian city of Kharkiv.
Yusov’s comments, which cast doubt on the account given by Moscow, echo similar remarks made overnight into Thursday by Mykola Oleschuk, commander of the Ukrainian air force. “Frantic Russian propaganda is directing a stream of fake information to an external audience in an attempt to discredit Ukraine in the eyes of the world community,” he said in a statement.
Lubinets also called Moscow’s unsubstantiated account “a vivid example of Russia planning an information campaign against Ukraine in advance.” He said he has sent official letters to the UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) asking whether they were informed by Russia about a transfer of prisoners of war by plane.
Ukraine’s Security Service (SBU) on Thursday launched a criminal investigation into the crash. The government communications body also urged for an international investigation into the incident, saying “there is no evidence that any Ukrainian citizens were killed on board” and that “Russian official statements cannot be trusted.”
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Thursday it is too soon to talk about instructions from Russian President Vladimir Putin regarding the military plane crash as an investigation is still underway.
He called the downing of the IL-76 an “absolutely monstrous act” since the plane was allegedly carrying Ukrainian servicemen “who should have been at home literally in a day.”

Y0ZJT3O14X_DQGBIJTFIW7JK1N,Alabama carries out first known execution with nitrogen gas in the US. Now the state’s AG expects more states to follow,"By Elizabeth Wolfe, Dakin Andone, Holly Yan and Caitlin Danaher, CNN","7 minute read Updated 6:58 PM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/26/us/alabama-execution-nitrogen-what-we-know/,"Alabama inmate Kenneth Smith was put to death Thursday night by nitrogen hypoxia, marking the nation’s first known execution using that method. Now Alabama’s attorney general wants to help other states interested in using the new form of capital punishment.
Smith, 58, was sentenced to death for his role in a 1988 murder-for-hire and had previously survived a failed attempt to execute him by lethal injection in 2022. His attorneys fought the execution until the end, ultimately losing a final appeal to the US Supreme Court on Thursday evening.
Smith’s legal team – alongside experts and advocates from the US to the United Nations – had voiced concern that nitrogen hypoxia could lead to excessive pain or even torture.
Alabama is one of only three states – Oklahoma and Mississippi being the others – to have approved the method, which is designed to replace oxygen in the body with a high concentration of nitrogen, causing death. So far, Alabama is the only state to have carried it out or even outlined a protocol on how to do it.
Here’s what we know about the historic execution:
After widespread discussion and speculation about how Smith’s execution would unfold, Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall told reporters on Friday, “What occurred last night was textbook.”

“As of last night, nitrogen hypoxia as a means of execution is no longer an untested method. It is a proven one. It’s the method that Kenneth Smith ultimately chose, along with 43 other death row inmates in our state,” Marshall said.
“I now suspect many states will follow.”
The attorney general had a message for colleagues across the country who were monitoring developments in the nation’s first execution using nitrogen hypoxia:
“Alabama has done it, and now so can you,” Marshall said. “And we stand ready to assist you in implementing this method in your states.”
As the procedure started Thursday evening at the William C. Holman Correctional Facility in Atmore, Smith was fitted with a mask, a device that would be used to administer the nitrogen.
The execution process began at 7:53 p.m. CT, and Smith was pronounced dead at 8:25 p.m., according to Alabama Department of Corrections officials.

Nitrogen flowed for about 15 minutes during the procedure, state corrections commissioner John Hamm said in a news conference.
Smith, who was on a gurney, appeared conscious for “several minutes into the execution,” and “shook and writhed” for about two minutes after that, media witnesses said in a joint report.
That was followed by several minutes of deep breathing before his breath began slowing “until it was no longer perceptible for media witnesses,” the media witnesses said.
When asked at the news conference about Smith shaking at the beginning of the execution, Hamm said Smith appeared to be holding his breath “for as long as he could” and may have also “struggled against his restraints.”
“There was some involuntary movement and some agonal breathing, so that was all expected and is in the side effects that we’ve seen and researched on nitrogen hypoxia,” Hamm said. “So nothing was out of the ordinary of what we were expecting.” Agonal breathing is an irregular, gasping breath pattern that can happen when someone is near death.

Smith’s spiritual adviser, the Rev. Jeff Hood, who’d previously expressed concern that the method could be inhumane, witnessed the execution and described it in more graphic terms, saying it was “the most horrible thing I’ve ever seen.”
Smith, wearing a tight-fitting mask that covered his entire face, convulsed when the gas was turned on, “popped up on the gurney” repeatedly, and gasped, heaved and spat, Hood said.
“It was absolutely horrific,” he said.
Smith made a lengthy statement in front of the witnesses before the execution started, according to the pool reporters.
“Tonight, Alabama caused humanity to take a step backward,” Smith said in part, according to the reporters. “I’m leaving with love, peace and light. Thank you for supporting me. Love all of you.”
Smith “made a ‘I love you’ sign in sign language with one of his hands that was facing the room where his family was witnessing,” the journalists’ joint report said.
It’s unclear exactly how long it took for Smith to die.
During lethal injections, the nation’s most common execution method, the time it takes for an inmate to die varies widely depending on the drugs used, number of injections and individual inmates’ reactions.
In a typical three-injection protocol, a person can die as quickly as 30 to 60 seconds after the final fatal injection, experts say. But the process does not always go as outlined. In 2014, for example, an Oklahoma inmate had an apparent heart attack 43 minutes after receiving the first injection, according to state documents and witnesses.
A tense debate has unfolded about whether America’s new execution method is humane and whether the procedure would cause undue pain.
In theory, the method involves replacing the air breathed by an inmate with 100% nitrogen, depriving the body of oxygen.

Proponents argue the process should be painless, citing nitrogen’s role in deadly industrial accidents or suicides, and the state indicated in court records that it believes nitrogen hypoxia is “perhaps the most humane method of execution ever devised.”
Others have been skeptical, fearing the method could go awry and voicing concerns that the state’s plan up until Thursday had been shrouded in secrecy. The protocol published by the state contained several redactions experts said shielded key details from public scrutiny.
The White House said Smith’s execution by nitrogen gas was “troubling” to the administration.
Press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters the death by the new method underscored President Joe Biden’s belief in a moratorium on the federal death penalty.
“The president has long said, and had deep, deep concerns, with how the death penalty’s implemented and whether it’s consistent with our values,” Jean-Pierre said.
Criticism of Alabama’s new death penalty method has spread globally. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Turk, said the death penalty is “inconsistent with the fundamental right to life” and called for its “universal abolition.”
“I deeply regret the execution of Kenneth Eugene Smith in Alabama despite serious concerns this novel and untested method of suffocation by nitrogen gas may amount to torture, or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment,” Turk said in a statement Friday.
The European Union described the new method of execution as “a particularly cruel and unusual punishment” and also called for universal abolition of the death penalty, spokesperson Peter Stano said in a statement Friday.
In recent years, many states that still allow the death penalty have had difficulty obtaining necessary ingredients for lethal injections after European manufacturers refused to sell drugs to the US that would be used in executions.
Stano said the EU welcomed “the fact that 29 US states have either abolished capital punishment or imposed a moratorium on executions.”
The family of Smith’s victim, Elizabeth Sennett, said the execution is “bittersweet” – a final act of justice for the woman killed more than three decades ago.
Sennett was murdered in 1988 after her husband hired someone who hired two others, including Smith, to kill his wife and make it look like a burglary, court records show. The husband, minister Charles Sennett, was having an affair and had taken out an insurance policy on his wife, the records say.
“Nothing that happened here today is going to bring mom back,” said Sennett’s son, Michael, after the execution. But, he added, “we’re glad this day is over.”
Elizabeth Sennett’s sons told CNN earlier Thursday they felt it was time for Smith’s sentence to be carried out, adding they believed their mother had been overlooked due to the focus on the execution method.
“What’s going on is overshadowing what’s actually happened,” Chuck Sennett, said. “He’s gotta pay the price for what he done to our mother,” who should be remembered “as a loving, caring woman.” The brothers were in their 20s when their mother was killed.
The family has forgiven everyone involved in the killing, including Smith, Michael Sennett said at a news conference Thursday night.
“His debt was paid tonight,” the son said.

Y1ZILUOINA_W5CUXZTPF1O1OUU,Sofia Richie Grainge announces pregnancy with ‘Vogue’ photoshoot,"By Alex Rees, CNN","3 minute read Published 5:45 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/25/style/sofia-richie-grainge-pregnant-vogue/,"For young celebrities in the public eye today, many of life’s milestones are accompanied by a glossy magazine feature — or perhaps a carefully-staged paparazzi shoot, depending on the narrative at hand.
It could be the announcement of a new professional venture or personal success; a “revenge body” reveal if there’s a failed relationship to bounce back from or a wedding dress reveal if love — and luxe confetti — is in the air. And then, of course, there’s the time-honored tradition of the fashion shoot-meets-baby-bump-debut.
Sofia Richie Grainge is the latest star to partake in this trend, with a “Vogue” spread released Thursday featuring her in bump-baring shirts, tank tops and even some loose tailoring as a means of confirming her first pregnancy.
(Richie Grainge and her husband, the music executive Elliot Grainge, were married last April in a ceremony which was also splashed across “Vogue.”)
Richie Grainge told “Vogue” she learned of her pregnancy after a whirlwind trip to Milan Fashion Week last fall, when it turned out what she first thought to be jet-lag was an early bout of morning sickness.
“I told everyone that I had bought them a gift from Milan,” the fashion influencer told the magazine of how she and Grainge then hid her positive pregnancy tests in designer gift boxes. “That’s how we told all of our parents. Watching their reaction go from like, ‘I’m about to get an expensive present’ to like ‘I’m about to get a grandchild’ was really sweet.”
‘My body is doing incredible things right now.’ Rihanna is resplendent on Vogue’s May cover
“I’ve learned more in the past six months than I have in my entire life,” Richie Grainge continued, confirming that her baby — a girl — will be due in the late spring. “And also just like what the female body is capable of. Every week brings new things, whether it’s hormonal shifts or expansion — there’s just so much our bodies go through, and it’s so interesting to experience it all.”
Having kept her news among close family and friends until today, Richie Grainge acknowledged stepping back from the social media platforms where her “It girl” aesthetic is widely-followed (and widely-envied) during the early stages of her pregnancy. That was a conscious choice, she said: “I’m definitely not posting as much. It’s been hard for me to have that connection with my followers when I can’t really be honest,” she explained.
And while she will be back in their feeds moving forward, it will be with some new boundaries in mind. “I’m not going to publicize my child on Instagram,” Richie Grainge said. “I don’t plan to take that approach because I want my kid to have the option to do what she wants with her life. If she wants to be a private person, I want her to be able to make that choice.”"
Y3GV7A28SR_FJ8YR79QXCCA5HN,US and UK carry out additional strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen,"By Natasha Bertrand and Oren Liebermann, CNN","6 minute read Updated 5:44 AM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/22/politics/us-uk-strikes-yemen-iraq/,"The US and UK carried out additional strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen on Monday, marking the eighth round of attacks by the US military on the rebels’ infrastructure in just over 10 days, according to a joint statement.
They struck eight sites, according to the statement from the US and UK, which conducted the strikes, and Canada, the Netherlands, Bahrain, and Australia, which supported the attacks.
The latest strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen were “successful” and destroyed missiles, weapons storage sites and drone systems, according to a senior military official and a senior defense official.
The officials, who briefed reporters following the Monday afternoon operation, said the strikes “achieved the desired effect.”
It was a smaller number than the first joint operation on January 11 that struck over 30 Houthi targets. Monday’s strikes targeted a Houthi underground storage site and sites associates with Houthi missile and air surveillance, the statement added.
The US used fighter jets from the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, as well as surface vessels and a submarine to strike eight locations, the senior military official said. In all, the official said approximately 25-30 precision guided munitions were fired at the targets, including Tomahawk cruise missiles.
President Joe Biden spoke to his British counterpart UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Monday, the White House said earlier in the day, about a range of topics including security in the Red Sea.
“Our aim remains to de-escalate tensions and restore stability in the Red Sea, but let us reiterate our warning to Houthi leadership: we will not hesitate to defend lives and the free flow of commerce in one of the world’s most critical waterways in the face of continued threats,” the countries said in their statement.
For the first time, the US also struck an underground storage facility used by the Houthis, the official said. The storage site was assessed to have “more advanced conventional weaponry,” including missiles and one-way attack drones.
Grant Shapps, the UK’s secretary of state for defense, said four British Typhoon fighter jets took part in the strikes on Houthi targets. He warned that the ongoing Houthi launches against commercial vessels “threaten the lives of sailors and disrupt shipping at an intolerable cost to the global economy.”
Following the latest round of US and UK airstrikes in Yemen on Monday, Houthi leader Mohamed Ali al-Houthi said the strikes would only strengthen the Yemeni people.
“Your strikes will only make the Yemeni people stronger and more determined to confront you, as you are the aggressors against our country,” he said in a statement posted on X.
The rebel group said the US and the UK launched 18 airstrikes on four governorates Monday night.
CNN reported on Monday that the US has named the ongoing operation to target Houthi assets in Yemen “Operation Poseidon Archer,” suggesting a more organized and potentially long-term approach to the operations in Yemen that have been aimed at deterring the Iranian-backed group from attacking commercial vessels in the Red Sea.
The US has now struck Houthi targets in Yemen eight times since January 11, the majority of which the US military has carried out unilaterally. The first wave of strikes, in which the US and UK hit approximately 30 sites across Houthi-controlled Yemen, marked the beginning of Operation Poseidon Archer, one official said.
The attacks have targeted the Houthis’ one-way attack drones, anti-ship ballistic missiles, anti-ship cruise missiles and more as the US has tried to disrupt the group’s ability to fire on international shipping lanes.
In an attempt to avoid escalation, the officials said the latest strikes were specifically intended to target the Houthi weapons and supporting capabilities used to target international shipping lanes, describing them as similar in nature to the first round of coalition strikes against Houthi targets on January 11.
“We are not at this time expanding beyond that target set,” the senior military official said.
Deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh said on Monday that the Houthis had not launched a new attack on commercial shipping since January 18. The Houthis claimed on Monday to have attacked a US-owned cargo ship, the M/V Ocean Jazz, but a defense official told CNN that claim was not true.
Iran has been quietly fueling the attacks, US officials have said, enabling and supporting its proxy groups across the region. Tehran has been supplying the Houthis with tactical intelligence and weapons to help them target ships in the Red Sea, CNN previously reported. Iran has also continued to supply its proxy groups in Iraq and Syria, where US and coalition forces have come under attack over 150 times since October 17.
On Saturday, Iranian proxy militias launched one of their largest ballistic missile attacks since October on al-Asad airbase in Iraq, leaving two US service members with traumatic brain injuries, Singh said on Monday.
Biden acknowledged on Thursday that the US strikes were not stopping the Houthis, who have continued to target, and in some cases hit, US-owned commercial vessels operating off the coast of Yemen.
But Biden said the US airstrikes would continue, anyway. And Singh said on Monday that it would ultimately be up to the Houthis and the Iranian proxy groups when to end their attacks.
Singh said last week that the Pentagon’s initial assessments are that the strikes against the Houthis have been “very successful” in destroying “pretty much all of the targets that we hit,” leaving one less missile or capability that the Houthis can then deploy in the Red Sea.
The Houthis have said that they won’t stop their attacks until the war between Israel and Hamas inside Gaza comes to an end. Houthi leader Abdul Malek al-Houthi said in a speech on Thursday that it is “a great honor and blessing to be confronting America directly.”
Last week, the US Navy intercepted a vessel off the coast of Somalia destined for Houthi-controlled parts of Yemen that was carrying Iranian-made missile components, Central Command announced in a statement. That operation resulted in the deaths of two Navy SEALs who fell overboard while attempting to board the boat, CENTCOM said.
The US also carried out all of its strikes on Houthi targets last week unilaterally, in contrast to the coalition of countries that supported the first round of joint US and UK strikes on the Houthis on January 11.
Singh said on Thursday that future joint action wasn’t off the table, but that CENTCOM Commander Gen. Erik Kurilla had the authority to order strikes when he deemed it necessary to protect ships in the region, including US Naval assets stationed in the Red Sea. After each of the strikes the US conducted against the Houthis last week, CENTCOM said that the missiles the US destroyed were being prepared for imminent launch by the Houthis.
National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby told reporters on Thursday that the administration is “making it harder” for the Houthis to continue their attacks with each strike on their infrastructure. And he noted that the administration has “additional options” available to it if the Houthis don’t stop. But he declined to preview what those options might look like.
“I’m not going to telegraph punches one way or another, except to say what the president said this morning– that if the Houthis continue to go down this path, we will continue to do what we can to disrupt and degrade their ability to make those choices,” he said.
“We’re not looking for a conflict with the Houthis, we’re not looking for a conflict in the region,” he added. “But we have to be able to act in our own self-defense, not just for our ships and our sailors, but for merchant ships and merchant sailors and international shipping in the Red Sea.”

Y6HSNEL87E_6BLJ24HH3CRUF0F,Opinion: Three ways to help millennials overcome the cost of living crisis,Opinion by Jill Filipovic,"8 minute read Published 2:26 PM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240122,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/22/opinions/millennials-cost-of-living-crisis-filipovic/,"Editor’s Note: Jill Filipovic is a journalist based in New York and author of the book “OK Boomer, Let’s Talk: How My Generation Got Left Behind.” Follow her on Twitter. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely her own. View more opinion on CNN.
Millennials, as you’ve have probably heard, have gotten pretty screwed.
By some accounts, we’re the most educated generation in American history, but also underwater with educational debt. We haven’t amassed the kind of wealth our parents had at our age, and it’s unclear whether we’ll ever catch up. We’ve been slower to purchase homes in part because Baby Boomers won’t sell theirs, and so we’re throwing our hard-earned cash away on skyrocketing rents, which in turn puts saving for a 20% down payment further out of reach. We’re so financially stressed that we can’t afford to have kids, and by staying childless we’re breaking our Boomer parents’ hearts.
I wrote an entire book on the plight of Millennials, on the many advantages Boomers enjoyed and then hoarded for themselves, and what Boomers and Millennials alike don’t understand about each other. There is much doom and gloom to be found in nearly all of the reporting about Millennial life, and things aren’t looking much better for Gen Z and younger generations. But there are also tremendous opportunities. American Boomers enjoyed unprecedented wealth and opportunity not just out of sheer luck or even sheer numbers, but because the government made unprecedented investments in them: in their education, in their health, in their ability to live independently.
Our country could do the same for Millennials. It may, frankly, be too little, too late for many of us. But it could ensure that the Millennial generation is an unfortunate aberration, and that future generations return to a path of prosperity and upward mobility.
The “how to fix it” list could itself fill an entire book. But here are three priorities:
One of the more troubling shifts of the past American decade has been the broad loss of faith in higher education. While 74% of young adults a decade ago agreed that a college degree is very important, only 41% say the same today. Nearly half of Gen Zers say that a high school diploma or GED is sufficient to ensure financial security. And they were the least likely among generations to say that colleges and universities are having a positive effect “on the way things are going in this country today.”
Perhaps unsurprisingly, a smaller proportion of high schoolers are continuing on to college. It’s a decline not seen around the rest of the developed world, where higher education is expanding. At its core, this uniquely American rejection of higher education seems to be about value: Given all we’ve heard about how even well-educated Millennials struggle financially, the price tag on a degree in the US just doesn’t seem worth it.
The truth is, of course, more complicated. A college degree does mean, on average, significantly better wages, and graduates of elite universities do best of all. Those higher wages, though, can be offset by debt. And people who take out loans to go to college but don’t graduate see the worst of both worlds: lower wages and higher debt.
Related article What broke the American Dream for Millennials
Jobs that require a college degree are also likely to remain higher-paying, while those that do not seem to be in a race to the wage bottom. Life for Americans without a college degree has become more perilous by a range of measures: This is the group most likely to perish from “deaths of despair” and to live in communities rife with alcoholism, substance abuse and financial struggle. And American economic growth and global competitiveness both require a workforce with plenty of college graduates.
This is not a problem that one-time student loan forgiveness is going to solve. We need massive state and federal investment in education: in higher education, to make college much more affordable, and in K-12 education, to ensure that where a child grows up doesn’t limit her prospects for college and beyond. The federal government needs to regulate the student loan industry and end the proliferation of predatory and exploitative for-profit educational institutions. Not every student needs to go to an Ivy League school, but every student should have access to an affordable, high-quality four-year education near their homes.
This is largely a solved problem across Europe. We could make it happen here in the US, too. Doing so would benefit young adults, of course, who could graduate without the weight of five- or six-figure debt weighing them down from the start. But it would also benefit the nation as a whole, equipping us with a more sophisticated workforce better prepared for the technological evolutions of the coming decades.
From my vantage point, the single highest barrier to Millennial economic stability is child care. Millennials are now squarely within childbearing age, and while many of us are forgoing children, most of us are or will be parents – but we’re having fewer children than women of previous generations, and we’re having them later. The reasons behind that are complex, but cost is certainly among them: The United States has some of the highest child care costs in the world.
And that isn’t because American kids are getting better-than-average care; it’s because our government simply doesn’t invest in it. The US government spends, on average, $500 per child per year on early childhood care costs. The average spent among OECD countries is $14,436.
Affordable, high-quality, universal child care helps mothers, and particularly low-income mothers, to stay in the workforce, which pays dividends for their families. Child care programs help to prepare kids for school and may keep them more active and socially engaged. As it stands, screens have become a stopgap measure for poor families, with kids in low-income households spending many more hours looking at them than kids in more affluent ones – something that was exacerbated during the pandemic.
Related article Boomers won’t part with their homes, and that’s a problem for young families
Social conservatives often prefer that mothers leave the labor force and stay home with their children, which is one reason there has been such broad resistance to universal child care on the American right. The demand that women stay home seems to be based more on nostalgia and gender traditionalism than evidence, of which there’s plenty, that working mothers bring significant benefits to their children, to themselves and to national economies.
The reality, for many American families, isn’t a well-paid dad who can support a family on a single income and a mom whose primary aspiration is to dedicate herself to raising children, were it not for manipulative feminists and scheming liberals who pressure her into the workforce. Much more often, reality is a complicated mix of mothers who want many sources of purpose and gratification, as well as the freedom and pride that financial independence brings; couples who need two incomes in order to raise their children in financial stability; and single moms who are the only person bringing home the bacon.
All of these groups would benefit hugely from free or affordable child care. It would radically decrease the stress American parents live under, it would enable parents to provide a higher standard of living for their children and it would give children a leg up.
It might also make having a child, or having an additional child, feel possible for a greater number of young people.
America’s housing system is broken, and not just because so many Millennials can’t afford homes. Millennials drove re-urbanization as many of us graduated college and moved to cities instead of returning to the small towns or suburban enclaves in which we were raised. But those cities simply don’t have enough housing units, especially affordable rentals for low-income people or starter homes (and even starter apartments) for those taking a big step into adult life. This housing shortage has expanded out into the suburbs and even rural areas.
This wasn’t the case for Boomers, in large part because the government invested in a massive expansion of housing stock during their early years. The federal government could do the same now, expanding tax credits and voucher programs. Cities could embrace growth and build, and tax homeowners who do not live in or rent out their units. States could expand aid to first-time homebuyers, ideally lowering closing costs for real estate purchases and making that so-hard-to-amass 20% down payment more doable.

And this is very pie-in-the-sky, but the US is far overdue for a total overhaul in property taxation. We are vastly over-reliant on property taxes for government revenue, which poses a big problem for homeowners who are just scraping by, as well as for retirees who may have paid off their homes but still owe a hefty tax bill every year. Property tax costs are inevitably passed down to renters, who also wind up paying more. And local property taxes, in turn, contribute to wildly unequal funding schemes for public schools, the outcome of which is that the kids in the richest enclaves also enjoy the best public educations — better-paid teachers, nicer facilities, smaller classes, updated textbooks, advanced science equipment, college and mental health counselors — while kids in poorer areas receive far less investment and far fewer educational resources.
This, too, hurts young families, who may spend beyond their means to get their kids in to a decent school district, or who see their children’s opportunities drastically diminished simply because a parent doesn’t make enough to move to a tony neighborhood. And it hurts children, who are, after all, future adults, keeping those who already come from challenging backgrounds at an even greater disadvantage, while giving the best-off an additional leg up. That’s fuel for growing inequality, and a compounding of the problems Millennials face for future generations.
There is much more than should be — could be, must be — done to help Millennials and the generations after us achieve the American dream (or at least financial stability). But there’s no time to waste. The oldest Millennials are in our early 40s, and the window to improve our future is rapidly narrowing. We may indeed wind up left behind. But the US can also refuse to repeat these mistakes and instead choose to invest in something better for the generations that come next."

Vergara, who is currently starring as Colombian drug lord Griselda Blanco in Netflix’s “Griselda,” has intentionally sought characters where her accent is an asset.
“I’m always looking for characters because there’s not much that I can play with this stupid accent,” she told The Los Angeles Times. “I can’t play a scientist or be in ‘Schindler’s List.’ My acting jobs are kind of limited.”
It was after she watched the 2006 documentary “Cocaine Cowboys,” that Vergara said she first got the idea of playing Blanco. She joined “Modern Family” in 2009, but kept Blanco in the back of her mind over the years, periodically studying her.
“I read every single book, every single article, every new note on the internet that came out,” Vergara told the publication. “For many years, I read and read and read.”
Blanco, known as La Madrina ( Godmother) and La Viuda Negra (Black Widow), ran a cocaine ring before she was fatally shot in Medellín in 2012 at age 69.
“Griselda” is now streaming on Netflix."

The lone survivor of Tuesday morning’s crash was initially taken to Fort Smith Health Centre and then transported by medevac to Stanton Territorial Hospital in Yellowknife, the Northwest Territories Coroner Service said in a statement. The survivor’s condition was not publicly released.
The plane was “en route from Fort Smith to the Diavik Diamond Mine” when the crash happened, the coroner’s office said. The global mining company Rio Tinto said it had employees on the aircraft.
“We have been informed by authorities that a plane on its way to our Diavik mine, carrying a number of our people, crashed near Fort Smith, Northwest Territories, Canada, resulting in fatalities,” the company said in a statement Wednesday.
Fort Smith is on the border with Alberta.

“As a company we are absolutely devastated by this news and offering our full support to our people and the community who are grieving today,” Rio Tinto Chief Executive Jakob Stausholm said in the statement. “We are working closely with authorities and will help in any way we can with their efforts to find out exactly what has happened.”
CNN has reached out to Rio Tinto for more information.
The Northwest Territories Coroner Service said its representatives are working with local authorities to access the crash site and start the recovery process.
“The NWT Coroner Service would like to express our condolences to the families and community of Fort Smith during this very tragic and difficult time,” the statement said.
On Tuesday morning, the Canadian Rangers and the Royal Canadian Air Force responded to a report of lost contact with an aircraft outside of Fort Smith, an RCAF spokesperson in Winnipeg, David Lavallee, told CNN Canada news partner CBC News.
Visibility was poor during the early hours Tuesday morning but improved by around 10 a.m., according to CNN’s weather team.
The Fort Smith Health Centre activated its mass casualty protocol around 8:50 a.m. on Tuesday, according to the Northwest Territories Health and Social Services Authority.

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the Canadian Rangers and the Royal Canadian Air Force also responded. Investigators with the Transportation Safety Board were also sent to Fort Smith following the crash.
The aircraft involved is a British Aerospace Jetstream registered to Northwestern Air Lease, according to the Transportation Safety Board of Canada, which said it is investigating the crash. The aircraft can carry up to 19 passengers, according to Northwestern Air Lease’s website.
The coroner’s office said the two crew members worked for Northwestern Air Lease. CNN has reached out to Northwestern Air Lease for comment.
R.J. Simpson, the premier of the Northwest Territories, released a statement extending his condolences to the families, friends and loved ones of those who were aboard the airplane. He also encouraged affected residents to seek support and use mental health resources provided by the government.
“The impact of this incident is felt across the territory,” Simpson said. “The people we lost were not just passengers on a flight; they were neighbors, colleagues, friends, and loved ones. Their stories and contributions to our communities will not be forgotten.”

YBAF8XR5C0_08XBFJ6T0FEJTSZ,Groundwater levels are rapidly declining around the world — with a few notable exceptions,"By Katie Hunt, CNN","3 minute read Updated 8:27 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/24/climate/groundwater-global-study-scn/,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.
Many parts of the world are experiencing a rapid depletion in the subterranean reserves of water that billions of people rely on for drinking, irrigation and other uses, according to new research that analyzed millions of groundwater level measurements from 170,000 wells in more than 40 countries.
It’s the first study to piece together what’s happening to groundwater levels at a global scale, according to the researchers involved, and will help scientists better understand what impact humans are having on this valuable underground resource, either through overuse or indirectly by changes in rainfall linked to climate change.
Groundwater, contained within cracks and pores in permeable bodies of rock known as aquifers, is a lifeline for people especially in parts of the world where rainfall and surface water are scarce, such as northwest India and the southwest United States.
Reductions in groundwater can make it harder for people to access freshwater to drink or to irrigate crops and can result in land subsidence.
“This study was driven by curiosity. We wanted to better understand the state of global groundwater by wrangling millions of groundwater level measurements,” said co-lead author Debra Perrone, an associate professor in University of California’s Santa Barbara’s Environmental Studies Program, in a news release on the study that published in the journal Nature on Wednesday.

The authors found that groundwater levels declined between 2000 and 2022 in 71% of the 1,693 aquifer systems included in the research, with groundwater levels declining more than 0.1 meter a year in 36%, or 617, of them.
The Ascoy-Soplamo Aquifer in Spain had the fastest rate of decline in the data they compiled — a median decline of 2.95 meters per year, said study coauthor Scott Jasechko, an associate professor at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at University of California Santa Barbara.
Several aquifer systems in Iran were among those with the fastest rate of groundwater decline, he added.
The team wasn’t able to gather data from much of Africa, South America and southeast Asia because of a lack of monitoring, but Jasechko said the study included the countries where most global groundwater pumping takes place.
The study also highlighted some success stories in Bangkok, Arizona and New Mexico, where groundwater has begun to recover after interventions to better regulate water use or redirect water to replenish depleted aquifers.
“I was impressed by the clever strategies that have been put into action to address groundwater depletion in several places, though these ‘good news’ stories are very rare,” Jasechko said via email.
To understand whether the declines seen in the 21st century were accelerating, the team also accessed data for groundwater levels for 1980 to 2000 for 542 of the aquifers in the study.
They found that declines in groundwater levels sped up in the first two decades of the 21st century for 30% of those aquifers, outpacing the declines recorded between 1980 and 2000.
“These cases of accelerating groundwater-level declines are more than twice as prevalent as one would expect from random fluctuations in the absence of any systematic trends in either time period,” the study noted.
Donald John MacAllister, a hydrologist at the British Geological Survey who wasn’t involved in the research, said it was a really “impressive” set of data, despite some gaps.
“I think it’s fair to say this global compilation of groundwater data hasn’t been done, certainly on this scale, at least to my knowledge before,” he said.
“Groundwater is an incredibly important resource but one of the challenges is… because we can’t see it, it’s out of mind for most people.

Now they’re even worse,"By Francesca Street, CNN","11 minute read Published 8:11 AM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/unruly-airplane-passengers-post-pandemic-problem/,"Passenger Philip Baum recently experienced one of the most uncomfortable flights of his life.
To Baum, it was obvious his seatmate, a stranger, was drunk. Flight crew, he says, “denied him alcohol.”
“But in front of me, he managed to sneak more alcohol off the trolley,” Baum recalls.
For Baum, who was seated in the economy cabin, being in such close proximity to the “unruly” passenger for multiple hours wasn’t pleasant.
“I actually thought I’d throw up,” he tells CNN Travel. “The guy pulled out his nails. He was bleeding. He stank, and he was blind drunk.”
Moreover, Baum was worried the passenger, who didn’t seem fully in control, “was going to completely lose it” at any moment.
“In the end, I spent about four hours talking to him and calming him down,” Baum recalls.
Throughout the flight, Baum felt himself working hard to control his own reaction to the situation. He felt, at several points, on the precipice of giving in to his own anger and frustration.
“The only reason I didn’t become unruly was because I thought, ‘Philip, you know better. You can’t suddenly become unruly,’” he says.
Baum is an aviation security expert, the founder of DISPAX World, the international conference on Unruly Airline Passenger Management and Restraint.
Given his background, Baum found himself wondering – only half-jokingly – whether the whole incident was some kind of “test.”
Pre-pandemic, statistics recorded by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) indicated unruly airplane passengers were on the rise. Discussions about the issue were ramping up, with the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) launching its #notonmyflight initiative in 2019, aiming to increase passenger awareness.
During the peak Covid years, fewer flights didn’t equal fewer problems – at least not in the US, where reported incidents ballooned. In early 2021, Federal Aviation Authority data reached what an FAA spokesperson tells CNN Travel was “record highs,” with many altercations based around the then-mandated face mask rule. As American flight attendant Susannah Carr told CNN Travel that year: “I come in expecting to have a passenger that could potentially get violent.”
Reported incidents in the US have since fallen, but remain notably higher than pre-pandemic levels. IATA and FAA data can only tell us so much (not every airline that’s part of IATA submits data, while not every airline records every instance of unruly behavior) but the conversation around disruptive passengers remains heated.
As incidents regularly hit the headlines (including passengers sliding down the evacuation slide, hitting and biting flight attendants and forcing aircraft to divert from their intended destination, to name but a few) aviation authorities are clamping down, flight attendants are speaking up and aviation experts are questioning how we got here, and whether we can change the tide.
IATA classifies unruly behavior incidents into four levels. Level 1 is “minor” (IATA’s “Cabin Operations Safety Best Practice Manual” suggests this could be argumentative behavior or non-compliance with safety regulations). Level 2 is “moderate” (physically aggressive behavior, for example). Level 3 is “serious” (i.e. dangerous behavior, an “intent or threat to injure,” as IATA puts it). Level 4 is “flight deck breach” (which IATA classifies as “credible threat of death).
The latest available IATA data, from 2022, indicates most disruptive passenger incidents involved non-compliance, verbal abuse and intoxication. These incidents are less extreme, but are still seen as potentially detrimental to flight safety.
In a 2023 document called “Even safer and more enjoyable air travel for all: A strategy for reducing unruly and disruptive passenger incidents,” IATA states that while “only a tiny minority” of passengers behave badly, these travelers “have a disproportionate impact.”
Incidents could “threaten the safety and security of the aircraft, other passengers, and crew,” says IATA. There’s also the mental health impact on crew and passengers, and increased likelihood of inconvenient diversions, delays or cancellations.
Unruly passengers, “can compromise the ability for cabin crew to undertake their safety duties,” former flight attendant Liz Simmons, who flew for 17 years, tells CNN Travel.
Simmons, who is Australian, is now working on a PhD examining the physical and psychosocial well-being of cabin crew in Oceania, and how that intersects with performance and safety behaviors.
Simmons says disruptive passenger incidents can cause “physical, emotional or psychological injury,” for flight attendants and other passengers alike.

Of the 5,981 unruly passenger incidents reported to the FAA in 2021, 4,290 were face mask-related.
It’s not surprising then, that as the pandemic waned and mask mandates were lifted, aviation workers and officials alike assumed the situation would improve.
European flight attendant Kris Major, who sits in groups within the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) recalls conversations about pandemic bad behavior being “kind of a blip” and assumptions that they’d quickly be a “bounceback.”
Short answer, there wasn’t. The pandemic, as former Japan Airlines flight attendant Mizuki Urano puts it, was a “turning point.”
John Franklin, head of safety promotion at EASA, tells CNN Travel he believes the uptick in unruly passenger behavior correlates with a more general societal behavior shift that’s taken place in the last couple of years.
“It has become clear that the increase in unruly passenger behavior matches what police see in general society since the Covid pandemic,” says Franklin, who says EASA’s been discussing the rise of disruptive behavior with European law enforcement.
People behaving badly in public spaces is a conversation that’s taken place beyond the aviation industry. In the UK, for example, there’s been an increase in what performing arts union Bectu calls “extreme anti-social behavior” among theater goers. Meanwhile, 2023 saw a slew of reports of tourists behaving badly across the globe – damaging heritage sites, eating endangered species and stealing.
Aviation psychologist Aleksandra Kapela posits that “prolonged online work and limited social interactions” might have impacted our “comfort levels in close spaces, such as airplanes.”
Kapela also attributes the increase in unruly passenger behavior to some “now viewing travel as both a right and a privilege after enduring uncertainty and restrictions.”
That outlook brings “heightened expectations to their journeys,” Kapela tells CNN Travel.
Anti-social behavior has negative impacts in any setting, but as IATA notes, “behaviors which some people may deem to be acceptable on the ground take on a completely different complexion in the confines of an aircraft traveling at 500 miles per hour six miles above the ground.”

During the pandemic years, airlines and airports furloughed staff. Many didn’t return. Then, when international air travel started to ramp up, restaffing quickly proved tricky.
It’s a vicious circle, suggests flight attendant Kris Major. Staffing issues, he says, are behind several general issues with the aviation industry right now – “flight delays, cancellations” – and such problems can also be the source of passenger tension and lead to unruly incidents.
Fewer staff, says Major, also means less “vigilance in the terminals” – meaning it’s harder for ground crews to spot and weed out a potential disruptive passenger.
Newly hired staff and cabin crew also bring less experience to the table. Former flight attendant Simmons suggests that no matter how good training might be, experience is often integral in handling unruly passenger incidents.
And while practical training – on how to restrain passengers, for example, and self defense – is mandatory for flight attendants, Simmons says “emotional intelligence” is one of the key skills needed by cabin crew.
Human skills are part of the training programs, but they’re often honed on the job.
“Time and exposure makes for a better diffuser,” she says. “We’re trained on the ground, but then you go into the air and everything you encounter on a daily basis could be considered on the job training as well.”
In recent years, airlines and airports have also increasingly relied on automated processes – think self check-in, automated gates. DISPAX World organizer Philip Baum says automation “dehumanizes the whole experience” of flying.
Passengers may not directly interact face-to-face with another person until they’re at the gate or boarding the aircraft. When they finally do, air rage hits.
“The passenger could be carrying all types of grievances about the booking process, the security screening – something may have happened in their life – and it’s just that buildup of anxiety and anger that compounds with other issues,” says Simmons.

Bearing the brunt of disruptive passenger incidents places “a significant emotional burden” on cabin crew, as aviation psychologist Kapela puts it.
“Their already demanding job, focused on ensuring safety, becomes even more challenging when dealing with disruptive passengers.”
There’s also a knock-on impact on other passengers, who could follow in the disruptive passenger’s footsteps – a potential that crossed Philip Baum’s mind when he was seated next to a drunk passenger and actively worked to control his own frustrations.
There’s also the potential physical and emotional threat to aviation workers – as evidenced in the news reports of flight attendants at the receiving end of violence – and other passengers.
At the 2023 iteration of DISPAX World – Baum’s conference on unruly passenger behavior – presenter Polly Hilmarsdóttir, from Icelandair, said the airline’s ground staff are instructed, when they encounter an unruly passenger, to consider the question “Would you be happy for this passenger to sit next to a child you care about?” If the answer is ‘no’, Icelandair staff are instructed to deny boarding.
Their already demanding job, focused on ensuring safety, becomes even more challenging when dealing with disruptive passengers.
Aviation psychologist Aleksandra Kapela, on flight attendants
Daniela Modonesi, who works at an Italian airport and who is chair of the European Transport Workers’ Federation (ETF)’s Ground Staff Committee, agrees ground staff have an important role to play. She adds that disruptive passenger-related issues are also prevalent on the ground and can cause knock-on effects.
“If (passengers are) in a line with somebody screaming, they don’t want to go on board with this person,” Modonesi tells CNN Travel.
Unruly passengers also lead to attrition across the aviation industry, says Modonesi. She regularly sees fellow ground staff leaving work, crying, following interactions with aggressive passengers. Often they hand in their notice not long after.
“You start thinking, ‘Why should I do this? I could change jobs so that this goes away,’” says Modonesi.

Disruptive behavior at 30,000 feet isn’t without consequences.
An FAA representative told CNN Travel they review every unruly passenger report received from airlines. The FAA will investigate further when they believe a passenger “may have violated a regulation or federal law.”
Unruly passengers in the US face fines of up to $37,000 per incident, as well as criminal prosecution.
“While we do not have criminal prosecution authority, the FAA is working closely with the FBI and TSA to ensure unruly passengers face additional punishments when warranted,” the FAA spokesperson told CNN Travel.
Airlines can also choose to place disruptive travelers on internal no-fly lists. These may be shared with partner airlines – for example, Dutch airline KLM shares this data with its low cost sister airline Transavia, and passengers are banned from flying with either airline for a minimum of five years if they misbehave on a Transavia or KLM flight.
However, penalizing disruptive passengers – particularly on international flights – can be complicated. Under existing international law (the Tokyo Convention 1963), offenses committed on board an aircraft are under the jurisdiction of the authorities in the state in which the aircraft is registered.
Essentially it’s “quite a legal minefield,” as flight attendant Major puts it.
The Montreal Protocol 2014 seeks to get around this issue by enabling prosecution in the state where the airplane lands, but not every nation has ratified this protocol.
The FAA uses the threat of steep fines in its digital signage and public service announcements – which aim to clamp down on disruptive passengers.
The FAA’s also created social media memes, with the FAA spokesperson pointing CNN Travel to one made especially for Halloween 2023, depicting a “police officer and unruly passenger” couple’s costume.
In Europe, EASA’s Not on my Flight Campaign also draws attention to the safety implications of people behaving badly on board via online advertisements.
Baum is skeptical about the potential positive impact of these campaigns.
“If you are a potentially unruly passenger, do you really not become unruly because you saw some zero tolerance unruly behavior video?” he questions.
Instead, Baum thinks the focus should be on the aviation industry’s approach to alcohol – which can be free flowing in the airport and on the plane and is often cited as a factor in unruly passenger incidents – and as a general threat to cabin safety. IATA says it’s working with airports and duty-free retailers to encourage responsible sales and marketing of alcohol, as often it’s the alcohol consumed prior to the flight that causes issues on board.
Former flight attendant Simmons thinks the FAA memes are effective – “visual images are such a powerful tool,” she says. But Simmons suggests there should also be reminders within the airport. Preboarding announcements that “crew are there for safety, first and foremost, and they’re not there as an outlet for aggression” could also be helpful, she says.
Simmons also encourages airlines and airports emphasizing cabin crew’s role as safety professionals.
“The way that flight attendants are represented in advertising, or onboard safety demonstrations sends a very powerful message to passengers,” she says.
Aviation psychologist Kapela agrees that “pre-flight education” is key, suggesting “ensuring passengers get why safety measures are in place, the important role of cabin crew, and the reasons behind actions like fastening seatbelts or delays can clear up misunderstandings.”
I feel we’ve been incredibly lucky that an aircraft has not been brought down because of unruly behavior in the skies.
Philip Baum, organizer of DISPAX World, the international conference on Unruly Airline Passenger Management and Restraint
EASA’s Franklin says it’s still too early to know if there will be a sea change in 2024 – not all data is yet available from 2023, for one.
He says EASA hopes “to see a reduction, particularly in events involving physical violence” and believes the industry will get there “through proactive passenger behavior management that deals with situations early before they escalate.”
So far in 2024, the problem doesn’t seem to have gone anywhere. In January, an American passenger bit an All Nippon Airways (ANA) flight attendant, forcing the plane to return to Tokyo, and an American Airlines flight was diverted to a Texas airport mid-flight after a passenger punched a flight attendant multiple times and assaulted at least one police officer.
“We’ve got a problem,” says Philip Baum, who fears that “one day there will be a disaster because of an unruly passenger incident.”
“At the moment, I feel we’ve been incredibly lucky that an aircraft has not been brought down because of unruly behavior in the skies.”"

The study involved testing blood for a key biomarker of Alzheimer’s called p-tau217, which increases at the same time as other damaging proteins — beta amyloid and tau — build up in the brains of people with the disease. Currently, to identify the buildup of beta amyloid and tau in the brain, patients undergo a brain scan or spinal tap, which often can be inaccessible and costly.

But this simple blood test was found to be up to 96% accurate in identifying elevated levels of beta amyloid and up to 97% accurate in identifying tau, according to the study published Monday in the journal JAMA Neurology.
“What was impressive with these results is that the blood test was just as accurate as advanced testing like cerebrospinal fluid tests and brain scans at showing Alzheimer’s disease pathology in the brain,” Nicholas Ashton, a professor of neurochemistry at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden and one of the study’s lead authors, said in an email.
The study findings came as no surprise to Ashton, who added that the scientific community has known for several years that using blood tests to measure tau or other biomarkers has the potential to assess Alzheimer’s disease risk.
“Now we are close to these tests being prime-time and this study shows that,” he said. Alzheimer’s disease, a brain disorder that affects memory and thinking skills, is the most common type of dementia, according to the National Institutes of Health.
Related article Doubts abound about a new Alzheimer’s blood test
Last year, the first blood test for assessing beta amyloid protein was made available for consumer purchase in the United States, called AD-Detect, to help people with mild cognitive impairment identify their risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. Some researchers have raised doubts about the science behind the test. Quest Diagnostics, the company behind the test, has stressed that it is not meant to diagnose Alzheimer’s, but says it helps assess a person’s risk of developing the disease.
The test used in the new study, called the ALZpath pTau217 assay, is a commercially available tool developed by the company ALZpath, which provided materials for the study at no cost. The test is currently available for research use only, but Ashton said it is expected to be available for clinical use soon.
“This is an instrumental finding in blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer’s, paving the way for the clinical use of the ALZpath pTau 217 assay,” Professors Kaj Blennow and Henrik Zetterberg from the University of Gothenburg, co-authors of the study, said in a press release. “This robust assay is already used in multiple labs around the globe.”
ALZpath estimates the price of the test could be between $200 and $500.
“A robust and accurate blood-based biomarker would enable a more comprehensive assessment of cognitive impairment in settings where advanced testing is limited,” the researchers wrote in their study. “Therefore, use of a blood biomarker is intended to enhance an early and precise AD diagnosis, leading to improved patient management and, ultimately, timely access to disease-modifying therapies.”
For instance, the test demonstrated “high accuracy” in identifying tau pathology within people who tested positive for beta amyloid, according to the study. That may help guide treatment decisions in patients considering therapies that target beta amyloid, such as Leqembi and Aduhelm, since they may be less effective in patients with advanced tau pathology, the researchers wrote.
“These results emphasize the important role of plasma p-tau217 as an initial screening tool in the management of cognitive impairment by underlining those who may benefit from antiamyloid immunotherapies,” the researchers wrote.
The study included data on 786 people, who had an average age of 66 and had brain scans and spinal taps completed, as well as blood samples collected. The data and those samples came from the Translational Biomarkers in Aging and Dementia, Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer’s Prevention and Sant Pau Initiative on Neurodegeneration.
Some of the participants showed signs of cognitive decline while undergoing the data collection but others did not. The researchers, from institutions in Sweden, the United States and other countries, analyzed the participants’ data from February to June of last year.

The researchers found that when they tested a participant’s blood sample with the p-tau217 immunoassay, the blood test showed similar results and accuracies in identifying abnormal beta amyloid and tau as the results from the participant’s spinal tap or brain scan.
Only about 20% of the study participants had blood test results that, in a clinical setting, would have required further testing with imaging or a spinal tap due to being unclear.
“This is a significant reduction in costly and high-demand examinations,” Ashton said in the email. Therefore, based on the study findings, “we think that a blood test and clinical examination can have definitive decision in 80%” of those who are being investigated for early signs of dementia.
Yet even though the blood test in this study was found to be highly accurate in predicting whether someone has key characteristics of Alzheimer’s disease in their brain, not everyone with those characteristics will go on to develop the disease.
Also, the p-tau test is specific for Alzheimer’s disease, so if someone tests negative but is showing signs of cognitive impairment, this test could not determine other possible causes of their symptoms, such as vascular dementia or Lewy body dementia.
“A blood test being negative speeds up the investigation for other causes of the symptoms and this is just as important,” Ashton said.

Overall, a blood test for Alzheimer’s disease, such as the one described in the new study, can be used to help diagnose both a person experiencing early memory loss, as well as before a patient shows signs or symptoms of the disease, because changes in the brain can occur about 20 years before the onset of overt symptoms, said preventive neurologist Dr. Richard Isaacson, director of research at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Florida, who was not involved in the study.
“This is actually the test that has, at this time, among the best available evidence for being one single test for Alzheimer’s,” Isaacson said about the study’s findings. “This study takes us one really powerful step closer to having that test, and the beauty of this study is it also looked at people before they had symptoms.”
Signs and symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease can vary from one person to another, but often memory problems are the first signs of the disease, such as losing track of dates, getting lost, misplacing things or having difficulty completing tasks, such as bathing, reading or writing.
Isaacson, who has researched blood biomarkers in people with no or minimal cognitive complaints, likened testing blood samples for signs of Alzheimer’s disease to how people undergo routine blood tests for high cholesterol.
“People get cholesterol tests before they have a heart attack. People get cholesterol tests before they have a stroke. To me, this type of test will eventually be best served in people before they start to have cognitive symptoms,” Isaacson said. And “just like cholesterol tests, by following the pTau217 level over time, we can better understand how various therapies and lifestyle changes are working to keep Alzheimer’s under better control.”
Testing for Alzheimer’s before someone has symptoms “leaves a lot of time” for that person to make brain-healthy choices and to talk to their doctor about their individual risk factors, Isaacson said, adding that a blood-based test also can be more cost-effective than performing brain scans or other methods of testing.
“PET scans have radiation and can cost over $5,000. Spinal taps are great because you get detailed information, but not everyone wants one and it is expensive and not covered by insurance. These blood tests are generally more reasonably priced,” Isaacson said.
“Having a blood test like this can also help democratize access for people and just make it easier for our health care system to more proactively manage the tsunami of dementia risk that our society is facing,” he said. “This is the key to unlock the door into the field of Alzheimer’s prevention and preventive neurology.”
More than 6 million people in the United States are living with dementia caused by Alzheimer’s disease, according to the Alzheimer’s Association, and the number of people affected is projected to double in the next two decades, rising to some 13 million in 2050.

In the future, adults older than 50 may be recommended to undergo routine blood tests for Alzheimer’s disease, said David Curtis, honorary professor at the University College London, who was not involved in the new study.
“When effective treatments to prevent the progression of Alzheimer’s disease become available it will be essential to be able to identify people who are at high risk before they begin to deteriorate. This study shows that a simple blood test might be able to do this by measuring levels of tau protein in the blood which has been phosphorylated in a specific way. This could potentially have huge implications,” Curtis said in a statement distributed by the UK-based Science Media Centre.
“Everybody over 50 could be routinely screened every few years, in much the same way as they are now screened for high cholesterol. It is possible that currently available treatments for Alzheimer’s disease would work better in those diagnosed early in this way,” he said. “However, I think the real hope is that better treatments can also be developed. The combination of a simple screening test with an effective treatment for Alzheimer’s disease would have a dramatic impact for individuals and for society.”"
YD7RNT0M3F_52E403AVT6J3PUC,UAW endorses Biden as he prepares to fight Trump for union workers,"By MJ Lee, Jeff Zeleny, Betsy Klein, Samantha Waldenberg, Chris Isidore and Michael Williams, CNN","5 minute read Updated 4:42 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/24/politics/biden-uaw-endorsement/,"The United Auto Workers union on Wednesday endorsed President Joe Biden, a long-awaited announcement that is an important pickup for the president.
“Look, I kept my commitment to be the most pro-union president ever,” Biden said after receiving the UAW’s endorsement at the group’s conference in Washington, DC, on Wednesday afternoon. “I’m proud you have my back. Let me just say I’m honored to have your back, and you have mine.”
The endorsement comes as the Biden campaign is making a full pivot to the general election, pointing to former President Donald Trump’s victory in the Republican primary in New Hampshire Tuesday as a clear sign that he is poised to emerge as the GOP presidential nominee.
The president and union leadership have long courted each other. Although it’s a key endorsement for Biden, the backing from union leadership may not convince all of the rank-and-file to vote for the president in November. Biden won the endorsement of the UAW in the 2020 campaign, even though many rank-and-file members supported Trump.
Ahead of endorsing Biden, UAW President Shawn Fain said the choice union workers face in 2024 “isn’t about who you like. It’s not about your party. It’s not this b——- about age. It’s not about anything, but our best shot at taking back power for the working class.”
He then referred to Trump using the worst insult that can be made in front of a room full of union workers.
“Donald Trump is a scab,” Fain said. “Donald Trump is a billionaire, and that’s who he represents. … Donald Trump stands against everything we stand for as a union – as a society.”
The choice between Trump and Biden, Fain said, was clear.
“Joe Biden bet on the American worker while Donald Trump blamed the American workers,” he said. “We need to know who’s going to sit in the most powerful seat in the world and help us win as a united working class. So if our endorsement must be earned, Joe Biden has earned it.”
Trump has made appealing to union voters a key part of his political strategy, in no small part by targeting disaffected voters in parts of the Midwest who believe the Democratic Party has left them behind.
Biden, meanwhile, has continued to cast himself as the most pro-union leader. He joined members of the UAW in Michigan on the picket line last year in the middle of a strike – an unprecedented move for a sitting president.
“I will say, I was so damn proud to stand in that picket line with you,” Biden told the crowd on Wednesday, prompting cheers.
“Honest to God, I’ve always believed that the union movement in America is important because it produces the best-skilled workers in the world. That’s what happens. It’s good for everybody.”
But just because the union endorsed Biden for a second term doesn’t mean it is lockstep with the president on every issue. In December, UAW released a statement calling for a ceasefire in Israel and Gaza – a move that Biden has himself resisted. The gap between the union’s position on Israel and the president’s briefly revealed itself during his speech Wednesday, when a member of the audience unfurled a Palestinian flag and shouted, “Ceasefire now!”
The protest was brief and did not derail the president’s remarks – unlike the abortion-rights rally on Tuesday where Biden was interrupted more than a dozen times by protesters demanding a ceasefire.
The endorsement could be a factor in the battleground state of Michigan in November. Trump won the Great Lakes State in 2016 and Biden won it narrowly in 2020. The race is expected to be close again in November as Biden and the former president – should he win his party’s presidential nomination – both work to stake out their claim to be the champion of the working class.
The UAW had kept its powder dry on a potential endorsement, declining last year to join a cadre of high-profile unions in backing Biden’s reelection campaign ahead of high-stakes contract negotiations. At the time, the union cited concerns over Biden’s policies that would encourage a transition to electric vehicles.
The UAW has more than 400,000 members, and Biden – who has long relied on the political backing of unions – has touted its support in the past. The president has called American autoworkers “the most skilled autoworkers in the world.” The group’s membership is mostly concentrated in Michigan, a presidential election battleground.
Fain previously warned this cycle that “another Donald Trump presidency would be a disaster.”
While Biden took care to show his support on the picket line, the administration lacked the legal or legislative authority to act as a participant in the negotiations, which ended in late October.
Rep. Dan Kildee, a Michigan Democrat, dismissed concerns Tuesday that Biden had not yet received the union’s endorsement.
“No, it doesn’t,” Kildee told CNN’s Poppy Harlow when pressed on whether he was worried the endorsement had not yet been made.
“The UAW had other issues on its mind than injecting presidential politics into the 2023 challenges. They had an unprecedented strike. With the support of President Biden, they received an unprecedented contract. So, when I talk to auto workers, they understand that. And, you know, I’m very hopeful that organized labor generally, and the UAW specifically, will - will remember Joe Biden’s record and will stand with him as a result,” Kildee added.
Trump has found support among the rank-and-file of the UAW despite Fain’s strong criticisms and union leadership’s consistent support of Democratic candidates. On the same day that Biden visited a UAW picket line in Michigan, Trump spoke at a non-union auto shop in suburban Detroit – drawing the ire of the union.
Fain told CNN in December that he felt like the former president has never truly had the backs of UAW members.
“You go back to 2019, when he was a sitting president, and GM was on strike for, you know, 40 days. What did he say about the strikers in? What did he do to assist? What did you do show he cared about those workers, I mean, he was silent,” Fain said.
“You go back to 2015, when he was running for the presidency. And he talked about, we need to do a rotation of all these good paying jobs in the Midwest somewhere else, not out of the country, but somewhere else in the country, and have these workers begging for their jobs back. You go back to the economic recession, and he jumped on ‘The bandwagon of the UAW is to blame for everything wrong with these companies.’ And so those are facts, they’re indisputable.”

YFWASVE418_WQYOL5B5SC9NY8Q,Trump SPAC has tripled since the Iowa caucuses,"By Matt Egan, CNN","3 minute read Published 2:59 PM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/23/business/trump-stock-spac/,"The latest meme stock is one closely associated with the 45th president of the United States.
Digital World Acquisition Corp., the blank-check firm that’s been trying for years to merge with Truth Social owner Trump Media & Technology Group, has emerged as a way for investors to make bets on the political fortunes of former President Donald Trump.
The share price of the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) has exploded in value as Trump’s political rivals drop out of the 2024 race and line up behind him. That’s despite the legal, regulatory and financial questions that have been swirling over the corporate marriage since it was proposed in October 2021.
Digital World’s share price spiked 88% to 19-month highs on Monday alone. That was the day after Florida Governor Ron DeSantis ended his 2024 presidential campaign and endorsed Trump.
The Trump-linked stock tumbled 10% Tuesday morning as residents of New Hampshire began voting in the primary there. But by late afternoon trading the stock reversed course and was up 6% on the day.
Since Trump’s landslide victory in the Iowa caucuses on January 15, Digital World shares have more than tripled.
“After Iowa, it got crazy. This is the only direct-ish way to play Trump,” said Matthew Tuttle, CEO of Tuttle Capital Management.
Tuttle said the stock surge has been purely fueled by momentum and Trump’s political success – not the fundamentals that are supposed to move stocks in the long run.
“There are no fundamentals here,” he said. “This is all investors playing what’s going on with Trump on a blow-by-blow basis, crushing the shorts and creating a short squeeze.”
A short squeeze occurs when investors that bet against a stock are forced to unwind their bets and buy the stock back at a higher price. That in turn drives the share price even higher, creating further losses for short-sellers.
Jay Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida, expressed shock at the stock spike for Digital World.
“It’s basically a memestock like GameStop,” Ritter said, noting that the company has “almost no revenue and is hemorrhaging money.”
Despite that, Digital World’s share price values the company at up to approximately $8 billion on a fully diluted basis, which includes all shares and options that could be converted to common stock, according to Ritter.
“It’s so grossly overvalued,” he said.
Neither Trump Media & Technology Group nor Digital World responded to requests for comment.
In November, SEC filings showed Trump Media & Technology Group has lost $31.6 million since launching in early 2021.
The Truth Social owner is burning cash so rapidly that accountants warned it might not survive unless the long-delayed merger with Digital World is completed soon.
Ritter cautioned retail investors that betting on a momentum stock like Digital World could backfire.
“Retail investors are pushing the price around, not based on the profitability of the company now or in the future but a combination of sticking it to the man and perhaps gambling that you can sell it to a greater fool at an even higher price,” he said. “The greater fool theory of investing works in the short-term but as a consistent strategy it certainly does not work.”
Even some professional traders are keeping their distance from the Trump stock given the recent volatility.
Tuttle said he’s not “messing” with Digital World now, preferring to bet on less volatile stocks that are “not going to rip my head off.”
“This is not your widow-and-orphan stock. This is something you don’t play unless you know exactly what you’re doing,” Tuttle said."
YJ5W3BIBRF_EOURZSVPDVE2PGE,There isn’t a taco truck on every corner. But there’s a Mexican restaurant in nearly every US county,"By Catherine E. Shoichet, CNN","6 minute read Published 7:41 AM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/23/us/mexican-restaurant-locations-us-county-cec/,"As falling snow blankets the ground around his bright green taco truck in rural eastern Oregon, Amado Juarez puts the finishing touches on an order.
It’s a labor of love for Juarez, 53, who takes pride in the food he and his wife prepare and serve.
“We make everything personally,” he told CNN in a recent Zoom interview. “We give it our own seasoning.”
Years ago, Morrow County, Oregon, would have been a surprising place to find the carne asada, enchiladas and tacos Juarez is known for. But his family’s food truck, Tacos Hometown, has been operating in this rural community some 1,100 miles from the US-Mexico border for more than a decade, serving up “simply authentic Mexican food” to a largely American clientele.
A recent report from the Pew Research Center lists Morrow County as one of the places with the highest concentration of Mexican eateries in the US. According to Pew’s analysis of data from SafeGraph, more than a third of restaurants in the county serve Mexican food. The other counties listed in that ranking are all located in border states.
It’s one telling example of how Mexican food has spread throughout the United States.
Roughly 1 in 10 restaurants in the US serve Mexican food, according to Pew’s analysis of SafeGraph and Yelp data, with Mexican restaurants found in a large majority of US counties.
“Mexican food exists exactly where you would expect it to, but also pretty much anywhere else you might care to look in the United States that has any significant number of people in it,” says Aaron Smith, Pew’s director of data labs research. “In the middle of Oregon somewhere, out between the Pacific Ocean and the Rockies, there’s this little moderately sized community where over a third of the restaurants are serving Mexican food, which is kind of fascinating.”
There’s not a taco truck on every corner, as a Trump supporter once warned could happen in the runup to the 2016 election – spurring backlash and mockery on social media, and even inspiring a campaign to use taco trucks to help with voter registration.
But Mexican cuisine in the US is flourishing near the border, and also thousands of miles away. Tacos and tamales can be found in food trucks and five-star restaurants, in big cities and small towns.
Decades ago, the landscape was dramatically different. As food historian Jeffrey Pilcher notes in “Planet Taco: A Global History of Mexican Food,” in the middle of the 20th century, Mexican restaurants outside the Southwest were rare in the US.
Pilcher points to a number of factors that contributed to Mexican food’s increasing prevalence, including a “renaissance for family restaurants serving Mexican regional cooking throughout the United States” as large numbers of migrant workers from Latin America came to the US starting in the 1980s.
Now, as Pew’s analysis shows, Mexican food can be found almost everywhere in the US.
According to the report, 99% of the US population lives in a county with at least one Mexican restaurant.
Historian Natalia Molina says behind each data point there are even richer stories to tell — and important questions to ask.
“If we want to understand immigration, if we want to understand Latino culture, if we want to understand our neighborhoods, the way that our cities and counties and states are changing, food and restaurants are a central part of that,” Molina says. And numbers, she says, only tell part of the story.
Yes, foodies across the US now scour sites like Eater to find the trendiest tacos.
But, Molina notes, “at the same time we can’t pass immigration reform, at the same time every time you turn on the news there’s a new crisis at the border.
“It’s begging the question — can we cherish Mexican cuisine without embracing Mexicans?”
For Molina, a distinguished professor of American studies and ethnicity at the University of Southern California, the question isn’t simply academic. It’s closely intertwined with her family’s personal history.
Molina’s grandmother once ran a beloved Mexican restaurant in Los Angeles, and she documents its history — and the vital importance of other restaurants like it — in her book “A Place at the Nayarit: How a Mexican Restaurant Nourished a Community.”
Her mother sold the restaurant lease when Molina was a child. Its new owners closed it in 2001. Later that year, the building became a nightclub.
About 37 million people in the United States trace their ancestry to Mexico, according to Pew, and Mexicans represent the largest group of immigrants living in the US. While there are many Mexican restaurants in the US — not to mention restaurants serving other types of cuisine where Mexican immigrants work — Molina says a key detail can get lost when focusing on overall numbers.
Gentrification is changing neighborhoods that once were epicenters of working-class Latino life, Molina says, and beloved restaurants where people could find community are closing.
“When that gets replaced by someone selling your matcha latte and your avocado toast, it’s not going to draw the immigrant generation or the working-class immigrants,” she says.
Meanwhile, Molina hopes that in addition to embracing Mexican cuisine, consumers will think more about how that food is making it to their table.
“That’s brought to you by a chain fueled by immigrants,” she says.
At first, Amado and Elia Juarez weren’t sure how the residents of Morrow County would respond to their taco truck.
“There are very few Mexicans here. When we moved to Ione, Oregon, in 2002, we were the first Mexicans,” Elia recalls.
So when they opened up their taco truck in 2013, they went with a name they hoped would help them connect with customers. Amado’s former boss at the dairy farm where he’d worked for decades offered a suggestion that stuck.
While many taco trucks invoke the names of their owners or Mexican locales, “Tacos Hometown” aimed to appeal both to immigrant agricultural workers in the area and the larger community they hoped to serve.
But they knew their Mexican heritage would be a key ingredient.
They painted the taco truck green as a tribute to Amado’s late father, whose home in Mexico’s Guerrero state was the same bright color.
And they didn’t change the foods to appeal to an American palate.
It wasn’t long before their business was thriving, Amado recalls.
“They really love the spicy salsa,” Elia says.
Getting ingredients to make the fresh food that’s become their trademark isn’t easy. The closest city is a 50-minute drive, and often they’ll drive an hour and a half to get products in bulk. But they say going the extra miles — literally — is worth it to keep customers happy.
The dairy industry has brought more Mexicans to the area since they first arrived, but the Juarez family says Mexican eateries are still relatively rare. Other taco trucks and restaurants they know of are about an hour away, on the other side of the county or outside its limits.
Juarez says most of his taco truck’s customers are American. Opening the business, he says, has helped his family feel closer to their community.
He marvels at the generous tips American customers leave. On his phone he keeps a photo of the day when students in a local high school Spanish class showed up and serenaded him. And he’s even visited a preschool to give a presentation on Mexican food.
“I see them as my future customers,” he laughs.
And wherever those toddlers end up traveling in the years to come, there will be plenty of restaurant options to choose from for the kids from rural Oregon who learned to love tacos in their hometown."
YMHS5HFHMZ_ZPEBVMUWK5QP0PE,A dayslong siege of rain is fueling a serious flash-flood threat in the South,"By Elizabeth Wolfe, Robert Shackelford and Mary Gilbert, CNN","5 minute read Updated 7:35 PM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/23/weather/rain-ice-storm-flooding-forecast-tuesday/,"A multi-day siege of heavy rain and thunderstorms is raising the risk of flash flooding across the South, while freezing rain creates potentially perilous travel conditions for parts of the central US on Tuesday. Here are the latest updates:
• Heavy rain brings flash flooding to South: More than 30 million people are under flood watches that stretch from eastern Texas to the Tennessee Valley. More than 5 inches of rainfall could inundate drought-stricken areas this week, overwhelming dry soil and triggering additional flooding. Heavy rainfall Monday unloaded flash flooding in Texas, including San Antonio.
• Wintry mix poses travel threat: Freezing rain and scattered snowfall could lead to ice-glazed roadways and some power outages through Tuesday night from parts of the Midwest to the interior Northeast. Air travel may be hampered by icy weather after similar conditions on Monday led to spikes in delays and cancellations at airports including Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport and St. Louis Lambert International Airport.
• Hundreds rescued in California flooding: Winter storms continue to pummel the West. Cleanup and recovery is underway Tuesday in San Diego, where the mayor has declared a state of emergency after heavy rain sent several feet of fast-moving water rushing through some streets and prompted hundreds of rescues on Monday, officials said. Damage assessments are underway in the region and temporary shelters have been established for the displaced and homeless. Gov. Gavin Newsom on Tuesday declared a state of emergency in San Diego and Ventura counties to support recovery from recent storms.
Daily waves of warm, moist air will fuel rounds of drenching storms for the South through midweek before wet and dreary conditions expand to a wider area of the eastern US by Friday and Saturday.
Moisture surging north from the Gulf of Mexico is increasing the flood threat across the South.
The heaviest rainfall and the greatest risk for flash flooding will be Tuesday and Wednesday over some of the most parched areas of the region, including Louisiana and Mississippi. Level 3 out of 4 risks of excessive rainfall are in place for both days.
Widespread rainfall totals of 4 to 6 inches are likely. Higher totals will focus on areas closer to the Gulf of Mexico where multiple rounds of heavy rain and a few thunderstorms unfold. Parts of Louisiana and Mississippi could end the week with rainfall bordering on double digits.
Rainfall of this nature can easily lead to flash flooding, especially in drought-stricken areas, because the ground is dry and hard, allowing less water to soak into the soil.
Drought conditions cover more than 80% of Mississippi and more than 90% of Louisiana, and over 10% of both states are in exceptional drought – the most severe level of US Drought Monitor scale.
While the rain will become less intense after Wednesday, steady rounds of rain will persist for the entire week across parts of the South.
By Friday and Saturday, rain and will expand tremendously in scope, bringing dreary, wet weather across much of the East.
Around 1 to 2 inches of rain is possible during this time from the central Appalachians through New England.
About 13 million people are under winter weather alerts across the Great Lakes and Northeast on Tuesday as a storm that wreaked icy chaos begins to wind down.
After slick roadways led to reports of cars losing control or spinning out on Monday, accumulating ice remains a threat Tuesday. Even small coatings of ice are enough to cause issues on untreated, paved surfaces like roads and sidewalks. Larger build-ups can also cause tree damage and cause power outages.
Several regional National Weather Service offices urged people to avoid driving in hazardous conditions or exercise extreme caution if travel is essential.
The weather service in Indianapolis, Indiana, cautioned that though air temperatures will be slightly above freezing, ice can still coat roads and sidewalks. “If traveling, drive slow and safe!” the agency said.
Winter weather alerts last into Wednesday for parts of New York and New England.
Monday’s rainfall and flooding in San Diego were “unprecedented,” Mayor Todd Gloria said Tuesday. He said he toured the communities in the southeast areas of the city most impacted by rain and flooding.
Monday was ranked as the fourth-wettest day on record in San Diego, with 2.73 inches of rain, according to the National Weather Service.
“The damage and the impact were absolutely devastating, in fact, it was heartbreaking,” Gloria said at a news conference.
“I saw homes that were destroyed by floodwaters, floodwaters that reached the ceilings in some cases. I saw cars that had been picked up and moved down the street, floated away from where they had been parked, got swamped with water and with mud.
“I saw entire lives changed in just a few minutes, and I want to let folks know my heart is with them, and I ask San Diegans to hold every one of your neighbors in your hearts who are having to deal with yesterday’s events.”
Gloria said those residents most affected by the storm will be in recovery mode for weeks, if not months.
He encouraged residents to assess damages, file claims with their insurance and report issues to the county.
Initial assessments indicated Monday’s rainstorm caused $6 million to $7 million in damage to the city’s infrastructure, said Chris Heiser, director of San Diego’s Office of Emergency Services.

YNWLRX28YJ_YCT4VM9GRW512WB,The Los Angeles Times plunges into ‘chaos’ as brutal layoffs loom and senior editors call it quits,"By Oliver Darcy, CNN","5 minute read Published 6:30 AM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240123,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/23/media/los-angeles-times-layoffs-strike/,"Editor’s Note: A version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here.
The Los Angeles Times is in disarray.
The Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong-owned newspaper, which houses the largest newsroom in the western U.S., has been thrown into a state of mayhem as severe layoffs loom and senior editorial leaders abruptly call it quits.
“I cannot overstate the level of chaos,” one   staffer, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak   publicly, candidly told me on Monday.
To say that it has been a rocky start to the new year for the venerable news outlet would be an understatement. Earlier this month, Kevin Merida suddenly announced that he was departing his post as executive editor after less than three years on the job. Then, news of forthcoming mass layoffs ensued, prompting the employee’s union to stage a historic one-day walk out on Friday. The LAT’s Meg James reported last week that management could slash upwards of 20% of the newsroom — or roughly 100 positions — with the looming layoffs, though a person familiar with the matter warned to me on Monday that it could ultimately end up being “much worse” than that.
Meanwhile, amid the backdrop of bedlam, the team of four managing editors — Julia Turner, Sara Yasin, Scott Kraft, and Shani Hilton — tapped to oversee operations in the wake of Merida’s departure has also been rocked by departures. Two of the four members, BuzzFeed News alums Hilton and Yasin, have in recent days exited the newspaper, contributing even further to the turmoil that has enveloped the newsroom.
“We have a billionaire who doesn’t understand media and thinks he can cut his way to success,” another staffer told me, likening the drama playing out in the editorial leadership to the reality television show “Survivor.”
Seeking to provide the newsroom with some sense of stability, Turner emailed staffers on Monday announcing that she would oversee daily editorial operations with Kraft and absorb all of Hilton’s direct reports. Notably, Turner was not shy about the grim reality confronting the newspaper, writing to employees, “Scott and I are now responsible for all editorial operations, and we’re advocating for editorial interests in conversations with the company about the financial crisis we face.”
Beyond the drastic cuts hanging over the newsroom, it’s unclear what Soon-Shiong is doing behind the scenes to stable his ship. The biotech billionaire purchased The LAT in 2018, pouring nearly $1 billion into the storied paper and vowing to steer it into the future after enduring years of tumult under Tribune Publishing. But in the words of the newspaper’s own leadership team, years later under his stewardship it is in a dire state of “financial crisis.”
The newsroom’s rank-and-file have not heard from Soon-Shiong since he   announced Merida’s exit two weeks ago. At the time, he said his commitment to   the newspaper had “not wavered.” But he did foreshadow a period of   disruption, telling staffers, “Given the persistent challenges we face,   it is now imperative that we all work together to build a sustainable   business that allows for growth and innovation of the LA Times and LA Times   Studios in order to achieve our vision.”
The Times is certainly not alone in its struggles. Most news media companies are fighting to stand on their feet as they fight unprecedented headwinds. Layoffs have become the de facto norm in an industry continually pummeled by seismic change. In 2023, news outlets slashed nearly 2,700 jobs — the highest number of cuts to torment the industry since the Covid-19 pandemic.
The cuts have come at a horrendous time. As antidemocratic   candidates look to seize power in election contests from coast to coast,   newsrooms are shrinking and simply trying to stay afloat. That lack of   accountability means dishonest figures seeking higher office, and those in   positions of power, could avoid crucial scrutiny, leaving the electorate less   informed about the vital decisions it will have to make in November at the   ballot box.
That said, while painful cuts have become all too frequent   throughout the industry, it’s still rare to watch in real-time as a news   organization of The LAT’s stature see its leadership team come apart at the   seams so visibly — particularly as staffers brace for even more agony.
On Monday, 10 Democratic members of Congress representing   California wrote Soon-Shiong, expressing alarm over the planned layoffs,   noting that during elections, “the role of news outlets in providing   accurate and unbiased information becomes even more vital.”
“Our community relies on the newspaper to stay informed   about local and national events, and a reduction in reporters could have a   detrimental impact on the quality of reporting,” the congressional   leaders wrote. “Preserving democracy is contingent upon a free and   robust press, and the LA Times has been instrumental in upholding this   democratic principle.”
“We urge you to consider alternative solutions that would   allow the LA Times to navigate its financial challenges without compromising   the integrity and strength of its newsroom.”
In response, Soon-Shiong said he had invested hundreds of   millions of dollars into the paper and suggested lawmakers should take action   of their own to aid revenue-starved news organizations.
“I’d like to put the question to them: What can they do   to help preserve a free and robust press, one that is instrumental in   upholding our democracy?” he wrote. “All we are asking for is the   opportunity for our newspaper and hardworking journalists to be fairly   compensated, and for the L.A. Times to have a fair chance to become a   self-sustaining institution.”"
YPFGEIRD1W_LKDVJ43CUO6V4FH,"Netanyahu must be removed, top former Israeli national security officials say","By Alex Marquardt, CNN","5 minute read Published 5:00 AM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/26/middleeast/netanyahu-letter-israel-national-security-intl/,"More than 40 senior former Israeli national security officials, celebrated scientists and prominent business leaders have sent a letter to Israel’s president and speaker of parliament demanding that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu be removed from office for posing what they say is an “existential” threat to the country.
The signatories on the letter include four former directors of Israel’s foreign and domestic security services, two former heads of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and three Nobel Prize winners.
The letter blasts the coalition Netanyahu assembled to form the most right-wing government ever in Israel, along with his highly controversial efforts to overhaul Israel’s judiciary that they say led to security lapses that resulted in the October 7 attacks, the deadliest day in Israel’s history.
“We believe that Netanyahu bears primary responsibility for creating the circumstances leading to the brutal massacre of over 1,200 Israelis and others, the injury of over 4,500, and the kidnapping of more than 230 individuals, of whom over 130 are still held in Hamas captivity,” it reads. “The victim’s blood is on Netanyahu’s hands.”

The letter was sent to Israeli President Isaac Herzog on Thursday and to Knesset Speaker Amir Ohana on Friday.
Netanyahu’s popularity has fallen dramatically since starting his sixth term as prime minister, just over a year ago. Critics have blasted his judicial reform efforts – which threatened to trigger a constitutional crisis and divided the country, with months of massive, regular demonstrations.
“Leaders of Iran, Hezbollah, and Hamas,” the letter says, “openly praised what they correctly saw as a destabilizing and erosive process of Israel’s stability, led by Netanyahu, and seized the opportunity to harm and damage Israel’s security.”
Among the 43 signatories are former IDF chiefs Moshe Ya’alon and Dan Halutz, Tamir Pardo and Danny Yatom, who ran the Mossad intelligence agency, and Nadav Argaman and Yaakov Peri, who were directors of the domestic security service, Shin Bet.
Former CEOs, ambassadors, government officials and three Nobel laureates for chemistry - Aaron Ciechanover, Avram Hershko and Dan Shechtman - also signed the letter.
A poll released this week by Israel’s Channel 13 suggests that Netanyahu’s political party, Likud, would now come in a distant second if elections were held today. The frontrunner in the poll was the National Unity party led by former IDF chief of staff Benny Gantz, currently a member of Netanyahu’s war cabinet.
The next elections aren’t planned until late 2026, though there have been protests and calls for early elections, including from one of Israel’s main opposition leaders, Yair Lapid.
“The situations that brought Israel to elections beforehand are almost nothing in comparison to what Israel is going through now,” said Haim Tomer, a longtime Mossad officer who retired after heading the agency’s intelligence division and who signed the letter demanding Netanyahu’s removal.
“Everybody understands that Netanyahu is incompetent to lead Israel,” Tomer told CNN.
In the past week Netanyahu has repeatedly expressed his opposition to Palestinian sovereignty for security reasons, as Israel’s main ally, the United States, continues to call for a two-state solution.
The letter’s signatories accuse Netanyahu of spending years propping up Hamas in Gaza at the expense of the Palestinian Authority, which the US has argued should be revitalized to govern both the West Bank and Gaza.
CNN has reported that for years Qatar delivered cash-filled suitcases to Gaza with Netanyahu’s blessing, despite concerns from his own government. The money was intended to pay civil servants’ salaries and retirees’ benefits. It is now delivered via bank transfers rather than in cash, and as recently as last month, Qatar said it was continuing to pay it.
To form his current government, Netanyahu brought together other parties well to the right of Likud and assembled the most right-wing government in Israeli history. Two of its most prominent members, Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben Gvir, have been called out by the Biden administration for arguing that Palestinians should leave Gaza.
The letter accuses Netanyahu of refusing to take responsibility for the October 7 attacks, instead “blaming others and inciting against those who had fought to save the Israeli democracy from his destructive actions and plans, and now mobilize whole heartedly to support Israel’s national war efforts.”
It concludes with a plea to the Israeli president and Knesset speaker to replace the prime minister, as well as a warning: “The Israeli nation and Jewish history will not forgive you if you don’t fulfill your utmost national responsibility.”
Neither the president nor the speaker has the power to remove a prime minister from office unilaterally, but the letter was also to be distributed by the speaker to Knesset members who can remove and replace a prime minister.
The right people need “to get their hands on the steering wheel,” said Tomer, the former Mossad official.
“I think people start to look from the outside towards Israel and ask themselves what happened to this country,” Tomer said. “What’s happened to this country with very, very smart people that are now being led with some idiots?”
“The word that we have been using in the circles that I’ve been participating in is: we need a restart, we need a restart.”

Israel has come under intense international criticism for its war in Gaza, which has killed more than 25,000 Palestinians and displaced almost two million people since the October 7 Hamas attacks.
Israel has repeatedly insisted that its war is not against the Palestinian people but Hamas militants who are holding more than 130 hostages in dire conditions in the war zone.
Netanyahu told a news conference last week that politicians who are asking him to step down are essentially asking for a Palestinian state.
Israel’s actions in Gaza are the subject of a genocide case in the International Court of Justice (ICJ), initiated by South Africa that accuses the country’s leadership of intending to “bring about the destruction of its Palestinian population.”
Israel denies the allegations, arguing that the war is being fought in self-defense and that its leadership has not displayed genocidal intent."
YQUPUQDA9W_UK12LGJL09TXOGA,DOJ and Mifepristone maker urge Supreme Court to preserve full access to abortion pill,"By Devan Cole, CNN","3 minute read Published 11:18 PM EST, Tue January 23, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/23/politics/doj-mifepristone-maker-supreme-court-abortion-pill/,"The Justice Department and the manufacturer of a widely used abortion pill urged the Supreme Court on Tuesday to preserve full access to the drug, warning that a lower-court ruling restricting its availability “threatens profound harms” nationwide.
“The loss of access to mifepristone would be damaging for women and healthcare providers around the Nation. For many patients, mifepristone is the best method to lawfully terminate their early pregnancies,” Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar told the justices in court papers.
“There is no equitable justification for allowing parties whose asserted injuries are at best attenuated – and whose relevant claims assert only that FDA failed adequately to explain its actions – to secure disruptive nationwide relief that threatens profound harms to the government, the healthcare system, patients, and the public,” Prelogar wrote.
The pair of filings from the Justice Department and Danco Laboratories, a manufacturer of the drug and an intervenor in the case, lay out their arguments for why the justices should overturn the lower-court ruling that curbed access to mifepristone, including that the pill’s challengers didn’t have the legal right – known as “standing” – to sue the government over its approval of the drug and the regulatory regime that eased access to it.
“The Fifth Circuit ran roughshod over this Court’s precedents,” attorneys for Danco wrote in their filing. “The court’s standing analysis would give medical organizations standing to challenge virtually every government regulation that touches on health or safety.”
The justices agreed last year to review the case, though the court has not yet scheduled oral arguments. More briefs from the parties are expected in the coming weeks.
In its filing Tuesday night, the drugmaker, like the government, defended the US Food and Drug Administration’s 2000 approval of mifepristone and the agency’s subsequent actions concerning the drug. The company argued that the legal analysis employed by the New Orleans-based appeals court to limit access to the drug “threatens to destabilize the pharmaceutical industry, which relies both on FDA’s ability to make predictive judgments and on courts not second-guessing those scientific judgments.”
For now, mifepristone remains available and not subject to restrictions that the lower courts have said should be imposed on its use. The high court determined in April 2023 that access to the drug would remain unchanged until the appeals process finishes.
Central to the dispute is the scope of the FDA’s authority to regulate mifepristone, a drug that the medical community has deemed safe and effective and is used by more than half of women to terminate their pregnancies, according to the government.
Challengers – including doctors and groups who oppose abortion – argue that the FDA did not do enough to study the safety implications of the drug when it approved its use and made it more easily accessible in subsequent years.
A federal judge in Texas agreed last spring, issuing a ruling that would have halted the FDA’s 2000 approval of the drug. The 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals backtracked somewhat, saying in August that while it was too late for the challengers to mount a case against the initial 2000 approval of the drug and left in place the 2019 approval of a generic version of the drug, it would block changes made in 2016 and 2021 that made the drug more easily accessible."

Videos of the toothpicks, a sanitary product, being fried in oil and eaten were going viral, it added.
Food coloring is used to impart a green hue to the toothpicks, made from sweet potato or corn starch, which are seen as being environmentally friendly and biodegradable.
Often used in restaurants in South Korea, they can also be used to pick up finger foods.
A genre of online videos called “Mukbang,” which often show people eating an excessive amount of food or unusual dishes, are popular in South Korea.

He was 97.
Jewison died “peacefully” on Saturday, his publicist Jeff Sanderson told CNN in a statement on Monday. Sanderson did not specify a cause of death.
With a career spanning over 40 years, Jewison had several Oscar nominations, including three for best director and four for best picture as a producer – 1966’s “The Russians Are Coming the Russians Are Coming,” 1971’s “Fiddler on the Roof,” 1984’s “A Soldier’s Story” and 1987’s “Moonstruck.” In 1999, he was awarded the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award for his body of work.
“The biggest grossing picture is not necessarily the best picture, so just tell stories that move us to laughter and tears and, perhaps, reveal a little truth about ourselves,” Jewison said in his acceptance speech.
“In The Heat of the Night,” starring Poitier and Lee Grant, won five Oscars, including best picture, but Jewison was the director, not a producer on that film.
Jewison had been in show business since the age of five, when he made his on-stage debut as a performer at the Malvern Collegiate Institute, according to an official biography. After serving time in the Royal Canadian Navy, Jewison earned a degree from Victoria College in Toronto.
Some of his first credits as a director were for television series in the 1950s, including “Your Hit Parade,” “The Andy Williams Show” and “The Fabulous Fifties.”
His cinematic directorial debut came in 1962, with Jewison behind the lens of the Tony Curtis-led comedy “40 Pounds of Trouble.” He continued to find success as a director in the years that followed with the 1965 classic “The Cincinnati Kid,” starring actor and racing legend Steve McQueen.
He teamed back up with McQueen in 1967 to direct the original “Thomas Crown Affair,” which was remade in 1999 starring Pierce Brosnan.
Known for his ability to cover a variety of topics in his work, Jewison directed the cinematic version of the hit Broadway play “Fiddler on the Roof” and the rock opera “Jesus Christ Superstar” within two years of each other in the early 1970s.
He followed-up that duo of films with a war drama — 1984’s “A Soldier’s Story” — and “Moonstruck,” a family dramedy starring Cher, in 1987.
Jewison directed other iconic films throughout the 1980s, including “In Country,” starring Bruce Willis and Emily Lloyd, and “Other People’s Money.”
His last credited directorial offering came in 2003 with “The Statement,” a thriller starring Michael Caine and Tilda Swinton.
He is survived by his wife Lynne St. David, three children and five grandchildren."

The panel rejected the case on procedural grounds Monday, finding that the commission didn’t have jurisdiction to address the matter. The outcome is a victory for the former president, but the panel avoided grappling with questions around his culpability for the deadly attack on the US Capitol.
Massachusetts is one of several states where Trump’s eligibility to run for president is being tested, based on the “insurrectionist ban” enshrined in the Constitution’s 14th Amendment. He has been removed from the ballot in Colorado and Maine, but those decisions are paused while the US Supreme Court considers Trump’s appeal in the Colorado case.
The Massachusetts commissioners met briefly last week in Boston and heard arguments on procedural questions.

“We believe that Mr. Trump’s candidacy for this office and placement on the Massachusetts ballot violates the Constitution, so we are challenging the constitutionality,” said Shannon Liss-Riordan, an attorney for the challengers. “It is the job of this commission to hear objections to the legality of placement of candidates on the ballot.”
Trump’s lawyers urged the panel to dismiss the objection. His legal team has previously convinced judges in Michigan, Minnesota and other key states to throw out similar challenges based on procedural grounds.
“There is nothing in the case law or the statutes that the commission is required to follow that says qualification to be on a ballot is a pre-condition to appear on the ballot,” Trump lawyer Marc Salinas said.
The Massachusetts commission is an independent and bipartisan panel, whose members are appointed by the state’s governor. The chairman is a Republican appointee, and the other two members are Democratic appointees.
Decisions made by the commission can be appealed in Massachusetts courts."

Moscow and Kyiv gave conflicting accounts of how the Ilyushin Il-76 was downed Wednesday in Russia’s Belgorod region, which neighbors eastern Ukraine. Moscow says the plane was transporting Ukrainian prisoners of war, while Kyiv says it was carrying Russian missiles to be used in further strikes on Ukraine.
But the latest comments indicate Kyiv’s growing confidence that the IL-76 plane, which crashed Wednesday morning in the village of Yablonovo in Russia’s Belgorod region, may not have been carrying Ukrainian prisoners of war ahead of an exchange, as Moscow claimed.
Andriy Yusov, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence (DI), told CNN the number of bodies brought to the morgue matched the number of crew members on the plane. “No other bodies were detected,” he said.
Moscow claimed all 74 people on board – comprising six crew members, three military escorts and 65 Ukrainian servicemen – were killed in the crash. A Russian regional governor posted a list of names of the people he said made up the six-person crew.
Pressed by CNN to account for the discrepancy between the number of crew members Russian authorities said were on board and the number of bodies Ukrainian intelligence suggests had arrived at the morgue on Wednesday, Yusov said he stood by his initial comments.
Russia initially failed to produce visual evidence to back up its claims there were Ukrainian soldiers on the plane. The first video that emerged from the crash site, of which some was broadcast on Russia state media, appeared to show several dead bodies on the ground, but no images appeared to suggest there were dozens of fatalities.
The Russian Investigative Committee released a second video on Thursday, which they claim is from the crash site, and appears to show human remains in the snow.
The video shows investigators measuring what appears to be a bloody human hand and a dismembered arm. In separate clips, the video also shows aerial footage of the crash site and remnants of the plane. It is unclear if the human remains in the video are in the same location as the remnants of the plane.
CNN geolocated the two videos released by Russia’s Investigative Committee of the crash site, which matches the location of a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image taken by Umbra Space for CNN.
The plane came down in a field in rural Belgorod oblast, just north of the small village of Yablonovo, according to CNN’s analysis of videos and the SAR image.
The SAR image shows a sprawl of debris littering the crash site of the Il-76. The debris field is just under a mile long, and stretches about 800 feet at its widest point.
Moscow also accused Kyiv of downing the plane with an anti-aircraft missile system from Ukrainian territory, claiming the radar equipment of the Russian Aerospace Forces detected two Ukrainian missiles. Ukraine’s military command said it regarded Russian military aircraft approaching Belgorod as legitimate target, but did not confirm it had fired at the plane.
CNN is unable to independently verify the claims made by the two sides.
Both Moscow and Kyiv agree that a prisoner exchange had been planned for Wednesday, with the swap due to take place some 60 kilometers west of Belgorod city. Ukraine’s ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said Thursday in a televised interview that the swap was planned and the “representatives of our institution were present.”
But Yusov said Ukraine had not received notification that the prisoners would be flown into the region, rather than being transferred by road or rail. In the only other recent prisoner of war exchange, which happened earlier this month, Russia had sent a deconfliction alert to Ukraine to keep Belgorod’s airspace free, Yusov said, which Ukraine had observed.
Yusov also claimed that Russian IL-76 aircraft were often used to carry S-300 missiles to forward positions, and that Russia was restocking its missiles in Belgorod region after several waves of attacks on the nearby Ukrainian city of Kharkiv.
Yusov’s comments, which cast doubt on the account given by Moscow, echo similar remarks made overnight into Thursday by Mykola Oleschuk, commander of the Ukrainian air force. “Frantic Russian propaganda is directing a stream of fake information to an external audience in an attempt to discredit Ukraine in the eyes of the world community,” he said in a statement.
Lubinets also called Moscow’s unsubstantiated account “a vivid example of Russia planning an information campaign against Ukraine in advance.” He said he has sent official letters to the UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) asking whether they were informed by Russia about a transfer of prisoners of war by plane.
Ukraine’s Security Service (SBU) on Thursday launched a criminal investigation into the crash. The government communications body also urged for an international investigation into the incident, saying “there is no evidence that any Ukrainian citizens were killed on board” and that “Russian official statements cannot be trusted.”
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Thursday it is too soon to talk about instructions from Russian President Vladimir Putin regarding the military plane crash as an investigation is still underway.
He called the downing of the IL-76 an “absolutely monstrous act” since the plane was allegedly carrying Ukrainian servicemen “who should have been at home literally in a day.”

The views expressed in this commentary are her own. Read more opinion on CNN.
It’s Oscars season and “Barbie” is dominating the discourse.
Since the nominations were announced on Tuesday, fans of Greta Gerwig’s pink-tinged fantasy have been taking to social media to make it clear that they’re not happy that Gerwig and star Margot Robbie didn’t bag nominations for their respective categories in best director and best actress (though both did receive nominations, Robbie as a producer and Gerwig for best adapted screenplay).
The outrage at their perceived omissions is so widespread that even former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has weighed in. Many feel that the fact that Ryan Gosling is nominated for best supporting actor for his performance as Ken, Barbie’s lovable-but-dim boyfriend, is reflective of the patriarchal power of the world that the film supposedly rallies against.
But here’s the thing; “Barbie” is neither smart enough nor interesting enough to be inspiring this level of uproar. When I first heard about “Barbie,” I thought I would like it. I’m a huge fan of Gerwig’s other work, especially “Frances Ha” and “Little Women,” the latter of which I am convinced is the greatest example of a perfect filmic adaptation of a book (and for which Gerwig received a nomination for best adapted screenplay, though notably not for best director).
Related article Opinion: Why the ‘Barbie’ Oscars snubs are so enraging
Of “Barbie,” I thought it might be, if nothing else, a fun time at the movies. What I found, instead, was a deeply disappointing blockbuster that offered audiences a watered-down version of feminism and which often felt like a vehicle for multimillion dollar toy company Mattel to poke fun at itself whilst using the movie as a shield from real criticism. (The distributor of “Barbie” and CNN share a parent company).
There is nothing radical about the feminism that “Barbie” puts forward. In fact, I feel that it actually lets patriarchy off the hook far too easily by suggesting – through the proxy of Ken – that men’s misogyny comes from a place of idiocy rather than malice. By depicting Ken as a dumb, hapless figure, “Barbie” makes misogyny a laughing matter, instead of what it often is – a matter of life and death for women.
“Barbie” functions only as a palatable crowd-pleaser and not as an intelligent critique of sexism. In the film, audiences have a laugh at bumbling Mattel executives. But the company will continue to make a fortune from a doll that, at least at its inception, helped to uphold unrealistic beauty standards for a generation of girls and women.

It’s also important to remember that “Barbie” has most certainly not been ignored by the Academy Awards’ members. It has eight nominations – which is far more than many of 2023’s other women-directed films got. While “Barbie” achieved cultural phenomenon status last year, other films that took a more complicated approach to womanhood were shut out of the Oscars and the mainstream awards circuit completely.
Sofia Coppola’s “Priscilla” – a claustrophobic portrait of Priscilla Presley’s marriage to Elvis – and Molly Manning Walker’s “How to Have Sex” – a devastating story of a girls’ vacation that ends in tears – received no attention from the Academy. Nor did Ava DuVernay’s groundbreaking film “Origin.” All offer far more fascinating explorations of women’s lives and interior thoughts than “Barbie,” and all are defined by their exceptional direction and their standout performances by two rising stars in Cailee Spaeny and Mia Mckenna-Bruce, as well as veteran Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor.
“Origin” is a fascinating work inspired by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Isabel Wilkerson’s book, “Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents.” “Priscilla” was directed by one of the most famous and accomplished female directors of the 21st century and “How to Have Sex” won the prestigious prize of “Un Certain Regard” at the Cannes Film Festival.  Yet all were totally overlooked by the Oscars.
Related article Opinion: The moment ‘Priscilla’ became a horror movie for me
And, ironically, the discourse swirling around Gerwig and Robbie’s supposed lack of recognition has overshadowed a truly historic moment. Lily Gladstone is up for best actress for her role in the Martin Scorsese epic “Killers of the Flower Moon” – making her the first Native woman of American descent to be nominated in the category.
Yet, in most conversations about the Oscars in recent days, Gladstone’s achievement has become something of a footnote. Energy that could be better expended by highlighting the watershed moment for Gladstone and for Native women of American descent has instead been poured into indignation over Gerwig and Robbie missing out.
As for the categories that Robbie and Gerwig were not considered for, I don’t think it’s unfair to argue that they might’ve not landed the nominations because neither have put forward their best work here. Gerwig’s direction in “Barbie” is grand in scope, no doubt, but it’s her impeccably observed depiction of a strained mother-daughter relationship in 2017’s “Lady Bird” that broke my heart and cemented her as an astute filmmaker.

Robbie does a fine job as the titular doll in “Barbie,” but she is far more affecting in the few minutes of screentime she has in Wes Anderson’s recent “Asteroid City” and far funnier in “The Wolf of Wall Street” – where her excellent comedic timing comes across much better than it does in the hollow world of “Barbie.”
With just over a month to go before the ceremony itself, don’t expect the furor over “Barbie” to go away anytime soon. But while some of its fans flood the internet with anger, it might be worth seeking out some of 2023’s other female-directed films, from A.V. Rockwell’s “A Thousand and One” to “Priscilla” and “Origin” and “How To Have Sex,” all of which offer far more nuanced and complex studies of women and all of which haven’t had so much as a whiff of winning a seat at the Oscars’ table."

She is a weekly opinion contributor to CNN, a contributing columnist to The Washington Post and a columnist for World Politics Review. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.
Elon Musk, who spends much of his time on futuristic endeavors, took a step into history on Monday. With his son on his shoulders, Musk visited a somber monument to humanity’s darkest past, the remains of the Auschwitz death camp, where the Nazis killed 1.1 million people during World War II, almost 1 million of them Jews.
That put Musk, whom many have accused of promoting antisemitism on his social media platform X, formerly Twitter, at the paramount memorial to the victims of the Holocaust, itself the zenith of industrialized hatred, which killed 6 million Jews just eight decades ago.
Why did Musk go to Auschwitz?
Was the pilgrimage one of self-reflection and atonement? Despite rising antisemitism across the globe, Musk’s trip appears to have been more of a public relations move aimed at repairing his reputation and boosting a flagging business.
Assaults, vandalism, harassment and even physical attacks against Jews had been increasing for months even before the Hamas assault inside Israel on October 7 and Israel’s subsequent fierce counterattack inside Gaza.
Once the war started, Jews, regardless of their views or connections to Israel, have been targeted to a degree they had never experienced in the United States, a country that, on the surface, seemed to be mostly free of the antisemitic virus, perhaps a lasting refuge for a minority that has been persecuted elsewhere for thousands of years.
Related article Opinion: Elon Musk’s Israel tour was transparently transactional and insulting
But suddenly antisemitism started coming out of the shadows on the far right and on the left.
Like in other entities where an upsurge in antisemitic activity started making headlines, Musk was taking performative action at Auschwitz. It was an effort to appear to be taking action while doing nothing.
After his visit to the death camp, Musk appeared at a conference on antisemitism in nearby Krakow, Poland. There, he defended his social media platform. X, he said, has less antisemitic content than other platforms. He gave no evidence to back that assertion up. But that, it seemed, was irrelevant.
There was nothing in his statements to suggest he will do anything about the problem.
Nothing suggests he will change the guidelines or even enforce X’s existing ones. A recent experiment by the Center for Countering Digital Hate, an internet monitoring group, found 98% of reported posts with shocking antisemitic, Islamophobic or anti-Palestinian content were left untouched. (X has rejected the center’s work as an effort to drive away advertisers and filed a lawsuit against it. The center says the lawsuit is an attempt to silence the organization.)
The moment Musk bought Twitter, reinstated suspended accounts and fired the content moderation staff, the platform exploded with hate speech, as documented by independent internet monitoring organizations. The verbal invective converged with real-world attacks on Jews, as cataloged by the Anti-Defamation League.
Related article Opinion: Progressives should never tolerate antisemitism
Musk’s own words amplified the surge of anti-Jewish conspiracy theories. When someone posted “Hitler was right,” accusing Jews of “hatred against whites,” Musk posted, “You have said the actual truth.”
He later apologized, calling the comment his “dumbest” ever. But it was hardly his first incendiary moment. Earlier Musk postings included one in which he declared that the Jewish financier George Soros “hates humanity.” It was described by Ted Deutch, head of the American Jewish Committee, as “The Protocols of the Elders of Zion for the internet age.” The Protocols is one of history’s foremost texts of antisemitic incitement.
Despite Musk apologizing for his endorsement of the “Hitler was right” post, advertisers fled X. The stampede accelerated after Media Matters said ads on X were appearing next to pro-Nazi and white supremacist posts. When Apple, Disney and IBM stopped advertising, Musk accused them of trying to blackmail him. X sued Media Matters.
To advertisers who left because of his antisemitic content, he said, “go f—k yourself.”
X was going into a tailspin. Ad revenue has collapsed. It was time to take action.
Unfortunately, there’s no sign that anything will change at the former Twitter, which has become a stronghold for far-right antisemites and people such as Tucker Carlson, who recently declared on X that rich Jews are funding a “white genocide.”
It’s easier to show up at a conference or a concentration camp, or to create a committee than to make real changes.
Consider Harvard University.
Related article Opinion: This unpalatable reality about antisemitism at Harvard
The school made headlines after a politically charged chain of events. President Claudine Gay was asked in Congress if calls for genocide against Jews violate Harvard rules against bullying and harassment. She said it depended on the context and later apologized. But after plagiarism charges surfaced, the embattled administrator resigned her post.
Many Jewish students said they had not wanted her to lose her job. They wanted Harvard to focus on tackling antisemitism with the same conviction with which it rejects racism or other forms of prejudice. That doesn’t seem to be happening.
A number of students have already filed a lawsuit against the school, describing it as a bastion of rampant and anti-Jewish hatred and harassment. The evidence is hard to miss.
When Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, setting on fire entire families in their homes, massacring more than 1,200 people and kidnapping hundreds more in the worst attack against Jews since the Holocaust, 31 Harvard student groups responded on that very same day, saying they held Israel “entirely responsible” and blaming Israel for the pogrom even before Israel started its military response, while the flames set by Hamas were still smoldering.
Since then, Jewish staff and students have implored the university for help in enforcing its own rules as they endure relentless harassment. A Harvard rabbi said antisemitism is “thriving” there, and after 26 years at the university, he’s “never felt so alone.”
Related article Opinion: I thought I’d be safe from antisemitism at my college. I was wrong
The popular theory of “intersectionality” has been weaponized against Jews, incredibly claiming that the most persecuted minority in history is part of a white oppressor class. That view now seems to permeate university campuses.
Across the country, 73% of Jewish students say they have seen or experienced antisemitism since the start of the 2023-2024 school year. Nearly half say they don’t feel safe on campus.
Under pressure, Harvard’s interim president, Alan Garber, just announced the appointment of the man who will co-chair its new task force on antisemitism. (Another task force on Islamophobia is being created.)
It was a moment to find a leader without controversial baggage. One who would help soothe the rifts and make a genuine effort to address the problem. Instead, Garber named a man who only recently declared that the problem of antisemitism on campus has been blown out of proportion.
Derek Penslar heads Harvard’s Center for Jewish Studies. Whatever the scholarly qualifications, he is a terrible choice for this new position. The main problem is not that he has made some startling statements about “Jewish civilization,” or that as a fierce critic of Israel he has used the language of Israel’s enemies to attack the country.

The most serious problem with the appointment of Penslar, who describes himself as “left of center,” is that he does not seem to think the problem he has been tasked with solving is a terribly serious one. Outsiders, he said, have “exaggerated” the issue. And he worried that paying attention to antisemitism is obscuring the vulnerabilities of pro-Palestinian students.
Former Harvard President Larry Summers said the university made its credibility problem worse by naming Penslar. “I am unable to reassure Harvard community members,” he wrote on X, “… that Harvard is making progress in countering anti-Semitism.”
The ADL called Penslar’s appointment, “absolutely inexcusable.”
From Musk, on the far right, to Harvard, on the left, antisemitic forces are being given a pass. Much of what we’re seeing is PR, theater, a pretense of action with little real impetus to solve what is admittedly a difficult problem — but one for which useful steps, such as improved content moderation on social media and unbiased leaders in the effort to uproot antisemitism, are plain to see."

Jerri Roby, who also goes by the last name Israel, is facing one count of first-degree murder after authorities found the body of her 42-year-old son, John Allen Gaither, behind the wall in her Gulfport home, Gulfport Police Department spokesman Jason DuCré told CNN Sunday.
Authorities started investigating on December 22, 2023, after one of Gaither’s out-of-state relatives called to report him missing, DuCré said, noting the last known contact anyone had made with Gaither was on December 10.
Police started investigating, conducted several follow-ups and “began noticing discrepancies in statements provided by Isreal [sic]. Throughout the course of the investigation, Isreal [sic] became increasingly uncooperative and changed her statements multiple times,” a news release from Gulfport police reads.

Roby had previously been convicted of murder in Florida around 1995, and “made several attempts to dump the deceased subject at different locations throughout Florida,” authorities said in the news release. Police then say they obtained a search warrant.
Detectives and crime scene technicians conducted the search of her home on January 18, the release said. As detectives walked into her home, Roby ingested a handful of unspecified pills, which prompted the need for her to be transported to a hospital for medical treatment, DuCré said.
“During the search of the residence, a wooden box containing a deceased subject, later identified as John Allen Gaither, was located behind a false wall,” the news release states.
DuCré said Roby attempted to cover up the crime by writing notes to family members, where she posed as her son, saying he was OK. Multiple homemade wooden boxes were found at the house and in the garage, DuCré said.
Roby was arrested on Saturday after she was released from the hospital and is now being held in Harrison County Detention Center without bond, according to DuCré, who said due to her past criminal record, she has been deemed a flight risk.
Information about an upcoming court appearance and Roby’s legal representation was not available Sunday."

They struck eight sites, according to the statement from the US and UK, which conducted the strikes, and Canada, the Netherlands, Bahrain, and Australia, which supported the attacks.
The latest strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen were “successful” and destroyed missiles, weapons storage sites and drone systems, according to a senior military official and a senior defense official.
The officials, who briefed reporters following the Monday afternoon operation, said the strikes “achieved the desired effect.”
It was a smaller number than the first joint operation on January 11 that struck over 30 Houthi targets. Monday’s strikes targeted a Houthi underground storage site and sites associates with Houthi missile and air surveillance, the statement added.
The US used fighter jets from the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, as well as surface vessels and a submarine to strike eight locations, the senior military official said. In all, the official said approximately 25-30 precision guided munitions were fired at the targets, including Tomahawk cruise missiles.
President Joe Biden spoke to his British counterpart UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Monday, the White House said earlier in the day, about a range of topics including security in the Red Sea.
“Our aim remains to de-escalate tensions and restore stability in the Red Sea, but let us reiterate our warning to Houthi leadership: we will not hesitate to defend lives and the free flow of commerce in one of the world’s most critical waterways in the face of continued threats,” the countries said in their statement.
For the first time, the US also struck an underground storage facility used by the Houthis, the official said. The storage site was assessed to have “more advanced conventional weaponry,” including missiles and one-way attack drones.
Grant Shapps, the UK’s secretary of state for defense, said four British Typhoon fighter jets took part in the strikes on Houthi targets. He warned that the ongoing Houthi launches against commercial vessels “threaten the lives of sailors and disrupt shipping at an intolerable cost to the global economy.”
Following the latest round of US and UK airstrikes in Yemen on Monday, Houthi leader Mohamed Ali al-Houthi said the strikes would only strengthen the Yemeni people.
“Your strikes will only make the Yemeni people stronger and more determined to confront you, as you are the aggressors against our country,” he said in a statement posted on X.
The rebel group said the US and the UK launched 18 airstrikes on four governorates Monday night.
CNN reported on Monday that the US has named the ongoing operation to target Houthi assets in Yemen “Operation Poseidon Archer,” suggesting a more organized and potentially long-term approach to the operations in Yemen that have been aimed at deterring the Iranian-backed group from attacking commercial vessels in the Red Sea.
The US has now struck Houthi targets in Yemen eight times since January 11, the majority of which the US military has carried out unilaterally. The first wave of strikes, in which the US and UK hit approximately 30 sites across Houthi-controlled Yemen, marked the beginning of Operation Poseidon Archer, one official said.
The attacks have targeted the Houthis’ one-way attack drones, anti-ship ballistic missiles, anti-ship cruise missiles and more as the US has tried to disrupt the group’s ability to fire on international shipping lanes.
In an attempt to avoid escalation, the officials said the latest strikes were specifically intended to target the Houthi weapons and supporting capabilities used to target international shipping lanes, describing them as similar in nature to the first round of coalition strikes against Houthi targets on January 11.
“We are not at this time expanding beyond that target set,” the senior military official said.
Deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh said on Monday that the Houthis had not launched a new attack on commercial shipping since January 18. The Houthis claimed on Monday to have attacked a US-owned cargo ship, the M/V Ocean Jazz, but a defense official told CNN that claim was not true.
Iran has been quietly fueling the attacks, US officials have said, enabling and supporting its proxy groups across the region. Tehran has been supplying the Houthis with tactical intelligence and weapons to help them target ships in the Red Sea, CNN previously reported. Iran has also continued to supply its proxy groups in Iraq and Syria, where US and coalition forces have come under attack over 150 times since October 17.
On Saturday, Iranian proxy militias launched one of their largest ballistic missile attacks since October on al-Asad airbase in Iraq, leaving two US service members with traumatic brain injuries, Singh said on Monday.
Biden acknowledged on Thursday that the US strikes were not stopping the Houthis, who have continued to target, and in some cases hit, US-owned commercial vessels operating off the coast of Yemen.
But Biden said the US airstrikes would continue, anyway. And Singh said on Monday that it would ultimately be up to the Houthis and the Iranian proxy groups when to end their attacks.
Singh said last week that the Pentagon’s initial assessments are that the strikes against the Houthis have been “very successful” in destroying “pretty much all of the targets that we hit,” leaving one less missile or capability that the Houthis can then deploy in the Red Sea.
The Houthis have said that they won’t stop their attacks until the war between Israel and Hamas inside Gaza comes to an end. Houthi leader Abdul Malek al-Houthi said in a speech on Thursday that it is “a great honor and blessing to be confronting America directly.”
Last week, the US Navy intercepted a vessel off the coast of Somalia destined for Houthi-controlled parts of Yemen that was carrying Iranian-made missile components, Central Command announced in a statement. That operation resulted in the deaths of two Navy SEALs who fell overboard while attempting to board the boat, CENTCOM said.
The US also carried out all of its strikes on Houthi targets last week unilaterally, in contrast to the coalition of countries that supported the first round of joint US and UK strikes on the Houthis on January 11.
Singh said on Thursday that future joint action wasn’t off the table, but that CENTCOM Commander Gen. Erik Kurilla had the authority to order strikes when he deemed it necessary to protect ships in the region, including US Naval assets stationed in the Red Sea. After each of the strikes the US conducted against the Houthis last week, CENTCOM said that the missiles the US destroyed were being prepared for imminent launch by the Houthis.
National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby told reporters on Thursday that the administration is “making it harder” for the Houthis to continue their attacks with each strike on their infrastructure. And he noted that the administration has “additional options” available to it if the Houthis don’t stop. But he declined to preview what those options might look like.
“I’m not going to telegraph punches one way or another, except to say what the president said this morning– that if the Houthis continue to go down this path, we will continue to do what we can to disrupt and degrade their ability to make those choices,” he said.
“We’re not looking for a conflict with the Houthis, we’re not looking for a conflict in the region,” he added. “But we have to be able to act in our own self-defense, not just for our ships and our sailors, but for merchant ships and merchant sailors and international shipping in the Red Sea.”

Z9MWIL3X51_MBT1KB71TNQM666,Opinion: The real problem the DeSantis withdrawal poses for Haley,Opinion by David Mark,"4 minute read Updated 7:20 AM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240122,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/22/opinions/desantis-2024-trump-haley-mark/,"Editor’s Note: David Mark is a political journalist, author and public speaker.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’s exit from the Republican nomination fight Sunday gives his former rival, former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley, the one-on-one shot against former President Donald Trump she claimed to crave from the stage following the Iowa caucuses last week. But the former South Carolina governor is only likely to be hurt by the nomination race moving in that direction.
DeSantis’s supporters, limited though they were, comprise one more group of voters from which Trump can add to his already healthy lead over Haley. And DeSantis himself is no longer around as a political deflector shield as Haley heads into Tuesday’s crucial New Hampshire primary.
A CNN poll released Sunday, before DeSantis withdrew from the race, found he was the first choice of 6% of likely New Hampshire GOP primary voters. That put him far behind in the poll, conducted by the University of New Hampshire, with 50% of likely New Hampshire GOP primary voters backing Trump and Haley garnering 39%.
When DeSantis’s supporters were reallocated to their second-choice candidate, however, Haley’s support widened slightly, to 41%. But Trump’s support ticked up to 54%. Another 3% of likely GOP primary voters said they’d vote for someone else.
This isn’t particularly surprising, since the whole concept of DeSantis’s campaign was being a Trump mini-me. In Florida, he picked culture issue fights over the content of social studies textbooks, played up Covid-19 pandemic issues and tangled with the state’s largest employer, Disney, among other actions that were likely to play well with the populist right.

In his GOP nomination bid, DeSantis — who endorsed Trump on Sunday — even tried to chastise the former president from the right for his administration’s supposedly insufficient results in converting MAGA policy proposals into law.
But Haley was eager to show that DeSantis, who was only able to eke out a second-place showing in Iowa despite camping out in the state and at one point leading Trump in the polls, was flagging at the same time she was rising. She seemed to think this would give her more momentum and credibility as the race turned to friendlier territory in New Hampshire.
The make-up of New Hampshire’s Republican primary electorate and Haley’s stronger showing in the polls there also likely factored into Haley’s possible miscalculation. Trump lost New Hampshire in the general elections of both 2016 and 2020. And the state, which doesn’t have as many of the evangelical voters who favor the former president, does have a large independent voter pool. In a reflection of how she’s potentially a better fit for the Granite State than Trump, New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu has been a prominent endorser of Haley.
Some of Haley’s tactics also may have backfired, like pulling out of two debates with DeSantis in recent days unless Trump participated. The idea was to emphasize that her real opponent is Trump. But in doing so, Haley relinquished two high-profile chances to present herself to the undeclared part of the New Hampshire electorate her campaign is now courting so aggressively.
Related article Opinion: Biden’s supporters need to get real about Trump, and fast
Haley risks being victimized by the “bandwagon” effect some researchers have identified in which voters want to go with the perceived winner. A 2014 paper by Neil Malhotra of Stanford and David Rothschild of Microsoft Research showed that some voters do switch sides to feel accepted and to be a part of the winning team. To them, DeSantis dropping out (and quickly endorsing Trump) wouldn’t make Haley look like the safer bet, but Trump.
Haley tried to make the best of DeSantis’s move.
“We’re not a country of coronations,” Haley said in a late afternoon statement. “Voters deserve a say in whether we go down the road of Trump and Biden again, or we go down a new conservative road.”
But with DeSantis’s departure coming a bit over 48 hours before polls close in New Hampshire on Tuesday night, she may be hard-pressed to do better than a second-place finish behind Trump if he indeed gets 50% or more.
While finishing a relatively close second would normally allow for bragging rights against a former president who is effectively a quasi-incumbent, she faces a serious calendar and geography challenge. The South Carolina primary, in Haley’s home state, isn’t until February 24. That gives Trump plenty of time to build on his already considerable Palmetto State Republican support, with lots of GOP elected officials, backing him and no other early states where she looks to have a shot at finishing first.
Moreover, it’s not just Trump’s campaign that is galvanizing against her. With DeSantis out, the Republican establishment is rallying hard behind Trump. Sen. Steve Daines of Montana, who heads the Senate Republican campaign arm, made that point explicitly in an X post late Sunday afternoon less than two hours after DeSantis quit.

“Donald Trump is the presumptive nominee. I am encouraging every Republican to unite behind him because it will take all of us to defeat Joe Biden, take back the Senate, and hold the House,” wrote Daines, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee.
This rally-around-Trump message likely makes Haley supporters even more of an isolated minority in the GOP firmament. Heading into voting Tuesday, DeSantis’s withdrawal only exacerbates her challenge."
ZBS8VSS91Q_MDE14A6ZLF8JS2J,Haley remains defiant as Trump ratchets up attacks on last-standing 2024 GOP rival,"By Eric Bradner, Arit John, Alayna Treene, Kylie Atwood and MJ Lee, CNN","10 minute read Updated 8:32 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/25/politics/nikki-haley-trump-republican-primary/,"Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley is growing more defiant in the face of Donald Trump’s efforts to push her out of the 2024 Republican primary race, poking and prodding at the former president and encouraging supporters to wear Trump’s attacks as a badge of honor.
Returning to her home state Wednesday, Haley mocked Trump’s victory speech in New Hampshire the night earlier — one in which the former president raged about the concession speech Haley had just delivered.
She said Trump “pitched a fit,” called him “insecure” and declared he “should feel threatened, without a doubt.” She cast doubt on his mental competency — the same line of attack Trump and his allies have long leveled at President Joe Biden — and dared Trump to debate her one-on-one.
“Bring it, Donald,” she said in North Charleston. “Show me what you got.”
Haley’s increasingly pointed attacks on Trump come amid pressure from many Republicans for her to drop out of the 2024 primary race so that the party can coalesce around the former president — who is seeking a third consecutive nomination.
Polls show Haley is far behind Trump in South Carolina, where many of her former allies have turned on her and the Republican primary electorate is much more conservative than that of New Hampshire — where she lost to Trump by 11 points.
Still, she remains a thorn in the former president’s side, provoking his ire in ways the 2024 Republican presidential contenders he’s already dispatched never did.

And Haley’s aides say that’s intentional.
Her campaign is bracing for Trump to go too far in attacking Haley and believes those attacks are likely to boost her support in South Carolina. One campaign official said Trump’s attacks would be a “key piece” of Haley’s pathway to winning over Palmetto State voters ahead of the February 24 primary.
It’s the same strategy she used in her home state in 2010 — when she seized on allegations of affairs and racist attacks to fend off three Republican primary rivals in the governor’s race.
“Those attacks were one part of why she won,” the campaign official said. “South Carolinians didn’t like it then and they won’t like nasty attacks now.”
With Haley refusing to drop out of the race, Trump has shifted from viewing her as a primary rival to a full-blown enemy, and has grown increasingly angry with her, sources close to the former president said.
“Before she was a gnat. Now she is an enemy, and Trump plans to bludgeon her in the lead-up to South Carolina,” a person who spoke with Trump following his victory in New Hampshire told CNN.
He is also targeting Haley’s donors, warning that they’ll be “permanently barred” from his orbit if they continue to contribute her campaign.
“Nikki ‘Birdbrain’ Haley is very bad for the Republican Party and, indeed, our Country. Her False Statements, Derogatory Comments, and Humiliating Public Loss, is demeaning to True American Patriots,” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform Wednesday night.
“Anybody that makes a ‘Contribution’ to Birdbrain, from this moment forth, will be permanently barred from the MAGA camp. We don’t want them, and will not accept them, because we Put America First, and ALWAYS WILL!” he said.
Haley’s campaign leaned into those attacks Thursday, releasing T-shirts emblazoned with the words“Barred. Permanently.” Haley posted a photo of the new T-shirts on social media, saying, “Enough said … Grab your shirt here.”
Haley also told supporters in North Charleston that her campaign had already raised $1 million after her concession speech and Trump’s election night address in New Hampshire.
Trump’s latest attacks are an escalation of weeks of digs at Haley, who served as his US ambassador to the United Nations.
Trump has already attacked Haley with a racist dog whistle, referring to her on Truth Social by her first name Nimarata, which he misspelled “Nimrada” and later “Nimbra.” He has also falsely suggested Haley is not eligible for the presidency.
Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants, was born Nimarata Nikki Randhawa. She has gone by “Nikki” since childhood and took her husband Michael Haley’s last name after they married. The attacks were reminiscent of Trump referring to former President Barack Obama by his middle name, Hussein, and demanding to see his birth certificate.
“It’s a little bit of a take off on her name — you know, her name, wherever she may come from,” Trump said of Haley on Fox News.
Trump and his campaign had hopes that a win in New Hampshire would effectively end the GOP presidential primary, his advisers said. They are eager to declare that the former president has become the presumptive Republican nominee as soon as possible and pivot their efforts toward a general election rematch with Biden.
Emboldened by the flood of endorsements he has received in recent days — from former primary rivals, congressional leaders and governors — Trump personally believes the party has fallen in line and wants to move forward with the weight of the GOP behind him, his advisers said. But from Trump’s point of view, Haley is getting in the way.
Haley’s decision to stick it out for now has infuriated the former president, the sources said, and he is now determined to hurt her as much as possible ahead of South Carolina, where his campaign will continue to try and paint Haley as being unpopular with people in her own backyard.
“We need to unite around our eventual nominee, which is Donald Trump,” Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said Tuesday on Fox News.
The Trump campaign had initially approved going forward with a draft RNC resolution to formally declare Trump the party’s presumptive 2024 nominee and the former president himself was also on board until backlash began, a source familiar told CNN.
Trump wrote on Truth Social that he appreciated the effort but was opposing it “for the sake of Party unity” and wanted to “finish the process off AT THE BALLOT BOX.” Dave Bossie, an RNC committeeman from Maryland who recently endorsed Trump, withdrew the resolution Thursday night, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN, but not before Haley’s campaign began fundraising off of it.

“The RNC is leveraging the establishment to try and crown Trump the presumptive nominee,” Haley wrote in a fundraising email. “Well I have news for them: I’m in this to win it and I’m not going anywhere.”
Trump’s attempts to embarrass Haley were on display in New Hampshire. In the final days before the GOP primary there, Trump paraded a series of South Carolina Republican officials onstage at his rallies, including Gov. Henry McMaster, Lt. Gov. Pamela Evette and multiple congressmen.
For Trump’s victory speech Tuesday night, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott — a onetime presidential rival whom Haley appointed to the Senate in 2012 — stood onstage behind Trump days after endorsing him.
“She actually appointed you, Tim,” Trump said. “You must really hate her.”
Scott stepped forward and leaned into the microphone in an effort to defuse the situation. “I just love you,” he said.
“That’s why he’s a great politician,” Trump responded.
Even as her campaign team plans for a monthlong fight in South Carolina, officials say Haley is gaugingthe support of donors and taking the temperature of longtime supporters about her path forward. Those private conversations could help influence any campaign decisions.
Trump did not do well with independents in New Hampshire, which further bolsters Haley’s argument that he would lose in the general election, her aides said. Haley got the vote of about 6 out of 10 independent voters in New Hampshire, according to CNN exit polls.
Art Pope, a North Carolina retail magnate who is supporting Haley, sharply criticized Trump’s threat to blacklist the former governor’s donors, saying it “emboldens me” and only increases his commitment to her candidacy for the GOP presidential nomination.
“I and most Americans do not respond well to a bully,” Pope, an influential player in North Carolina Republican politics, told CNN on Thursday while noting that he voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020. “President Trump wants to be the leader of the country … but rather than unifying, reaching out and building support, he’s basically telling us to go away and take a hike and threatening us. I decline to be threatened. I’m not going to be intimidated.”
He said Haley clearly is “getting under the skin” of someone “who wants an anointment, rather than letting the voters have a choice in the primaries.”
However, other donors, including a prominent Democrat who had crossed party lines in a bid to stop Trump, said they will no longer back Haley’s efforts financially after her loss in New Hampshire.
Reid Hoffman, the co-founder of LinkedIn and a prominent Democratic donor who initially gave $250,000 to the pro-Haley super PAC, SFA Fund Inc., has no plans to continue donating to Haley’s presidential campaign after she lost the New Hampshire primary, his adviser Dmitri Mehlhorn said.
“If she had won New Hampshire there would have been a huge push to raise many tens of millions for her to build on that momentum in SC and Super Tuesday. The investment was based on winning NH,” Mehlhorn told CNN.
Haley’s campaign declined to comment on the donor moves.
Biden campaign officials have been privately cheering on Haley’s decision to stay in the presidential race, sources say, as they monitor Trump lashing out at her.
The Biden campaign made clear after the New Hampshire primary that it fully believes Trump will be the president’s GOP opponent. Still, Biden’s reelection team has welcomed seeing Haley prolong the Republican contest and force the Trump campaign to use its resources and time to attack her.
“Go forth and prosper,” one Biden campaign official said in describing the team’s delight to see the Trump-Haley battle continue.
The Biden campaign account on Truth Social has amplified some of Haley’s ongoing attacks on Trump, including her saying in an interview this week that Trump is prone to throwing “temper tantrums” when he is nervous or feels threatened.
Haley and her supporters have embraced her status as a long-shot candidate, drawing connections to tough fights she has waged, and won, at the start of her political career in South Carolina.
“This is nothing new to her,” said South Carolina state Rep. Nathan Ballentine, a longtime Haley ally. “She’s always been the underdog, and frankly, she thrives in that environment.”
She won her first race, a 2004 contest for a state House seat, after beating a 30-year incumbent in a Republican primary by 9 points.
Six years later, she faced the real test of her political fortitude during her 2010 bid for governor. First, a key political ally – South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford – became a major liability after he revealed he’d secretly left the country to visit his mistress in Argentina.
“People looked at me with pity,” Haley wrote in her 2012 autobiography. “They no longer treated me like a real candidate. Worst of all, no one returned my calls.”
Fundraising dried up, and Haley’s campaign directed most of its funds to TV. She ran on a shoestring budget with donated office space and supplies, and charged supporters for yard signs.
“Any other person probably would have just quit and caved in there, but she knew that South Carolina needed her,” Ballentine said.
Haley went on to win the endorsement of Sarah Palin, which helped propel her in a GOP primary field that included McMaster, then the state’s attorney general, the state lieutenant governor and a congressman. And she stayed in after two men claimed without evidence that she’d had extramarital affairs. Haley won the nomination in a runoff election by about 30 points.

The pressure Haley may have faced to drop out in 2010 is a fraction of the national pressure she’s facing now. The Republican Party has also changed dramatically since then. There is no Palin-figure whose endorsement might change the tide of the race – an overwhelming majority of South Carolina politicians, as well as national leaders, have fallen in line behind Trump.
That hasn’t stopped Haley from attempting to get under his skin.
“I think part of her strategy is to make him mad, which seems to be very effective,” said Chip Felkel, a South Carolina GOP strategist not working for any campaign. “He gets off script, he says stupid stuff, he tweets stupid things, and it’s been indicative that he’s not controlled.”
Felkel, who described Haley’s approach as “guerrilla warfare,” said he doesn’t think she can win South Carolina but speculated that she may try to stay in until the convention.
“She got a lot of fight in her, but at some point conventional wisdom says you’ve got to get a W somewhere or the mind dries up,” Felkel said. “And maybe she’s banked enough, going to be judicious enough with it, that she thinks she can be in for the long haul.”

ZCRDY4FBN3_FDXNAYWCKTHQPFK,Ancient DNA offers new evidence in long-standing syphilis theory,"By Katie Hunt, CNN","6 minute read Updated 5:25 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240124,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/24/world/syphilis-bacteria-origins-scn/,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.
The English, Germans and Italians called it the French disease. Polish people dubbed it the German disease, while Russians blamed it on Poles. In France, it was named the “Neapolitan disease” after the French army got infected during its invasion of Naples, Italy, in the first documented syphilis epidemic.
The origins of syphilis — a sexually transmitted infection that devastated 15th century Europe and is still prevalent today — have remained murky, difficult to study and the subject of some debate.
One long-standing theory is that the disease emerged in the Americas and migrated to Europe after the expeditions led by Christopher Columbus returned from the New World, but a new study suggests the true story is more complicated.
Genetic information about ancient pathogens can be preserved in bones, dental plaque, mummified bodies and historical medical specimens, extracted and studied — a field known as paleopathology.
Research published Wednesday in the journal Nature used paleopathology techniques on 2,000-year-old bones unearthed in Brazil in an attempt to shed more light on when and where syphilis originated. The study resulted in scientists recovering the earliest known genomic evidence of Treponema pallidum, the bacterium that causes syphilis and two other related diseases, which is reliably dated to long before the first trans-Atlantic contacts.
“This study is incredibly exciting because it is the first truly ancient treponemal DNA that has been recovered from archaeological human remains that are more than a few hundred years old,” said Brenda J. Baker, a professor of anthropology at Arizona State University, who wasn’t involved with the study.
Without treatment, syphilis can cause physical disfigurement, blindness and mental impairment. As a sexually transmitted disease, it has long carried a stigma — hence the past attempts by different populations to blame outbreaks on neighboring groups or countries.
It’s particularly complex to study both the disease and the pathogen responsible for it, said Molly Zuckerman, a professor and codirector of the Bioarchaeology Laboratories, New and Old World, at Mississippi State University, who wasn’t involved in the research.
“It was only in 2017 that researchers were able to culture T. p pallidum for the first time, even though we’ve known it’s the cause of syphilis for over one hundred years,” Zuckerman said in an email. “It’s still costly and cumbersome to study in the lab. There are many reasons that, despite our best efforts, it’s one of the least well understood common bacterial infections.”
The timing and sudden onset of the first documented syphilis epidemic in the late 15th century is what led many historians to conclude that it arrived in Europe after the Columbus expeditions. Others believe T. pallidum bacteria always had a global distribution but perhaps grew in virulence after initially manifesting as a mild disease.
“It is very clear that Europeans took a number of diseases (including smallpox) to the New World, decimating the native populations, so the hypothesis that the New World ‘gave syphilis to Europe’ was attractive to some,” noted Sheila A. Lukehart, professor emeritus in the department of medicine, infectious disease and global health at the University of Washington, who didn’t take part in the study.
Gene that protected humans 5,000 years ago may be linked to debilitating modern disease
Syphilis is closely related but distinct from two other subspecies or lineages of treponemal disease, nonsexually transmitted illnesses that have similar symptoms that are known as bejel and yaws and were also a focus of the new research.
The team behind the new study examined 99 bones from the archaeological site known as Jabuticabeira II from the Laguna region of Santa Catarina on the Brazilian coast. Some bones had marks characteristic of infection with T. pallidum — the bacteria effectively eat away at bones, leaving concave lesions.
Bone samples from four people yielded sufficient genetic data for the team to analyze, with one producing what study author Verena Schünemann, an assistant professor at the University of Zurich’s Institute of Evolutionary Medicine, described as a high-coverage genome, detailed enough for fine-grained analysis.
The analysis revealed that the pathogen responsible for the lesions was most closely related to the modern subspecies of T. pallidium that causes bejel, a disease found today in arid regions of Africa and the Middle East that has similar symptoms to syphilis.
The finding adds strength to previous suggestions that civilizations in the Americas experienced treponemal infections in pre-Columbian times, and that treponemal disease was already present in the New World at least 500 years before Columbus set sail.
Schünemann said the new findings do not mean the venereal syphilis that caused the 15th century epidemic came to Europe from the Americas at the time of Columbus. A similar study conducted previously by her team found T. pallidum bacteria in human remains in Finland, Estonia and the Netherlands from the early modern period (early 1400s onward), suggesting that some forms of treponemal disease, if not syphilis, were already in circulation on the continent at the time of Columbus’ expeditions to the New World.
What’s more, the genome recovered from the Brazilian sample provided a bacterial family tree going back thousands of years, suggesting that T. pallidum bacteria first evolved to infect humans as far back as 12,000 years ago. It was possible, Schünemann said, that the bacteria could have been brought to the Americas by its first inhabitants who crossed into the continent from Asia.
“I think that the story is way more complex than the Columbian hypothesis could have ever imagined,” she said.
Superbug crisis threatens to kill 10 million per year by 2050. Scientists may have a solution
Mathew Beale, a senior scientist in bacterial evolutionary genomics at the Wellcome Sanger Institute near Cambridge, England, agreed with Schünemann’s assessment, saying in an email that the study did not “prove or disprove the central tenet of the Columbian hypothesis itself — that Columbus’s voyage led to the importation of Treponema and led to the outbreaks of the 1500s and then to modern day syphilis.”
“This is mainly because the bacteria sequenced is not a direct ancestor of the strain that causes modern syphilis. … (I)t is a sister species. This could mean the various treponematoses were already very widely spread around the world, and could even predate the ancient migration and population of the Americas,” said Beale, who wasn’t involved in the research.
“It could alternatively mean that lots of different treponematoses were present in the New World, and one of those, only distantly related to the ancient genomes from this paper, was indeed imported by Columbus and his peers,” he added.
Further research on ancient genomes from across the world might be able to solve the mystery, illuminating which subspecies of the bacteria were present in Europe and the New World before the voyages of Columbus, according to Lukehart.
“The bigger scientific question now is not about syphilis, but is about the distribution of the three subspecies around the globe, particularly in pre-Columbian samples,” Lukehart said.
“The modern tools available for extracting DNA from ancient samples, for enriching the treponemal DNA, and obtaining deep sequencing from samples has rapidly increased our understanding of the Treponema.”"
ZDY7B74JPE_94KCNDCDXTHX5CX,Exclusive: House ethics probe of Gaetz seeks information from DOJ and woman who allegedly had sex with congressman as a minor,"By Paula Reid and Annie Grayer, CNN","4 minute read Updated 6:55 PM EST, Wed January 24, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/24/politics/house-ethics-matt-gaetz/,"The House Ethics Committee investigating Rep. Matt Gaetz has reached out to the woman whom the congressman allegedly had sexual relations with when she was a 17-year-old minor, according to a source familiar with the committee’s work.
The outreach, which has not previously been reported, is a sign that the GOP-led committee’s investigation into the Florida Republican has recently expanded to include questioning around allegations of sex crimes.
Sources said the committee also has reached out to the Justice Department requesting materials from its investigation into Gaetz, which included allegations of lobbying violations, sex-trafficking and possible obstruction of justice. The federal probe, which also included allegations he had sex with a minor, concluded in 2023 with no charges brought against the congressman.
Gaetz has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, including ever having sex with a minor or paying for sex.
“Those allegations were not true, have never been true, and the people who spread those lies have been exposed, indicted, and imprisoned,” Gaetz said in response to CNN Wednesday.
The Ethics Committee’s outreach to the young woman and the Justice Department comes amid a new flurry of activity in the probe, including outreach to multiple other witnesses and starting to conduct witness interviews. The increased activity under Republican leadership is notable given the committee probe was started by House Democrats in 2021.
Gaetz, who led the charge to oust former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, has privately blamed McCarthy for the committee restarting its probe under the California Republican’s watch.
But McCarthy has repeatedly denounced those accusations and has said Gaetz worked to oust the former speaker because of the ethics probe.
“I don’t believe them to be conservatives,” McCarthy said in November, referring to the eight Republicans who voted to oust him. “It’s driven by Gaetz, and it was all based upon an ethics complaint that happened in the last Congress. He would throw his country away to try to protect himself for what would come out as the truth.”
The Ethics Committee and Department of Justice declined to comment.
The Justice Department does not have to comply with a voluntary request from the House Ethics Committee, said Norman Eisen, who served as counsel to House Democrats in former President Donald Trump’s first impeachment.
“If a request seems merited, as part of the usual accommodation process between the legislative and executive branches, DOJ will sometimes provide some information,” Eisen said, “but they tend to be withholding of sensitive investigative materials.”
Even when the House issues a subpoena, the Justice Department typically holds back much of their internal investigative materials, Eisen said. “They will sometimes provide a specific piece of evidence when the House shows a strong need and is not otherwise able to obtain it,” he added.
In late 2020, under Trump-appointed Attorney General Bill Barr, the Justice Department opened an investigation into allegations Gaetz may have had sexual contact with a minor. The probe expanded over the years before the Justice Department officially decided last year not to charge the congressman.
As part of the sprawling investigation, Joel Greenberg, a former Florida tax collector and close confidant of Gaetz, pleaded guilty in 2021 to six federal charges, including soliciting and paying the minor in the Gaetz allegation for sex.
The Ethics Committee, controlled at the time by Democrats, originally opened its Gaetz investigation in 2021, publicly announcing that it was examining a range of allegations including that Gaetz violated sex trafficking laws, shared inappropriate images or videos on the House floor, used illicit drugs, converted campaign funds to personal use and accepted a bribe, among other claims.
The committee deferred its investigation at the request of the Justice Department, which was simultaneously probing the allegations, but resumed its work in after the DOJ concluded its investigation without bringing charges.
A source familiar with the House panel’s work previously told CNN that the Justice Department’s decision not to bring charges against Gaetz does not impact what the committee will and won’t investigate. The committee plans to examine the same allegations they were looking into when they opened the investigation in 2021, the source told CNN."
ZN7LACJ3NL_MRMRLZ3FL9LPY7F,Trials of Michigan school shooter’s parents set to test limits of who’s responsible for a mass shooting,"By Eric Levenson, CNN","8 minute read Updated 5:09 PM EST, Thu January 25, 2024",20240125,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/25/us/james-jennifer-crumbley-school-shooting-trial/,"The parents of Ethan Crumbley, the teenager who in 2021 opened fire at his high school in Oxford, Michigan, are going on trial for manslaughter in cases that will test the limits of who is responsible for a mass shooting.
James and Jennifer Crumbley have pleaded not guilty to four charges of involuntary manslaughter for their alleged roles in their son’s rampage, which left four students dead and seven others wounded. They face up to 15 years in prison.
They are standing trial separately. Opening statements in Jennifer Crumbley’s trial began Thursday, and James Crumbley’s trial is tentatively scheduled to start March 5.
In bringing manslaughter charges, prosecutors alleged the gunman’s parents are also responsible for the students’ deaths – a novel and unusual legal theory.
“Jennifer Crumbley didn’t pull the trigger that day, but she is responsible for those deaths,” Oakland County assistant prosecutor Marc Keast said in opening statements.
In particular, prosecutors accuse the gunman’s parents of disregarding the risks when they bought a gun for their son four days before the shooting, even though he was struggling with his mental health and contemplating violence. They also say the parents did not mention the gun to school officials in a meeting to discuss Ethan’s disturbing drawings just hours before the fatal shooting.

“Despite her knowledge of his deteriorating mental crisis, despite her knowledge of his growing social isolation, despite the fact that it’s illegal for a 15-year-old to walk into a gun store and walk out with a handgun by himself, this gun was gifted,” Keast said.
“Even with all of that,” on the day of the shooting, “Jennifer Crumbley was still given the opportunity to prevent these murders from ever happening,” Keast said. “Instead, she chose to do nothing.”
The parents’ defense attorneys have argued the charges have no legal justification, but appeals courts have upheld them.
In the defense’s opening statements, attorney Shannon Smith said Jennifer Crumbley did not know about her son’s deteriorating mental state and could not have reasonably foreseen he would use the gun in a mass shooting. Instead, Smith pushed blame on her husband for purchasing the firearm and on the school for failing to notify her about her son’s problematic behavior. Jennifer Crumbley plans to testify to explain her side of the story, Smith said.
“She is going to take the stand and tell you about her life with her son, about the day he became the shooter, and about the day he did something she could have never anticipated or fathomed or predicted,” Smith said. “She will tell you that when she saw the materials in this case, she learned that her son had not been her son for months. That he had been manipulating her, he had been hiding things from her, he had been sending alarming text messages to other people.”
“You will hear that the school never advised Mrs. Crumbley of problematic issues that, if she had heard about, she would have jumped right on top of it,” Smith added.
Parents have been charged for their child’s actions before, but not in this specific way, according to Misty Marris, a trial attorney who has followed the case.
“It’s not the first time that a parent has been held liable in some capacity for the acts of a child or a shooter, however, usually those charges relate to child neglect or manifest as a failure to keep a firearm locked up,” Marris said. “This is very different because it’s actually holding them responsible for the killings.”

Ethan Crumbley, speaking at his sentencing hearing in December, said, “They did not know, and I did not tell them what I planned to do, so they are not at fault for what I’ve done.” His testimony about his parents’ knowledge of his mental health struggles could be key, but it’s not clear at this point whether he will testify.
His attorneys have indicated he will invoke his Fifth Amendment right to silence if called to testify, as the appeal of his sentence remains open. In court Tuesday, Jennifer Crumbley asked the judge to compel her son and his two jail psychiatrists to testify, while the shooter’s attorneys indicated they will not waive privilege or confidentiality for his medical records, the testimony of his doctors or his own testimony.
Marris said the trials will particularly focus on what the parents did not do, and whether that makes them responsible. “That’s why this is a tricky case because a lot of it is based on omission, not action,” she said. “A lot of criminal culpability is because you did something, not because you failed to do something. That’s why this legal argument is so novel and new and actually pretty groundbreaking.”
The evidence and arguments may also differ for each parent. Jennifer and James Crumbley had been working toward a joint defense, but their cases were separated after their defense learned of a conflict between the two. According to a prosecution filing from last year, Jennifer Crumbley “placed blame” on her husband in the shooting, leading to the split.
On November 30, 2021, Ethan Crumbley, 15 at the time, took a gun from an unlocked container in his home, hid it in his backpack and took it out in a bathroom before opening fire on his schoolmates.
He has pleaded guilty to one count of terrorism causing death, four counts of murder and 19 other charges related to the deadly rampage, and last year was sentenced to life in prison without parole.
In court Thursday, the first two witnesses were educators at Oxford High School, including Molly Darnell, a teacher who was shot in the arm. In addition, Cammy Back, an employee at an Oxford store that sells guns, testified she sold a 9 mm Sig Sauer firearm to James Crumbley on November 26, 2021, with Ethan there as well.
With ATF special agent Brett Brandon on the stand, prosecutors showed a series of videos of Ethan Crumbley shooting at the gun range with his father in the months before the attack. Ethan and Jennifer Crumbley went to the gun range on November 27, and they took turns shooting, surveillance video showed. “Mom & son day testing out his new Xmas present,” she wrote afterward in an Instagram post. “My first time shooting a 9mm I hit the bullseye.”
Further, Ethan texted a video to a friend just after midnight on August 20, 2021, showing him holding and loading a pistol inside his house. “My dad left it out so I thought, ‘Why not’ lol” he wrote.
In pre-trial hearings, prosecutors introduced text messages and other evidence they said showed his parents ignored clear warning signs.
According to phone evidence, Ethan had texted a friend saying he was experiencing hallucinations and hearing voices and had asked his parents to take him to a doctor. In response, his dad gave him pills and told him to “suck it up,” and his mom laughed at him, according to the texts.
Days later, when the school notified them that Ethan had been searching online for ammo on his phone, Jennifer Crumbley texted her son: “LOL I’m not mad at you. You have to learn not to get caught,” according to prosecutors.
Finally, on the morning of the shooting, a teacher found a drawing from Ethan showing a gun and a person bleeding along with the phrases, “the thoughts won’t stop help me,” “blood everywhere” and “my life is useless.” His parents were called into school for a meeting, but they did not inform the school Ethan had access to a gun and declined to take him out of classes for the day.
Shortly after, Ethan took the gun out of his backpack and opened fire.
His parents have been held in jail since they were arrested on manslaughter charges days after the shooting.
There have been several other cases in which parents were charged for shootings carried out by their children, though not one in a school mass shooting.
For example, the father of the July 4 mass shooter in the Chicago suburb of Highland Park, Illinois, was accused of wrongdoing for signing his son’s application for an Illinois Firearm Owners Identification card months after his son displayed concerning behavior. The father, Robert Crimo Jr., ultimately pleaded guilty to misdemeanor reckless conduct charges and agreed to serve 60 days in jail.
In a similar vein, the mother of a 6-year-old boy who shot his teacher at a Virginia school last year faced charges. The boy’s mother ultimately pleaded guilty to a state child neglect charge and felony charges of unlawful use of a controlled substance while possessing a firearm and making a false statement while purchasing a firearm.

Frank Vandervort, clinical professor of law at the University of Michigan Law School, said parents can be held responsible for their children’s actions, such as for truancy. But the level of severity in the case of the Crumbleys is different.
“We do impose on parents certain obligations regarding their children, to say you have a heightened degree of responsibility for what happens when your kids do things. That’s generally in the law,” he said. “The severity of the charges, I think, are what’s unique here.”
Could these cases set a new precedent for parents?
In a written opinion filed last March, a panel of judges for the state’s appellate court acknowledged the possible precedent-setting nature of these cases but called the situation unique and unusual.
“We share defendants’ concern about the potential for this decision to be applied in the future to parents whose situation viz-a-viz their child’s intentional conduct is not as closely tied together, and/or the warning signs and evidence were not as substantial as they are here,” wrote the panel.
The opinion said those concerns are “significantly diminished” by the fact that Ethan Crumbley’s actions “were reasonably foreseeable, and that is the ultimate test that must be applied.”
Vandervort similarly said he believed these cases were so unusual and uncommon that the impact would be limited.
“I don’t anticipate there’s going to be a lot of this kind of thing filed. I think this is a pretty unique case,” he said. “It’s hard to talk about shootings by teenagers as being run of the mill. Unless you’ve got really unusual factual situations, I don’t anticipate a lot of parents getting charged.”
Even so, Joey Jackson, a CNN legal analyst, said the prosecution’s broad goal in bringing these cases was to deter other parents.
“They want to deter other parents from being negligent,” he said. “They want to make sure we have diligent parents who don’t put their kids in a position where they can gain access to firearms easily.”

ZTQ1GCXS6V_3NTCGFYFKXVMKQT,Climate-threatened Tuvalu holds election closely watched by China and Taiwan,Story by Reuters,"3 minute read Published 4:31 AM EST, Fri January 26, 2024",20240126,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/26/asia/tuvalu-election-china-taiwan-us-climate-intl/,"Voting began on Friday in the tiny Pacific island nation of Tuvalu in a national election that is being closely watched by China, Taiwan, the United States and its ally Australia, amid a tussle for influence in the region.
Tuvalu, with a population of about 11,200 spread across nine islands, has campaigned at international conferences for greater action to help low-lying nations address climate change, because science shows its capital Funafuti risks being inundated by tides by 2050.
Most of Tuvalu is forecast to be flooded by high tides by 2100, says the United Nations Development Programme, which is working with Tuvalu to bolster its coastline.
A contest for influence in the Pacific between China and the United States has seen Tuvalu courted, with Washington recently pledging to connect its remote population by undersea cable to global telecommunications for the first time.

Tuvalu is one of three remaining Pacific allies of Taiwan, after Nauru cut ties this month and switched to Beijing, which pledged more development support.
Taiwan on Thursday said China was trying to influence the Tuvalu election and “seize our diplomatic allies.” China’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
China views democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory and not entitled to diplomatic ties. Taiwan rejects China’s sovereignty claim.
Contenders for Tuvalu’s leadership have all advocated for climate change action on the world stage, but differ in approaches to ties with Taiwan, a diplomatic ally since 1979.
Tuvalu’s Finance Minister Seve Paeniu, who has secured a seat in the new parliament as one of only two candidates for the Nukulaelae island electorate, told Reuters he expects Taiwan ties to be reviewed after the election.
The new government should decide whether Taiwan or China can best respond to Tuvalu’s development needs, he said.

Prime Minister Kausea Natano has told Taiwan he continues to support ties, Taiwan said.
Enele Sopoaga, ousted as prime minister by Natano at the 2019 election, and former foreign minister Simon Kofe, have previously pledged support for Taiwan.There are no political parties, and two lawmakers will be chosen by voters in each of eight island electorates.
After votes are counted, government boats collect the new lawmakers from islands and bring them to the capital Funafuti, a journey that can take up to 27 hours. The prime minister is chosen by the newly elected lawmakers. Natano and Kofe are running in the seat of Funafuti.
Kofe attracted global headlines in 2021 when he delivered a speech to the United Nations climate change summit standing knee deep in water to highlight the plight of the low-lying nation.
Tuvalu signed a security and migration agreement with Australia in November that allows Canberra to vet security ties. Sopoaga has rejected the Australia deal, while Kofe said some aspects should be revised."
ZVSNG1UBA1_OYV8PEGM583HHWG,This hidden BBQ joint is taking Dubai’s food scene by storm,"Story by Rebecca Cairns, CNN; Video by Ana DeOliva, CNN","5 minute read Published 4:27 AM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240122,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/big-t-bbq-dubai-texas-hidden-barbecue-joint-hnk-spc-intl/,"Editor’s Note: This CNN series is, or was, sponsored by the destination it highlights.

Al Quoz Industrial Area 4 looks much like the other three: a vast complex of low-rise warehouses, dusty roads passing factories and storage units, trucks and lorries ferrying goods to and fro. It looks nothing like the Dubai of travel brochures or Instagram — no iconic skyscrapers, no golden beachfront, no glitzy lights, no luxe resorts.
But among the clutter of concrete and corrugated iron of Al Quoz 4 is a restaurant that’s quickly turning the neighborhood into a must-visit for foodies: Big T’s BBQ.
The humble Texas-style barbecue joint, named after its owner, founder, and head chef Fadel “Big Tasty” Faour, is only open three days a week but has garnered a cult following of loyal customers who are willing to queue for up to an hour to grab a portion of its famous brisket.
“I’m proud and honored that I’ve received a lot of attention from people who love to explore food,” says the Palestinian chef, who grew up in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), adding that many of his regulars have now become friends.
One of the draws here is Faour’s 1,000-gallon Texan smoker — the largest of its kind in the UAE, he claims. Faour’s goal is to recreate the authentic flavors of the Lone Star state for his customers, down to the post-oak wood he imports from Texas for smoking.
“It’s what Texas uses. Think of oak as the spice — each wood will taste different. I try to keep it as original tasting as possible,” says Faour. “If you want to taste actual Texas barbecue, not any just state, but Texas barbecue, it’s this.”
Food runs in Faour’s family. His parents owned a chocolate factory and import business in Al Quoz Industrial estate, and he always had a passion for cooking. In 2016, after years of traveling and volunteering in kitchens, he joined the Institute of Culinary Education in Manhattan, and worked in prestigious New York kitchens. “I was just eager to jump at any chance to explore food,” he says.
It was a trip to Texas in 2019 that gave him his first taste of barbecue, and he spent months living with a friend and trying all the best spots for smoked and grilled meat. It was here Faour bought his famous smoker — long before he dreamt up Big T’s.
“Good Texas smokers are scarce” because they’re handmade and often have year-long waiting lists, he says. “I knew I wanted to open a restaurant but I didn’t have a plan on when or where,” he adds.
When the pandemic hit in 2020, Faour moved back to Dubai. Lockdowns and restrictions forced the family’s chocolate business to close — but Faour saw an opportunity to put his culinary training into action and make his dream of opening a restaurant a reality, utilizing the now-empty warehouse.
He transported the smoker to Dubai in 2022, opening Big T’s BBQ in December of that year. It was bare-bones: the sign above the door was handpainted, and a hand-written menu was taped by the cash register. Fluorescent tube lights bounced off the concrete floor and mismatched furniture.
But the sparse decor of the cafeteria-style restaurant didn’t matter to his diners. They were there for one thing: beef. Brisket, short ribs, pastrami, sausages, burgers, and double-fried beef tallow fries, along with a monthly and weekly rotation of specials. The brisket, which has become Big T’s signature, is smoked for 12 to 16 hours a day.
“We just cook it till it’s done. There is no time or temperature, we just keep checking. We know how it feels when it’s done. We go a lot on feeling,” Faour adds.
When Big T’s opened, Faour could barely keep up with demand, sometimes selling out by mid-afternoon. With the growing popularity, he bought not one, but two new smokers, tripling his capacity.
“Now we only sell out of everything once every three months,” Faour says. There may be less choice in the hour before it shuts but he’s quick to add: “You’ll always have something nice to eat till closing time.”
While Dubai’s food scene has captured international attention, dominating the 50 Best Restaurant list for MENA (Middle East and North Africa) and becoming the first city in the region to have its own Michelin guide, its budget dining venues are less well known.
The emirate is home to around 18,000 food outlets, and its culinary scene is a reflection of the 200 different nationalities living in the UAE — something that makes it “one of the best cities in the world for diversity of food,” says Alex Augusti, the Dubai-based food vlogger behind Just Food DXB. His videos often highlight low-cost eateries in unusual places, like Big T’s, which he calls his “go-to” for all things meat.
“It’s rustic, it’s rough around the edges and that’s why I love it,” says Augusti. “He’s got years of experience in the US and he really does inject that passion and that enthusiasm into his food.”
Augusti adds that Faour has “shaken up the food scene” and has raised the bar for barbecue in the city, “especially the smoked brisket scene, he’s really the leader in it.”
Through his videos and reviews, Augusti hopes he can convince visitors to look beyond the city’s malls and five-star resorts. “When you explore new foods and new cultures, that’s when you have the best experiences. And places like (Big T’s) are a perfect example — it’s in the middle of nowhere and you’ll probably get some of the best food in the city.”
The attention of adventurous foodies like Augusti has boosted Big T’s reputation in the city’s culinary scene, and Faour is now embarking on his second project, which he’s keeping under wraps until launch.
“I love barbecue, (but) I want to keep it interesting for me as a chef, and keep trying new things,” he adds."
