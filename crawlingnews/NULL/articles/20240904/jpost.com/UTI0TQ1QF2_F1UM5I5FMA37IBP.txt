The reaction of a not insignificant portion of the Israeli population to the events over the weekend is perplexing and disturbing. October 7, 2023, was a massive failure by the State of Israel in failing to protect its citizens, but the direct responsibility for the massacre and hostage-taking falls on Hamas and their accomplices. The 11 months since then have been tense and tragic. Then, this past weekend, terrorists from the North, South, and East killed policemen, soldiers, and hostages. The responsibility for this loss of life falls squarely on Arab terrorists; secondarily on their international supporters such as Iran and Qatar; and finally on international powers, including the United Nations and European Union, who have insisted on pressuring Israel and not the perpetrators.  The reaction of all moral people to Hamas murdering six hostages in cold blood (after abusing them for almost a year) should be utter outrage and disgust at Hamas. Instead of the world media reporting on global condemnations of this barbaric behavior, instead of hearing about world leaders finally unequivocally denouncing Hamas, the airwaves are blaring the calls for shutting down the Israeli economy to pressure not Hamas but Israel. The oversized Histadrut union as well as other unions and employers are calling for a strike. I am disappointed that among them is my place of work, Bar Ilan University which, together with many of the other universities, has the hubris to choose to make a political statement. The presidents of the universities, acting as if this was a private enterprise of theirs, have unilaterally called for a strike.  Tel Aviv - Thousands blocking Begin Rd near the Begin Gate of the Kirya military HQ, demanding the government sign the hostage deal and bring everyone home, now!  (credit: Tally Melamed)I can imagine Sinwar in his rat-infested tunnel surrounded by his human shields receiving news of the massacre of six living hostages and awaiting global condemnation. Instead, his next messenger arrives and tells him that the result of those point-blank murders is that the Israeli economy is being shuttered and pressure is being applied not to Hamas but to the Israeli government to make even greater concessions. He could not have dreamed of a greater success in shooting those six hostages in the head.I assume he then sent out two messengers, one to verify whether that absurd scenario was truly taking place, and the other to instruct that if that is the case, it would be worthwhile to kill a few more. He has absolutely no motive to modify his behavior or make any concessions. Many may agree that Netanyahu is to blame, at least in part, for the October 7 debacle and for a lack of effective leadership since then. But if asked what the most appropriate reaction on September 3, 2024 to the Hamas massacre should be, it is quite clear that giving Hamas exactly what it wants – damaging the State of Israel economically and giving Hamas the upper hand in future negotiations – is the wrong response.A desire for political change may be a legitimate goal, but attempting to bring it about by playing into the hands of our sworn enemy is foolhardy and dangerous.Israelis are frustrated. They are mad. They are depressed. The bloody weekend was too much for many people who feel a need to direct pent-up anger. Nevertheless, that anger should be directed at Hamas, the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO), Iran, and Qatar.    Stay updated with the latest news!
