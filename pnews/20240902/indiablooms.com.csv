0DBX3F9FAB_9ST1TMB1RBCFV2J,Canada: Jagmeet Singh's NDP pulls support for Trudeau's govt,India Blooms News Service,"05 Sep 2024, 01:50 pm",20240905,indiablooms.com,https://www.indiablooms.com/world-details/USN/43308/canada-jagmeet-singh-s-ndp-pulls-support-for-trudeau-s-govt.html,"A year ahead of the general elections in Canada, Trudeau's minority government is now at risk after the NDP withdrew support from the Liberal Party.
NDP leader Jagmeet Singh, in a video posted on social media on Wednesday (Sept 4), said that he had informed PM Trudeau of the party's decision, saying the Liberal Party was ""too weak, to selfish"" to fight for Canadians.
The NDP supported Liberals in confidence votes as they had a deal - called a ""supply and confidence"" agreement - with Trudeau's party.
While making the announcement, Singh attacked Trudeau for caving to ""corporate greed"" and claimed that the Canadian PM's Liberal Party has ""let people down.""

""Justin Trudeau has proven again and again he will always cave to corporate greed. The Liberals have let people down. They don't deserve another chance from Canadians,"" Singh said in the video,"" the NDP leader said.
""There is another, even bigger battle ahead. The threat of Pierre Poilievre and Conservative cuts. From workers, from retirees, from young people, from patients, from families -- he will cut in order to give more to big corporations and wealthy CEOs,"" Jagmeet Singh added.
An NDP spokesperson said the plan to end the agreement was in the works for the past two weeks -- and that the party would not inform Trudeau's Liberal government of its decision until an hour before the video was scheduled to go live online.
The NDP's announcement of support withdrawal from Liberals does not automatically mean a federal election is imminent as the Liberals could seek the support of the Bloc Quebecois or try to continue negotiating with the NDP on a case-by-case basis but that Canadians may go to the polls before the election scheduled for October next year (2025), reports BBC.
Justin Trudeau affirmed hope that the next election will not happen ""until next fall"" so that his government has time to move forward on pharmacare, dental care, and school food programmes, reports CBS News.
Meanwhile, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre called NDP's Jagmeet Singh's announcement a ""stunt"" and criticised him for not saying whether he would vote non-confidence in the government, as reported by CBC News.
""He came out and claimed that he was wrong, that the coalition was a bad, costly idea, but he refuses to commit to voting for a carbon tax election,"" Pierre Poilievre told reporters in Nanaimo, British Columbia.
The Conservative leader also called on Singh to commit to voting for an election at the earliest opportunity when the House of Commons returns, according to reports.
""Right now, we don't have a calendar to indicate when we can put forward a motion,"" Poilievre said.
""After Sellout Singh did this stunt today, he is going to have to vote on whether he keeps Justin Trudeau's costly government in power, or whether he triggers a carbon tax election,"" he added.
Jagmeet Singh has also said that his NDP is ready for an election in the country.
""The NDP is ready for an election, and voting non-confidence will be on the table with each and every confidence measure,"" Singh said in a media release accompanying his announcement.
A by-election in the Montreal riding of LaSalle-Emard-Verdun, formerly held by the Liberals, is scheduled to be held on September 16, as per reports.
Left-wing NDP kept Trudeau's minority Liberal government in power through the confidence-and-supply agreement, in exchange for movement on key priorities such as dental care benefits, one-time rental supplements for low-income tenants, and a temporary doubling of the GST rebate, according to a report by CBS News.
But some of the promises made to the NDP by the Liberal government are yet to be fully realised, reports said.
Pharmacare legislation has not passed the Senate, and a bill to implement Elections Act changes is still before the House, and additionally, the promised Safe Long-Term Care Act has yet to be tabled, as per reports.

According to reports, the accused, who was brought to the health center for treatment, touched the nurse inappropriately while she was administering him with saline.
The nurse alleged that the patient molested her while being attended to in the emergency department.
The accused was even accompanied by his family members at the time of the incident.
""The male patient misbehaved with me and touched me inappropriately in my private parts while I was just following the doctor's instructions. He also hurled verbal abuses at me,"" the nurse was quoted as saying by NDTV.
""Such incidents occur due to a lack of security. Otherwise, how can a patient dare to do such a thing to someone on duty in the presence of his family members who do nothing to stop him,"" she said.
The incident triggered tension at the health center, which prompted hospital authorities to contact the police.
Cops arrested the accused after arriving at the scene.
The incident comes at a time when massive protests are being held in Kolkata and rest of the state over the horrific rape and murder of the young doctor At RG Kar Hospital while she was on her night duty earlier this month.
The Mamata Banerjee-led government is facing protests and flak over its handling of the crime."

Netflix India content head Monika Shergill gave assurance to the government about being cautious in future during her meeting with officials of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting on Tuesday.
The government said it was taking the issue ""very seriously"" and underscored that nobody had the ""right to play with the sentiments of the people of this nation,"" according to an India Today report.
""We have been supporting content and content creators, but facts cannot be distorted. Under creativity, sentiments cannot be hurt,"" the government said while summoning the Netflix content head, the report stated.
The series is directed by Anubhav Sinha and written by Adrian Levy and Trishant Srivastava.
Produced by Sarita Patil and Sanjay Routray under Matchbox Shots and Benaras Mediaworks, it stars an ensemble cast led by Naseeruddin Shah, Pankaj Kapur, Vijay Varma, Dia Mirza and Arvind Swamy.
The film has been slammed by different quarters for its portrayal of the hijackers from the ill-fated flight, particularly because of the  renaming of the characters to ""Bhola"" and ""Shankar,"" names traditionally linked to Lord Shiva.
Many critics view this as a distortion of historical truth, arguing that it misrepresents the actual identities of the terrorists and is offensive to Hindu sentiments.
""Netflix has provided an assurance to conduct a content review and guarantee that all future content on their platform will be sensitive to and in accordance with the nation's sentiments as well as children's sensitivity,"" government sources were quoted as saying by the India Today.
On Tuesday, Netflix India also clarified that it has updated the series' opening disclaimer to mention the real and code names of the hijackers.

The controversy sparked a war of words on social media.
On platforms such as X (formerly Twitter), hashtags like #BoycottNetflix and #BoycottBollywood began trending, with users condemning the filmmakers of rewriting history and downplaying the terror caused by the real hijackers.
However, a document from the Union Home Ministry, published shortly after the 1999 hijacking, makes the facts clear.
The statement back then categorically stated that the hijackers - Sunny Ahmed Qazi, Shakir a.k.a Rajesh Gopal Verma, Mistri Zahoor Ibrahim, Shahid Akhtar Sayed and Ibrahim Athar used nicknames like Bhola, Shankar, Doctor and Burger to address each other inside the plane.
""To the passengers of the hijacked place these hijackers came to be known respectively as (1) Chief, (2) Doctor, (3) Burger, (4) Bhola and (5) Shankar, the names by which the hijackers invariably addressed one another,"" the old government statement reads.
The release of 'IC 814: The Kandahar Hijack' precipitated a verbal war on social media between the BJP and the Opposition members.
Amit Malviya, the BJP IT Cell chief, accused the filmmakers of pushing an agenda to whitewash the crimes of Pakistani terrorists by assigning them Hindu names, obscuring the truth from the future generations.
Former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah and Shiv Sena-UBT leader Priyanka Chaturvedi criticized the backlash as targeted, highlighting the inconsistencies in calls for historical accuracy in cinema.

According to Anand Ranganathan, author, scientist and academic, the Hindus are tired of selective targeting and double standards when it comes to freedom of expression.
""If it isn’t the gau mutra (cow urine) jibes, the ads, the stand-up comics, or the utterances of parties like the DMK, it is the whitewashing OTT dramas.  Enough is enough,"" he posted on X.

1WV6M405CV_QWTVJTM42NRBAVI,States fail to reach consensus on GST relief on health insurance premiums,India Blooms News Service,"04 Sep 2024, 05:36 pm",20240904,indiablooms.com,https://www.indiablooms.com/finance-details/21172/states-fail-to-reach-consensus-on-gst-relief-on-health-insurance-premiums.html,"A decision is expected to be made at the upcoming GST Council meeting, chaired by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, scheduled for September 9 in Delhi, reported Moneycontrol.
According to two officials familiar with the discussions, various options are still being considered, including exemptions for senior citizens, partial exemptions, or reducing the tax rate to 5 percent, with or without the Input Tax Credit (ITC), the report said.
The proposal to exempt health insurance premiums from GST has ignited a debate, with states raising concerns about a potential revenue loss estimated to be between Rs 3,200 crore and Rs 4,000 crore.
However, the exact amount of revenue loss will depend on whether the Input Tax Credit (ITC) is retained, according to officials.
""There are nuances to the tax system. Some states are conscious of the revenue implications of exemption of health insurance premium from GST. Some are very conservative, while others feel that lower tax could lead to a wider coverage of health insurance. The overriding sentiment is that whatever losses are suffered due to the tax relief could be recouped by other sectors, thanks to a growing economy,” an official was quoted as saying Moneycontrol.
“If GST on health insurance is proposed at 5 percent without ITC, then the tax burden is inclusive of the 5 percent tax rate and additional tax on inputs. In such a scenario, the government will continue to levy tax on inputs.
As a result, some revenue will accrue to the government for discharging its output liability. This policy move will also lessen revenue loss for the state exchequer,” the official said.
Currently, health insurance premiums are subject to an 18% GST, and the debate over its withdrawal has been ongoing for some time.
Shortly after Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented the Union Budget 2024-25 in the Lok Sabha, Minister for Road, Transport, and Highways Nitin Gadkari advocated for exempting health insurance from GST, citing concerns about how the 18% tax affects accessibility and growth in the sector.
The deadlock remains unresolved as states seek more data and deliberate on the most viable approach to balance consumer relief with revenue protection."

The ruling BJP has also planned a march to counter the Opposition's agitation.
A huge police contingent has gathered at the Gateway of India, which has also been shut for tourists, citing law and order, media reports said.
The rally will see the who's who of the INDIA bloc in Maharashtra including Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray, NCP (SP) supremo Sharad Pawar and state Congress president Nana Patole.
The leaders are expected to walk from Hutatma Chowk in the Fort area to the Gateway of India.
The Opposition bloc has called its protest rally ""jode maro"", which means ""hit with footwear"".
The Shiv Sena (UBT) has urged people to join the march, and has posted on X that it is coming to bow at Shivaji's feet to ""awaken the pride of Maharashtra"".
The Sharad Pawar faction of NCP has said there is no forgiveness for ""corrupt Shivdrohis"".
The state unit of the Congress has said the march is aimed at teaching a lesson to ""Shivdrohis"" for committing corruption and insulting Shivaji.
The Shivaji statue was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi just 8 months back. The collapse of the statue has sparked a massive political row in Maharashtra.
The Indian Navy was in charge of the project in coordination with the state government.
Police have arrested the structural consultant for the project and its contractor under sections relating to attempt to murder, culpable homicide, and acts endangering the life and safety of others.
Facing sever backlash, Prime Minister Modi has apologised to the people for the statue's collapse. ""Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj is not just a name or a king. For us, he is our deity. Today, I bow my head at his feet and apologise to my deity. I also apologise to the people hurt by the collapse,"" he has said."
3ONNANWAQR_5IOWW9LQH24FAON,Naveen Patnaik's BJD to oppose Waqf Bill in parliament,India Blooms News Service,"06 Sep 2024, 01:13 am",20240905,indiablooms.com,https://www.indiablooms.com/news-details/N/99629/naveen-patnaik-s-bjd-to-oppose-waqf-bill-in-parliament.html,"Speaking at a meeting of the party’s minority cell at the BJD headquarters, Sankha Bhawan, Patnaik noted a “sense of insecurity” among minorities, whom he regularly engages with, reported The Indian Express.
The Waqf (Amendment) Bill introduces several notable changes to the 1995 Waqf Act, including provisions that would allow a non-Muslim to serve as the chief executive officer and appoint at least two non-Muslim members to state Waqf boards.
It also proposes giving the district collector the authority to decide whether a property is Waqf or government land.
Despite having no representation in the Lok Sabha and its presence in the Rajya Sabha reduced to eight members after one of its members resigned and rejoined as a BJP representative, the BJD had traditionally supported the BJP-led NDA government on key legislations.
However, following its defeat to the BJP in both the 2024 Lok Sabha and assembly elections, the BJD has shifted its stance, with Patnaik declaring the party would cease “issue-based support” to the BJP to strengthen its role as an opposition party in Parliament.
According to the 2011 Census, Muslims make up 2.17 percent of Odisha’s population.
However, BJD sources suggest that Patnaik's decision to oppose the Waqf Bill is aimed at preserving his image as a “secular politician.”
Despite the BJD's support for the Centre’s Citizenship Amendment Bill, the party declared in 2020 that it would oppose the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC) plan. During the minority cell meeting, Patnaik called on everyone to maintain social harmony.
“Peace and harmony are the foundations of prosperity, which helped Odisha to stride in different sectors,” Patnaik said according to the report.
Patnaik remarked that Odisha has always been recognized for its ""harmony and brotherhood,"" and highlighted that the state's pride lies in its ""cultural diversity."" He emphasized that building a prosperous country requires the cooperation of everyone."

""The heart of an entire nation is shattered to pieces,"" said President Isaac Herzog, according to Reuters. ""I embrace their families with all my heart, and apologize for failing to bring them home safely.""
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not release a statement immediately over the brutal killing of the hostages, the report said.
According to the report, he is under pressure to reach a ceasefire agreement with Hamas that includes the release of remaining hostages.
U.S. President Joe Biden said in a statement he was “devastated and outraged.”
Biden, who monitored the situation of the hostages seized on Oct. 7, said the six included Israeli American Goldberg-Polin.
Senior Hamas official Izzat El-Reshiq said that Israel, in its refusal to sign a ceasefire deal, was responsible for the deaths.
According to Israel's Hagari, hostage Qaid Farhan Alkadi from the Bedouin community in southern Israel, was rescued days earlier, about a kilometre away.
The six recovered bodies were among the 250 hostages taken during Hamas' attack on southern Israel on October 7, which triggered the ongoing war in Gaza.
The assault resulted in around 1,200 deaths, according to Israeli reports.
Since then, the health ministry in Gaza has reported at least 40,691 Palestinians killed and 94,060 injured in Israel's military counter-attack.
Sunday's developments are likely to intensify protests by Israelis demanding a deal for the hostages' release.
The Hostage Families Forum has called on Netanyahu to take responsibility and clarify what is delaying an agreement."

However, the researchers found screentime in the two hours before bed had little impact on youth sleep, it was screen time once in bed that caused problems.
Lead author Dr Bradley Brosnan, of the Edgar Diabetes and Obesity Research Centre, says screentime is a mainstay in adolescents’ bedtime routines, and sleep guidelines need to be revaluated to better reflect modern life.
Published in JAMA Pediatrics, the study had 85 adolescents aged 11 to 14 years wear a body camera on their chest from three hours before bed until they got into bed, over the course of one week.
Along with the body camera capturing when, what and how they used their screens, a second infrared camera was placed in their bedrooms to capture their screentime while in bed.
They also wore an actigraph, a watch-sized device which measures sleep.
“It quickly became obvious that adolescents spend a lot of their screen time while in bed,” Dr Brosnan says.
The researchers found 99 per cent of participants used screens in the two hours before bed, more than half used screens once in bed, and a third used them after first trying to go to sleep for the night.
“Our most interesting findings were that this screen time before they got into bed had little impact on sleep that night.
“However, screen time once in bed did impair their sleep – it stopped them from going to sleep for about half an hour, and reduced the amount of sleep they got that night.”
This was particularly true for more interactive screen activities like gaming and multitasking – when more than one device is used at the same time, such as watching a movie on Netflix on a laptop while playing Xbox on a gaming device.
“Every additional 10 minutes of this type of screen time reduced the amount of sleep they got that night by almost the same amount.
“Our findings suggest that the impact of screen time on sleep is primarily through time displacement delaying sleep onset rather than any direct effects of blue light or interactive engagement as we didn’t find associations with sleep latency and wakefulness during the sleep period.”
Dr Brosnan says a ‘simple’ sleep guideline – in theory but not necessarily reality – would be for devices to be kept out of the bedroom, allowing teenagers to use their devices before bed, but not in bed.
“We need to revisit sleep guidelines, so they fit the world we live in, and actually make sense – the current ones aren’t achievable or appropriate for how we live.”
For Dr Brosnan, applying his expertise in research and health to effect meaningful, practical change is a central focus. He has been developing screenwise.co.nz, an online platform to help parents and whānau in Aotearoa New Zealand better manage screen time at home.
“Screenwise is about providing realistic, evidence-based tips and tools that parents can easily incorporate into their daily routines. I’m starting with my community, doing talks and group sessions at local schools, to continue educating parents, youth, and whānau on building healthier screen habits for better sleep and overall well-being.”"

According to a Times of India report, the complainant filed a written complaint with the UGC and university authorities. JU's anti-ragging squad is looking into the case and probing the allegations.
""The anti-ragging squad has taken up the case and an investigation has started,"" a JU official was quoted as saying by the Times of India.
""The incident took place on Aug 2 when an ex-student of the power engineering department called me inside the union room and started verbally abusing me. Soon, he was joined by six others from the printing, civil, pharmacy and electrical engineering departments.
They started threatening me, snatched my phone, forced me to unlock it and kept on checking my private messages and call logs. They charged me about the incident that took place on July 25 on the campus when some of our seniors and fellow batchmates confronted two of the pass-out students of being accused of previous incidents of ragging and violent activities because we want our university to be ragging-free,"" the student stated in his complaint, according to the report.
The victim stated that he was seized by the neck and forced to write a letter, adding that he was instigated by his seniors to confront them against ragging, according to the report.
Expressing disappointment over the university's failure to maintain a ragging-free environment, the student said he felt unsafe and afraid.
2023 ragging allegation
Last year, Swarnodip Kundu, 18, fell fatally from the hostel's second floor on the JU campus. He succumbed to multiple wounds at a nearby city hospital.
Kundu, a resident of Bogulia in Nadia district, was a first-year student in the Bengali Honours stream. He died after allegedly falling from the second-floor balcony of his hostel though mystery still shrouds over what happened that day.

According to the FIR, the teenager fell off the balcony and died during treatment at KPC Medical College.
Hours after the incident, another fresher had come out with his claims of suffering, saying that ragging forced him to quit the prestigious institution.
A year has passed, but the JU authorities are yet to take action on the identified students who ragged Swarnodip, according to reports in a local English daily.
The father of the deceased has said the university has only issued a show-cause notice to the identified students.
He told The Telegraph, ""JU show-caused the students implicated in the committee report, that, too, only after the education minister Bratya Basu in late July said he would speak to the JU authorities about the inaction.
""We don’t know when JU will announce the punishment and we will get justice.""
JU interim Vice-Chancellor Bhaskar Gupta said the university is waiting for the reply to the show-cause letters.
Kundu’s parents and friends had alleged that he had been a victim of ragging.
""The show cause should have been wrapped up much earlier... As the university is taking time to act, complaints of harassment of students keep emerging from the same hostel. A postgraduate first-year student had to quit the hostel recently,"" the father told the daily."

The doctors agreed and a 22-member delegation met Vineet Goyal, submitted their deputation, demanded his resignation and offered him a symbolic spinal cord accusing the police of failing to act without compulsion in the case that has brought the role of Mamata Banerjee government under scanner.

Mamata Banerjee brings anti-rape law amid public ire
Facing massive protests and criticisms over the RG incident, the West Bengal Assembly Tuesday passed the Aparajita Bill to amend some provisions of the criminal code, Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, to be applicable for the state.
Though the law is seen by many as a ploy to shift the attention to the issue of rape instead of allowing a fair probe in the RG Kar case where the focus is on destruction of evidence, the amendments are aimed at making punishment more stringent in cases of rape and child abuse.
The Bill seeks to amend several sections in the newly introduced Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS). Section 64 in Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita states that a rape convict will face rigorous imprisonment of not less than 10 years extending to life term.
Photo courtesy: Screenshot grab from X video
The Bengal legislation tweaks this Section to increase the jail term to the ""remainder of that person's natural life and fine, or with death"". It also adds that this fine shall be fair and reasonable to meet the medical expenses and rehabilitation costs of the victim.
The Aparajita Bill also seeks to amend Section 66 of BNS, which lays down penalties for a convict if rape leads to the victim's death or causes her to be in a ""vegetative state"".
While the Centre legislation states a punishment of a 20-year jail term, life imprisonment, and death for such a crime, the Bengal Bill says the convict should get only the death penalty."

The two met Leader of Opposition and Congress top leader Rahul Gandhi.
The wrestlers' joining comes at a time talks are underway between Congress and Aam Aadmi Party for a seat-sharing deal in the state.
The Congress and AAP had entered into a seat-sharing deal in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections that had offered a blow to the ruling BJP.

It is also significant because both Phogat and Punia led the protests against former BJP MP Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh who has been accused of sexually assaulting several women wrestlers.
Brij Bhushan was denied a ticket by the BJP in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls.
Also last week, Phogat had visited the Delhi-Haryana border and met the farmers who were camped there protesting against the central government.
The Haryana state polls will be held months after the BJP's tally of seats tanked from the previous 303 to 240 making it mandatory for the saffron party to have the allies' support."

Ratna Adhikari Bose, Riyanshi's mother, couldn't hold back her worry for her daughter, who says the RG Kar case is the only issue being discussed from dining space to bedroom at her place.
""I took her along with me so that she could realise the kind  of society we are currently living in,"" says Ratna and adds in the same breath, ""As a mother, I am very worried. How will I be unworried about my daughter's future? I am not educating my daughter for her to be confined at home. So she will have to be strong from this moment on.""
""I have hit the streets hoping for better days in future,"" she added.

For the uninformed, Kolkata, its neighbouring districts have been witnessing relentless, unprecedented protests after a post-graduate medical student was raped and murdered at her workplace on the intervening night of August 8 and 9.
Though the police swiftly nabbed a civic volunteer- named Sanjoy Roy- with the rape and murder charges, junior doctors, who are on an indefinite strike, suspect the crime was committed by more than one and an attempt to tamper with evidence and cover up the incident to protect its perpetrators or conspirators is at play right from the beginning.

""I think this 'Maha Michil' has been able to send out a clear message. I hope the real culprits are found out and arrested. We have to free our state and society from these kinds of mafia-raj and rape culture,"" says an elderly lady, named Anuradha Mahapatra, who was walking in the rally with almost equal vigour as that of the minor, Riyanshi.
""I feel there should be an end to the atrocities women are facing in our country. This situation needs to be changed,"" says the woman who came all the way from Garia, an eastern part of the city, to downtown Kolkata.

The Mamata Banerjee government, despite winning an overwhelming number of parliamentary seats in the General Elections just a couple of months ago, is now in a deep crisis as people's protests roil the state challenging the state administration, which was marred by political violence and rampant corruption cases for more than a decade now.

The administration's swift run for the last rites of the victim and demolition work near the crime scene have raised some uncomfortable questions for the state administration, which is helmed by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who also holds both the police and health portfolios. Clamour for her resignation also grew louder.

In a departure from its previous rallies, including the night vigil on August 14, justice was demanded also from the CBI which has been on the case for nearly three weeks now.

Priyanka Chatterjee- a middle-aged lady- pointed her fingers on the CBI too as she walked past the Bowbazar area this evening.
""We are waiting for the results by CBI on September 5 (the next hearing date) but what we are scared of is that the probe agency will claim there was only one rapist and murderer. But the system has raped and killed the girl. We want to know about the syndicate which was going on in that hospital against which our daughter had spoken.
""Is it sex racket or drug racket or organ racket, what was going on? CBI must shed its light on that,"" says Priyanka pausing her sloganeering at the rally, which saw the presence of film personalities like Aparna Sen, Swastika Mukherjee, Srijit Mukherji among others.

Besides Ghosh, three others have been arrested by the central probe agency including vendors Biplav Singha and Suman Hazara, who supplied medicine to the hospital, and Afsar Ali, a security guard.
Earlier in the day, as Sandip Ghosh was leaving the court with CBI officials towards the car, TV visuals showed him getting slapped by one of the protesters who had gathered outside the premises.
Before being arrested, Ghosh had been summoned to the CGO complex almost every day ever since the CBI investigated the horrific incident.
On Monday, as the news of his arrest spread, the protesting junior doctors were seen celebrating in Kolkata.
According to reports, he has been arrested by the CBI's anti-corruption branch over the financial irregularities and corruption charges at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital during his tenure as the principal of the facility.
The financial irregularities case against him was enforced following a petition by former Deputy Superintendent of RG Kar Hospital Akhtar Ali.
He had accused Sandip Ghosh of illegal sale of unclaimed corpses, trafficking of biomedical waste, and passing tenders against the commission paid by medicine and medical equipment suppliers.
He also alleged that students were pressured to pay up to Rs. 8 lakh to pass exams.
The Supreme Court as well as the Calcutta High Court has repeatedly questioned why Ghosh, being the principal of the medical college when the brutal crime took place, did not lodge a police complaint.
A post shared by India Blooms (@indiablooms)
Ghosh, who faced the ire for alleged mismanagement and financial irregularities at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, resigned from his post facing protests from the medical students.
Though he had resigned, the Mamata Banerjee government had controversially appointed him to a similar post at Calcutta National Medical College within a few hours.
The Indian Medical Association had already suspended Ghosh and his appointment to premier Calcutta National Medical College was also taken down after the Mamata Banerjee government received massive flak over the same with even the High Courts and the Supreme Court questioning the same.
The financial irregularities case was handed to the CBI by the Calcutta High Court as a parallel investigation. The agency primarily flew to Kolkata to probe the rape-murder case on the instructions of the High Court.
The key suspect in the rape and murder case of the junior doctor so far has been identified as Sanjay Roy, a civic volunteer, who was seen on the hospital's CCTV near the crime scene.
Sanjay Roy, Sandeep Ghosh, and some doctors whose fingerprints were taken from the seminar hall, where the junior doctor's body was found, have been made to undergo polygraph tests.

The CCTV footage shows Sanjay Roy entering the hospital at 1.03 on the fateful night when the incident took place, media reports said.
During interrogation, the police had shown him the CCTV evidence, after which Sanjay Roy admitted to the crime, media reports said.
On Tuesday, people from diverse backgrounds joined healthcare professionals in forming a human chain along a 14 km long stretch of Kolkata demanding justice for RG Kar victim."

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not release a statement immediately over the brutal killing of the hostages.
According to the report, Netanyahu is under pressure to reach a ceasefire agreement with Hamas that includes the release of remaining hostages.
Senior Hamas official Izzat El-Reshiq said that Israel, in its refusal to sign a ceasefire deal, was responsible for the deaths.
According to Israel's Hagari, hostage Qaid Farhan Alkadi from the Bedouin community in southern Israel, was rescued days earlier, about a kilometre away.
The six recovered bodies were among the 250 hostages taken during Hamas' attack on southern Israel on October 7, which triggered the ongoing war in Gaza.
The assault resulted in around 1,200 deaths, according to Israeli reports.
Since then, the health ministry in Gaza has reported at least 40,691 Palestinians killed and 94,060 injured in Israel's military counter-attack.
Sunday's developments are likely to intensify protests by Israelis demanding a deal for the hostages' release.
The Hostage Families Forum has called on Netanyahu to take responsibility and clarify what is delaying an agreement."

AMR occurs when bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites change over time and no longer respond to medicines. It is driven largely by the misuse and overuse of antimicrobials, even as many people worldwide do not have access to these essential medications.
Antibiotic effectiveness undermined
WHO said the emergence and spread of AMR caused by antibiotic pollution could undermine the effectiveness of antibiotics globally, including the medicines produced at the manufacturing sites responsible for the pollution.
Yet despite high antibiotic pollution levels being widely documented, the issue is largely unregulated and quality assurance criteria generally do not address environmental emissions.
Additionally, consumers are not given sufficient information on how to dispose of unused antibiotics, for example, when the drugs have expired or when a course of antibiotics is finished but some is still leftover.
Potential new threats
“Pharmaceutical waste from antibiotic manufacturing can facilitate the emergence of new drug-resistant bacteria, which can spread globally and threaten our health,” said Dr. Yukiko Nakatani, WHO Assistant Director-General for AMR ad interim.
“Controlling pollution from antibiotic production contributes to keeping these life-saving medicines effective for everyone,"" she added.
Globally, there is a lack of accessible information on the environmental damage caused by manufacturing of medicines, said WHO, which noted that several international bodies have called for the guidance, including health ministers from G7 leading economies as well as the UN Environment Programme (UNEP).
Environmental action critical
“The role of the environment in the development, transmission and spread of antimicrobial resistance needs careful consideration since evidence is mounting,” said Jacqueline Alvarez, Chief of Branch for the Industry and Economy Division at UNEP.
“There is a widespread agreement that action on the environment must become more prominent as a solution. This includes pollution prevention and control from municipal systems, manufacturing sites, healthcare facilities and agri-food systems,” she added.
About the guidance
The new guidance was developed in close collaboration with a diverse group of international experts, including representatives from academia, regulators, inspectors, international organizations, and other sectors.
It provides human health-based targets to reduce the risk of emergence and spread of AMR, as well as targets to address risks for aquatic life caused by all antibiotics intended for human, animal or plant use.
Furthermore, all steps from the manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and formulation into finished products, including primary packaging, are covered.
“The guidance provides an independent and impartial scientific basis for regulators, procurers, inspectors, and industry themselves to include robust antibiotic pollution control in their standards,” said Dr. Maria Neira, Director of WHO’s Department of Environment, Climate Change and Health.
“Critically, the strong focus on transparency will equip buyers, investors and the general public to make decisions that account for manufacturers’ efforts to control antibiotic pollution.”"

Speaking to international media on Sunday, Sam Rose, a spokesperson for UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestine refugees, said that over 200 teams are administering the vaccine in 25 locations in the middle areas of Gaza.
A race against time
In order to stop the polio outbreak in Gaza, and to prevent an international spread of the virus, health workers will need to vaccinate at least 90 percent of children during each round.
Reacting to the launch on social media, Philippe Lazzarini, the head of UNRWA described the campaign as “a race against time”.
The campaign will be delivered in stages, over three days each, covering three different areas of Gaza. Vaccination coverage will be monitored and analyzed every day, and vaccination drives will be extended by one day if necessary.
The operation – organized by UNRWA, the World Health Organization (WHO), the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the Palestinian Ministry of Health –will continue in the coming days, if the temporary pause in fighting between Hamas and Israeli forces holds.
Security concerns
The UN bodies involved in the campaign and senior officials have underlined the importance of maintaining security for health workers and the Gazan population.
“For this to work, parties to the conflict must respect the temporary area pauses,” wrote Mr. Lazzarini on social media. “For the sake of children across the region a lasting ceasefire is overdue”. In another post, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the head of WHO, wrote that “ultimately, the best vaccine for these children is peace.”
UN chief reacts to hostage deaths
On the same day that the campaign launch was confirmed, news broke of the death of six of the hostages taken by Hamas in the October 7 2023 attacks on Israel.
The UN Secretary-General, António Guterres, reacted to the news by recollecting his meeting with the family of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, one of the hostages reported dead on Sunday. The reports, he wrote in a social media post, are “a devastating reminder of the need for the unconditional release of all hostages and an end to the nightmare of war in Gaza.”"
E5ZGGVH8XC_LBXH77KI2BLT6O1,RG Kar rape-murder: CBI arrests ex-principal Sandip Ghosh,India Blooms News Service,"02 Sep 2024, 08:37 pm",20240902,indiablooms.com,https://www.indiablooms.com/news-details/N/99531/rg-kar-rape-murder-cbi-arrests-ex-principal-sandip-ghosh.html,"Ghosh has been summoned to the CGO complex almost every day ever since the CBI undertook the investigation into the horrific incident.
According to reports, he has been arrested by the CBI's anti-corruption branch over the financial irregularities and corruption charges at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital during his tenure as the principal of the facility.

Besides him, three others arrested by the CBI's anti-corruption branch include vendors Biplab Singha, Suman Hazara, and additional security to Sandeep Ghosh, Afsar Ali.
Earlier, the CBI raided his house in connection with the financial irregularities at the hospital along with 15 other locations across the city.

The CBI started a probe into the corruption charges against Ghosh based on information by Akhtar Ali, the whistleblower, who had raised this matter in the Calcutta High Court, after which the Kolkata Police's special investigation team had recorded his statement.
Akhtar Ali worked at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital for 16 years. He began as assistant superintendent in grade 2, went to grade 1, and became Deputy Superintendent.
""Before Sandeep Ghosh came, this was the number one college in eastern India. It is a 100-year-old college. I have exposed a lot of scams. The first scam was to make students fail. They used to extort money from them, those who did not listen, and some students used to collect this money,"" Akhtar Ali had alleged in various media bites.
""They used to make junior students drink alcohol and make them protest, whenever it came to Sandeep Ghosh's transfer. The illegal activities include smuggling of bodies, biomedical waste scam. The complaints went to the higher levels including vigilance, but nothing happened,"" Akhtar Ali said.
Ghosh has also been accused of selling unclaimed dead bodies.
The Supreme Court as well as the Calcutta High Court has repeatedly questioned why Ghosh, being the principal of the medical college when the brutal crime took place, did not lodge a police complaint.
Ghosh, who faced the ire for alleged mismanagement and financial irregularities at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, resigned from his post facing protests from the medical students.
""He is a criminal, not a doctor. He's ruined many students' lives.... He runs a mafia raj. He has ruined many lives, taught students to consume alcohol and he even sold unclaimed dead bodies and tampered with death records and removed the registers so that nobody comes to know about it,"" Ali told Times Now.
Meanwhile, junior doctors protesting against the crime and demanding justice for the same, were seen celebrating the arrest.

However, they said they will continue their protest until justice is delivered.
The key suspect in the rape and murder case of the junior doctor so far has been identified as Sanjay Roy, a civic volunteer, who was seen on the hospital's CCTV near the crime scene.
Sanjay Roy, Sandeep Ghosh, and some doctors whose fingerprints were taken from the seminar hall, where the junior doctor's body was found, have been made to undergo polygraph tests.
The CCTV footage shows Sanjay Roy entering the hospital at 1.03 on the fateful night when the incident took place, media reports said.
During interrogation, the police had shown him the CCTV evidence, after which Sanjay Roy admitted to the crime, media reports said.
Before he reached the hospital at 1.03 am the night the junior doctor was raped and murdered, Sanjay Roy had gone to two brothels in Kolkata, the police have said.
He went to the red light area Sonagachi on August 8 night, drank alcohol, and visited two brothels one after another, sources had said.

ELOCW3V3LO_E73647X7X2UI8KM,"Growing anti-Khalistan sentiments pinning SFJ in Europe, US, and Canada",India Blooms News Service,"04 Sep 2024, 05:08 pm",20240904,indiablooms.com,https://www.indiablooms.com/news-details/O/99588/growing-anti-khalistan-sentiments-pinning-sfj-in-europe-us-and-canada.html,"A significant shift in sentiment is emerging as pro-India Sikhs, who form a substantial portion of the diaspora, push back against the divisive and disruptive activities of Khalistani elements, particularly those associated with the controversial group, Sikhs for Justice (SFJ).
The most recent flashpoint in this escalating tension occurred in Italy, where two prominent Gurudwara Committees—Gurudwara Singh Sabha (GSS) in Flero, Brescia, and Gurudwara Sri Kalgidhar Sahib (GSKS) in Torre de’ Picenardi, Cremona—found themselves at the center of a disturbing incident involving SFJ activists.
The committees had come under fire from SFJ for attending the Indian Independence Day celebrations at the Consulate General of India in Milan, an act seen by the radical group as a betrayal of the Khalistani cause.
SFJ activists Ranjit Singh aka Jitu Bhagat, and his brother Jaswant Singh, both based in the Cremona area, allegedly orchestrated a smear campaign against the committee members.
By circulating a video taken from the Consulate’s webpage and posting it online with derogatory comments, the SFJ aimed to intimidate and shame the Gurudwara officials who had participated in the Independence Day event. They asked a US national of Indian origin (https://www.tiktok.com/@bajwasingh3600) to post the video with nasty comments. However, the attempt backfired spectacularly.
Rather than cower under pressure, the Gurudwara Committees and the broader Sikh Sangat (community) responded with a unified and decisive stance. During a gathering on August 18, 2024, the Sangat condemned the actions of SFJ and the two brothers, and in a symbolic act of defiance, removed all furniture belonging to the brothers from the Gurudwara Sahib.
They went further, destroying all Khalistani banners and flags that had been placed in the Gurudwara by the SFJ sympathizers. This act was not merely a rejection of the SFJ’s ideology but a powerful assertion of the Sikh community’s alignment with a united India.
The incident in Italy is not isolated. Across the United States, Canada, and other parts of Europe, similar patterns are emerging. Pro-Khalistani rallies, which were once met with either apathy or muted resistance, are now encountering organized opposition from within the Sikh community.
During the August 15 Independence Day celebrations, pro-India Sikhs in several cities confronted and disrupted pro-Khalistan protests, signaling a growing weariness with the separatist rhetoric and a desire for harmony and stability.
This shift has profound implications. It underscores the growing disillusionment with SFJ’s methods, which often involve online harassment, intimidation, and the exploitation of Sikh religious sentiments for political ends.
The international Sikh community, deeply rooted in values of justice, peace, and mutual respect, is increasingly rejecting the divisive narratives propagated by Khalistani elements.
Moreover, the backlash against SFJ and other pro-Khalistani groups highlights the broader diaspora’s connection to India.
Many Sikhs abroad maintain strong ties to their homeland, where they have witnessed firsthand the economic growth, social progress, and efforts at reconciliation that have marked India’s recent history.
The idea of a Khalistan, once a rallying cry for a beleaguered minority, now seems out of step with the realities of a globally connected world where identity and allegiance are far more complex and intertwined.
The actions of the Gurudwara Committees in Italy serve as a potent reminder that the Sikh diaspora is not monolithic. While there will always be diverse perspectives within any community, the increasing resistance to Khalistani extremism signals a pivotal moment. Sikhs across the globe are asserting their identity not as pawns in a separatist agenda, but as proud members of a global community committed to peace, unity, and the betterment of all.
As the world watches, the message is clear: the days of Khalistani extremism dominating the discourse among the Sikh diaspora are waning. The growing chorus of voices opposing these radical elements, as seen in Italy, marks the beginning of a new chapter—one where the Sikh community can focus on building bridges, not walls, and where the true spirit of Sikhi can flourish unencumbered by the divisive politics of a select few.

In a supposed fallout of the remark, Atish Sarkar said, ""Mamata Banerjee has asked us to protest. If we protest, we will hang pictures malingering the characters of women of your family at your home. You won't be able to take those posters down.""
""I am saying this with full responsibility. Such days are approaching. We will hang distorted pictures of women of your family on the walls of your houses for maligning and character assassinating Mamata Banerjee on Facebook,"" he added with several women leaders of TMC sitting behind him tight-lipped.
Amid criticism, TMC MP Kakali Ghosh Dastidar said Sarkar has been suspended from the party for a year over his remark.
Opposition BJP state president Sukanta Majumdar reacting to the speech said: ""The poor taste and uneducated statement of these TMC leaders is dangerous not only for the state but also for the society. Women of West Bengal will give a befitting reply to it. The end of TMC rule is certain.""
রাজ্যের মহিলাদের সম্পর্কে এদের বক্তব্যে যেভাবে অতি নিম্ন রুচি, কুশিক্ষার পরিচয় উঠে আসছে সেটা রাজ্যের জন্য শুধু নয় সমাজের পক্ষেও বিপজ্জনক।  বাংলার মাতৃশক্তি এর ঠিক জবাব দেবেন। এ রাজ্য থেকে তৃণমূলের বিসর্জন নিশ্চিত।
What did Mamata Banerjee say?
Speaking at a mega rally of her Trinamool Congress' youth wing, Mamata referred to her slogan against the then Left government in 2011 when she asked people to bring in a political change but no revenge.
Thirteen years later, Mamata, a senior politician, has perhaps deflected from her stance but with caution.
""I have been humiliated a lot but never returned vengeance. We wanted change but no revenge. But now I ask you to counter in a manner it is required as per your understanding. I don't want violence but counter as and when required. Unmask all who are conspiring against us,"" Mamata said in downtown Kolkata. She used the Bengali word ""phonsh"" meaning the hissing sound of snake to scare away threats.
Relaunching her outsider-insider debate that ruled the 2021 assembly elections which TMC won by a mammoth margin, the Chief Minister warned people, who have come from other states and resided in West Bengal, of a counter if they resort to violence against police.
In the backdrop of the protesters-police clash during Nabanna march on Tuesday, Mamata said, ""People, who are outsiders but staying in Bengal, should be ready for a counter-attack if they hurt police conspiring with the BJP. I don't want anyone to be attacked. I do not want any death or loss. But I won't allow people to stay in Bengal and torture the state.
""There is no reason for considering me as weak. Sometimes, it is better to be tolerant. But no one knows what I can do if my tolerance limit crosses because I am the product of the movement. I am born with movement and will die with it. Challenge me if you can.""
Mamata Banerjee's clarification
In an X post, the Chief Minister issued a clarification saying, ""I have spoken against BJP. I have spoken against them because, with the support of the Government of India, they are threatening the democracy in our State and trying to create anarchy. With support from Centre, they are trying to create lawlessness and I have raised my voice against them.
""I also clarify that the phrase (""phonsh kara"") that I had used in my speech yesterday is a quote from Sri Ramakrishna Paramahansa Deva. The legendary saint had said that occasionally there is need to raise one's voice. When there are crimes and criminal offences, voice of protest has to be raised. My speech on that point was a direct allusion to the great Ramakrishnite saying.""

Taslima Nasreen said Bangladesh is witnessing a rise in intolerance.

Nasreen worried that women will be badly hit in the South Asian country.
""The increasing prominence of radical Islamists will take away the rights of women by imposing restrictions and controlling them under the Sharia law. Universities have already begun to issue diktats on Islamic dress code,"" she said.
Bangladesh witnessed a massive political upsurge in recent months with students protesting against the job quota issue and soon the demonstration turned into a massive movement demanding the ouster of former PMSheikh Hasina-led government.
The violence led to over 300 deaths.
Amid the violence demonstrations, PM Sheikh Hasina fled to India last month and she is still present in the neighbouring nation.
Hasina had returned to power for another term after winning the general polls in January.
Following the ouster of Hasina-led government, Muhammad Yunus-led interim government has taken charge of the country."

Born the day after the outbreak of the  conflict in Gaza between Hamas and Israel forces that began last October, Mr. Mohammed has struggled to get medical care.
She is one of the thousands of children benefiting from the mass polio vaccination campaign, which began on the first of September in the central area of Gaza.
Mohammed’s daughter is receiving oral vaccinations against type II polio at an UNRWA clinic in Nuseirat camp in central Gaza as part of the first phase of the campaign.
Nourhan Shamalakh, a young mother of two young sons and an infant daughter, left the simple tents they call home, in the central Gazan city of Deir al-Balah, to a health centre where her children could receive polio vaccinations. To get there, they travelled by donkey cart. She said that her fears of the disease outweighed her concerns at having to travel to the centre.
Lining up at the Deir al-Balah health centre, which us run by UNRWA, Mohammed Rajab waited for his baby daughter to receive her vaccination, which is administered orally. ""Given the conditions we live in and the diseases that are prevalent, vaccination is now of great importance to the survival of our children,” he said. “God willing, in these days of war, peace will prevail for all.""
The parents who have come to the health centre are well aware of the importance of vaccinations.
""The issue of polio in Gaza is serious,"" says Muhammad Abu Jayab. ""For decades the disease did not exist in Gaza. And now, because of the war, it has returned. This is a threat to hundreds of thousands of children in Gaza, including my own. This vaccination is a big step despite the harsh humanitarian and security landscape in Gaza.""
Vaccination campaign going to plan
Inside the health centre, the Agency's spokesperson, Louise Wateridge, followed the vaccination process as hundreds of families arrived to wait their turn.
""Our staff here is ready to vaccinate as many children as possible over the next three days in this first phase of the vaccination campaign,"" Wateridge said. ""Doses are kept in individual cooler boxes to keep them from the heat of the day. So far, the calm seems to prevail in the Gaza Strip. The humanitarian truce is holding so far, and that's what we need to implement this campaign, and we'll see how things go in the coming days. So far, everything is going according to plan. Children are arriving, families are here, vaccinations are going well."""
IUEA87HDJN_C334ZCGSLWJZ275,Mamata Banerjee's govt passes Aparajita Bill laying death penalty for rape convicts,India Blooms News Service,"03 Sep 2024, 09:30 pm",20240903,indiablooms.com,https://www.indiablooms.com/news-details/N/99565/mamata-banerjee-s-govt-passes-aparajita-bill-laying-death-penalty-for-rape-convicts.html,"These amendments are aimed at making punishment more stringent in cases of rape and child abuse.
The Bill seeks to amend several sections in the newly introduced Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS). Section 64 in Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita states that a rape convict will face rigorous imprisonment of not less than 10 years extending to life term.
The Bengal legislation tweaks this Section to increase the jail term to the ""remainder of that person's natural life and fine, or with death"". It also adds that this fine shall be fair and reasonable to meet the medical expenses and rehabilitation costs of the victim.
The Aparajita Bill also seeks to amend Section 66 of BNS, which lays down penalties for a convict if rape leads to the victim's death or causes her to be in a ""vegetative state"". While the Centre legislation states a punishment of a 20-year jail term, life imprisonment, and death for such a crime, the Bengal Bill says the convict should get only the death penalty.
Smt. @MamataOfficial's Aparajita Anti-Rape Bill has three key tenets: 👉🏻 Exemplary and severe punishment 👉🏻 Expeditious investigation 👉🏻 Speedy trials and time-bound justice delivery#BengalShowsTheWay pic.twitter.com/qjRGXnfxB0
Amending Section 70 of BNS, which deals with the penalty in cases of gangrape, the Bengal legislation has removed the option of a 20-year jail term and laid down provisions of life term and death for those convicted of such crimes.
The Bengal legislation also toughens the penalty in cases related to revealing the identity of a victim of sexual violence. While the BNS provides a jail term of up to two years in such cases, the Aparajita Bill provides imprisonment between three and five years.
GoWB is committed to delivering the strictest punishment in cases of sexual violence.  Smt. @MamataOfficial outlined key aspects of the Aparajita Anti-Rape Bill and the amendments it proposes to the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.#BengalShowsTheWay pic.twitter.com/gfLniuX68q
The Bengal legislation also toughens the punishments in child abuse cases as laid down by the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.
Besides toughening penalties, the Bengal legislation includes provisions for setting up special courts to hear sexual violence cases and task forces to probe them.
Although the TMC government-led legislation cleared the Bengal House comfortably with the support of both the ruling party and the Opposition, it will need both the Governor's and the President's assent before it can come into force.
Criminal Law comes in the concurrent list. This means that a law passed by a state Assembly can be implemented even if it is at odds with a law passed by Parliament, provided it has the President's assent.
However, the President acts on the advice of ministers, and it is the Centre that will decide on whether this Bill becomes an Act. The Trinamool is a key rival of the BJP, which is in power at the Centre, and therefore, the Aparajita Bill is unlikely to get the nod.

According to a press release from the Air India Group, the groundbreaking event was graced by Gunjan Krishna, Commissioner for Industrial Development and Director of the Department of Industries and Commerce, Government of Karnataka; Hari Marar, Managing Director and CEO of Bangalore International Airport Limited (BIAL); Chin Yau Seng, CEO of SIA Engineering Company; and other senior leaders from Air India.
The MRO facility in Bengaluru is expected to generate over 1,200 new jobs for skilled aviation engineers and support more than 200 small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Karnataka through an improved supply chain, Air India said in the press release.
The Tata Group-owned airline said this development will contribute to a robust MRO ecosystem in Karnataka and support Air India’s ambition to make Bengaluru a key hub with enhanced global connectivity.
The new MRO facility will feature a state-of-the-art hangar capable of accommodating both wide-body and narrow-body aircraft for base maintenance under one roof, the press release said, adding that future expansions will include additional hangars and a dedicated paint hangar.
Air India said the new MRO will set a new benchmark in aviation maintenance with advanced aircraft maintenance technologies such as overhead teleplatforms, cranes, universal docking systems, and India’s largest vertical lift hangar doors.
The Bengaluru MRO, along with the expansion of Air India’s line maintenance facilities across its network and the recently updated wide-body hangar in Mumbai, will enhance the airline’s self-reliance in fleet maintenance starting in 2025, the press release said.
Air India also plans to build a new wide-body hangar in Delhi for line maintenance, fostering a comprehensive maintenance ecosystem at major airports, it added.

The CBI has tracked the call details of the officials and doctors who were present at the crime scene. The doctor was raped and murdered at the seminar hall.
Theough the probe agency has learnt that the incoming calls were from an overseas number, it is yet to trace the owner of the number.
But the CBI has learnt that the number is a prepaid and rechargeable sim card.
As per reports, the CBI officials have forwarded the number to their higher authorities so that they can connect to the external affairs wing of the particular country to track the details of the sim card owner.
Reportedly, the officials and doctors who received the calls are close-confidantes of ex-college principal Dr. Sandip Ghosh, who was on Monday arrested by the CBI in connection with the financial irregularities in RG Kar Hospital.
The only arrest in the crime was made so far by the Kolkata Police, which swiftly nabbed civic volunteer Sanjoy Roy. Sanjoy has denied committing the murder.
Junior doctors and protesters suspect the crime was committed by more than one and an attempt to tamper with evidence and cover up the crime is at play right from the beginning.
The Mamata Banerjee government is now in a crisis as people's protests roil the state challenging the state administration, which was marred by political violence and rampant corruption cases for more than a decade now.
The administration's swift run for the last rites of the victim and demolition work near the crime scene have raised some uncomfortable questions for the state administration, which is helmed by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee who holds both the police and health portfolios."

Recent measures by the Bank of Maldives to restrict foreign currency spending, along with a second downgrade by Fitch since June, have triggered a wave of selling, said the report.
With $500 million in sukuk debt due in 2026, all eyes are on the coupon payment scheduled for October 8.
Purvi Harlalka, senior emerging-market sovereign debt strategist at M&G, noted in a Bloomberg report, ""Without a last-minute foreign exchange infusion from China, the GCC, or India, the non-payment of the October coupon is a plausible scenario.""
Despite having gross reserves of $395 million in June, the Maldives' usable reserves stand at only $45 million.
Traders flee Maldives amid escalating default risk
The Maldives Monetary Authority is currently negotiating a $400 million currency swap deal with India, but Fitch's downgrade to CC highlights increasing fears of a potential default.
Soeren Moerch, a portfolio manager at Danske Bank, noted that the bank sold most of its bonds earlier this summer as the reserves began to decline.
""Things are much worse now,"" he was quoted as saying to Bloomberg, emphasizing that the main question is whether Muslim nations will permit the Maldives to default on a sukuk bond.
Despite increasing tourism revenues, the Maldives continues to rely heavily on imports and maintains a dollar peg, which puts additional pressure on its reserves.
The ruling People’s National Congress, under pro-China President Mohamed Muizzu, gained a parliamentary majority earlier this year, adding complexity to the geopolitical situation.
""The ‘India Out’ campaign and lack of USD liquidity are red flags. It’s too early for us to reinvest,"" Woznica was quoted as saying by Bloomberg."

EFTA includes Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.
On Wednesday, the Swiss Federal Council adopted a dispatch on the free-trade agreement between the EFTA states and India, the Swiss government said in a statement.
“Today the world wants to invest in India. Everybody wants to come to India. Singapore has already invested about $150 billion in India. They are ready to invest probably five times that amount in the coming years,” Goyal said.
He said that if all states and union territories (UTs) could come to one platform for approvals and facilities, it would attract global investment in each state.
Goyal said that approvals to industries in states should be time-bound and should be easy.
""We are experimenting with a system whereby people should not need to come to government offices for approvals and compliances,"" the Minister added.
He said that the Centre and states can work together in all sectors and push towards greater employment opportunities.
Goyal said that the government is making sincere efforts to promote India as the investment destination for the world and attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) across different states and UTs.
He said that the Union Government has created a level playing field for all the states and UTs to attract FDI.
The investments coming from abroad are going to different states and each of them are beneficiary of our efforts to attract FDI, he added."

""If India wants to keep her until Bangladesh wants her back, the condition would be that she must stay quiet,"" Yunus stated.
In an interview with PTI at his official residence in Dhaka, Yunus, who was appointed Chief Advisor after Hasina's removal from power, emphasised that while Bangladesh values its strong relationship with India, New Delhi must move ""beyond the narrative that portrays every political party except the Awami League as Islamist and that the country will become like Afghanistan without Sheikh Hasina.""
In an interview with PTI at his official residence in Dhaka, Yunus, who was appointed the country's Chief Advisor after Hasina's ouster, stressed that while Bangladesh values strong ties with India, New Delhi must move “beyond the narrative that portrays every other political party except Awami League as Islamist and that the country will turn into Afghanistan without Sheikh Hasina.” ""No one is comfortable with her stance there in India because we want her back to try her. She is there in India and at times she is talking, which is problematic. Had she been quiet, we would have forgotten it; people would have also forgotten it as she would have been in her own world. But sitting in India, she is speaking and giving instructions. No one likes it,” he said.
Yunus was apparently referring to Hasina's statement on August 13, in which she called for ""justice"" and demanded that those responsible for the recent ""terror acts,"" killings, and vandalism be investigated, identified, and punished.
“It is not good for us or for India. There is discomfort regarding it,” he told PTI.
After unprecedented anti-government protests that culminated on August 5, Hasina resigned as prime minister and fled to India. Her nearly four-week stay in India has sparked speculation in Bangladesh.
When asked whether Bangladesh has communicated its position to India, Yunus stated that it has been conveyed verbally and quite firmly that she should remain silent.
“Everyone understands it. We have said quite firmly that she should keep quiet. This is an unfriendly gesture towards us; she has been given shelter there and she is campaigning from there. It is not that she has gone there on a normal course. She has fled following a people's uprising and public anger,” he said.
When discussing the future of India-Bangladesh relations, Yunus expressed a desire for strong ties with India but emphasized that New Delhi must move away from the narrative that only Hasina's leadership guarantees the country's stability.
“The way forward is for India to come out of the narrative. The narrative is that everybody is Islamist, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) is Islamist, and everyone else is Islamist and will make this country into Afghanistan. And Bangladesh is in safe hands with Sheikh Hasina at the helm only. India is captivated by this narrative. India has to come out of this narrative. Bangladesh, like any other nation, is another neighbour,” he said.
The minority Hindu community has experienced vandalism of their businesses and properties, as well as the destruction of temples, during the student-led violence that erupted after Hasina's ouster.
In his Independence Day speech from the Red Fort on August 15, Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed hope for a return to normalcy in violence-hit Bangladesh and stated that 1.4 billion Indians are concerned about the safety of Hindus and other minorities in the neighbouring country.
“We need to work together to improve this relationship, which is now at a low,” he said.
The 84-year-old Nobel laureate stressed the importance of India and Bangladesh working together to improve their currently strained relations.
When asked about ways to enhance ties between the two countries, Yunus noted that cooperation is essential, but acknowledged that the relationship is currently deteriorating."

Samantha made her acting debut in the Telugu romance film Ye Maaya Chesave (2010), winning the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut – South.

Over the next few years, she played the leading lady in top-grossing androcentric films such as Dookudu (2011), Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu (2012), Attarintiki Daredi (2013), Kaththi (2014), Theri (2016), 24 (2016), Mersal (2017), and Rangasthalam (2018).

""If  the top court grants bail to Arvind Kejriwal, it will demoralise Delhi High Court,"" ASG S V Raju said, reported Moneycontrol.
Kejriwal's counsel Abhishek Manu Singhvi told the apex court that Kejriwal cannot be a ""flight risk"" since he is a constitutional functionary.
""Triple test is based on presumption of innocence. Ultimate object is to secure presence. You should not be a flight risk. A man who is a constitutional functionary cannot be a flight risk,"" he told the court, according to Moneycontrol.
The triple test requires the court to be assured that releasing the accused will not lead to a flight risk, tampering with evidence, or a lack of cooperation with ongoing investigations.
Singhvi contended that the CBI arrested Kejriwal on June 26 despite no arrests having been made in two years, calling it an ""insurance arrest.""
Kejriwal challenged the denial of bail and his arrest by the CBI in two separate petitions to the Supreme Court. On August 23, the court allowed the CBI to submit its counter affidavit and granted Kejriwal two days to file a rejoinder. The Delhi High Court had upheld his arrest on August 5.
Earlier, on July 12, the Supreme Court had granted bail to Kejriwal in connection with an Enforcement Directorate case related to a scam.
Kejriwal was arrested on March 21 by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) for his alleged involvement in the Delhi excise policy case, becoming the first sitting chief minister in India to be imprisoned.
He was granted temporary bail in May due to the Lok Sabha elections.
On August 9, the Supreme Court granted bail to former Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia in the liquor policy case."

""The government is taking it (the concerns) seriously,"" they added.
'Emergency', in which Kangana Ranaut portrays former Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, was initially scheduled to be released on September 6.
However, the release date was postponed multiple times earlier.
The film's release has been deferred again as it is awaiting a certificate from the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC).
Several Sikh bodies have demanded a ban on the release of the movie claiming it misrepresents the community.
According to reports, a top gurdwara body Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) has sent a legal notice to the producers of 'Emergency', citing the film's misrepresentation of the history of Sikhs.
It demanded the removal of the objectionable scenes that will hurt Sikh sentiments.
The actor-turned-politician, a BJP MP from Mandi, who is herself the director, writer, and co-producer of 'Emergency', earlier termed the postponing of the film's release over such objections as ""hugely demotivating and unjust"".
Drawing parallels between her movie and Netflix series 'IC814: The Kandahar Hijack', she said censorship was only for those who make films based on ""historic facts"".
""Law of the land is that one can show unimaginable amount of violence and nudity on OTT platforms without any consequence or censorship, one can even distort real-life events to suit their politically motivated sinister motives, there is all the freedom for communists or leftists across the world for such anti-national expressions,"" Kangana was quoted as saying by NDTV.

Earlier, three other cases were also reported in Peshawar.
They were all detected at the airport.
“The rapid response team took samples from the patient’s wound in the hospital and sent it to the laboratory,""  Roghani said.
“No local cases have been reported so far,” he stated, adding that the province’s health department had “created an integrated surveillance and response system for mpox”.
What is mpox?
Formerly known as monkeypox, the viral disease can spread between people, mainly through close contact, and occasionally from the environment to people via objects and surfaces that have been touched by a person with mpox.
Originating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1970, mpox was neglected there, according to WHO.
“It is time to act decisively to prevent history from repeating itself,” said Dimie Ogoina, who chairs the International Health Regulations’ Emergency Committee, which advises WHO on such matters.
Endemic in central and West Africa, the infectious disease later caused a global outbreak in 2022, leading to a WHO public health emergency in July as it became a multi-country outbreak.
Following a series of consultations with global experts, WHO has begun using a new preferred term “mpox” as a synonym for monkeypox.
What are the symptoms?
Common symptoms of mpox include a rash lasting for two to four weeks, which may be started with or followed by fever, headache, muscle aches, back pain, low energy and swollen lymph nodes.
The rash looks like blisters and can affect the face, palms of the hands, soles of the feet, groin, genital and/or anal regions, mouth, throat or the eyes. The number of sores can range from one to several thousand.
People with mpox are considered infectious at least until all their blisters have crusted over, the scabs have fallen off and a new layer of skin has formed underneath, and all lesions on the eyes and in the body have healed. Typically this takes two to four weeks. Reports show that people can be re-infected after they’ve had mpox.
People with severe mpox may require hospitalisation, supportive care and antiviral medicines to reduce the severity of lesions and shorten time to recovery.
How does mpox spread?
Human to human: Touching, sex and talking or breathing close to someone with mpox can generate infectious respiratory particles, but more research is needed on how the virus spreads during outbreaks in different settings and conditions, says WHO.
What scientists do know is that it is also possible for the virus to persist for some time on clothing, bedding, towels, objects, electronics and surfaces that have been touched by a person with mpox. Someone else who is in contact with these items may become infected without first washing their hands before touching their eyes, nose and mouth.
The virus can also spread during pregnancy to the fetus, during or after birth through skin-to-skin contact, or from a parent with mpox to an infant or child during close contact.
Although getting mpox from someone who is asymptomatic has been reported, there is still limited information on whether the virus can be transmitted from someone with the virus before they get symptoms or after their lesions have healed.
Humans to animals: Since many species of animals are known to be susceptible to the virus, there is the potential for spillback of the virus from humans to animals in different settings.
People who have confirmed or suspected mpox should avoid close physical contact with animals, including such pets as cats, dogs, hamsters and gerbils, as well as livestock and wildlife.
Animals to humans: Someone who comes into physical contact with an animal which carries the virus, such as some species of monkey - or a terrestrial rodent like a tree squirrel - may also develop mpox. Such exposure can occur through bites or scratches, or during activities such as hunting, skinning, trapping or preparing a meal. The virus can also be caught through eating contaminated meat which is not cooked thoroughly.
Can it be fatal?
Yes, for a small minority. Between 0.1 per cent and 10 per cent of people who have become infected with mpox, have died.
It is important to note that death rates in different settings may differ due to several factors, such as access to health care and underlying immunosuppression, including because of undiagnosed HIV or advanced HIV, according to the UN health agency.
In most cases, the symptoms of mpox go away on their own within a few weeks with supportive care, such as medication for pain or fever, but, in some people, the illness can be severe or lead to complications and eventual death.
Newborn babies, children, people who are pregnant and people with underlying immune deficiencies - such as from advanced HIV - may be at higher risk of more serious mpox disease and death."

The attack took place in Koutruk village in the Imphal West district, which borders Kuki tribes-dominated Kangpokpi district.
Several houses and vehicles were set on fire allegedly by the Kuki insurgents on Sunday night.
Security forces had covered up the entire area on Monday morning.
The area was volatile even on Monday. As per a report by NDTV, intermittent firing and explosions were heard at a distance.
Janghaolun, a spokesperson of Manipur's Kuki Inpi, said as quoted by NDTV, ""The violence in Manipur will continue to escalate till the time there is no permanent political solution or Biren Singh remains the Chief Minister.""
More than 200 people died and about 50,000 others displaced after the ethnic clash between the Meiteis and Kukis broke out in Manipur on May 3, 2023.
The outbreak of violence in Manipur can be traced back to the 'Tribal Solidarity March' initiated by the All Tribal Students' Union of Manipur (ATSUM).
The march was organized as a form of protest against the demand to include the Meitei community in the Scheduled Tribe (ST) category, which was prompted by a directive from the Manipur High Court on April 19.
The march served as a catalyst for the subsequent escalation of violence in the region.
Approximately 53 percent of the population in Manipur comprises Meiteis, residing predominantly in the Imphal Valley, while the remaining 40 percent consists of tribal communities such as Kukis, residing primarily in the hill districts surrounding the Valley."

The attack it said was the culmination of Hamas’s decades-long campaign of terrorism and violence against Israel and its allies, including American citizens. ""The defendants are either deceased or remain at large,"" read the statement issued by the US Department of Justice.
“The Justice Department has charged Yahya Sinwar and other senior leaders of Hamas for financing, directing, and overseeing a decades-long campaign to murder American citizens and endanger the national security of the United States,” said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland.
“On October 7th, Hamas terrorists, led by these defendants, murdered nearly 1200 people, including over 40 Americans, and kidnapped hundreds of civilians. This weekend, we learned that Hamas murdered an additional six people they had kidnapped and held captive for nearly a year, including Hersh Goldberg-Polin, a 23 year old Israeli American.
""We are investigating Hersh’s murder, and each and every one of Hamas’ brutal murders of Americans, as an act of terrorism. The charges unsealed today are just one part of our effort to target every aspect of Hamas’ operations. These actions will not be our last.”
According to AP, the impact of the case may be mostly symbolic given that Sinwar is believed to be hiding in tunnels in Gaza and the Justice Department says three of the six defendants are believed now to be dead.

“Yahya Sinwar and the other senior leaders of Hamas are charged today with orchestrating this terrorist organization’s decades-long campaign of mass violence and terror — including on October 7th. On that horrible day, Hamas terrorists viciously massacred nearly 1,200 innocent men, women, and children, including over 40 Americans, kidnapped hundreds more, and used sexual violence as a weapon of brutality,” said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco.
“Since that horrific day, we have worked to investigate and hold accountable those responsible, and we will not rest until all those who kidnapped or murdered Americans are brought to justice. Our thoughts continue to be with the families of all the victims of this barbaric terrorist attack.”
“From the moment Hamas launched its horrific attack on October 7, the FBI has been dedicated to identifying and charging those responsible for these heinous crimes,” said FBI Director Christopher Wray.
“The FBI has and will continue to relentlessly investigate these attacks on civilians, including Americans. Hamas is a Foreign Terrorist Organization with a long history of violence, and the group’s actions have resulted in increased terrorism threats in the U.S. and against American interests throughout the world. Countering terrorism remains our number one priority, and our work continues,” he said.
“The core mission of the National Security Division is to protect Americans from violent terrorists and extremist organizations like Hamas,” said Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the Justice Department’s National Security Division.
“The atrocities committed by Hamas in Israel on October 7 are intolerable, and the Justice Department will not rest in our pursuit to hold Hamas accountable for perpetrating its campaign of terror, death, and destruction,” he said.
“For decades, Hamas and its leadership have dedicated themselves to the eradication of the State of Israel, and to murdering, maiming, and brutalizing anyone — including dozens of Americans — who stood in their way,” said U.S. Attorney Damian Williams for the Southern District of New York.
“The October 7 Hamas Massacres – in which over 40 American citizens were murdered – is only the latest act of savagery carried out by Hamas. This office has long been dedicated to serving as a bulwark against terrorism, and striking blows against its leaders. Our commitment is clear: if you hurt one member of our community, you hurt all of us — and we stand with all victims of Hamas’ reign of terror. We will bring justice to this terrorist organization from the top down for the atrocities they have committed.”
According to court documents, Harakat al-Muqawamah al-Islamiyya, commonly known as Hamas, is a terrorist organization that was founded in 1987, and has been designated as a foreign terrorist organization (FTO) by the United States since 1997.
""From its inception, Hamas’ stated purpose has been to create an Islamic Palestinian state throughout Israel by eliminating the State of Israel through violent holy war, or jihad,"" the US Department of Justice said in a statement.
""Hamas also promotes attacks against the U.S. and its citizens and, over more than two decades, Hamas has murdered and injured dozens of Americans as part of its campaign of violence and terror,"" the statement said.
""The defendants charged in the complaint are all senior leaders of Hamas who have orchestrated, overseen, and supported Hamas’s decades-long campaign of terrorism, including the October 7 Hamas Massacres,"" the statement further said.

USONWO8MRY_ZOO0217IJEZT3SO,Ignoring Khalistan extremism harms real Sikhs,India Blooms News Service,"02 Sep 2024, 05:03 pm",20240902,indiablooms.com,https://www.indiablooms.com/news-details/O/99527/ignoring-khalistan-extremism-harms-real-sikhs.html,"This catastrophic event, the deadliest aircraft bombing until September 11, 2001, remains a somber marker of how extremist ideologies can wreak havoc across borders.
Yet, while the September 11 attacks reshaped American attitudes towards radical Islam, the Air India tragedy has not been accorded similar reflection or response, especially in Canada.
In the wake of September 11, 2001, the American public and policymakers were forced to confront the uncomfortable reality that not all Muslim organizations were benign. Many discovered that beneath the veneer of religious and community organizations, some were indeed fronts for extremist agendas. Prominent among these were the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) and the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA), both criticized for their ties to the Muslim Brotherhood and questionable affiliations.
In contrast, Khalistan extremism, exemplified by the Air India bombing, has not received the same level of scrutiny. This discrepancy is partly due to the fact that the vast majority of the 329 victims were not Americans, but Canadians, making the event less visible in the American consciousness. However, this lack of attention is a disservice to the victims and to the broader fight against extremist ideologies.
Canada’s approach to Khalistan extremism has been particularly problematic. Despite the serious threat posed by pro-Khalistan militants, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his administration have been criticized for their superficial understanding of Sikh issues and their political calculations regarding the Sikh vote. The result has been a political blindness to the dangers posed by extremist elements within the Sikh community.
The United Kingdom, however, has been more proactive in addressing similar issues. Five years ago, the Bloom Review was commissioned to assess the engagement of the British government with religious groups. The review identified three categories of believers: the sincere and peaceful “true believers,” the generally decent “non-believers,” and the problematic “make-believers” who exploit religion for personal gain. This framework has been instrumental in recognizing that while the majority of British Sikhs are true believers, a fringe group of extremists has been hijacking Sikh institutions to further their radical agendas.
In Britain, this recognition has led to concrete measures to address extremist influence. The Bloom Review recommended a zero-tolerance approach to gurdwaras—Sikh temples—hijacked by extremists. It emphasized that the aggressive actions of pro-Khalistan militants, including threats and violence, should not be tolerated as they undermine the broader Sikh community.
In North America, however, the response has lagged. Sikh extremists in Canada and the U.S. have been able to exert undue influence and create a false narrative of power that often intimidates and marginalizes peaceful Sikhs. This has been exacerbated by political leaders who, driven by short-term electoral considerations, fail to challenge extremist elements and instead mistakenly engage with them.
The American and Canadian governments must learn from the British experience. It is crucial to differentiate between peaceful Sikh communities and the extremist fringe that seeks to exploit them. The dangers posed by Khalistan extremists are not dissimilar to those posed by radical Islamic groups: they use religion as a cover for their radical aims and engage in intimidation to suppress dissent within their own communities.
To confront this threat effectively, policymakers must prioritize a nuanced understanding of Sikhism and not be swayed by the loudest or most aggressive voices. They must support and protect the majority of Sikhs who are devoted to their faith’s principles of peace and community service. Tolerating or appeasing extremist factions under the guise of religious freedom only serves to undermine it.
The Air India 182 tragedy should not be a forgotten chapter but a powerful reminder of the need for vigilance against all forms of extremism. Just as the lessons from September 11 reshaped American approaches to counterterrorism, the legacy of Air India 182 should prompt a more rigorous and informed approach to dealing with Sikh extremism. It is time for Canada and the United States to adopt policies that recognize and address the real threats posed by extremist factions, ensuring that the principles of religious freedom are upheld in practice, not just in rhetoric.

The Nabanna march was called by Paschim Banga Chhatra Samaj demanding justice for the 31-year-old trainee doctor who was raped and murdered at Kolkata's RG Kar Medical College and Hospital.
The Chief Minister's resignation was also one of the demands by the organisation, which is yet to be registered.
Granting him bail, Justice Amrita Sinha had observed Sayan is not an influential person or does not hold any position or power to influence, hence he is liable to be released from jail.
The court has also restrained police from taking any coercive action against Sayan, who was arrested while he was leaving a local television channel earlier this week.
Sayan's mother Anjali had filed a plea seeking her son's bail and quashing all proceedings against the Chhatra Samaj leader.
People clashed with police, water cannons and tear gas shells were fired on several roads leading to Howrah, where state secretariat Nabanna is located, last Tuesday.
Though the RG Kar case is now being probed by the CBI, the state administration is facing public anger over its slow progress in the case until it was handed over to the premier investigating agency under the central government.
One person, a civic volunteer, has been arrested in connection with the case but protesting students as well as the victim's parents suspect more people are involved in the case."
