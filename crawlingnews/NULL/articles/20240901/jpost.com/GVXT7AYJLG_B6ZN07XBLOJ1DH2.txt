Israeli leaders and politicians reacted on Sunday morning to the IDF's recovery of the bodies of hostages Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Eden Yerushalmi, Carmel Gat, Almog Sarusi, Alexander Lobanov, and Ori Danino from Rafah in the Gaza Strip. President Isaac Herzog said following the IDF confirmation of the identities early Sunday morning, "The heart of an entire nation is shattered to pieces."He apologized "for failing to bring them home safely."  The president vowed that Israel would "continue to fight relentlessly against the criminal, terrorist organization Hamas, which has once again proven there is no end to its willingness to commit murder and crimes against humanity.""The blood of our brothers cries out to us. Our sisters and brothers are still there, enduring hell. The supreme covenant between the state and its citizens is to ensure their safety. We have the sacred and urgent mission to bring them home," Herzog concluded.  Carmel Gat, Eden Yerushalmi, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Ori Danino, Alexander Lobanov and Almog Sarusi.

"It is too late for the hostages killed in cold-blooded murder," he stated, adding, "We must return home the hostages remaining in Hamas captivity."הקבינט המדיני-ביטחוני חייב להתכנס באופן מיידי ולהפוך את ההחלטה שהתקבלה ביום חמישי. זה מאוחר עבור החטופים שנרצחו בדם קר. חייבים להשיב הביתה את החטופים שנותרו בשבי החמאס.מדינת ישראל תבוא חשבון עם כל ראשי ומרצחי החמאס, עד האחרון שבהם.— יואב גלנט - Yoav Gallant (@yoavgallant) September 1, 2024 He further stated Israel would "reckon" with Hamas, "down to the last one."Opposition head Yair Lapid said in a Sunday statement that the murder of the six hostages could have been prevented. "Instead of doing a deal, they do politics. Instead of saving lives, they bury hostages. Instead of doing everything to return them home, Netanyahu is doing everything to remain in power," Lapid wrote.    Stay updated with the latest news!

Their fate is one - death."He added that there were those who did not do everything in their power to prevent the hostages' death. Gantz noted that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was "hesitant, scared, and is playing for time out of political considerations instead of acting."Head of the Shas party, Arye Deri, stated that there was no dispute regarding the immediate necessity to return the hostages and eliminate Hamas.  "These two values ​​constitute the significant basis for unity," he noted. Former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett criticized the current government in a statement on X."There are ways to balance the security needs of the State of Israel with the moral obligation of the Jewish State to do everything to return its sons and daughters who were kidnapped from their beds and from a dance party, and we failed to protect them. Chaotic and conflicted management and political considerations have rudely invaded our sanctum sanctorum, threatening our fundamental values," he stated.
