Bern, 04.09.2024 -- On 4 September, the Federal Council decided to extend indefinitely the humanitarian exemption to the sanctions regime against Syria. The exemption was introduced for a limited period following the earthquake that hit the country in February 2023.
In light of the grave humanitarian crisis in Syria following the earthquake of 6 February 2023, the European Union (EU) introduced a temporary humanitarian exemption to its sanctions regime against Syria on 23 February 2023. The exemption for international organisations and certain categories of humanitarian actors was subsequently extended twice. On 27 May 2024, the EU extended the exemption for a further year.
The Federal Council decided on 10 March 2023 to include the EU's temporary humanitarian exemption in the ordinance on measures against Syria, initially for a period of six months and since extended twice. The exemption means that the targeted financial sanctions do not apply to activities that are necessary for the humanitarian work of international organisations and some categories of humanitarian actors. With today's decision, the Federal Council is extending the duration of the exemption indefinitely, bringing the humanitarian actors involved a degree of predictability.
The Federal Council first adopted sanctions against Syria on 18 May 2011, thus aligning Switzerland with the sanctions regime adopted by the EU against Syria on 9 May 2011. It has subsequently amended the ordinance several times to reflect the EU's decisions.
