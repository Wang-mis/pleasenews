Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and Egyptian counterpart Abdel Fattah al-Sisi discussed the Gaza war and ways to further repair the long-frozen ties between the regional powers during talks in Ankara, in the first such presidential visit in 12 years.Relations between Ankara and Cairo collapsed in 2013 after Egypt's then-army chief Sisi led the ousting of the Muslim Brotherhood's Mohamed Mursi, a Turkish ally who had become Egypt's first democratically elected president the year before.Ties between the two countries began thawing in 2020 when Ankara launched a diplomatic drive to ease tensions with its estranged regional rivals, including the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Egypt.  Last year, Ankara and Cairo mutually reappointed ambassadors and Turkey said it would also provide Cairo with armed drones. Erdogan traveled to Cairo in February for his first trip to Egypt since 2012.He met Sisi at Ankara airport on Wednesday and the two then traveled in the same car to the presidential palace for around two hours of talks.
