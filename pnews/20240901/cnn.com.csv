08Y5Y868WJ_6TCCLZ1TV40U4NK,Andrew Cuomo agrees to testify publicly next week about his Covid-era nursing home advisory,"By Jake Tapper, CNN","3 minute read Updated 10:44 AM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240827,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/02/politics/andrew-cuomo-testify-covid-hearing/,"Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo will testify publicly before Congress next week about his controversial nursing home advisory from the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, informed sources and a House subcommittee say.
As CNN reported earlier, Cuomo, who testified in June behind closed doors before members of the House Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic, will testify in front of the same panel on September 10.
“Andrew Cuomo owes answers to the 15,000 families who lost loved ones in New York’s nursing homes during the COVID-19 pandemic. On September 10, Americans will have the opportunity to hear directly from the former governor about New York’s potentially fatal nursing home policies,” Rep. Brad Wenstrup, an Ohio Republican who chairs the subcommittee, said in a statement Tuesday morning.
A spokesperson for Cuomo confirmed Monday night that the former governor will testify.
“The one question that needs to be answered is still being ignored: ‘Why did more people die from COVID in the United States than any other country and how do we make sure it never happens again?’ It is Governor Cuomo’s pleasure to join the committee once again to try to get an answer,” said Rich Azzopardi, Cuomo’s spokesperson.
In a series of tweets Tuesday morning, the committee detailed takeaways from Cuomo’s June interview. The panel said he was “shockingly callous when discussing New York’s nursing home mortality rate” and that he “repeatedly deflected responsibility for issuing the nursing home directive.”
The committee said it also conducted interviews with nine high-ranking former Cuomo administration officials. It said transcripts from all interviews, including Cuomo’s, would be released ahead of the hearing next week.
A 2021 investigation by New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, found that the New York State Department of Health undercounted Covid-19 deaths among residents of nursing homes by approximately 50%, essentially by leaving out deaths of residents who had been transferred to hospitals. A 2022 audit by State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli concluded that Cuomo’s health department failed to report roughly 4,100 deaths between April 2020 and February 2021.
Cuomo has insisted that advisory was consistent with guidance from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Wenstrup said on “The Lead” in April that lawmakers wanted to ask the Democratic former governor about the March 2020 advisory, which barred nursing homes from rejecting patients solely on the basis of a Covid-19 diagnosis.
“I’m trying to learn why he would do something like this,” Wenstrup said. “As a doctor who has treated infections, it goes against all medical common sense to take someone who was highly contagious and put them amongst the most vulnerable.”
Cuomo was first elected governor in 2010 and served nearly three full terms before he resigned in August 2021 following the release of a report by James’ office that found he had sexually harassed 11 women. Cuomo has denied the allegations.

09K5RHKK3F_XRU8ZOBWACFC6NE,House Foreign Affairs Committee subpoenas Blinken over Afghanistan withdrawal,"By Haley Talbot, CNN","3 minute read Updated 11:06 AM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/03/politics/blinken-subpoena-house-committee-afghanistan/,"The House Foreign Affairs Committee on Tuesday subpoenaed Secretary of State Antony Blinken to appear later this month to discuss its report on the US’ withdrawal from Afghanistan.
“The Committee is holding this hearing because the Department of State was central to the Afghanistan withdrawal and served as the senior authority during the August non-combatant evacuation operation (NEO),” Republican Chairman Michael McCaul wrote of the hearing set for September 19.
In his letter, McCaul said Blinken had refused previous requests to appear before the committee.
The State Department said in a statement Wednesday that Blinken is unavailable to testify “on the dates proposed by the committee” and that they have proposed alternatives.
“It is disappointing that instead of continuing to engage with the department in good faith, the committee instead has issued yet another unnecessary subpoena,” Matthew Miller, a spokesman for the State Department, said in a statement.
McCaul has repeatedly called for accountability from the Biden administration on how the withdrawal from Afghanistan played out. He has slammed the administration for the Abbey Gate bombing that killed 13 US service members in the final chaotic days of the withdrawal.
McCaul is set to release on September 9 his committee’s report detailing the findings of its three-year investigation into the withdrawal from Afghanistan.
McCaul, in a statement, said the report “will serve as an indictment on the administration’s reckless refusal to properly prepare for the withdrawal, their cold indifference to the safety and security of U.S. personnel on the ground before and during the emergency evacuation, and their culpability in the deaths of 13 U.S. servicemembers who perished in the terrorist attack at Abbey Gate.”
Last year, the US State Department publicly released its Afghanistan After Action Review report, which found that the decisions to pull all US troops from Afghanistan had detrimental consequences.
“The decisions of both President (Donald) Trump and President (Joe) Biden to end the U.S. military mission in Afghanistan had serious consequences for the viability of the Afghan government and its security,” the unclassified report said.
“Those decisions are beyond the scope of this review, but the AAR (After Action Review) team found that during both administrations there was insufficient senior-level consideration of worst-case scenarios and how quickly those might follow,” it said.
The committee has conducted more than a dozen interviews as part of the investigation into the 2021 evacuation.
Former White House press secretary Jen Psaki sat for a transcribed interview before the committee in late July.
And three top State Department officials provided hours of closed-door testimony to the committee, providing more on the “unprecedented” situation in the final days of the US presence in Afghanistan.
Those officials – John Bass, Jim DeHart and Jayne Howell – rushed to Kabul in the days surrounding the Taliban’s seizure of the capital city, and dove into creating systems on the fly alongside the US military and with constantly changing input on the ground and coming from DC, as CNN has reported.

0CRGUWUEDK_FDIPNSJLZPY4U3B,Mystery of ‘Pinnacle Man’ found frozen in a cave solved after nearly five decades,"By Graham Hurley, CNN","2 minute read Published 9:07 AM EDT, Sun September 1, 2024",20240901,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/01/us/pinnacle-man-identified-five-decades/,"A man found frozen in a Pennsylvania cave in 1977 has finally been identified, closing the book on a nearly 50-year-long mystery.
The Berks County Coroner’s Office identified the remains of the missing man as Nicholas Paul Grubb, 27, from Fort Washington, Pennsylvania.
Surprisingly, advanced technology played no role in identifying the “Pinnacle Man,” a moniker inspired by the peak in the Appalachian Mountains near where Grubb was found.
Instead, Berks County Coroner John Fielding told reporters at a Tuesday news conference that a Pennsylvania State Police detective discovered the missing link to the cold case the old-fashioned way, by digging through files.
On January 16, 1977, hikers found a man’s frozen body in a cave just below the Pinnacle, in Albany Township, the Berks County Coroner said at the news conference.

During the autopsy he was unable to be identified based on his appearance, clothing or belongings, according to George Holmes, chief deputy coroner of Berks County. The cause of death, according to Holmes, was determined to be a drug-induced overdose. There were no signs of trauma to Grubb’s body suggesting foul play, the coroner’s office said.
Dental records and fingerprints were collected from the man’s body during his autopsy, according to Holmes, who added that the fingerprints were misplaced.
More than 42 years passed before authorities revisited the cold case, according to CNN affiliate WFMZ, which reported Grubb’s body was exhumed in 2019 after dental records linked him to two missing person cases in Florida and Illinois.
Berks County forensic experts performed an exam in 2019, and DNA samples were taken to update his record in the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System, or NamUs. But they did not match the two missing person cases, the coroner’s office said.

Fast-forward to early August, when there was a major break in the cold case. Ian Keck of the Pennsylvania State Police found the lost fingerprint card from Grubb’s 1977 autopsy.
Keck submitted the fingerprint card to NamUs on August 12, according to Holmes, and within an hour an FBI fingerprint expert matched the Pinnacle Man’s fingerprints to Grubb’s.
One of Grubb’s family members was notified by the Berks County Coroner’s Office, who confirmed Grubb’s identity. The family member asked the office to place his remains in the family plot.
“This identification brings a long awaited resolution to his family, who have been notified and expressed their deep appreciation for the collective efforts that made it possible. It is moments like these that remind us of the importance of our work to provide answers, to bring closure and to give the unidentified a name and a story,” Fielding said."
0U4YTSSWG0_Z4AI8NOMOSM3IFH,Iran summons Australian ambassador over post that ‘promoted homosexuality’,"By Angus Watson, CNN","2 minute read Published 12:56 AM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/04/australia/iran-summons-ambassador-over-social-post-intl-hnk/,"A series of smiling Instagram photos of diplomats wearing purple and enjoying cupcakes has caused a spat between Iran and Australia, with the Australian ambassador summoned to explain the “disrespectful” behavior.
The Australian Embassy in Tehran posted photos on Monday to mark Wear It Purple Day, an annual celebration of LGBTQIA+ youth founded in Australia.
“Today, and every day, we’re dedicated to creating a supportive environment, where everyone, especially LGBTQIA+ youth, can feel proud to be themselves,” the caption read.
The post drew swift condemnation from Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which deemed it “disrespectful and contrary to Iranian and Islamic cultural norms,” according to state news agency IRNA.
Homosexuality is illegal in Iran, which considers same-sex relations a breach of Islamic values, punishable under the country’s Sharia-based law.
“The official Instagram page of the Australian Embassy in Tehran has promoted homosexuality in a derogatory post,” IRNA reported.
Australian ambassador Ian McConville responded by saying the embassy “had no intention of offending the Iranian people,” according to IRNA.
The bi-lingual post on the official Australia In Iran Instagram account has drawn thousands of likes and comments, including from the German Embassy Tehran which responded with three purple heart emojis.
Asked about the diplomatic spat in an interview with Australia’s national broadcaster, the ABC, government minister Murray Watt said he was “concerned” about Iran’s reaction to a message he said was in keeping with his own country’s values.
“We support all Australians, regardless of their sexual orientation, their gender, their race, and I am concerned to see this reaction from the Iranian government to the activities of the Australian embassy,” Watt told the ABC.
“We’re very proud about the fact that our embassies promote Australian values internationally and I’m very concerned to see an overseas government seemingly take action against an Australian embassy that is upholding Australian values,” he said.
According to Amesty International, LGBTQIA+ people suffer “systemic discrimination and violence in Iran,” where the punishment for consensual same-sex relations ranges from flogging to the death penalty.
Iranian authorities have sentenced rights advocates to death over posts on social media.
In 2021 prominent Iranian LGBTQIA+ campaigners Zahra Sedighi-Hamadani and Elham Chobdar were arrested and later sentenced to death for alleged crimes including “corruption on earth” and “promoting homosexuality” over social media, according to the US government and Amnesty International.
Both advocates were released on bail in 2023, and Sedighi-Hamadani fled Iran for an “undisclosed country” the next year. Chobdar was re-arrested in 2024 and remains in detention, according to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom."
0YRCZZUAYC_J9CC03MZZNWJLB9,Maduro decrees Christmas will start in October as Venezuela cracks down on dissent,"By Stefano Pozzebon, CNN","3 minute read Updated 1:17 AM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/03/americas/christmas-venezuela-october-maduro-intl-latam/,"Christmas will start next month in Venezuela, authoritarian leader Nicolas Maduro has decreed – even as thousands of Venezuelans look set to pass the holidays behind bars amid his government’s crackdown on political unrest.
“September smells like Christmas!” Maduro said in his weekly television show on Monday, to the apparent delight of his audience.
“This year and to honor you all, to thank you all, I am going to decree the beginning of Christmas on October 1. Christmas arrived for everyone, in peace, joy and security!” he said.
Maduro’s decree – not the first of its kind, but the earliest – comes as Venezuela grapples with the fallout from July’s presidential election, which saw Maduro claim a third term despite global skepticism and outcry from the country’s opposition movement.
Just a few hours before Maduro’s announcement, Venezuelan authorities published an arrest warrant for his main rival, opposition leader Edmundo Gonzalez, accusing him of “crimes associated with terrorism.” Gonzalez has failed to respond to three summons regarding an investigation into an opposition website that posted results from the contested vote, the Venezuela Prosecutor’s Office said.
Maduro has been under pressure at home and abroad since claiming victory. The opposition coalition backing Gonzalez insists the presidential vote was stolen, publishing online vote tally sheets, which experts say indicate Maduro actually lost the presidency by a significant margin.
The US and other neighboring governments have demanded that Venezuelan authorities reveal granular voting data to verify the outcome. US authorities this week also announced that a Venezuelan plane used by Maduro for international travel was seized in the Dominican Republic.
A second plane linked to Maduro is under 24-hour surveillance by authorities in the Dominican Republic, a source with knowledge of the matter told CNN.
Protests over the vote in the streets of Venezuela have been fiercely repressed. Some 2,400 people have been arrested, and many others are now fleeing the country. Some are hiding in their homes, telling CNN they are afraid to step foot outside due to intimidation by government supporters.
The crackdown is the deadliest in years, according to a new analysis by Human Rights Watch, which says it has documented 11 killings that it says took place in the context of mass political protests over the July 28 vote.
“On average, [this year] is much more intense in terms of the amount of people that have died in the context of post-electoral violence and protest,” HRW Director for the Americas Juanita Goebertus told CNN.
Non-governmental organizations have reported 24 people killed.

“In terms of detention, more than 2400 [people arrested], that is way above the data we saw in 2014 and 2017,” Goebertus added, referring to previous cycles of protests in Venezuela that were also repressed in violence.
Maduro, despite his jollity on Monday, has been at the forefront of the crackdown, ordering the opening of two new prisons to accommodate detained protesters and openly calling for everyone in the streets to be imprisoned.
He has also endorsed what is informally referred to as “Operation Knock-Knock” – a play on the name of a popular Venezuelan Christmas song, repurposed to evoke the sound of government security services knocking on critics’ doors.
“Knock Knock! Don’t be a crybaby … You’re going to Tocorón (a jail)” Maduro shouted at a rally last month.
This is not the first time Maduro has extended the official national period of Christmas celebration, which in Venezuela often comes with extra bonuses for public employees and more lavish gifts in government handouts.
Last year, Maduro ordered Christmas to start on November 1, later expressing regret that he didn’t start it earlier. In 2021, with the country reeling from the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns, Maduro decreed that Christmas would start on October 4 as a tactic to boost the economy.
The Venezuelan Episcopal Conference on Tuesday protested the unilateral acceleration of Christmas, warning that the holiday “is not to be used for political or propaganda goals.”
“Christmas commences on December 25,” it said in a statement."

“I’ve just been told there are going to be more films and Gandalf will be involved and they hope that I’ll be playing him,” the actor, 85, told Big Issue magazine. “When? I don’t know. What the script is? It’s not written yet. So they better be quick!”
McKellen fell in June during a performance of “Player Kings,” a new version of Shakespeare’s “Henry IV,” in London.
He told the publication he wonders if the fall happened because he is elderly.
“I’m just trying to convince myself it was an accident,” McKellen said.
“I’m left feeling weak physically, which I’m doing exercises for,” he added. “And, of course, it’s emotional. We all trip all our lives, it’s just when you get to my age you can’t always get up again.”
The legendary actor has appeared in multiple “Lord of the Rings” films and likes being busy.
“I’m usually working or preparing to work, I’ve been doing a little bit of that, wondering what might be the best plan,” he said. “I’m going to take the rest of the year off. Not because I need to, just because I want to.”"

A federal judge in Manhattan denied his initial request to move the case to the Southern District of New York on Tuesday. Trump’s attorneys filed a notice of appeal of that decision soon after.
Trump’s legal team filed the petition last week to move the state case to federal court in the wake of the Supreme Court’s presidential immunity decision. They also asked the federal judge to postpone Trump’s sentencing, currently set for September 18.
Last week, Trump’s attorneys asked Judge Juan Merchan to refrain from issuing a decision over presidential immunity to allow the process in federal court to play out. Merchan had previously said he’d rule on that motion September 16.
In a letter filed with the state court on Wednesday, the Manhattan district attorney’s office said Trump now has no basis for his request to pause the state proceedings because of that federal ruling.
“Because there is no pending notice of removal with the federal court, there is no basis for the relief sought in defendant’s August 29 letter-motion,” the letter says.
The letter does not reference Trump’s notice of appeal.
Merchan still has not ruled on Trump’s separate request to delay the sentencing until after the election.
The judge could issue a decision as soon as this week.

The NUP said in a post on social media that Wine was shot in the leg in an attempt on his life, just outside the capital Kampala. Local police said however that the injury was caused when the popstar-turned-politician “stumbled while getting into a vehicle.”
Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, was the main opposition frontrunner in the presidential elections in January 2021 and lost to President Yoweri Museveni. Museveni claimed at the time that he had been re-elected for a sixth term despite widespread allegations of fraud and intimidation.
The NUP said in a post on ‘X’ that Wine was in Bulindo to meet a lawyer when “the police and military … surrounded our vehicles and started firing live bullets, teargas canisters and other projectiles.”
According to the NUP, Wine “was clearly targeted” and shot in the leg.
“Security operatives have made an attempt on the life of President Bobi Wine,” the NUP claimed on ‘X’.

Images posted on his own ‘X’ account show Wine bleeding and lying in a hospital bed, with a bleeding injury on his shin. A statement on his account said he is being treated by doctors after the shooting.
Local police told CNN in a statement that they intervened after Wine’s group blocked the road without permission. Despite being warned not to organize an event in the road, Wine “insisted on proceeding and closing the road, leading to police intervention to prevent the procession,” the police statement said.
“During the ensuing altercation, it is alleged that he sustained injuries. Police officers on site claim he stumbled while getting into his vehicle, causing the injury, whereas Hon. Kyagulanyi and his team assert that he was shot,” the police statement said, adding that an investigation is being conducted.
Wine has faced multiple arrests by Ugandan security forces over the years, particularly in the lead-up to Uganda’s controversial elections. He told CNN in a 2021 interview that he felt his life was in danger."
14RQN49ZT9_LYST8WRQAX9SCL3,Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson reflects on ‘groundbreaking’ path to the Supreme Court in new memoir,"By John Fritze and Lauren del Valle, CNN","7 minute read Updated 7:07 AM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240903,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/03/politics/ketanji-brown-jackson-new-memoir/,"Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson is using a new memoir published Tuesday to reflect on a personal journey that has already earned her a place in history.
Jackson recalls sinking into her chair when she was an appeals court judge – her blood “a roaring ocean in my ears” – when President Joe Biden called in early 2022 to say he would nominate her to the high court, setting her on a path to become the first Black woman to serve as a Supreme Court justice.
“From my perspective, my arrival at the pinnacle of the legal profession was indeed groundbreaking, the culmination of a life spent toiling in relative obscurity, marked by my being suddenly thrust into the white-hot spotlight of national prominence,” Jackson writes in her book, “Lovely One.”
She added, “For many, my seat at the table represents the realization of our country’s highest ideals in a land that promises opportunity and equality to all.”
Jackson, who turns 54 this month, joined the Supreme Court two years ago and is already establishing herself as a thoughtful questioner, a prolific opinion writer and a reliable vote for the court’s liberal wing.  Biden’s first and only nominee, Jackson succeeded Justice Stephen Breyer, for whom she once clerked.
In the coming days, Jackson will travel across the country to promote the memoir, speaking to sold-out theaters as well as public libraries. This week, she’ll speak in New York, Washington, DC, Atlanta and Miami.
Her memoir doesn’t delve deeply into the law or behind-the-scenes workings of the Supreme Court. Instead, she tells the story of a modern family – and, specifically, a modern mother – juggling a demanding career alongside a young family, including a daughter diagnosed at 11 with mild autism spectrum disorder.
Jackson details impossible commutes and childcare stresses, parent-teacher conferences that don’t go as planned and stolen naps in Safeway parking lots borne of exhaustion.
But she also focuses on the triumphs at home and at work, including her relationship with her husband, Dr. Patrick Jackson, a prominent surgeon; a diagnosis that helped her eldest daughter thrive; and a nomination to a US District Court judgeship during the Obama administration.
The book’s title is a reference to Jackson’s name. Chosen by her parents from a list provided by an influential aunt, “Ketanji Onyika,” they were told, meant “Lovely One” in an African dialect.
“As I grew older, the sound of my name would often remind me of my aunt,” Jackson writes. “And when people would tell me that my name was unique, creative, and beautiful, I would think of it as a tribute to the woman who had gifted it to me.”
The book offers a personal and relatable narrative of a prominent justice at a time when the high court as an institution is under considerable scrutiny for a series of ethics scandals and politically charged rulings on abortion, guns and presidential immunity.
Speaking at the famed Apollo Theater in Harlem on Tuesday night to promote the book, Jackson acknowledged that the court shouldn’t be exempt from public criticism – though she didn’t embrace any specific ideas for how to address its slipping support.
“The court is an institution that doesn’t have any other mechanism of enforcement than public trust. And so it’s particularly significant when there is a deficit of trust,” Jackson said. “This sort of how our system works – the judges, in my view, are not beyond criticism or constraint. We are a government branch. We are government servants and officials. And so in a democracy, the people decide the form and the structure of government. And so in order to decide that people have to be engaged, they have to debate these issues. And that’s what we see happening now.”
Expanding on those remarks during an appearance on CBS’ “The Late Show” Tuesday, Jackson acknowledged that public perception of the high court is “problematic.”
“I’m aware that that is the public perception, and I think it’s problematic for the court that that’s a perception that the public has, because we really rely on public trust in order to do our jobs,” Jackson said. “It’s a concern.”
Jackson on Tuesday night recalled some of the preparation she underwent for her confirmation in 2022, which at times grew testy as Republicans attempted to get her to define her judicial philosophy and explain some of her sentencing decisions as a federal trial court judge. In one-on-one interactions, the senators were “lovely,” she said, which helped her cope with the sometimes-brutal moments of her confirmation hearing.
“It was also super helpful in the hearing because we had had a conversation, so I said, ‘Oh, I see. You’re not really talking to me, right?’” she said. “’You must be talking to your constituents or to someone else.’”
She recalled some of the best advice she received from White House advisors during her preparation for the confirmation battle that helped her maintain her composure.
“You can get angry, or you can be a Supreme Court justice,” she said she was counseled.
Born in Washington, DC, in 1970, Jackson in her memoir pins her good fortune, at least in part, on timing. She came of age at the dawn of the post-Civil Rights era, with a family that impressed upon her the significance of the moment for African Americans. Jackson not only capitalized on that opportunity but was fixated on meeting the challenges put before her.
“I had understood from the outset that my learning curve as a district court judge would be the steepest I had ever encountered,” she writes about taking her seat on the federal bench in 2013. “I intended to be unimpeachable as I climbed.”
At least some of the landmark anti-discrimination laws that Jackson cites in her book, including the Voting Rights Act of 1965, are now being challenged at the Supreme Court. During Jackson’s first term on the court, a majority of her colleagues barred consideration of race to ensure diversity on college campuses. Jackson dissented in one of those cases and recused herself in another, involving Harvard College, because she had previously served on the school’s board of overseers.
The memoir is being published by Random House weeks before the Supreme Court begins a new term in October that will feature cases dealing with transgender rights, ghost guns and the federal regulation of e-cigarettes. Jackson reported receiving nearly $894,000 from Random House last year, though that is likely only the first of multiple payments.
While justices often publish memoirs after serving for at least several years on the court, Jackson’s went on sale just more than two years after she was seated – far faster than any of her colleagues’ recent books. Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett have also announced book deals and Justice Neil Gorsuch published a book of his own earlier this summer.
Though she briefly touches on general legal controversies – such as those dealing with criminal sentencing – Jackson avoids mentioning cases before the court. At one point, she appears to question the way some of her colleagues are focusing on history in their rulings.
“Whose history,” she asks, is being considered in those analyses?
“It is true that not everyone was represented at the table when our country was being birthed, or when our vaunted Constitution was being hammered out,” she writes. “Yet the principles of liberty and equality that the framers adopted and that are now enshrined as the bedrock of our society mean that, today, every citizen can enter those rooms, protected by laws that recognize the civil liberties and human rights of all Americans.”
Jackson writes at length about her older daughter, Talia, who is academically gifted but who sometimes struggled with social interactions and transitions at school. After years of navigating what Jackson describes as “outright trauma,” her daughter was diagnosed with autism.
“There is no use in pretending that we weren’t completely devastated by the long-overdue confirmation of what I had suspected all along: that our older child was on the autism spectrum,” Jackson writes. At the same time, Jackson described the news as something of a relief.
“We could end our denial,” she writes.
“As Talia learned to advocate for herself through the years, she would educate us about how she was not ‘a person with autism’ but, rather, was autistic – by which she meant that her autism was an identity as much as her being Black and female,” Jackson writes. “Autism was another lens through which she engaged the world, with full awareness of her strengths and mindful of her trials.”
In thinking about her place in history, Jackson writes that the framers of the Constitution probably couldn’t have foreseen her story – her struggle and, ultimately, her successes.
“I highly doubt that any of them could have envisioned me, the descendant of enslaved Africans, the offspring of parents raised in the Jim Crow era, and a post–civil rights daughter, donning a borrowed robe to take her oath of judicial office and join the ranks of that esteemed branch of government,” Jackson writes. “But that is the very genius of the framers’ foundational guarantee of liberty and justice for all.”

188NSA54ON_T5XRI47BQ4XACMM,DOJ alleges Russia funded US media company linked to right-wing social media stars,"By Zachary Cohen, Donie O'Sullivan, Evan Perez, Sean Lyngaas and Majlie de Puy Kamp, CNN","6 minute read Updated 11:08 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/04/politics/doj-alleges-russia-funded-company-linked-social-media-stars/,"The unnamed Tennessee-based company that the Justice Department alleges was being funded by Russian operatives working as part of a Kremlin-orchestrated influence operation targeting the 2024 US election is Tenet Media, which is linked to right-wing commentators with millions of subscribers on YouTube and other social media platforms, according to a US official briefed on the matter.
The indictment unsealed in New York’s Southern District accused two employees of RT, the Kremlin’s media arm, of funneling nearly $10 million to an unidentified company, described only as “Company 1” in court documents.
CNN has independently confirmed that “Company 1” is Tenet Media, which is a platform for independent content creators. It is self-described as a “network of heterodox commentators that focus on Western political and cultural issues,” according to its website, which matches language contained in the newly unsealed indictment.
The alleged Russian operation tapped two people to set up the company in their names to add to its legitimacy and the two founders were aware Russian money backed the operation, according to the indictment.
The goal of the operation, according to prosecutors, was to fuel pro-Russian narratives, in part, by pushing content and news articles favoring Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and others who the Kremlin deemed to be friendlier to its interests.
Among the commentators listed on Tenet Media’s website are right-wing personalities Benny Johnson, Tim Pool and Dave Rubin. All have released statements saying they were victims of the alleged Russian scheme and they maintained editorial control of the content they created.
Each has a loyal fanbase online, with a combined roughly 6 million followers on YouTube alone. Pool interviewed Trump on his podcast in May.
Wednesday’s indictment outlined how the American social media stars were hired by Tenet Media. Some of the creators were told the project was being bankrolled by a man named Eduard Grigoriann. “In truth and fact,” the indictment reads, “Grigoriann was a fictional persona.”
The indictment outlines how one of the social media stars was approached by Tenet Media’s founder with an offer of $2 million a year to make videos for the company. One of the founders later wrote, “It would need to be closer to 5 million yearly for him to be interested,” according to the indictment.
The social media star expressed some skepticism about who was funding the deal and asked for more information about Grigoriann.
Eventually the social media star agreed on a contract of a $400,000 monthly fee to create “four weekly videos,” along with a $100,000 signing bonus.
Tenet Media’s US-based founders are not named in the indictment, but business records filed in Tennessee reveal two people connected to the company: Lauren Chen and Liam Donovan. A Twitter account for Donovan identifies him as the president of Tenet Media and his Instagram account describes Donovan as Chen’s husband.
A private message between the two in May 2021 read, “So we’re billing the Russians from the corporation, right?” Two weeks later, another message said, “Also, the Russians paid. So we’re good to bill them for the next month I guess,” the legal filing details.
Chen, is a rightwing online influencer in her own right. She has appeared in some of Tenet Media’s videos and has more than 500,000 subscribers on YouTube.
The Russian state-controlled media RT lists Chen as a contributor for several articles in 2021 and 2022. She is also linked to the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA. As of Thursday afternoon Turning Point US had deleted webpages featuring Chen.
A YouTube video referenced in the indictment further describes Tenet Media as “a project of Lauren Chen and her husband Liam.”
Blaze Media on Thursday said it had fired Chen.
BlazeTV, a subset of the Glenn Beck-founded conservative outlet, has since taken down a page that previously promoted content Chen produced for the outlet, including her show “Pseudo-Intellectual.”
“Lauren Chen was an independent contractor, whose contract has been terminated,” Tyler Cardon, the chief executive of Blaze Media, said in a statement to CNN. The news was first reported by Semafor.
YouTube has removed Tenet Media’s channel and others associated with Chen, a YouTube spokesperson said in a statement Thursday.
“Following an indictment from the US Department of Justice and after careful review, we are terminating the Tenet Media channel and four channels operated by its owner Lauren Chen as part of our ongoing efforts to combat coordinated influence operations,” the statement said.
The company’s investigation into the matter is ongoing, according to YouTube.
Neither Chen nor Donovan responded to CNN’s request for comment.
Others ensnared in the alleged Russian plot, however, insist they are the victims.
“We are disturbed by the allegations in today’s indictment, which make clear that myself and other influencers were victims in this alleged scheme,” Johnson wrote in a post on X after the indictment was unsealed on Wednesday.
“Should these allegations prove true, I as well as the other personalities and commentators were deceived and are victims,” Pool said on X. “The show is produced in its entirety by our local team without input from anyone external to the company,” he added.
In a statement also posted to X, Rubin wrote, “These allegations clearly show that I and other commentators were the victims of this scheme. I knew absolutely nothing about any of this fraudulent activity. Period.”
Adding, “The DoJ has never contacted me regarding this matter and I have no intention to comment further.”
The DOJ’s revealing of the alleged Russian plot was part of a wider set of actions the Biden administration announced Wednesday it was taking to tackle a major Russian government-backed effort to influence the 2024 US presidential election including sanctions on 10 individuals and entities, and the seizure of 32 internet domains.
At Russian President Vladimir Putin’s direction, three Russian companies used fake profiles to promote false narratives on social media, US Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said in a statement. Internal documents produced by one of those Russian companies show one of the goals of the propaganda effort was to boost the candidacy of Trump or whoever emerged as the Republican nominee for president, according to an FBI affidavit.
Taken together with the indictment of the RT employees, the actions represent the Biden administration’s most significant public response yet to alleged Russian influence operations targeting American voters. After the US accused Iran of trying to hack both the Trump and Biden-Harris campaigns last month, Wednesday’s actions are a reminder that US officials continue to see Russia as a prominent foreign influence threat to November’s election, sources familiar with the matter told CNN ahead of the announcements.

District Judge Mark Scarsi accepted the guilty plea after a dramatic and convoluted all-day hearing in Los Angeles that began with the routine jury selection process.
The judge, who is a Trump appointee, set a sentencing date for December 16. President Joe Biden’s son could now face up to 17 years in prison for his crimes, which include tax evasion, filing fraudulent tax returns and failing to pay taxes. The judge also said he could also impose a hefty fine, perhaps as much as $1.3 million.
But looming over the proceedings – as well as Hunter Biden’s convictions in a separate gun trial in June – is the possibility of a presidential pardon, or a commutation of sentence. President Joe Biden has repeatedly ruled this out, and a White House spokesperson reiterated that position on Thursday.
The guilty plea was a unilateral move by Hunter Biden, and was called an “open plea” because it was done without a pre-arranged leniency deal with prosecutors. Leo Wise, the hard-nosed prosecutor who led the case, told the judge, “We were as shocked as everyone else in the courtroom this morning” when Biden’s team tried to change his not guilty plea.
After the hearing, Biden’s lawyer Abbe Lowell told reporters that the president’s son “put his family first today, and it was a grave and loving thing to do,” instead of subjecting them to another public trial about his addiction and family dysfunction.
“After watching prosecutors who exploit his family’s grief during the Delaware trial and realizing they were planning to do it again in California, Hunter decided to enter his plea to protect those he loves from unnecessary hurt and cruel humiliation,” Lowell said. “This plea prevents that kind of show trial that would have not provided all the facts or served any real point in justice.”
This is a victory of sorts for special counsel David Weiss, who is the Trump-appointed US attorney for Delaware, and also successfully prosecuted the gun case. In a Thursday night statement, his team touted that Hunter Biden was “convicted” of the tax crimes – but this outcome means they didn’t get to put on the trial that they’ve been working on since 2018, when they started the investigation.
About 120 prospective jurors waited in a sequestered assembly room throughout the day, while prosecutors and Biden’s lawyers haggled in court over how to move forward.
When the proceedings kicked off Thursday morning, Lowell stunned the courtroom by saying Biden wanted to enter an “Alford plea,” where he would maintain his innocence but acknowledge that prosecutors had enough evidence to convict. Under this maneuver, Biden would have skipped a trial and accepted the judge’s punishment at sentencing.
But Biden’s team backed away from that plan after prosecutors raised forceful objections, and the judge said he’d want to study the matter and reconvene Friday morning.
“I want to make something crystal clear – the United States opposes an Alford plea,” Wise said. He added, “Hunter Biden is not innocent. Hunter Biden is guilty. He is not permitted to plead guilty on special terms.”
After a break in the proceedings, Lowell said Biden was willing to move forward with an “open plea,” to unilaterally plead guilty to the offenses, because “enough is enough.”
Lowell said Biden was willing to proceed with the open plea because the special counsel was trying to “exact a pound of flesh” and a “drop of blood.” Pushing back, Wise said Biden was to blame for the situation.
“We’re not here because of what the government did. … He’s the one that triggered this set of events,” Wise said, calling it “offensive” for Lowell to paint Biden as a “victim” of this prosecution.
During the standard questioning as part of every federal plea, Biden said under oath that nobody made him any promises to convince him to plead guilty. The president’s son also testified that nobody pressured him in any way to plead guilty.
“Do you agree that you committed every element of every crime?” Scarsi asked.
“Yes,” Biden responded.
Prosecutors also read the full 56-page indictment during the plea proceeding, which took nearly 90 minutes, and delved into the salacious details of Biden’s extravagant spending on strippers, escorts, luxury cars and fancy hotels, while not paying his taxes.
Biden’s wife Melissa Cohen left the courtroom soon after the reading began, which meant she missed the most explicit and embarrassing details in the indictment.
A tax trial would’ve have been Biden’s second criminal trial this year, after he was convicted in June on three federal gun charges in Wilmington, Delaware. That sentencing is scheduled for November 13, and he could face as many as 25 years in prison for those offenses.
The tax indictment alleged that Biden failed to pay $1.4 million in federal taxes and evaded taxes by filing tax returns with fraudulent business deductions.
The president’s son eventually paid roughly $2 million in back taxes and penalties after learning of the investigation and getting sober, following a yearslong struggle with drug addiction and alcoholism.
In the weeks before the trial, the judge blocked Biden’s lawyers from telling jurors about the belated tax payment, or about the potential origins of his addiction – dealing a major blow to his defense strategy.
The special counsel himself, Weiss, was sitting front row in the courtroom benches during the hearing, most of the time leaned over his knees and calmly tapping his feet as prosecutors laid bare the culmination of his six-year investigation into Biden’s finances and foreign deals.
Biden’s facial expression was stoic for the majority of the hearing. Just before the judge sat the courtroom after an initial recess, Biden stared blankly ahead of him for several moments. While Wise recited the indictment, Biden followed along closely with his own annotated copy.
Biden’s former business partner Tony Bobulinski attended the hearing, sitting with the public and press in the courtroom. A sharp critic of the Biden family, he testified in the House Republicans impeachment inquiry that also scrutinized many of the same foreign deals that were part of the tax case. Claims from Bobulinski and GOP lawmakers that Joe Biden was intimately involved in Biden’s lucrative foreign business deals, have not been proven.
Lowell’s leading role in the plea hearing was notable. He was the lead defense attorney for Biden’s Delaware gun case, but he was absent from a key pretrial hearing two weeks ago in the California tax case. Instead, celebrity attorney Mark Geragos, who was retained earlier this summer, took the lead at that hearing. Lowell did all the speaking for Biden on Thursday.
Asked by CNN after the hearing if there have been any contacts with President Joe Biden about a pardon, Geragos said, “The question you should be asking is, are you disappointed that you don’t get to try the case?”
The convoluted and drawn-out plea proceedings Thursday in Los Angeles were reminiscent of a similar hearing last summer in Delaware, where the same parties attempted to get a judge’s approval for a plea agreement that would’ve resolved the tax and gun cases in one fell swoop. That agreement stunningly unraveled in open court, with the parties disagreeing on its terms, and the judge eventually withholding her support over constitutional concerns.
”I’ve been through one of these plea hearings before,” Wise quipped, drawing a laugh from the judge as they all tried to figure out the way forward.
“Deja vu,” Scarsi replied.

1INNYG4PO4_67E1TACDEIHJU18,Liz Cheney says she is voting for Harris for president,"By Jamie Gangel, Rashard Rose and Piper Hudspeth Blackburn, CNN","2 minute read Updated 10:27 PM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/04/politics/liz-cheney-voting-kamala-harris/,"Republican former Rep. Liz Cheney will vote for Vice President Kamala Harris in November, she said during remarks at Duke University, according to audio obtained by CNN.
The former Wyoming congresswoman noted the importance of voting for Harris in states like North Carolina, where she appeared on Wednesday.
“I think it is crucially important for people to recognize, not only is what I just said about the danger that Trump poses something that should prevent people from voting for him, but I don’t believe that we have the luxury of writing in candidates’ names, particularly in swing states,” Cheney said.
She made the announcement in North Carolina specifically because it is a battleground state, according to a source close to Cheney.
“And as a conservative, as someone who believes in and cares about the Constitution, I have thought deeply about this, and because of the danger that Donald Trump poses, not only am I not voting for Donald Trump, but I will be voting for Kamala Harris,” she continued.
The Harris campaign highlighted Cheney’s endorsement Wednesday night and pointed to other Republicans who have backed her, including former Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger and former Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan.
“The Vice President is proud to have earned Congresswoman Cheney’s vote. She is a patriot who loves this country and puts our democracy and our Constitution first,” campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon said in a statement.

Cheney, who is the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney and a vocal critic of Trump, previously told CNN she is committed to doing what’s necessary to stop the former president from returning to the White House.
Cheney’s outspokenness against Trump and his efforts to overturn the 2020 election — including her vote to impeach him — eventually cost her her post in House Republican leadership. The House GOP ousted her as conference chair, replacing her with a top Trump defender, several months after the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.
She went on to serve as vice chair of the House select committee that investigated the insurrection, ultimately losing her seat in Congress in a 2022 primary to a Trump-backed challenger.
Cheney tried to counteract Trump’s influence in the 2022 midterms by opposing candidates who repeated his falsehoods about the 2020 election being stolen. The political action committee she started placed an ad buy urging Arizona voters to reject GOP gubernatorial nominee Kari Lake and Republican Secretary of State nominee Mark Finchem. She also crossed party lines to stump for two moderate Democrats in competitive House races that year.

1KD5KCDPAW_U5HOFPAZKZ17VDO,Tim Walz’s brother stands by criticism of his policies but says Facebook ‘wasn’t the right platform’ to express views,"By Aaron Pellish, CNN","4 minute read Published 3:37 PM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/04/politics/jeff-walz-criticism-brother-policies/,"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s brother said Tuesday that he doesn’t agree with the Democrat’s policies but expressed some remorse for inserting himself into the spotlight after he posted on social media last week he is “100% opposed” to his brother’s political views and was considering officially endorsing former President Donald Trump.
Jeff Walz, the older brother of Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate, told NewsNation in an interview that he didn’t intend to “influence the general public” with social media posts that indicated his support for Trump over Harris’ and his brother’s campaign and said he has no plans to be campaigning “for him or against him” ahead of November’s election.
The Harris-Walz campaign declined to comment.
Jeff Walz’s comments come after he wrote on Facebook that he hasn’t spoken to his brother in eight years but is “100% opposed to all his ideology.”
In another comment on Friday, he responded to someone suggesting he “get on stage” with Trump and offer his official endorsement by saying he’s weighing his family’s privacy against his desire to keep his brother out of higher public office, indicating he knows “stories” about Gov. Walz that would reflect poorly on him.
“I’ve thought hard about doing something like that!” he wrote in response to the idea of formally endorsing Trump. “I’m torn between that and just keeping my family out of it. The stories I could tell. Not the type of character you want making decisions about your future.”
Jeff Walz said he regrets sharing his views on Facebook, and explained he made the posts to clarify his views to people in his life who thought he was aligned with Tim Walz politically.
“It was a post that – that I made because I was getting a lot of feedback from my friends, old acquaintances, thinking that I was feeling the same way that my brother did on the issues, and I was trying to clarify that just to friends,” he told NewsNation. “I used Facebook, which wasn’t the right platform to do that for.”
Jeff Walz lamented the distance between him and his brother, saying “it’s too bad” they’ve grown apart and expressing hope for the possibility they can “disagree and still be civil brothers.” He added that any “stories” he had to share about Tim Walz wouldn’t reveal anything “hidden” about him.
“My little brother, when we were younger, we would go on family trips and in a station wagon. And the thing was, nobody wanted to sit with him, because he had car sickness and would always throw up on us,” he said. “That sort of thing. There’s really nothing else hidden behind there. People are assuming something else.”
Jeff Walz declined to share with NewsNation who he would be voting for in November. But he has a history of supporting Trump dating back to 2016.
The Facebook comments he posted on Friday occurred underneath a post he originally wrote on March 30, 2023, the same day Trump was indicted by a grand jury in New York as part of the investigation into hush money payments made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election. Trump was eventually found guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records.
“We’ve just become a third world banana republic,” he wrote that day.
He previously donated $20 to Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, federal campaign finance records show. And on the day after Election Day in 2022, he appeared to react to stronger than expected performances by Democrats in races across the country except in his home state of Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis won reelection by 19 points.
“Sure glad to live in Florida today!,” he wrote at the time.
Jeff Walz is one of three of Tim Walz’s siblings. They have a sister, Sandy, who lives in Nebraska, and a brother, Craig, who died in 2016.
His brother’s apparent opposition to his campaign puts Tim Walz in company with Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who have both seen family members criticize their presidential bids. Trump has faced continued attacks from his niece, Mary Trump, and his nephew, Fred Trump, who have both published books about their uncle. Kennedy’s siblings condemned his campaign at various points over the past year, including after he dropped out of the race in August and endorsed Trump."
1MBAFXLSNY_VWG9F9J7M4K5RTH,"US official lays out new details on Gaza ceasefire talks, says Netanyahu comments on Philadelphi Corridor not constructive","By Kevin Liptak, Alex Marquardt and Jennifer Hansler, CNN","5 minute read Updated 7:18 AM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/04/politics/gaza-ceasefire-talks-netanyahu-philadelphi-corridor/,"A prospective hostage and ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas is 90% completed, but disputes remain over the exchange of prisoners for hostages and the redeployment of Israeli forces in Gaza, according to a senior US administration official and others familiar with the matter.
American officials, with Qatar and Egypt, have for months worked to broker a deal to bring an end to the nearly year-long conflict. Those negotiations have taken on new urgency following the killings of six hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, and American officials have said they are preparing to present a “final” offer to the parties soon.
It’s not the first time over the past several months that US negotiators have described the talks as entering their end stage, only for hopes to be dashed. That’s a reality US officials have acknowledged in recent days.
The painstaking negotiations have prompted the families of the remaining Americans held by Hamas to press the White House to explore a separate agreement with Hamas that would secure the release of their relatives. So far, US officials have said they are focused only on the larger deal.
A senior Biden administration on Wednesday offered one of the most detailed looks yet at key elements of the negotiations, which spokespeople for the US government said they would not negotiate in public. The official offered the previously unreported details after repeated public statements by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu casting doubt on his potential willingness to accept a deal, despite claims by the US that he had agreed to a “bridging proposal.”
The agreement itself makes no mention of the length of the Egypt-Gaza border known as the Philadelphi Corridor, the official told reporters on a call on Wednesday. Netanyahu has held two news conferences this week to argue that maintaining permanent control of the corridor is vital to Israeli security.
“The first war goal was to destroy Hamas’ military and governing capabilities. The second was to free our hostages, and the third was to ensure that Gaza never again poses a threat to Israel. And all three of those goals – all three of them – go through Israel’s control of the Philadelphi corridor,” Netanyahu said Wednesday at a news conference for foreign press.
That emphasis on Philadelphi in Netanyahu’s recent public statements hasn’t been constructive, the official said.
“In my view, the less that’s said about particular issues, the better,” the official said, adding: “Staking out concrete positions in the middle of a negotiation isn’t always particularly helpful.”
In the agreement being discussed for the first phase of a deal, Israel Defense Forces are supposed to withdraw from “densely populated areas,” the official said. Israel argues that the border isn’t one and is vital to preventing weapons smuggling into Gaza.
In the second phase, the IDF is supposed to withdraw entirely from Gaza.
The official said Hamas’s recent killing of six hostages had “colored” the ongoing negotiations and thrown into question Hamas’s willingness to reach a deal.
Hamas said this week that militants guarding Israeli hostages in the buildings and tunnels of Gaza had “new instructions” to kill them if Israeli troops closed in.
Still, the talks remain ongoing on finalizing the 18-paragraph proposal that American officials believe is the best chance of securing the hostages’ release.
Of the 18 paragraphs, all but four are finished and agreed to, the official said.
“We still see this deal, this very complex but necessary arrangement, as really the most viable, perhaps the only viable, option for saving the lives of the hostages, stopping the war, bringing immediate release to Gazans, and also making sure we fully account for Israel’s security,” the official said.
It’s essentially down to the prisoner exchange and the deployment of Israeli forces, the official said.
The deal on the table currently includes the release in the first phase of some 800 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, including some serving life sentences, the official said. They would be released for the remaining female, elderly and wounded or sick hostages, which was believed to be around 30.
Yet Hamas has proved to be a frustrating negotiating partner of this issue, the official said.
“There was some progress on last week but is difficult and requires Hamas to engage on it. Otherwise you just can’t move forward,” the official said.
Frustrated by the progress of the talks, some families of Americans still held hostage by Hamas have asked the Biden administration to look into a deal that would go around Israel to secure their loved ones’ release. US national security adviser Jake Sullivan met with the families virtually over the weekend.
While not ruling out such a possibility, US officials have stressed this week that the broader deal is the best, and potentially only, viable option to secure the hostages’ release.
“We are working on a proposal that would release all the hostages, including the American hostages, and that is the proposal that we’ve been talking about in the region last week, and it was the same proposal that the president met with his team over the weekend to discuss. That is what we’re working on,” White House national security spokesman John Kirby said on Tuesday.
The broader deal being discussed carries a significant aid component that would be launched immediately once the first phase goes into effect.
As part of the deal, 600 aid trucks a day would be allowed into Gaza, including 50 trucks of fuel. Equipment to clear rubble, supplies to support internally displaced Gazans and provisions for rehabilitating infrastructure would also be included in the first phase of the three-phase agreement.
Although the negotiators are working to close the remaining gaps, it is unclear when the in-person negotiations will resume. The latest round wrapped up last week. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said earlier Wednesday, “We want to get this proposal developed as soon as possible and get it over to Israel and Hamas and then try to get a final agreement.”

1N1PN80DOT_T47133R0TXCSFZY,Exclusive: Ukraine army chief reveals the strategy behind Kursk incursion,"By Ivana Kottasová, Madalena Araujo and Victoria Butenko, CNN","5 minute read Published 1:00 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/05/europe/ukraine-army-chief-kursk-incursion-exclusive-intl/,"Russia had been planning to launch a new attack on Ukraine from the Kursk region before Kyiv’s surprise cross-border incursion, Ukraine’s Commander-in-Chief Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi told CNN in an exclusive interview Thursday.
In his first television interview since becoming military chief in February, the general told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour that he believed the Kursk operation had been a success.
“It reduced the threat of an enemy offensive. We prevented them from acting. We moved the fighting to the enemy’s territory so that [the enemy] could feel what we feel every day,” Syrskyi said, in a rare interview that offered a candid assessment of the war.
Last month, Ukrainian forces stormed into Kursk in a cross-border incursion that caught even American officials by surprise. It signaled that, despite Russia’s advantage in terms of men and armor, its military has vulnerabilities.
Related article Ukraine’s Zelensky says Russia incursion is part of victory plan he intends to show Biden
In what is the most detailed explanation of the rationale behind the incursion, Syrskyi outlined the key objectives of the operation: to stop Russia from using Kursk as a launchpad for a new offensive, to divert Moscow’s forces from other areas, to create a security zone and prevent cross-border shelling of civilian objects, to take prisoners of war and to boost the morale of the Ukrainian troops and the nation overall.
Speaking to Amanpour at an undisclosed location near the frontline, the general, who took over as army chief in February, said Moscow moved tens of thousands of troops to Kursk, including some of its best airborne assault troops.
And while admitting that Ukraine was under immense pressure in the area around Pokrovsk, the strategic city that has for weeks been the epicenter of war in eastern Ukraine, Syrskyi said his troops have now managed to stall the Russian advances there.
“Over the last six days the enemy hasn’t advanced a single meter in the Pokrovsk direction. In other words, our strategy is working.” he said.
“We’ve taken away their ability to maneuver and to deploy their reinforcement forces from other directions … and this weakening has definitely been felt in other areas. We note the amount of artillery shelling as well as the intensity of the offensive have decreased,” he said.
Speaking to Amanpour just after inspecting the frontlines on Thursday, Syrskyi said that there’s no doubt that Ukraine is outgunned and outmanned as it tries to defend itself against the Russian aggression.
“The enemy does have an advantage in aviation, in missiles, in artillery, in the amount of ammunition they use, of course, in personnel, tanks, infantry fighting vehicles,” he said.
But Syrskyi also said the fact that Russia has such a material advantage has forced Ukraine to become smarter and more efficient in the way it’s fighting the war.
“We cannot fight in the same way as they do, so we must use, first of all, the most effective approach, use our forces and means with maximum use of terrain features, engineering structures and also, to use technical superiority,” he said, highlighting Ukraine’s advanced drone program and other home-grown high-tech weaponry.
Syrskyi was named Ukraine’s commander in chief in February, after President Volodymyr Zelensky fired Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyi. He took over at a particularly difficult time for Ukraine.
The months-long delays in the delivery of US military assistance caused critical ammunition shortages.
At the same time, Ukraine was struggling to replenish its troops, exhausted and diminished after fighting Russia’s relentless offensive for two years.
Syrskyi said recruiting more soldiers was a priority. The Ukrainian government then passed a controversial mobilization law, requiring all men between 18 and 60 to register with Ukraine’s military and to carry their registration documents on them at all times – an effort to make the recruitment process more transparent and fair.
Seven months later, the new recruits are arriving to the frontlines. But several commanders have told CNN that not all of the new soldiers are ready to fight and are routinely abandoning their positions.
Syrskyi admitted his troops are heading to the battlefield after receiving less training than he’d like them to.
“Of course, everyone wants the level of training to be the best, so we train highly qualified professional military personnel,” he said. “At the same time, the dynamics at the front require us to put conscripted servicemen into service as soon as possible,” he added, explaining that new recruits get one month of basic military training followed by half a month to a full month of more specialized training before they are sent to fight.
Syrskyi told Amanpour that the delays in US military assistance did cause major setbacks on the battlefield and led to a slump in morale – something he admitted was still an issue.
He said he takes frequent trips to the frontlines and makes sure he spends time with his troops.
“We speak the same language … we understand each other no matter who I am talking to – whether this is an ordinary soldier, a rifleman, for example, or a brigade commander, or a battalion commander,” he said.
“I have been in this war since 2014,” he said, referring to Russia’s incursion into the Donbas 10 years ago. “In other words, the frontline is my life. We understand each other, I know all the problems that our servicemen, soldiers, and officers experience,” he added.
Syrskyi ended the candid interview by thanking Ukraine’s Western allies for their support. Switching from Ukrainian to English, he said: “Together we are stronger. Together we can win.”"

The students were waiting to enter the gate of a middle school in Tai’an city in Shandong province when the bus slammed into them after 7 a.m., state news agency Xinhua reported.
The bus, specially customized for transporting students, “lost control” when it drove into an intersection, the public security bureau in Dongping county said in a statement.
Five students and six parents were killed, it said. One of the injured was in critical condition while the others were stable, according to police.
The bus driver has been placed in police custody and the cause of the accident is being investigated, the statement said.
China has faced a spate of car-ramming and stabbing attacks targeting schoolchildren in recent years, as well as deadly road traffic accidents involving school buses.
In March, a car careened into a group of pupils in Dezhou, another city in Shandong, killing two people and leaving six others severely injured, state media reported at the time.

1NEE02YP2V_QE1SWROFNUBFCZV,‘A very serious situation’: Volkswagen could close plants in Germany for the first time in history,"By Hanna Ziady, CNN","2 minute read Updated 2:11 PM EDT, Mon September 2, 2024",20240902,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/02/investing/volkswagen-factory-closure-germany/,"Volkswagen is weighing whether to close factories in Germany for the first time in its 87-year history as it moves to deepen cost cuts amid rising competition from China’s electric vehicle makers.
In a statement Monday, the German automaker, one of the world’s biggest car companies, said that it could not rule out plant closures its home country. Other measures to “future-proof” the company include trying to terminate an employment protection agreement with labor unions, which has been in place since 1994.
“The European automotive industry is in a very demanding and serious situation,” said Volkswagen Group CEO Oliver Blume. “The economic environment became even tougher, and new competitors are entering the European market. Germany in particular as a manufacturing location is falling further behind in terms of competitiveness.
Volkswagen, which embarked on a €10 billion ($11.1 billion) cost-cutting effort late last year, is losing market share in China, its single biggest market. In the first half of the year, deliveries to customers in that country slipped 7% on the same period in 2023. Group operating profit tumbled 11.4% to €10.1 billion ($11.2 billion).
The lackluster performance in China comes as the company loses out to local EV brands, notably BYD, which also pose an increasing threat to its business in Europe.
“Our main area of action is cost cutting,” Blume told analysts on an earnings call last month, citing planned reductions to factory, supply chain and labor expenses. “We have done all the organizational steps needed. And now it is about costs, costs and costs,” he added.

Volkswagen’s cost-cutting plans will face heavy resistance from labor representatives, which hold almost half the seats on the company’s supervisory board, the body that appoints executive managers.
IG Metall, one of Germany’s most powerful unions, on Monday blamed mismanagement for the firm’s shortcomings and vowed to fight to protect jobs.
“Today, the board presented an irresponsible plan that shakes the very foundations of Volkswagen, massively threatening jobs and locations,” IG Metall lead negotiator Thorsten Groeger said in a statement.
“This approach is not only short-sighted but also highly dangerous — it risks destroying the heart of Volkswagen… We will not tolerate plans that the company makes at the expense of the workforce.”
Volkswagen employs almost 683,000 workers worldwide, including some 295,000 in Germany, according to its most recent earnings report.
Thomas Schaefer, the CEO of Volkswagen passenger cars, said the company remains committed to Germany “as a business location.” He added that VW would initiate talks with employee representatives urgently to explore possibilities for “sustainably restructuring the brand.”
“The situation is extremely tense and cannot be resolved through simple cost-cutting measures,” Volkswagen said."
1NP13BKF5O_25WMV59NOCV5FFX,Parents are not OK right now. Here’s what they can do,"Analysis by Kara Alaimo, CNN","5 minute read Updated 12:58 PM EDT, Fri September 6, 2024",20240901,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/01/health/parenting-stress-tips-surgeon-general-wellness/,"Parents and caregivers are working more hours and spending more time taking care of their children than parents did in the past — all while juggling sign-ups for extracurricular activities, playdates, school forms, doctor appointments and more.
No wonder they’re stressed. And the nation’s top doctor agrees.
US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy, a father of two, issued an advisory warning on Wednesday that the pressure that parents are under has become a public health problem. Some 41% of parents reported they can’t function most days because of stress, and 48% said they’re completely overwhelmed by stress, the advisory said, citing a 2023 American Psychological Association survey.
Parents are struggling with the high costs of childcare, education and health care, the advisory warned. They’re straining to find enough time for work, childcare and the mental load of parenting. They’re worried about school shootings and the mental health challenges many children are facing.

They’re also challenged by how to handle kids’ use of social media and their own, because parents are facing an “intensifying culture of comparison” encouraged by social media influencers showing off their supposedly perfect parenting, according to the advisory.
Things are even worse for parents with added stressors, such as those who are single, have children with special needs or have recently divorced.
And if parents are stressed, kids get stressed. Children were twice as likely to have behavioral, developmental or mental disorders and four times likelier to have poor mental health when their primary caregiver had poor mental health, according to a 2021 study.
It’s no surprise that parents’ mental health struggles can hurt our whole society by driving up health care costs and lowering economic productivity, the advisory noted.
“Simply put, caregivers need care, too,” the advisory warned.
It’s true that lot of these problems require action by lawmakers and employers, and this advisory should serve as a wake-up call to both that health care and childcare should be more affordable and accessible.
In the meantime, what can parents do? Anna Seewald, a psychologist and host of the “Authentic Parenting” podcast, told me parents can make changes to protect their physical and mental health amid all these challenges.
Related article Parents are feeling lonely. Here’s why it matters
Our society makes life incredibly hard for parents, the advisory noted, so parents could try to reevaluate their expectations of themselves.
“Parents put a lot of pressure on themselves to always be calm and patient and have well-behaved kids who do a lot of extracurricular activities,” Seewald said, but she noted doing so often isn’t realistic. “High expectations and social comparisons lead to big resentments and frustration.”
It’s better for parents to be realistic about what they can do given their circumstances.

Many parents who work with Seewald are spending loads of time on social media. Even deleting a single app can free up a substantial amount of time and energy, she said. “You don’t notice how they drain your time, but that’s a background stressor for a lot of people in a world of many stressors — and it’s one that you can control.”
Parents can also benefit from simplifying their kids’ activities. “You don’t need to go to two different birthday parties for 4-year-olds in a single weekend,” she said. “Preserving and protecting your own energy and time is more important.” If it’s something you’d enjoy, “maybe you hire a babysitter for an hour, maybe you invite a neighbor over for coffee,” she said.
One way for parents to find more time for themselves is to ask for help from the community — such as asking a kind neighbor or family member to watch their kids so they can take a break. Seewald said it’s also important for parents to think through what responsibilities —such as laundry or carpooling — they can delegate to other people.

Part of the time parents devote to themselves needs to include connecting with other people in person, Seewald said. “So many parents feel lonely and isolated. Seeing a friend helps you vent and talk about problems and get the emotional support you need, even if it’s limited and you see one person each week,” she said.
Parents can meet some self-care needs even with their kids around — and with small pockets of time, Seewald said. “If you put on music and dance with your kids and are silly for 10 minutes before you make dinner, your mood changes because of the movement,” she said. “Little interventions like that make a big difference, and they’re free.”
Related article Sleep disorders are associated with more parental stress
Spending time in nature also helps, she said. “You can go to the backyard or to a park, even if it’s for 15 minutes, even with kids, and feel the sun or watch the sunset. There’s no cost, but it regulates the nervous system and gives you a sense of awe and connects you to something bigger,” she pointed out.
Above all, Seewald recommended that parents practice self-compassion, which means “being kind and gentle with ourselves when we make mistakes, when we yell at our kids,” she said. “Feeling inadequate and shameful is a recipe for failure.”
The surgeon general has made clear that parents in the United States are not OK. While it’s on lawmakers and employers to solve many of these problems, it’s also critical for parents to practice self-care instead of waiting for the problems to be fixed. (That’s going to take awhile). Being kind and realistic with themselves, finding time to connect with friends and nature, and asking for help are all ways to help manage the mother lode of stresses parents are under.

1O27KDEUZN_NC8TY1X8XLNHL44,At least 12 dead after boat carrying migrants sinks in the English Channel,"By Emmanuel Miculita and Chris Liakos, CNN","3 minute read Updated 2:37 PM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240903,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/03/europe/english-channel-migrant-boat-deaths-intl/,"At least 12 people died, most of them women and children, when a migrant boat capsized off the coast of northern France on Tuesday, according to French authorities.
Nearly 70 people were on board the vessel, according to Boulogne-sur-Mer mayor, Frédéric Cuvillier. The exact number is unclear.
Emergency crews rescued 53 people and recovered the bodies of the dead, the maritime prefecture said. Several of those saved were in critical condition and required urgent medical care.
Three helicopters, two fishing vessels and two boats have been deployed in the search and rescue operation.
The incident is the latest in a number of tragedies on the English Channel, where small boat crossings of migrants attempting to reach Britain has soared in recent years.
“This maritime sector is one of the busiest areas in the world, with more than 600 merchant ships passing through it every day and the weather conditions are often difficult, so it is a particularly dangerous sector, even when the sea seems calm,” the prefecture said.
Most of the migrants on board appeared to be from Eritrea, the Boulogne-sur-Mer prosecutor, Guirec Le Bras, said Tuesday. He added that 10 of the 12 who died were women and some were minors.
Le Bras said it appears that the boat sank about 5 kilometers (3 miles) off the coast of Cap Gris-Nez, on the northern coast of France.
French interior minister Gerald Darmanin told reporters in Boulogne-sur-Mer on Tuesday that “less than eight people had a life jacket” on board the boat, as he pointed the finger at smugglers for the unsafe conditions.
“Obviously, it is a tragedy. As soon as a person loses their life on our territory, I would obviously like to have a compassionate thought for their families,” Darmanin added. “They were undoubtedly looking for a better world in Great Britain.”
Nearly 30,000 people reached Britain by crossing the Channel in a small boat last year, according to Home Office figures, with dinghies and other small vessels frequently being used to take large groups of people on the dangerous journey in the hope of seeking asylum in the United Kingdom.
Deadly incidents like Tuesday’s have occurred on a number of occasions during that time. Last August, six people died when a boat carrying dozens of migrants capsized.
The issue became a major political obstacle for the previous Conservative government, which was criticized by migrant rights groups for its hardline rhetoric against asylum seekers, and for the new Labour administration.
The head of the French mission for Médecins Sans Frontières, Xavier Crombé, on Tuesday blamed the policies of the French and British governments for the latest deaths.
“We are shocked and angry after this new tragedy in the English Channel,” Crombé said. “These deaths are not inevitable, but the tragic consequence of inhumane and absurd migration policies.”
Crombé said that current policies prioritize border control rather than human lives, making migrant journeys “more precarious and dangerous.”

1PKADFKTT9_AZ1Y0BDI584PRRV,"In Ukraine’s supposed safe haven city, an entire family is wiped out by a Russian missile strike","By Ivana Kottasová and Svitlana Vlasova, CNN","2 minute read Published 11:22 AM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/04/europe/ukraine-safe-haven-city-family-killed-intl/,"Writing in her college application letter, Daryna Bazylevych described her family as “incredibly close knit and harmonious.” She spoke of her parents’ infinite support and the way they told stories about Ukraine’s history to her and her sisters. “They are the strongest pillar in my life and they help me overcome any obstacle,” she wrote.
Of the five members of her family, only Yaroslav, Daryna’s father, is now alive, a lone survivor of a Russian strike on their home in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv on Wednesday.
According to eyewitnesses, Daryna, 18, her sisters Yaryna, 21, and Emilia, 7, and their 43-year-old mother Yevhenia were killed while sheltering in the staircase of their residential building, the Ukrainian emergency services said.
It is likely that Yaroslav survived only because he was in the family apartment when the missile hit the building. He popped over to grab some water for the family — it was him who went because the staircase was meant to be the safe place.
The deaths of the three sisters and their mother caused a huge outpouring of grief among people in Lviv and across Ukraine.
Andriy Sadovyi, the mayor of Lviv, said the eldest girl, Yaryna, worked in the town hall as part of the “Lviv - Youth Capital of Europe 2025” initiative.
Daryna, the middle sister, was a scholarship student of Ukrainian culture at the Ukrainian Catholic University in Lviv. She had just began her second year.
“This is a great and irreparable loss. There are no words that can describe this grief. Let us pray for the souls of the innocent victims. Let us pray for Yaroslav, the father,” the university said in a statement.
Yevhenia, the mother, and the two older girls were members of the Ukrainian Scouts movement. In a statement, the Scouts described Yevhenia as a “creative, intelligent, positive and bright personality.”
The staircase where the Bazylevyches died was meant to be a safe place in a safe city.
Lviv lies in western Ukraine, near the border with Poland, and it has always been seen as one of the safest places in the country.
Tens of thousands of internally displaced people from eastern parts of Ukraine are living in Lviv. Russia is far away, which means missiles and drones take longer to reach the city – giving the Ukrainian military more time to shoot them down.
It has been an exceptionally deadly week for Ukraine — the four members of the Bazylevych family were among seven people killed in Lviv on Wednesday. On Tuesday, two Russian missiles hit a military educational facility in Poltava, killing 53 people and injuring more than 270 others."
1UWX0HPVTC_24O3WXM1APNPYOS,This airport was once the gateway to Europe. Now no one’s heard of it,"By Will Noble, CNN","11 minute read Updated 9:50 AM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/croydon-airport-london-aerodrome-gateway/,"The words “Croydon” and “destination” are not what you’d call soulmates. “I’m certain that of all the places I’ve visited,” writes Tom Chesshyre in “To Hull and Back,” a travelog that sets out to visit the lesser-appreciated parts of Britain, “I’m least likely to return to Croydon.”
The south London town is widely mocked for its none-too-idyllic high-rise skyline, a direct product of a megalomania of office-building between the late 1950s and early 1970s.
True, there’s a small hotel district in the east of the town, flagged by glowing signs for Leonardo and Hampton by Hilton. But it’s unlikely guests are planning a sightseeing tour of Croydon courtesy of one of the lime green trams snaking through the town. They invariably have an early morning flight to catch from Gatwick Airport, which lies just 16 miles southwest of Croydon. It’s far cheaper to stay here than to get an airport hotel.
Gatwick Airport, though, wasn’t always around. Just over a mile and a half southwest of Croydon’s modern hotels lies a Neoclassical hotel at the side of the busy Purley Way road.
The bar is usually propped up with sapped business people, but it was once populated with pilots with nicknames like “Dizzy” and Scruffy “the Undertaker” Robinson. They swigged beers and swapped stories about dense fog and near-misses, while their own framed caricatures hung behind the bar. This was – indeed, still is –  the Aerodrome Hotel, the first purpose-built airport hotel in the world.
And next to it stood Britain’s first international airport.
“My brother and myself went into my parents’ bedroom with its big brass bedstead and my father took us to the window and we saw this silver Zeppelin, lit up by searchlights, with the bursts of anti-aircraft shells exploding around it.”
This is the recollection of David Lean, who director of “Brief Encounter” and “Lawrence of Arabia,” but who was at the time a frightened young boy living in Croydon.
While the thought of London being bombed conjures up images of a smoke-shrouded St. Paul’s Cathedral in the Blitz, London and its surrounds were already under attack during World War I. Croydon was a target, and following a particularly devastating raid in 1915, a plot of land to the southwest of the town was requisitioned under the Defence of the Realm Act, and turned into Beddington Aerodrome.
From here, Sopwith Camels and Bristol Fighters sortied into the night sky, attempting to bring down the inflatable German “baby killers.”
Soon though, war came to an end, and it looked as though Croydon’s tenure as an airbase would too.
But then something happened. Hounslow Heath Aerodrome – which had technically operated Britain’s first international flights – was requisitioned by the War Office. Beddington joined up with the neighboring airfield at Waddon, which’d briefly been used to test new aircraft. Together they became Croydon Aerodrome.
Croydon 1.0 was hardly in the league of Singapore’s Changi International.
It was essentially a collection of cobbled-together wooden buildings and old army huts. The control tower was another hut, this one on stilts accessed by a ladder. Inside it, one visiting journalist found “magicians playing about with little levers and handles.”
The customs house was a glorified barn with signs tacked up above two doors: “British” and “Non-British.”
Imperial Airways’ first PR man, Robert Brenard, said the whole scene “reminded one forcibly of a Wild West township.”
Sheep had to be shooed off the runway. With no radar to speak of, pilots swooped low over train stations to glimpse the sign on the platform and figure out where they were.
One pilot claimed that when looking to land, he sniffed the air; if his nostrils picked up the ripe aroma of Beddington Sewage Works, he knew he was almost home. It’s unclear if he was joking.
The struggle to attract passengers was real. Flying in the early 1920s was an especially expensive affair, and many were anxious about it too – not surprising given how frequent accidents were.
As a forerunner to the deals offered by airlines today, there were special season tickets to Paris, and Easter holiday discounts. These had little effect.
The British government didn’t exactly help matters. “Civil aviation must fly by itself,” said Winston Churchill, who was secretary of state for air between 1919 and 1921. “The government cannot possibly hold it up in the air.” Churchill didn’t mention that he himself had taken flying lessons at Beddington, crashed and very nearly died.
While countries like France, the Netherlands and Germany enjoyed generous subsidies from their respective governments – and already had nascent versions of Air France, KLM and Lufthansa – the Brits were left to fend for themselves.
This could sometimes lead to some embarrassing situations. In “The Seven Skies: A Study of B.O.A.C. and Its Forerunners Since 1919,” John Pudney mentions an episode in which airline staff were ordered to pretend to be passengers during a flight to Germany. The flight would have otherwise been totally empty, save a renowned American lecturer, who the Brits didn’t want to embarrass themselves in front of.

Gradually, the tide turned and the government realized air travel wasn’t going away. In 1924, Britain’s first national airline, Imperial Airways, was formed. A race was set up between an Argosy airliner, the “City of Glasgow,” and the “Flying Scotsman” steam train, between London and Edinburgh. As it transpired, the “City of Glasgow” only pipped the train by 15 minutes, but there was now little doubt: flying would become the superior mode of transport.
Things gradually grew more sophisticated, destinations more ambitious. Harry Beck, who’d designed the iconic “circuit board” London Underground map, was commissioned to come up with a similar-style map flaunting Imperial Airways’ routes. Instead of Goodge Street, Dollis Hill, Ladbroke Grove and Camden Town, the “lines” led to Gaza, Delhi, Luxor and Cape Town.
Flights, though, were anything but direct. The “Kangaroo” route from Croydon to Charleville in Australia involved 28 stops – plus a train between Paris and Brindisi for good measure. On the plus side, passengers got to see so much more of the world when they traveled.
Slowly but steadily, passenger confidence (and numbers) grew. In 1927, 92-year-old Elizabeth Reeves, dressed, as the “Evening Standard” newspaper described her, in “Victorian period” clothes, took her first flight, becoming surely the oldest person at that time to ascend into the heavens, and come back down again. “I really don’t feel at all afraid,” Reeves smiled as she stepped onto the plane at Croydon, “but I had two small nips of whisky before I left home.”
While the birth of Imperial Airways had been a boon to British air travel, what turned it into a shining beacon was Croydon’s stunning Neoclassical airport complex, opened in January 1928.
Here was the first purpose-built air traffic control tower, departure lounge and airport shops. Walking in through the doors, passengers were greeted by an octagonal clock showing details of flights and departures.
A board on the wall detailed what the weather was doing in different corners of the globe. You could even buy French newspapers.
The Aerodrome Hotel opened next door at the same time, offering French-language menus. All of a sudden, Croydon was the height of sophistication.
Though you could fly from Croydon to almost anywhere, its flagship flight was Imperial Airways’ Silver Wing service, which departed from Croydon to Paris Le Bourget daily at 12.30 p.m., and from 1930 were flown on the majestic Handley Page HP-42s.
As these planes leveled out, white-jacketed stewards offered a choice of four Champagnes and 10 cocktails, and a six-course meal served on blue and white china, with metal cutlery, real glasses and damask tablecloths. The food had been sourced from Croydon’s Surrey Street market that morning.
Some of Croydon’s passengers still preferred to bring their own, as was the case with eccentric millionaire Nubar Gulbenkian, who had his valet prepare dishes of game consommé on board.
Croydon might not have had all the creature comforts of modern-day air travel, but the interwar years were undeniably a golden era.
It’s true that passengers had to go through the ordeal of being individually weighed.
It’s also true that the seats weren’t as comfortable as though on today’s airliners, made as they were from wicker.
The HP-42s pootled along at what we’d consider a snail’s pace (95 miles-per-hour top whack). Then again, from entering the airport, it took as little as 10 minutes to board your flight.
If the cabin got stuffy, you could open a window and feel the breeze in your hair. As planes flew low back then, you often had a scenic view out of the window.
In-flight movies didn’t come as standard of course, although Croydon did screen the first full-length in-flight movie. The year was 1925, and the film was “The Lost World,” based on Arthur Conan Doyle’s sci-fi dinosaur fiction. The pilot thoughtfully steered through dense clouds to darken the cabin.
As for the Aerodrome Hotel, it was a hit, not just with overnight guests, but with day-trippers too.
“It must be particularly emphasized,” reads the hotel’s literature from the time, “that the Aerodrome Hotel is not a mere terminus hotel, but is used frequently as a holiday resort and sightseeing base by tourists and motorists.”
Between 1932 and 1933, almost 70,000 took advantage of the hotel’s bar, restaurant and rooftop viewing platform, from which they could watch planes take off and land.
Others were happy to watch the wealthy female passengers making their way across the airport apron, while commenting on their choice of clothes.
Croydon became not just a destination, but the destination.
Celebrities – including Babe Ruth, Fred Astaire, John F. Kennedy, and Hollywood couple Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks – came.
Charlie Chaplin was familiar with Croydon too. Landing here in 1921, he was “kidnapped” by an overzealous cinema owner, who’d put on a fake mustache, pretended to be Chaplin’s chauffeur, and instead of driving him to the Savoy, had taken him to his picture house in the London district of Clapham.
In 1935, Agatha Christie published the Hercule Poirot novel “Death in the Clouds,” in which a woman is found murdered on a flight as it comes into land at Croydon.
Croydon had become part of popular culture.

Though the 1928 airport complex was a big step up from the original aerodrome, Croydon was still blighted by problems.
It was a distance from central London, and without its own railway station. Worse was the fog – thick and tenacious, thanks to Croydon’s location at the foot of the Surrey North Downs.
December 9, 1936, witnessed the biggest disaster ever to happen at Croydon, when a KLM airliner attempting to take off in the fog crash-landed into a house soon after, killing more than a dozen passengers and crew. Among them was a former prime minister of Sweden, and Juan de la Cierva, inventor of the autogyro.
Tragedies like this certainly didn’t help Croydon’s reputation, but something else would prove the coup de grâce.
Just as World War I had breathed unlikely life into Croydon Airport, World War II more or less took it away. The RAF took over, and civilian flights stopped. The airport was damaged by bombing, and lost many of its personnel in conflict too.
Though Croydon reopened after the war, in 1946, Heathrow took the reins as the country’s premier international airport. Croydon’s incredible story was coming to an end.
While the Aerodrome Hotel remains, so too does a large chunk of the Neoclassical airport, now a business center known as Airport House.
The closest you’ll get to traveling to Pakistan from here today is a chicken karahi from the Imperial Lounge restaurant, nestled in one corner of the ground floor. And yet, thanks to its remarkable preservation, you can still get a real sense of the airport in its heyday – particularly on its monthly open days.
Here, tour guides will lead you on fascinating tours taking in the departure lounge, its original mezzanine and skylight still intact; wicker chairs on which passengers were once whisked to far-flung lands; vintage booklets providing “Hints for Lady Passengers” (”Do not use much powder during the flight, as the temperature varies a good deal’).
It’s quite something to think that nearly two million passengers have bustled through this place.
Out the front of Airport House is a plinth-mounted de Havilland DH.114 Heron – frozen in mid-flight. It’s the same model of plane in which Geoffrey Last (talk about nominative determinism) flew Croydon’s final flight back in 1959. Such was the sense of loss from Croydonians, that as they watched the plane vanish into the skies, they set light to an effigy of the minister of transport and civil aviation. Up in the old control tower – also in fantastically good condition – meanwhile, you will find a framed poem by Ken Steel, “The Lost Airport.” It concludes:
Alas those happy times have passed and gone.
No more the neon beams its welcome light.
Croydon is dead, her halcyon days are done.
No more her klaxon stirs the summer night.
Croydon is dead, but though her sun has set,
In airmen’s hearts her fame is living yet.
Croydon, though, is far from dead. The airport may not be operating anymore, but just as it was back in the 1920s and ‘30s, it remains an attraction in its own right – still bringing in people from near and far, and in doing so, making Croydon the unlikeliest of destinations.
Croydon Airport Visitor Centre opens for public tours on the first Sunday of every month. Book ahead, as they often sell out.

1X25BEX0NK_Y2AF41ON4X80OKI,Exclusive: John McCain’s son decries Trump appearance at Arlington as a ‘violation’ that turned cemetery into campaign backdrop,"By Natasha Bertrand, CNN","5 minute read Updated 5:05 PM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240903,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/03/politics/jimmy-mccain-decries-trump-arlington-appearance/,"When former President Donald Trump held a campaign event at Arlington National Cemetery last week, 1st Lt. Jimmy McCain says he viewed it as a “violation.”
The youngest son of the late Sen. John McCain had already been moving away from the Republican Party — just weeks ago, he changed his voter registration to Democrat and plans to vote for Kamala Harris in November, he told CNN in an exclusive interview this week.
But he is speaking out now for the first time about Trump because of the former president’s conduct at the hallowed ground where several generations of McCain’s family, including his grandfather and great grandfather, are buried.
“It just blows me away,” McCain, who has served in the military for 17 years, told CNN. “These men and women that are laying in the ground there have no choice” of whether to be a backdrop for a political campaign, he said.
“I just think that for anyone who’s done a lot of time in their uniform, they just understand that inherently — that it’s not about you there. It’s about these people who gave the ultimate sacrifice in the name of their country.”
McCain’s decision to speak out now is part of his broader shift away from the Republican Party and his family’s famously conservative roots. After years as a registered independent, he says he registered as a Democrat several weeks ago and plans to vote for Kamala Harris in November, adding that he “would get involved in any way I could” to help her campaign.
It’s a significant move for the son of a former GOP presidential candidate and Arizona senator. While other members of the McCain family have distanced themselves from Trump — including Jimmy McCain’s mother Cindy, who endorsed then-candidate Joe Biden in 2020, and his sister Meghan — none except Jimmy have publicly abandoned the Republican Party.
Despite her harsh criticisms of Trump, Meghan McCain indicated last week that she would still not endorse Harris. “I’m a lifelong, generational conservative,” she tweeted.
Jimmy McCain, who enlisted in the Marine Corps at age 17 and now serves as an intelligence officer in the 158th Infantry Regiment, had until now deliberately sought to avoid entering the political fray. Trump’s attacks on his father — that he was “not a war hero” because he was captured in Vietnam, and his reported description of the elder McCain as a “loser” — were deeply hurtful on a personal level, but not out of bounds politically, Jimmy McCain believes.
“One thing about John McCain is that he chose a public life,” McCain said. “So to attack him is really not out of the realm of his job description.”
For the younger McCain, though, the Arlington episode and how the campaign has reacted to it represents a whole new level of what he perceives as Trump’s disrespect for the fallen. And he believes it stems from Trump’s own insecurities about not having served.
“Many of these men and women, who served their country, chose to do something greater than themselves,” McCain said. “They woke up one morning, they signed on the dotted line, they put their right hand up, and they chose to serve their country. And that’s an experience that Donald Trump has not had. And I think that might be something that he thinks about a lot.”
McCain emphasized that he is speaking on his own behalf and his views do not represent those of the US Army. McCain received his commission and became an officer in US Army intelligence in 2022.
McCain’s anger over the Arlington episode was also particularly acute because when it happened, he had just returned from a seven-month deployment to a small US base on the Jordan-Syria border known as Tower 22.
He arrived there just weeks after three US service members were killed on the base in a drone attack by Iran-backed militants, and he says he thought of them when he saw Trump posing last Monday in front of gravestones.
“It was a violation,” McCain said. “That mother, that sister, those families, see that — and it’s a painful experience.”
Trump visited the cemetery last Monday following a wreath laying ceremony honoring the 13 US military service members who were killed at Kabul airport’s Abbey Gate in Afghanistan in 2021. His campaign filmed the visit, leading to an altercation with a cemetery staffer who attempted to prevent Trump’s team from photographing and filming in the area where recent US casualties are buried. According to the Army, doing so violates federal law, Army regulations and Defense Department policies.
Trump is not the first politician to violate a ban on political activity at Arlington. In fact, more than 20 years ago, John McCain said he made “a very bad mistake” when he released a campaign ad that featured a clip of him walking through the cemetery.
Trump and his campaign, however, have not issued such a mea culpa. Instead, according to the US Army, they ignored and “abruptly pushed aside” a cemetery staffer who protested the activity and published footage of the event later anyway. One of Trump’s campaign managers, Chris LaCivita, called the Army “hacks” and said it was “100% a manufactured story.”
Over the weekend, Trump’s campaign released taped statements from family members of some of the service members who were killed at Abbey Gate, who said they invited Trump to their loved ones’ graves. But the campaign’s video of the event, which they put on TikTok, showed other gravestones, too — including that of an Army Special Forces soldier who died by suicide, and whose family said they did not give the campaign permission to film it.
McCain, for his part, is now bracing to get more involved in this election cycle. While he has been involved in veteran advocacy work for years, he acknowledges that his own recent political shift has been deeply personal.
“John McCain was my father, and a lot of people lose that in the minutia,” McCain said. “He wasn’t ‘John McCain’ the way he is to the world. He was the man who loved me. And the one thing I’ve known about my dad since the moment I could think, was that he was a good man and that he had done his part. And for me to be with him towards the end of his life, hearing things [from Trump] like, he was a loser because he was captured—I don’t think I could ever overlook that.”"
1XRSEAJRNB_XHT53WREPPR3H9R,Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson reflects on ‘groundbreaking’ path to the Supreme Court in new memoir,"By John Fritze and Lauren del Valle, CNN","7 minute read Updated 7:07 AM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240903,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/03/politics/ketanji-brown-jackson-new-memoir/,"Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson is using a new memoir published Tuesday to reflect on a personal journey that has already earned her a place in history.
Jackson recalls sinking into her chair when she was an appeals court judge – her blood “a roaring ocean in my ears” – when President Joe Biden called in early 2022 to say he would nominate her to the high court, setting her on a path to become the first Black woman to serve as a Supreme Court justice.
“From my perspective, my arrival at the pinnacle of the legal profession was indeed groundbreaking, the culmination of a life spent toiling in relative obscurity, marked by my being suddenly thrust into the white-hot spotlight of national prominence,” Jackson writes in her book, “Lovely One.”
She added, “For many, my seat at the table represents the realization of our country’s highest ideals in a land that promises opportunity and equality to all.”
Jackson, who turns 54 this month, joined the Supreme Court two years ago and is already establishing herself as a thoughtful questioner, a prolific opinion writer and a reliable vote for the court’s liberal wing.  Biden’s first and only nominee, Jackson succeeded Justice Stephen Breyer, for whom she once clerked.
In the coming days, Jackson will travel across the country to promote the memoir, speaking to sold-out theaters as well as public libraries. This week, she’ll speak in New York, Washington, DC, Atlanta and Miami.
Her memoir doesn’t delve deeply into the law or behind-the-scenes workings of the Supreme Court. Instead, she tells the story of a modern family – and, specifically, a modern mother – juggling a demanding career alongside a young family, including a daughter diagnosed at 11 with mild autism spectrum disorder.
Jackson details impossible commutes and childcare stresses, parent-teacher conferences that don’t go as planned and stolen naps in Safeway parking lots borne of exhaustion.
But she also focuses on the triumphs at home and at work, including her relationship with her husband, Dr. Patrick Jackson, a prominent surgeon; a diagnosis that helped her eldest daughter thrive; and a nomination to a US District Court judgeship during the Obama administration.
The book’s title is a reference to Jackson’s name. Chosen by her parents from a list provided by an influential aunt, “Ketanji Onyika,” they were told, meant “Lovely One” in an African dialect.
“As I grew older, the sound of my name would often remind me of my aunt,” Jackson writes. “And when people would tell me that my name was unique, creative, and beautiful, I would think of it as a tribute to the woman who had gifted it to me.”
The book offers a personal and relatable narrative of a prominent justice at a time when the high court as an institution is under considerable scrutiny for a series of ethics scandals and politically charged rulings on abortion, guns and presidential immunity.
Speaking at the famed Apollo Theater in Harlem on Tuesday night to promote the book, Jackson acknowledged that the court shouldn’t be exempt from public criticism – though she didn’t embrace any specific ideas for how to address its slipping support.
“The court is an institution that doesn’t have any other mechanism of enforcement than public trust. And so it’s particularly significant when there is a deficit of trust,” Jackson said. “This sort of how our system works – the judges, in my view, are not beyond criticism or constraint. We are a government branch. We are government servants and officials. And so in a democracy, the people decide the form and the structure of government. And so in order to decide that people have to be engaged, they have to debate these issues. And that’s what we see happening now.”
Expanding on those remarks during an appearance on CBS’ “The Late Show” Tuesday, Jackson acknowledged that public perception of the high court is “problematic.”
“I’m aware that that is the public perception, and I think it’s problematic for the court that that’s a perception that the public has, because we really rely on public trust in order to do our jobs,” Jackson said. “It’s a concern.”
Jackson on Tuesday night recalled some of the preparation she underwent for her confirmation in 2022, which at times grew testy as Republicans attempted to get her to define her judicial philosophy and explain some of her sentencing decisions as a federal trial court judge. In one-on-one interactions, the senators were “lovely,” she said, which helped her cope with the sometimes-brutal moments of her confirmation hearing.
“It was also super helpful in the hearing because we had had a conversation, so I said, ‘Oh, I see. You’re not really talking to me, right?’” she said. “’You must be talking to your constituents or to someone else.’”
She recalled some of the best advice she received from White House advisors during her preparation for the confirmation battle that helped her maintain her composure.
“You can get angry, or you can be a Supreme Court justice,” she said she was counseled.
Born in Washington, DC, in 1970, Jackson in her memoir pins her good fortune, at least in part, on timing. She came of age at the dawn of the post-Civil Rights era, with a family that impressed upon her the significance of the moment for African Americans. Jackson not only capitalized on that opportunity but was fixated on meeting the challenges put before her.
“I had understood from the outset that my learning curve as a district court judge would be the steepest I had ever encountered,” she writes about taking her seat on the federal bench in 2013. “I intended to be unimpeachable as I climbed.”
At least some of the landmark anti-discrimination laws that Jackson cites in her book, including the Voting Rights Act of 1965, are now being challenged at the Supreme Court. During Jackson’s first term on the court, a majority of her colleagues barred consideration of race to ensure diversity on college campuses. Jackson dissented in one of those cases and recused herself in another, involving Harvard College, because she had previously served on the school’s board of overseers.
The memoir is being published by Random House weeks before the Supreme Court begins a new term in October that will feature cases dealing with transgender rights, ghost guns and the federal regulation of e-cigarettes. Jackson reported receiving nearly $894,000 from Random House last year, though that is likely only the first of multiple payments.
While justices often publish memoirs after serving for at least several years on the court, Jackson’s went on sale just more than two years after she was seated – far faster than any of her colleagues’ recent books. Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett have also announced book deals and Justice Neil Gorsuch published a book of his own earlier this summer.
Though she briefly touches on general legal controversies – such as those dealing with criminal sentencing – Jackson avoids mentioning cases before the court. At one point, she appears to question the way some of her colleagues are focusing on history in their rulings.
“Whose history,” she asks, is being considered in those analyses?
“It is true that not everyone was represented at the table when our country was being birthed, or when our vaunted Constitution was being hammered out,” she writes. “Yet the principles of liberty and equality that the framers adopted and that are now enshrined as the bedrock of our society mean that, today, every citizen can enter those rooms, protected by laws that recognize the civil liberties and human rights of all Americans.”
Jackson writes at length about her older daughter, Talia, who is academically gifted but who sometimes struggled with social interactions and transitions at school. After years of navigating what Jackson describes as “outright trauma,” her daughter was diagnosed with autism.
“There is no use in pretending that we weren’t completely devastated by the long-overdue confirmation of what I had suspected all along: that our older child was on the autism spectrum,” Jackson writes. At the same time, Jackson described the news as something of a relief.
“We could end our denial,” she writes.
“As Talia learned to advocate for herself through the years, she would educate us about how she was not ‘a person with autism’ but, rather, was autistic – by which she meant that her autism was an identity as much as her being Black and female,” Jackson writes. “Autism was another lens through which she engaged the world, with full awareness of her strengths and mindful of her trials.”
In thinking about her place in history, Jackson writes that the framers of the Constitution probably couldn’t have foreseen her story – her struggle and, ultimately, her successes.
“I highly doubt that any of them could have envisioned me, the descendant of enslaved Africans, the offspring of parents raised in the Jim Crow era, and a post–civil rights daughter, donning a borrowed robe to take her oath of judicial office and join the ranks of that esteemed branch of government,” Jackson writes. “But that is the very genius of the framers’ foundational guarantee of liberty and justice for all.”

1YR281F920_K6TBN2D3I8CQXB8,DOJ alleges Russia funded US media company linked to right-wing social media stars,"By Zachary Cohen, Donie O'Sullivan, Evan Perez, Sean Lyngaas and Majlie de Puy Kamp, CNN","6 minute read Updated 11:08 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/04/politics/doj-alleges-russia-funded-us-media-company-linked-to-right-wing-social-media-stars/,"The unnamed Tennessee-based company that the Justice Department alleges was being funded by Russian operatives working as part of a Kremlin-orchestrated influence operation targeting the 2024 US election is Tenet Media, which is linked to right-wing commentators with millions of subscribers on YouTube and other social media platforms, according to a US official briefed on the matter.
The indictment unsealed in New York’s Southern District accused two employees of RT, the Kremlin’s media arm, of funneling nearly $10 million to an unidentified company, described only as “Company 1” in court documents.
CNN has independently confirmed that “Company 1” is Tenet Media, which is a platform for independent content creators. It is self-described as a “network of heterodox commentators that focus on Western political and cultural issues,” according to its website, which matches language contained in the newly unsealed indictment.
The alleged Russian operation tapped two people to set up the company in their names to add to its legitimacy and the two founders were aware Russian money backed the operation, according to the indictment.
The goal of the operation, according to prosecutors, was to fuel pro-Russian narratives, in part, by pushing content and news articles favoring Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and others who the Kremlin deemed to be friendlier to its interests.
Among the commentators listed on Tenet Media’s website are right-wing personalities Benny Johnson, Tim Pool and Dave Rubin. All have released statements saying they were victims of the alleged Russian scheme and they maintained editorial control of the content they created.
Each has a loyal fanbase online, with a combined roughly 6 million followers on YouTube alone. Pool interviewed Trump on his podcast in May.
Wednesday’s indictment outlined how the American social media stars were hired by Tenet Media. Some of the creators were told the project was being bankrolled by a man named Eduard Grigoriann. “In truth and fact,” the indictment reads, “Grigoriann was a fictional persona.”
The indictment outlines how one of the social media stars was approached by Tenet Media’s founder with an offer of $2 million a year to make videos for the company. One of the founders later wrote, “It would need to be closer to 5 million yearly for him to be interested,” according to the indictment.
The social media star expressed some skepticism about who was funding the deal and asked for more information about Grigoriann.
Eventually the social media star agreed on a contract of a $400,000 monthly fee to create “four weekly videos,” along with a $100,000 signing bonus.
Tenet Media’s US-based founders are not named in the indictment, but business records filed in Tennessee reveal two people connected to the company: Lauren Chen and Liam Donovan. A Twitter account for Donovan identifies him as the president of Tenet Media and his Instagram account describes Donovan as Chen’s husband.
A private message between the two in May 2021 read, “So we’re billing the Russians from the corporation, right?” Two weeks later, another message said, “Also, the Russians paid. So we’re good to bill them for the next month I guess,” the legal filing details.
Chen, is a rightwing online influencer in her own right. She has appeared in some of Tenet Media’s videos and has more than 500,000 subscribers on YouTube.
The Russian state-controlled media RT lists Chen as a contributor for several articles in 2021 and 2022. She is also linked to the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA. As of Thursday afternoon Turning Point US had deleted webpages featuring Chen.
A YouTube video referenced in the indictment further describes Tenet Media as “a project of Lauren Chen and her husband Liam.”
Blaze Media on Thursday said it had fired Chen.
BlazeTV, a subset of the Glenn Beck-founded conservative outlet, has since taken down a page that previously promoted content Chen produced for the outlet, including her show “Pseudo-Intellectual.”
“Lauren Chen was an independent contractor, whose contract has been terminated,” Tyler Cardon, the chief executive of Blaze Media, said in a statement to CNN. The news was first reported by Semafor.
YouTube has removed Tenet Media’s channel and others associated with Chen, a YouTube spokesperson said in a statement Thursday.
“Following an indictment from the US Department of Justice and after careful review, we are terminating the Tenet Media channel and four channels operated by its owner Lauren Chen as part of our ongoing efforts to combat coordinated influence operations,” the statement said.
The company’s investigation into the matter is ongoing, according to YouTube.
Neither Chen nor Donovan responded to CNN’s request for comment.
Others ensnared in the alleged Russian plot, however, insist they are the victims.
“We are disturbed by the allegations in today’s indictment, which make clear that myself and other influencers were victims in this alleged scheme,” Johnson wrote in a post on X after the indictment was unsealed on Wednesday.
“Should these allegations prove true, I as well as the other personalities and commentators were deceived and are victims,” Pool said on X. “The show is produced in its entirety by our local team without input from anyone external to the company,” he added.
In a statement also posted to X, Rubin wrote, “These allegations clearly show that I and other commentators were the victims of this scheme. I knew absolutely nothing about any of this fraudulent activity. Period.”
Adding, “The DoJ has never contacted me regarding this matter and I have no intention to comment further.”
The DOJ’s revealing of the alleged Russian plot was part of a wider set of actions the Biden administration announced Wednesday it was taking to tackle a major Russian government-backed effort to influence the 2024 US presidential election including sanctions on 10 individuals and entities, and the seizure of 32 internet domains.
At Russian President Vladimir Putin’s direction, three Russian companies used fake profiles to promote false narratives on social media, US Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said in a statement. Internal documents produced by one of those Russian companies show one of the goals of the propaganda effort was to boost the candidacy of Trump or whoever emerged as the Republican nominee for president, according to an FBI affidavit.
Taken together with the indictment of the RT employees, the actions represent the Biden administration’s most significant public response yet to alleged Russian influence operations targeting American voters. After the US accused Iran of trying to hack both the Trump and Biden-Harris campaigns last month, Wednesday’s actions are a reminder that US officials continue to see Russia as a prominent foreign influence threat to November’s election, sources familiar with the matter told CNN ahead of the announcements.

20OB69ST2V_676ZAONA1XX7JCE,What to watch for at the first post-SCOTUS hearing in the Trump federal election subversion case,"By Tierney Sneed and Hannah Rabinowitz, CNN","7 minute read Published 5:00 AM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/05/politics/donald-trump-election-jan-6-hearing/,"Lawyers for Donald Trump and special counsel Jack Smith will be before Judge Tanya Chutkan on Thursday for the first hearing in the federal election subversion case since prosecutors revised their indictment to try to bring their case in line with a Supreme Court ruling extending to Trump some presidential immunity in the prosecution.
Chutkan will consider where the case goes from here, as a pre-election trial is now firmly out of reach. Smith’s and Trump’s teams have differing visions for what should come next, and they laid out their dueling approaches in court filings late Friday night.
Now the trial judge will have the opportunity to press them on those proposals. Thursday’s hearing could give a view into how Chutkan – an Obama appointee who was eager to get the prosecution to trial before the Supreme Court intervened – sees the case now that it is back in her court. She will ultimately decide what happens in the case before Americans cast their ballots, with Trump again topping the GOP presidential ticket, and how far the case moves along before Inauguration Day, when Trump, if elected, could bring about the end of the case.
Trump has claimed the Justice Department engaged in election interference by filing the newly revised indictment, an allegation Attorney General Merrick Garland rejected Wednesday, telling reporters that he was “confident” that Smith abided by DOJ policies regarding the sensitivities around major public activity near elections.
“I stand by the actions of the special counsel,” Garland said. “The superseding indictment is an effort to respond to the direct instructions of the Supreme Court as to how to effectuate a new indictment in an ongoing case.”
The hearing starts at 10 a.m. ET in Washington, DC’s federal courthouse. Cameras are not allowed into Chutkan’s courtroom, but CNN will be providing live updates as it unfolds. Here’s what to watch for:
Smith and Trump both offered their perspectives of the case’s schedule on Friday: Smith did not offer firm dates for the next phase of the case, while Trump recommended a schedule for certain pre-trial disputes that would carry through until at least the beginning of 2025.
Their staunch disagreements set up what could be a fierce debate Thursday in front of the judge, who will ultimately decide how the case will move forward.
Chutkan hasn’t yet tipped her hand as to whether she sees any detailed legal fights playing out before November’s presidential election. When she scheduled Thursday’s hearing last month, Chutkan only instructed the parties to get together to see whether they could agree on scheduling matters, and to highlight where they disagree.
In the past, the judge has shown a desire to push the case forward as quickly as possible. Chutkan has ruled on issues several times without holding in-person hearings, and before the case was upended by a lengthy appeals process, repeatedly refused to push back deadlines or the now-defunct March trial date.
In those disputes, however, prosecutors fiercely argued to keep the case on a tight schedule, whereas now they appear to be leaving all scheduling matters up to the judge. That switch could be because prosecutors don’t want to be perceived as explicitly pushing for dramatic public flare-ups in the case during the weeks before the election. Leaving those deadline decisions entirely up to Chutkan would take the onus off of the Justice Department.
With the filing last week of a so-called “superseding indictment,” Smith signaled that, though he spent several months without publicly indicating how they would handle the election interference prosecution going forward, his team has been quietly re-assembling their case.
Those preparations would allow prosecutors to propel the case forward – and quickly – should the judge decide to do so.
In the few weeks since the case returned to the district court’s jurisdiction, prosecutors rewrote the indictment against Trump entirely so that it would, in their eyes, conform with the high court’s mandate on presidential immunity.
The Supreme Court said in July that Trump had absolute immunity when it came to the executive branch’s “core” functions and said that his election-related dealings with the Justice Department fit in that category, so Smith removed the DOJ-related allegations entirely for that case. For other official presidential acts, such as Trump’s interactions with his vice president, Mike Pence, the immunity is “presumed” but could be overcome if prosecutors could prove that criminalizing that conduct wouldn’t interfere with a president performing his “constitutional functions,” the Supreme Court said. So, Smith has made significant edits to other parts of his indictment to distinguish Trump’s post-election actions – including his pressure campaign on Pence – from the duties of a president, while removing some interactions Trump had with his official advisers.
And in their scheduling proposal to Chutkan on Friday, the special counsel prosecutors indicated that they have been prepping other filings too, particularly over issues likely to arise in the continued and arduous fight over what evidence can still be presented in the case. “The Government is prepared to file its opening immunity brief promptly at any time the Court deems appropriate,” prosecutors wrote of those briefings.
Trump and Smith have different procedural ideas for how the battle over immunity that the Supreme Court ruling teed up should be tackled. On Thursday, Chutkan could indicate that she is choosing one of those approaches over the other, or she might press to find some middle ground way that melds their opposing proposals.
Smith, in Friday’s court filings, suggested that the issue could be decided just with legal briefings and said that his office was ready to file an opening briefing explaining how the superseding indictment comports with the Supreme Court’s decision.
Trump disagreed with that process in Friday’s filings. Instead, his lawyers think Trump is entitled to another round of immunity-related discovery from the government before the judge considers whether the revised case comports with the Supreme Court’s ruling. Trump argued the court should reserve time on its schedule to hash out any disputes that would arise if prosecutors refused to turn over records Trump is seeking. And Trump thinks he should be able to file the first brief on the merits of the immunity issues instead of the special counsel, with a motion to dismiss that would seek to toss the entire superseding indictment.
But before all that, Trump says that the court should decide a challenge he is planning to file alleging that Smith was unconstitutionally appointed and that his office was unlawfully funded – a similar motion to that which led to the dismissal of his federal case in Florida.
Another process-related question Chutkan may weigh in on is whether she will deal with non-immunity issues while she’s considering the immunity question, or if each dispute will need to be dealt with separately.
In addition to the immunity issue, Trump previewed in Friday’s filing what will be several other possible efforts he launches to attack Smith’s case. At Thursday’s hearing, Chutkan could lay out a process for dealing with those potential requests for the case’s dismissal, while signaling how seriously she views them.
Trump will try to replicate the successful challenge he brought to Smith’s appointment in the Florida case, which led to the judge there dismissing the classified documents prosecution (that ruling is up on appeal). Trump also plans a separate attack on the election subversion case that will allege that the grand jury that handed up the new indictment was exposed to evidence covered by the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling, requiring the case’s dismissal.
Trump’s lawyers are additionally considering a challenge zeroing in on the central role Trump’s conduct toward Pence continues to play in Smith’s case.
Another challenge they might bring would argue Smith’s case is flawed because it brings an obstruction charge that was undermined by a separate Supreme Court ruling this term, in which the court limited the use of the obstruction charge in Capitol rioter cases.
“Fully considering, researching, briefing, and resolving each of these potential motions will take considerable time and resources,” Trump’s attorneys said in the Friday filing.

The service member, a US Navy sailor, is a US citizen and was detained on August 30 in Caracas, according to the officials. One of the officials said he is being held by the Venezuelan intelligence agency SEBIN.
A defense official told CNN, “we are aware of reports that a US Navy Sailor was detained on or about August 30, 2024, by Venezuelan law enforcement authorities while on personal travel to Venezuela. The US Navy is looking into this and working closely with the State Department. We refer you to the State Department for additional questions.”
Another official said the service member was not on official travel or approved leave when he traveled to the country. It is not clear why he traveled there.
“We are aware of reports of the detention of an individual in Venezuela,” a State Department spokesperson said.
“We have no further information to share at this time,” the spokesperson said.
The White House said Wednesday that they are “in touch” with Venezuelan authorities to get more information about the situation, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said.
“We’re obviously in touch, as appropriate as you think we would be with Venezuela authorities to try to get more knowledge and information about this,” Kirby said in Wednesday’s White House press briefing.
The State Department advises Americans against traveling to Venezuela, warning that “there is a high risk of wrongful detention of U.S. nationals.”
“Security forces have detained U.S. citizens for up to five years,” the travel advisory for Venezuela says. “The U.S. government is not generally notified of the detention of U.S. citizens in Venezuela or granted access to U.S. citizen prisoners there.”
CNN has asked the Venezuelan government for comment.
The detention of a US citizen comes during a period of serious unrest within Venezuela, after opposition and multiple Latin American leaders refused to recognize the reelection of the country’s authoritarian leader, Nicolas Maduro, in July. Protests erupted in Venezuela over the election, which reportedly killed at least 11 people and resulted in the detention of hundreds of others.
Just this week, the US seized Maduro’s airplane in the Dominican Republic. CNN first reported the seizure, which was a significant development in an already tense relationship between the US and Venezuela. One US official told CNN the seizure “sends a message all the way to the top.”
“Seizing the foreign head of state’s plane is unheard-of for criminal matters. We’re sending a clear message here that no one is above the law, no one is above the reach of US sanctions,” the official said.
The latest detention of a US service member comes roughly two years after nine Americans — including the “Citgo 6” — were brought home from Venezuela by the Biden administration in 2022. after five years of detention in the country. In December 2023, the US secured the release of six wrongfully detained Americans and four other Americans held in Venezuela.

The Chinese Coast Guard (CCG) said a Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) ship had “deliberately collided” with one of its vessels near the disputed Sabina Shoal, according to state broadcaster CCTV.
“At 12:06, the Philippine ship No. 9701 deliberately collided with the Chinese ship No. 5205, which was normally enforcing rights and law enforcement, in an unprofessional and dangerous manner, resulting in a collision. The responsibility lies entirely with the Philippines,” CCG spokesman Liu Dejun said on Saturday.
PCG spokesperson Jay Tarriela said the Chinese side had “deliberately rammed” a Philippines vessel.
“This afternoon, the Chinese Coast Guard vessel deliberately rammed and collided with the BRP Teresa Magbanua three times, despite no provocation from the Philippine Coast Guard,” he wrote in a post on X.
Related article A dangerous new flashpoint is fast emerging in the South China Sea
The dueling accounts come as Chinese and Philippine vessels have engaged in multiple collisions and face-offs over the past week near Sabina Shoal, also known as Xianbin Reef.
The disputed atoll lies just 86 miles from the Philippines’ west coast and 745 miles from China.
A spokesperson for the US State Department said it condemned China for “deliberately colliding three times” with the Philippine vessel.
“On multiple occasions throughout August 2024, (China) has aggressively disrupted lawful Philippine aerial and maritime operations in the South China Sea, including at Sabina Shoal,” said the spokesperson Matthew Miller said.
Miller added that the US called on China to comply with international law and “desist from dangerous and destabilizing conduct.”
China claims almost all of the South China Sea as its sovereign territory despite an international ruling to the contrary.
The escalation in tensions comes just weeks after Beijing and Manila struck a temporary deal to lower tensions that had been rising all summer at another nearby reef, where China’s increasingly aggressive tactics had raised alarm across the region as well as in Washington, a mutual defense ally of the Philippines.

“I was looking through — I can’t remember if it was a phone book,” the “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice” star told People about the origin of his use of Keaton. “I must’ve gone, ‘I don’t know, let me think of something here.’ And I went, ‘Oh, that sounds reasonable.’”
The now 72-year-old actor explained that while he was born “Michael Douglas,” he was unable to use that name in Hollywood given that another Oscar-winning actor and the son of Kirk Douglas, Michael Douglas, was already using it.
Mike Douglas was also spoken for by the famous talk-show host.
The Screen Actors Guild prohibits two performers from using the same name, so Keaton chose Keaton. And while he’s made quite an accomplished name for himself, the actor would like to be known professionally as “Michael Keaton Douglas.”
He planned on doing just that for his recent directorial effort “Knox Goes Away.” In the hustle of making the film, however, Keaton forgot to seal it on screen.

2DR71SLYF6_WCESGJGVEJVKDNE,Costco’s first membership price hike in 7 years just went into effect,"By Jordan Valinsky, CNN","2 minute read Published 11:15 AM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/03/business/costco-membership-fee-price-increase/,"Costco customers are now paying more for their annual memberships for the first time since 2017.
The retailer announced in July that membership fees would increase by $5 to $65 a year in the US and Canada for three of its plans: “Gold Star,” “Business” and “Business Add-On.” The changes started for new members signing up on or after September 1 and renewals occurring after that date.
The price of Costco’s premium “Executive Membership” also went up, by $10 to $130 a year. However, those members will soon be able to earn a maximum of $1,250 in rewards annually versus $1,000 currently.
The company estimated that 52 million memberships will be impacted, a little over half of which are Executive members, Costco previously said.
Annual fees have been one of the biggest profit-generating areas for Costco, helping it offset expenses to keep its prices down. Last year, Costco earned $4.6 billion in revenue from membership fees, an 8% increase from 2022.
The fee hikes come as Costco, like streaming companies, has been taking more measures to ensure fewer non-subscribers are hitching a ride on other customers’ memberships.
Costco (COST) is cracking down on membership moochers by implementing stricter policies and requiring shoppers to scan their membership cards to enter stores.

“Over the coming months, membership scanning devices will be used at the entrance door of your local warehouse,” Costco said in a previous statement. “Once deployed, prior to entering, all members must scan their physical or digital membership card by placing the barcode or QR Code against the scanner.”
For members with cards that don’t have a photo, Costco says to come prepared with a valid photo ID but encourages shoppers to visit the membership counter and have their photo taken.
Costco’s new rule also requires all guests to be accompanied by a valid cardholder to enter its stores, making it more difficult for non-members to sneak in using cards that don’t belong to them.

2FX8HPQ1V8_N52X6TYA043CVXY,Netanyahu is unequivocal about ceasefire and hostage agreement with Hamas: ‘There’s not a deal in the making’,"By Mick Krever, Jennifer Hansler and Alex Marquardt, CNN","6 minute read Updated 11:22 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/05/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-hamas-agreement-intl/,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday was as clear as he has ever been that he does not believe a ceasefire and hostage deal is likely in Gaza in a sharp rebuke to the Biden administration’s insistence it’s close at hand.
“There’s not a deal in the making,” Netanyahu told Fox News. “Unfortunately, it’s not close.”
His comments stand in stark contrast to the relentlessly hopeful messaging from the Biden administration over the past months. On Sunday, President Joe Biden claimed that the parties were on the verge of a deal, and on Wednesday, a senior administration official claimed 90% of the agreement had been completed.
That, Netanyahu said, is “exactly inaccurate.”
Netanyahu’s rebuff of the US’ assessment of a prospective deal is the latest instance in a string of public comments this week from the Israeli prime minister casting doubt on the potential agreement months in the making.
US officials have been reticent to directly criticize Netanyahu – even as he has repeatedly broken with the administration’s position and cast doubt on his adherence to a potential deal – although a National Security Council official on Thursday acknowledged “frustrations” in the process while still continuing to insist a deal is close.
“It’s exactly inaccurate. There’s a story, a narrative out there, that there’s a deal out there,” the Israeli Prime Minister said of the statement from the American official the day prior that “basically, 90 percent of this deal has been agreed.”
On Sunday, when Israel announced that the bodies of six hostages has been found executed by Hamas, Biden still argued that negotiators were on the “verge of having an agreement.”
US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby doubled down on those assessments in comments to the press Thursday, saying, “90% – verge of a deal. You call that optimistic, I call that accurate.”
Asked about Netanyahu’s comments, Kirby said, “I’m just not going to get into a public back and forth through all of you in the press with Prime Minister Netanyahu.”
“I will just say that this process has at times been cumbersome. We have faced setbacks and setbacks and more setbacks, and without question, we here in the administration are frustrated that we still haven’t been able to conclude this deal,” he said.
“There’s lots of reasons for that, but I’m not going to lie to you and say that that we haven’t been frustrated. Of course we have. We want to see the hostages home as soon as possible. But I would also say that as frustrating as it has been at times, and as unhelpful as – not just public comments, but even private machinations in the negotiation process – have been to closure of the deal, it has not dimmed one bit President Biden’s commitment to trying to see this through,” Kirby said.
Kirby also dismissed the idea that the administration was overly optimistic about the prospects of a deal, saying that “we do believe that we have made an immense amount of progress in the last few months in terms of getting the structure of the deal in place, but nothing is negotiated until everything is negotiated.”
The senior Biden administration official on Wednesday said that the majority of the details of the first phase of the agreement had been worked out. The remaining sticking points, they said, are related to the withdrawal of Israeli forces within Gaza away from populated areas and the exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners.
“Other than that, that’s about it,” the senior official said.
On the prisoner exchange, the official accused Hamas of adding new “non-starters” for the prisoners they want to see released.
“What Hamas has been demanding here, the Israelis have come forward to meet the terms as best they can,” the official said. “And Hamas, frankly, on this issue, we’ve had a pretty frustrating process.”
The official said Hamas’s recent killing of six hostages had “colored” the ongoing negotiations and thrown into question Hamas’s willingness to reach a deal.
On where Israel Defense Forces troops move to during the first phase of a deal, the agreement under discussion makes no mention of the length of the Egypt-Gaza border known as the Philadelphi Corridor, the official told reporters Wednesday. Instead, it says in the first phase that the IDF is supposed to withdraw from “densely populated areas,” the official said. Israel argues that the border isn’t one and is vital to preventing weapons from being smuggled into Gaza.
Netanyahu has held two news conferences this week to argue that maintaining permanent control of the Philadelphi Corridor is vital to Israeli security.
“The first war goal was to destroy Hamas’ military and governing capabilities. The second was to free our hostages, and the third was to ensure that Gaza never again poses a threat to Israel. And all three of those goals – all three of them – go through Israel’s control of the Philadelphi corridor,” Netanyahu said Wednesday at a news conference for foreign press.
That emphasis on Philadelphi in Netanyahu’s recent public statements hasn’t been constructive, the official said.
On Thursday, Netanyahu claimed Hamas “don’t agree to anything. Not to the Philadelphi Corridor, not to the keys of exchanging hostages for jailed terrorists, not to anything. So that’s just a false narrative.”
Hamas on Thursday said that Netanyahu has used “evasions and deceptive maneuvers” to avoid reaching an agreement on a ceasefire in Gaza.
The head of the organization’s negotiating team, Khalil Al-Hayya, said in a speech released on Telegram that the “series of evasions and deceptive maneuvers practiced by Netanyahu to evade the obligation to reach an agreement on a ceasefire is now fully exposed to the mediators, the American administration, global public opinion, and even the (Israeli) public.”
Netanyahu is facing mounting accusations that he has purposefully blocked a deal with Hamas. The Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth, citing a document it obtained, reported that Netanyahu in July effectively spiked a draft of a hostage and ceasefire deal by introducing a raft of new, eleventh-hour demands.
Several news outlets, including CNN, have reported on the late July demands made by Netanyahu, but this is the first time the Israeli document has been obtained in full.
In the Fox News interview, Netanyahu rejected allegations that he has obstructed a deal.
“The obstacle to the end of this war is Hamas. The obstacle to the release of hostages is Hamas. The ones who butchered in a sling, murdering six people in cold blood, riddling them with bullets and then firing bullets into their heads is Hamas. It’s not Israel. It’s not me.”
Netanyahu was also questioned about reports that the families of American hostages still held by Hamas are lobbying the US Administration to unilaterally seek their loved ones’ release.
“I don’t know,” he said. “You know, I don’t judge the families. They’re going through enormous anguish.”
In an interview with CNN’s Kaitlin Collins on Thursday evening, Israeli ambassador Danny Danon was asked why Netanyahu’s latest comments contrast with more optimistic pronouncements from the White House.
“We want to lower expectations,” he said.
“In May the US proposed a deal, we said yes, Hamas said no,” Danin said, adding the same happened in August, contradicting the reporting Yedioth Ahronoth and others.
Israel was continuing to send its intelligence head and other officials to negotiations, Danon argued, and he reiterated blame on Hamas for the lack of progress in talks. “Every time we get closer to reach an agreement Hamas will come up with another excuse why not to sign an agreement,” he said.
Meanwhile, a Biden administration official told CNN Thursday the US has made no offer to Hamas in an attempt the secure the release of American hostages held captive in Gaza, noting that the US does not have the leverage for a unilateral deal with the group.
“Because of Hamas’ demands, there has not been a formal offer for a side deal made because no such deal is possible,” the official said.

The child was arrested Sunday afternoon after admitting to killing Joe Cornelius Sr., 82, and Keisha Miles, 31, in Minden, Louisiana, earlier that day, Police Chief Jared McIver said during a news conference Tuesday.
Cornelius was a former longtime Minden city councilman and former interim mayor of Minden, the current mayor said.
“Joe Cornelius’ years of service to Minden were marked by his commitment and dedication to the betterment of our community,” Mayor Nick Cox said in a release posted to Facebook. “On a personal note, I am grateful for his friendship and the many ways he supported me and others in our city.”
The boy, who was described only as a relative of the victims, has been charged with two counts of first-degree murder and is being held on a $500,000 bond, McIver said. It is unclear if the child will be tried as an adult.
CNN is working to determine if the boy has legal representation.
Police found the victims in a home with gunshot wounds after a family member called 911, McIver said. Authorities found two weapons hidden on the property, and their calibers matched empty shell casings left at the scene, the chief said without elaborating. It is unknown how the child got hold of the weapons, McIver added.
The boy told responding officers “a story at first that just didn’t add up,” before he was taken to the police station by a guardian and eventually confessed to the crime, McIver said.
The chief added the motive behind the double slaying remains unknown.
“We are still piecing the puzzle pieces together right now, there is a lot of pieces to put together, a lot of evidence that has been collected,” McIver said. “Who knows why someone would do something this malicious, and at that age.”
McIver said everybody in the community knew “Mr. Joe,” adding “The city is in mourning.”
“That’s what hurts the most, when you know somebody that’s been in the community that long that’s reached so many people, there’s a sorrow.”
Cox again lauded Cornelius’ career at Tuesday’s news conference.
“Joe Cornelius was more than just a public servant. He was a committed leader who dedicated many years to the service of the city of Minden,” Cox said. “Joe’s efforts to improve Minden have left a lasting impact that will be remembered for years to come.”
Minden is about 30 miles east of Shreveport and has a population of just more than 12,600.

The source said that the writings were discovered in the bedroom of suspect Colt Gray, and included references to the 2018 massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida.
Live updates: The latest on the Georgia high school shooting
The discovery, which could shed more light on a motive for the shooting, comes amid an emerging portrait of Gray’s tumultuous family life in the years leading up to the deadly attack, revealed in a CNN review of court and law enforcement records, social media posts, and an interview with his grandfather.
As that portrait has emerged, so have details about the investigation and authorities’ pursuit of those they allege bear responsibility in the shooting. Gray told investigators, “I did it” while being questioned, Barrow County Sheriff Jud Smith told CNN on Thursday.
And while Gray faces four counts of felony murder, Gray’s father, Colin, also has been arrested in connection with the shooting, accused of “knowingly allowing his son … to possess a weapon,” Georgia Bureau of Investigation Director Chris Hosey said Thursday. Colin Gray was charged with four counts of involuntary manslaughter; two counts of second degree murder; and eight counts of cruelty to children, the GBI said.
As for Colt Gray’s family situation: His parents went through a bitter separation and custody dispute in recent years. They called law enforcement on each other, the family was evicted from at least one home, and Gray’s mother was arrested on suspicion of keying her husband’s car and drug possession, law enforcement records show.

At the same time, Gray’s mother and maternal grandfather have accused Gray’s father of being verbally abusive toward his family for years.
“He was just a good kid, but he lived in an environment that was hostile,” Charles Polhamus said of Colt Gray, his grandson, in an interview with CNN. “His dad beat up on him, I mean, I’m not talking about physical, but screaming and hollering, and he did the same thing to my daughter.”
The grandfather said he had never seen Colt Gray show any kind of anger problems, but that the turbulent family life had affected the teenager.
Now, investigators seeking to understand the suspect’s motive are looking into his family’s previous contacts with the state’s child protective services agency, the GBI director said Wednesday.
The suspect’s father told investigators this week he had purchased the gun used in the killings as a holiday present for his son in December 2023, according to two law enforcement sources with direct knowledge of the investigation. One source told CNN the AR-15-style rifle was purchased at a local gun store as a Christmas present. The other source described the gift as a holiday present.
Attempts to reach both of the suspect’s parents for comment on Wednesday and Thursday were unsuccessful. CNN was working to determine whether Colt Gray and Colin Gray have legal representation.
Colt Gray’s parents’ relationship started out with promise. In July 2011, shortly after he was born, his parents bought a small farm in Barrow County, Georgia, outside of the college town of Athens. They planned to “create a non-profit, therapeutic riding school for local, under-privileged children,” his mother, Marcee Gray, who worked in industrial engineering, later wrote in a LinkedIn post.
But those plans were derailed in part because her husband, Colin Gray, had at least three “major” back surgeries, she wrote. The couple, who had three children, later sold the farm in 2019, according to property records.
After they moved, the family faced lawsuits from multiple landlords, and were evicted from one home by a county sheriff’s deputy in July 2022 for failing to pay rent, according to court records. As part of the eviction, sheriff’s records show, deputies collected three firearms, including an AR-15, and at least one hunting bow, and kept them for safekeeping. The weapons were later “released to owner,” the documents say.
Later that year, Marcee Gray wrote on social media that she had left her husband.
“Finally separated from my abusive husband of almost 14yrs,” she wrote in one LinkedIn comment on a post from December 2022. “Hardest shit I’ve ever done but we’re in good hands.”
“I packed myself and my babies up and relocated to my hometown in south GA,” Gray added in another post in May 2023. “We are all good and my kids are thriving.”
The same month, however, law enforcement agents were investigating 13-year-old Colt Gray in connection with a school shooting threat. Investigators with the Jackson County Sheriff’s Office interviewed Colt and his father about a threat on the online chat platform Discord to commit a school shooting, documents obtained through a public records request show.
Colt Gray denied making the threat, an investigation report said. A Discord spokesperson told CNN on Wednesday that the platform removed an account “believed to be associated with” Gray in May 2023 for violating Discord’s policy against extremism.
Colin Gray told investigators he had hunting rifles in the house, and that “Colt is allowed to use them when supervised but does not have unfettered access to them,” the report said. The case was later cleared because the tip could not be substantiated.
Transcripts from the interview and a subsequent phone call show that Colin Gray said his son was “getting picked on at school,” with other students “pinching him and touching him… just ridiculed him day after day after day.” He also that that he was “trying to teach him about firearms and safety and how to do it all and get him… interested in the outdoors,” in part to get him away from video games.
“He knows the seriousness of weapons and what they can do and how to use them and not use them,” Colin Gray said.

In his interview, Colin Gray told investigators that he had separated from his wife, who took their two younger children with her. The suspect’s father said that Colt – the oldest of three siblings – had “had some problems” at a middle school in Jackson County but had since moved to another school and “it has gotten a lot better,” one of the investigators wrote.
Gray was only enrolled in the Jackson County school district between February and August 2022, said Edward Hooper, the spokesperson for the district. Jackson County is next to Barrow County, where Colt Gray is accused of killing two fellow students and two teachers at Apalachee High School.
In October 2023, Barrow County Sheriff’s deputies responded to a wellness check on the Gray family after Marcee Gray reported that she hadn’t heard from her husband or their children in two weeks. Colin Gray, who was at their residence, said all of their children were with him, a sheriff’s deputy wrote in a report.
Colin Gray gave the deputy a paper from the Georgia Division of Family and Children Services that showed “a safety plan was put in place for him to have the children with him” and Marcee Gray “could not see them without supervision,” the deputy wrote.
A spokesperson from the Georgia Department of Human Services said Thursday she could not comment on the case due to confidentiality laws. But Georgia Bureau of Investigation Director Chris Hosey said at a press conference Wednesday that the bureau was aware that the division had previously had “some previous contacts” with the Gray family, and “we are pursuing that avenue as well too to see if that has any connection with today’s incident.”
In November 2023, Colin Gray called law enforcement and accused his wife of keying a truck he drove for his work at a construction company, writing “abuse” and “liar” on it, according to a sheriff’s report.
Two days later, police arrested Marcee Gray at a Walmart in Winder due to an active warrant from another county. Police found methamphetamine, fentanyl, pain pills, and a glass pipe in her car, and she and another man who was in the vehicle were arrested, another sheriff’s report said.
After being arrested, Marcee Gray admitted keying her husband’s truck, saying she “lost it” after he refused to let her see her kids, the report said.

Marcee Gray pleaded guilty the following month to criminal damage to property, “criminal trespass - family violence,” and use of a license plate to conceal identity, and was sentenced to a total of five months’ probation after serving more than a month in custody. As part of her guilty plea, she was barred from contacting her husband except through a third party for divorce negotiations and custody discussions.
A friend of Marcee Gray, who asked not to be named for privacy, told CNN that the legal trouble she faced was “not the Marcee we know,” calling her a “sweet, caring, and smart woman” who had changed.
“Something happened in that relationship that went wrong,” the friend said.
According to Polhamus, Marcee Gray’s father, she lost custody of her children after failing a drug test, moved back in with her parents in south Georgia and is going through rehab.
Polhamus said he had never thought his grandson would be capable of such a deadly attack.
“I understand that Colt chose to do what he did, and I understand he has to pay for it,” he said. “But I’m telling you, the environment that he lived in… you put somebody in a situation like that for 10 or 11 years, guess what’s gonna happen? Nothing good.”
The Discord account that the FBI had linked to Colt Gray last year referenced plans for a future mass shooting and shared screenshots of firearms, according to documents obtained by CNN.
“im committing a mass shooting and im waiting a good 2-3 years,” stated the account user, according to screenshots included in an FBI incident report from May 2023 obtained by CNN. “I cant kill myself yet, cause I’m not contributing anything to culture I need to go out knowing I did.”
The account referenced Adam Lanza, the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooter, and in separate posts shared a desire to target an elementary school and expressed frustration that transgender people were being accepted in society.
Above a photograph of two firearms, the account posted, “I’m ready.”
The FBI tip was shared with the Jackson County Sheriff’s Office, which closed the investigation after finding that “the user behind the Discord account that made the threat cannot be substantiated.”
A Discord spokesperson told CNN on Wednesday the platform removed an account “believed to be associated with” Gray in May 2023 for violating Discord’s policy against extremism.

2WQ69P2LNU_QFNQHHN6LSC8AGF,Harris kicks off fall campaign blitz with Labor Day events in key states,"By Alison Main and Arit John, CNN","5 minute read Updated 8:19 PM EDT, Mon September 2, 2024",20240902,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/02/politics/2024-harris-trump-labor-day/,"Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign held a string of Labor Day-themed events in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania on Monday, marking the unofficial launch of the fall campaign sprint in the states that will determine the November election.
The events come as Harris seeks to extend her momentum over the next two months. While the Democratic presidential nominee has sought to expand the map of states where she is competitive, the Labor Day stops point to the importance of winning those three “blue wall” states that propelled President Joe Biden to victory in 2020.
Biden joined Harris for a rally in Pittsburgh on Monday evening, the president’s first joint campaign appearance with the vice president since ending his reelection bid and endorsing her.
“I’ll be on the sidelines, but I’ll do everything I can to help,” Biden said. “Are you ready to make Donald Trump a loser again?”
Harris used the Pennsylvania event to say that US Steel should be owned domestically and that she opposed the company’s purchase by the Japanese-owned Nippon Steel.
“The president mentioned it: US Steel is a historic American company, and it is vital for our nation to maintain strong American steel companies. And I couldn’t agree more with President Biden, US Steel should remain American owned and American operated,” Harris said to a crowd of union members.
In a statement, a Nippon Steel spokesperson defended the deal, arguing that “U. S. Steel and the entire American steel industry will be on much stronger footing” under the acquisition.
Harris’ remarks in Pennsylvania largely echoed an earlier event in Detroit, where she emphasized the “dignity of work” and vowed to strengthen protections for collective bargaining to a crowd of union members and leaders, while drawing sharp contrasts with opponent Donald Trump.
“We celebrate unions because unions helped build America, and unions helped build America’s middle class,” she told a packed high school gymnasium here in Michigan.
Harris was joined onstage by national union leaders, including United Auto Workers president Shawn Fain, American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten and National Education Association president Becky Pringle.
The vice president reiterated her support for the PRO Act, legislation that would ensure workers’ rights to unionize and collectively bargain for workplace changes, and vowed to “end union busting once and for all.”
Monday’s events come 64 days ahead of Election Day and, as Harris noted in her remarks, 24 days before mail-in absentee voting begins in Michigan and 14 days before it begins in Pennsylvania. The vice president echoed previous warnings that the race would be close to the end.
“I’m telling you we know how they play, we know what they do,” she said. “So let’s not pay too much attention to the polls. Let’s know, like labor always does, we are out here running like we are the underdog in this race because we know what we are fighting for.”
Meanwhile, her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, proudly boasted his ties to organized labor at a union event in Milwaukee, celebrating Labor Day by declaring himself in “the pocket” of unions and daring Republicans to “roll the damn dice” if they want to criticize his support for labor.
Walz detailed his union membership as a former public school teacher, his record of backing unions in Congress and as Minnesota’s governor, and highlighted Harris’ support for unions.
Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, had no scheduled events Monday. Trump used his social media site to bash Harris over high gas and grocery costs and tout his work renegotiating America’s trade deal with Mexico and Canada.
“We can’t keep living under this weak and failed ‘Leadership,’” Trump said on Truth Social.
The Harris campaign knocked the former president for not holding any events on the holiday.
“Donald Trump is ditching workers on Labor Day because he is an anti-worker, anti-union extremist who will sell out working families for his billionaire donors if he takes power,” campaign spokesperson Joseph Costello said in a statement.
Ahead of Harris’ Labor Day remarks in Detroit, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer praised the vice president’s record and bashed the Republican ticket as disconnected from the common man.
“Look, if your most famous line is ‘You’re fired,’ you sure as hell don’t understand workers,” Whitmer later said, referencing Trump’s catchphrase on his former reality show “The Apprentice.” “I want our next President to say to workers, whomever she might be, I’ve got your back.”
Whitmer said Harris has been part of “the most pro-labor administration in American history,” and praised Harris’ work as a senator and attorney general to stand with picketing workers and take on big banks and pharmaceutical companies, as well as Walz’s work to bring infrastructure investments to his state and raise minimum wage for delivery drivers.
Trump has been critical of labor leaders, including the United Auto Workers’ Fain, but has sought the support of workers in the same Rust Belt states Harris and Walz campaigned in Monday. The former president has focused his attention on the Biden administration’s efforts to boost the production and purchase of electric vehicles, which Trump has argued will come at the expense of autoworkers.
Michigan Trump allies railed against Harris on the issue of auto manufacturing ahead of the Democratic presidential nominee’s Labor Day visit to Detroit.
“What makes America great, part of it, is our economy, and the Harris administration is coming after autoworkers’ jobs,” Rep. Lisa McClain, a Michigan Republican, told reporters on a call Monday morning. “There will continue to be more layoffs.”
McClain, who represents the northern part of the metro Detroit area, as well as Republican Rep. John James, who represents a neighboring district, both argued that Biden-Harris administration policies meant to increase the producing of electric vehicles in the US are unrealistic.
The Harris campaign has pushed back on previous claims by Trump and Vance, including that the vice president supported a “mandate” for all electric vehicles. The administration’s goal is to have EVs comprise half of all new vehicle sales by 2030.

Residents said the death toll could be even higher, with villagers still missing and feared dead after fighters chased them into the bush.
The attack took place on Sunday afternoon in Yobe, one of three states at the frontline of an insurgency that has lasted 15 years. Thousands of Nigerians have been killed and more than 2 million displaced.
Yobe police spokesperson Dungus Abdulkarim said the attack in Yobe’s Mafa village was apparent retaliation for the killing of two suspected Boko Haram fighters by local vigilantes.

After shooting at the market and torching buildings, the militants chased other residents into the bush and shot them, Abdulkarim added.
“The terrorists killed many people, but we are yet to ascertain the actual number of casualties,” Abdulkarim said.
A military official who accompanied the army’s commanding officer for Yobe to Mafa on Monday evening said the route to the village had been rigged with explosives, which troops managed to defuse.
“We recovered 37 corpses and brought them to Babangida General Hospital,” said the official, who declined to be identified because he is not authorized to speak to the media.
Modu Mohammed, a resident, said several more residents were missing and estimated the death toll at over 100. He said some corpses were still in the bush."

This second plane, a Dassault Falcon 2000 registration number YV3360, is similar to the aircraft seized by authorities in the United States on Monday, and it appears on a US Treasury list of sanctioned goods belonging to Maduro.
Both planes were sent to Santo Domingo for maintenance in recent months, the source told CNN.
The plane seized by US authorities on Monday had been described by officials as Venezuela’s equivalent to Air Force One and was pictured in previous state visits by Maduro around the world.
It was seized after determining that its acquisition was in violation of US sanctions, among other criminal issues. The US flew the aircraft to Florida on Monday, according to two US officials.
US Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement that “the Justice Department seized an aircraft we allege was illegally purchased for $13 million through a shell company and smuggled out of the United States for use by Nicolás Maduro and his cronies.”
The Venezuelan government described the first Falcon’s seizure as “piracy” in a statement on Monday, and accused Washington of escalating “aggression” toward Maduro’s government following a contested presidential election this July.

The Dominican Republic’s President, Luis Abinader, said the plane seized Monday was not registered under the name of the Venezuelan government but rather under “the name of an individual.”
The country’s Attorney General’s Office received an order last May from a national court to “immobilize” the plane, according to the Dominican Republic’s foreign minister, Roberto Álvarez. The US had requested it be immobilized so they could search it for “evidence and objects linked to fraud activities, smuggling of goods for illicit activities and money laundering,” he said.
Monday’s seizure in the Dominican Republic marked an escalation as the US continues to investigate what it regards as corrupt practices by Venezuela’s government.
“This sends a message all the way up to the top,” one of the US officials told CNN. “Seizing the foreign head of state’s plane is unheard-of for criminal matters. We’re sending a clear message here that no one is above the law, no one is above the reach of US sanctions.”
It also comes as the US recently placed pressure on the Venezuelan government to “immediately” release specific data regarding its presidential election, citing concerns about the credibility of Maduro’s claimed victory in the recent presidential election.
Venezuela’s opposition has published more than 80% of tallies printed and collected from voting machines across the country. Though partial, the documentation appears to show that the opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia actually won the vote, several experts told CNN.

35ZJVJQULG_XAPT6T16OH88WL7,OPEC+ extends oil output cuts again through November,"By Krystal Hur, CNN","2 minute read Updated 4:16 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/05/investing/opec-extend-oil-output-cuts/,"The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies — the coalition of the world’s top oil producers known as OPEC+ — said Thursday that it is extending oil production cuts once again as crude and fuel prices continue to slump.
The countries making up the organization will extend their production cuts of 2.2 million barrels per day through November and plans to phase out those voluntary cuts beginning in December until November 2025, OPEC+ said in a Thursday release.
This isn’t the first time OPEC+ has extended output cuts in a bid to boost crude prices. The group in June lengthened the 2.2 million barrels per day cut through the end of September. That same month, OPEC+ extended a cut of 1.65 million barrels per day announced in April 2023 until the end of 2025.
Oil prices rose initially but settled slightly lower Thursday. West Texas Intermediate crude futures, the US benchmark, settled at $69.15 barrel. Brent crude futures, the international benchmark, settled at $72.69 a barrel.
Oil prices have declined this year despite continued output cuts and ongoing geopolitical tension in the Middle East. Concerns about waning demand in China, the world’s largest oil importer, have helped keep a lid on prices, as has record output from the United States. US oil fell below $70 a barrel Wednesday for the first time since December 12, 2023.
OPEC+ has restrained output for about two years in an effort to prevent a huge supply surplus that could weigh on prices and hurt the oil-dependent economies of its member states.
In June, the International Energy Agency said that a glut of oil supply could weaken the sway OPEC+ has over oil prices. Global oil supply could outstrip demand by a “staggering” 8 million barrels per day by 2023, according to forecasts published by the agency in its medium-term oil market report.
The agency said in July that it expects global oil demand to grow by 970,000 barrels per day in 2024, up slightly from its 960,000 barrels per day forecast the prior month. In May, the IEA had projected demand to grow by 1.1 million barrels per day.

39ZQGQC4K4_DXHCNGX3QPVGWGV,Michel Barnier named as new French prime minister,"By Dalal Mawad, Stephanie Halasz, Sophie Tanno and Emmanuel Miculita, CNN","4 minute read Updated 2:29 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/05/europe/france-prime-minister-michel-barnier-intl/,"Michel Barnier, the EU’s former chief Brexit negotiator, has become France’s new prime minister, the French president’s office says, ending two months of stalemate following inconclusive parliamentary elections.
In a statement on Thursday, the Élysée Palace said: “The President of the Republic has appointed Michel Barnier as Prime Minister. He has to form a united government to serve the country and the French people.”
The statement added that Barnier’s appointment comes after “an unprecedented cycle of consultations” in order to ensure a stable government.
Barnier, 73, a staunch Europhile, is a member of the Republicans party which represents the traditional right. He is best known on the international stage for his role in mediating the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union.
A 40-year veteran of French and European politics, Barnier has held various ministerial positions in France, including roles as foreign, agriculture and environment ministers. He served twice as a European commissioner as well as an adviser to President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen. In 2021, Barnier announced his bid for presidential elections but failed to garner enough support within his party.
Macron accepted the resignation of former Prime Minister Gabriel Attal and his government in July, after his centrist Ensemble alliance was defeated in the second round of France’s snap parliamentary election. The president has since faced calls from across the political divide to name a new PM. Last week, Macron told journalists during a trip to Serbia he was “making all the necessary efforts” to finalize a name.
“I will have the opportunity in a few days, in just a few weeks, to state the major legislative priorities and proposals on behalf of the new government before parliament. It will be a question of responding, as much as we can, to the challenges, to the anger, as you mentioned, to the suffering, to the feeling of abandonment, of injustice that runs through our cities, our neighborhoods and our countryside far too much,” Barnier said, speaking alongside Attal during the transfer of power at Hotel Matignon, the prime minister’s office in Paris.
Surrounded by his family, staff members and several lawmakers, Attal congratulated Barnier.
“The French know you. They know that you are a great local elected official,” said Attal, praising Barnier’s “almost unmatched experience of serving the state in various international and European functions.”
But he did not hide his frustration that his tenure came to such an abrupt end.
“Eight months is too short,” Attal said, warning that the country’s politics is suffering, “but recovery is possible.”
Barnier’s prospects for forming a stable government are unclear. Currently, France’s far-right National Rally (RN) is one of the largest parties in parliament following the election in early July. It has previously suggested it could be open to working with Barnier and would not immediately veto him.
Still, RN politician Laurent Jacobelli spoke disparagingly of Barnier, telling French television network TF1: “They are taking out of mothballs those who have governed France for 40 years.”
The leaders of France’s main far-right and far-left political parties reacted to the appointment of Barnier following Thursday’s announcement, with the far left condemning the decision.
Jordan Bardella, president of the far-right National Rally party, said on social media that his party will “judge” Barnier based on his inaugural “general policy speech, his budgetary decisions and his actions.”
Bardella’s party colleague Marine Le Pen also stressed in televised remarks that the party “will not participate in any government whatsoever” until after they have heard Barnier’s speech laying out his policy plans.
Le Pen did go on to commend Barnier on one level, describing the veteran politician as “someone who is respectful of the different political forces” and “capable” of addressing her party.
Meanwhile, Jean-Luc Melenchon of the far-left France Unbowed party delivered a stinging rebuke of President Macron, accusing him of “stealing” the parliamentary elections held in July.
“The president has just officially denied the results of the legislative elections that he himself had called for. He (Barnier) is a member, among others, of a party which was last in the legislative election. The election was therefore stolen from the French people,” Melenchon remarked in a televised speech.
The left-wing leader called on French people to protests against Barnier’s appointment from this Saturday.
Barnier served as the chief negotiator during the UK’s exit from the European Union. The lengthy talks between London and Brussels ran from 2016 to 2021 and he is known among Brexiteers in the UK for driving a hard bargain.
Born in January 1951 in a suburb of the Alpine city of Grenoble, Barnier was first elected to parliament at the age of 27."

Britain’s High Court in 2022 ruled mostly in favor of the US technology company, which accused Lynch and his former finance director of fraud over its $11 billion takeover of his software company Autonomy. Hewlett Packard is seeking up to $4 billion in damages and the judge is expected to issue a decision on the final sum soon.
Lynch’s widow, Angela Bacares, could now be liable for the damages. Lynch died when his yacht, the Bayesian, sank in a storm off Sicily on August 19.
Months before the sinking, Lynch was acquitted in a separate US criminal trial of fraud and conspiracy charges in the deal.
Hewlett Packard initially celebrated the costly acquisition of Lynch’s company in 2011 but quickly came to regret it. The company said in a statement Monday that it had “substantially succeeded” in its civil fraud claims against Lynch and Sushovan Hussain, the former finance director.

“It is HPE’s intention to follow the proceedings through to their conclusion.”
However, the judge in the UK civil case has already ruled that the amount payable in damages would be “substantially less” than the company is seeking.
A spokesperson for Lynch’s family declined to comment.
Lynch and his daughter Hannah were among six passengers who died when the 56-meter (184-foot) luxury yacht went down. One crew member, the boat’s chef, also died, while 15 people survived the disaster. They had gathered on the yacht to celebrate Lynch’s acquittal.
Officials initially said the yacht was struck by a tornado over the water, known as a waterspout, but the weather phenomenon was re-identified as a downburst. Prosecutors in Italy are investigating the captain on possible charges including manslaughter."
3F6EXW6L3U_NG5M9S3EDDQ743G,Leader of Afghanistan’s resistance movement says he will defeat the Taliban ‘no matter the odds’,"By Peter Bergen, CNN","14 minute read Published 2:00 AM EDT, Sun September 1, 2024",20240901,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/01/politics/ahmad-massoud-afghanistan-resistance-interview/,"Three years after the departure of the final US troops from Afghanistan, the situation in the country is bleak, with the Taliban tightening its grip as it introduces increasingly oppressive laws that restrict political freedoms and suppress the rights of women.
Most Afghans have had to acquiesce to the Taliban not because they embrace their misogynistic ideology but because they have all the guns. Still, there is a nascent resistance movement. I spoke to its leader, Ahmad Massoud, who said he’s engaged in “a fight for the soul and future of our nation, and we are determined to win, no matter the odds.”
He is the son of Ahmad Shah Massoud, who led the Afghan resistance to the Taliban more than two and half decades ago when the Taliban first seized power in Afghanistan in 1996.
Massoud is now 35, and he leads the National Resistance Front to the Taliban. In our interview, he asserted that his group has carried out 207 military operations around Afghanistan this year and that he has 5,000 soldiers under his control. Verifying this kind of information independently is nearly impossible as there are relatively few international journalists covering Afghanistan, while the Taliban have closed hundreds of Afghan media outlets. The UN put out a report in June that documented a surge of anti-Taliban attacks during the first six months of this year but put the number at 29 operations carried out by the National Resistance Front, while on the group’s X feed, there are claims of far more operations.
Massoud told me that “the Taliban’s true victory wasn’t on the battlefield; it was at the negotiating table,” a withdrawal agreement that was negotiated by then-President Donald Trump’s team and carried out by President Joe Biden.
Massoud lives in an undisclosed location in Central Asia directing military operations in Afghanistan from outside the country. We conducted our interview over email, and it has been edited for clarity.
BERGEN: The Taliban last week banned the sound of women’s voices outside of the home. This seems crazy, but the Taliban can do it with impunity. What does this say about their hold on power?
MASSOUD: This is a blatant display of ignorance and arrogance. The Taliban believe they can punish the people of Afghanistan, especially women, and yet they can also still gain international recognition. [Today, no government officially recognizes the Taliban, though several governments do have diplomatic relations with them.] This impunity is a direct result of the international community’s policy of appeasement of the Taliban over the past three years. If we hope to see a change in the Taliban’s behavior, we must alter our approach towards them. It’s that simple.
Within Afghanistan, our strategy for resistance is clear. The Taliban only respond to power and force. Diplomatic engagement with the Taliban has only emboldened them.
BERGEN: This is the third anniversary of the withdrawal of all US troops from Afghanistan. What are your feelings on this anniversary after two decades of a US military and diplomatic presence in Afghanistan? Was this a betrayal of America’s Afghan allies?
MASSOUD: The hasty US withdrawal in 2021 caused us to lose many achievements that we had gained in the last 20 years. Afghanistan had started experiencing social and political transformations that it never had before. We had rights like freedom of speech, and a new generation, both women and men, was on the rise. Yet we lost all of this when the agreement with the Taliban was signed in 2020 and when the withdrawal abruptly happened in 2021. Now we are the only country fully controlled by terrorists.
BERGEN: What kind of military operations are you carrying out in Afghanistan?
MASSOUD: The National Resistance Front’s military activities started in August 2021 when the Taliban attacked us in the Panjshir Valley [in northern Afghanistan]. Since then, we have been resisting them. We started from two provinces in the north, yet now we have networks and operations in almost 20 provinces after three years of expansion. [There are 34 provinces in Afghanistan.] Our operations at the moment are unconventional and mostly guerrilla operations. Yet, the military wing of the National Resistance Front is based inside Afghanistan, our bases, and our commando units are all in the country, and as every day passes, we are increasing our recruitment and operational capacity.
BERGEN: Can you give us a sense of the strengths of your National Resistance Front?
MASSOUD: The National Resistance Front’s military wing is solely made up of the remnants of Afghanistan’s former armed forces. These forces joined us instead of abandoning the fight for democracy on August 15, 2021 [when the Taliban captured Kabul, the capital]. Today, we have more than 5,000 permanent forces scattered in some 20 provinces. We have been able to increase their capabilities even though we aren’t receiving any external support. To give you a sense of our strength, since January 2024, we have launched 207 operations around the country.
BERGEN: Your soldiers claimed an attack at Kabul Airport last month. Can you describe what happened?
MASSOUD: Operational security prevents me from disclosing specifics, but I can assure you that this operation and many others demonstrate the significant military and intelligence capabilities we’ve developed since 2021. Despite the risks and complexities, our forces, supported by our deep intelligence network within the enemy’s ranks, executed the operation precisely.
Also, I would like to make something clear. All our targets are and will be military targets. We only target where the Taliban and other terror groups reside and avoid civilian casualties.
BERGEN: Tell us about how you became the leader of the anti-Taliban resistance, and are there other resistance groups you work with?
MASSOUD: I started my political efforts back in 2018 by consulting Afghanistan’s people. I went to the furthest villages and valleys of Afghanistan, engaging directly with my people to formulate a strategic response to the imminent US-Taliban deal and withdrawal. On September 5, 2019, I received a clear mandate from our citizens, gathered at my father’s mausoleum, to lead a solution to this coming crisis.  The critical moment arrived on August 15, 2021, when my people and some of the former armed forces of Afghanistan established the National Resistance Front of Afghanistan, entrusting me with its leadership. This was not a choice but a call to duty that I answered without any hesitation.
BERGEN: You attended Sandhurst, the British equivalent of West Point, and studied in the War Studies department of Kings College, London. Was that helpful training for what you are doing now?
MASSOUD: My training at Sandhurst and education at King’s College provided me with a solid foundation. However, the burden of real-world conflict has been my true academy. The lessons I’ve learned leading our resistance these past few years far surpass any classroom instruction.
BERGEN: You won’t recall this, but I met you when you were only around 4 years old when CNN was interviewing your father, Ahmad Shah Massoud, in the Panjshir Valley in Afghanistan in 1993 during the Afghan civil war. I was very impressed by your father, his extraordinary charisma and his intelligence.
It must have been very difficult for you, aged 11 when he was assassinated by al Qaeda assassins two days before 9/11. How has your father’s assassination affected what you are doing today?
MASSOUD: The video of our first encounter, when you met my father during that CNN interview in the Panjshir Valley in 1993, is indeed part of our historical record. While I wish I had been older to fully grasp the gravity of those moments and learn more directly from my father, his legacy has become the cornerstone of my mission. My father’s assassination by al Qaeda, just days before 9/11, was a moment that shaped not just my family but the course of our nation. As I’ve detailed in my memoir “In the Name of My Father,” the impact was profound. However, it also ignited an unshakeable determination within me. At that moment, I vowed to continue his vision for a free and peaceful Afghanistan. His sacrifice wasn’t in vain – it’s the foundation upon which we’re building Afghanistan’s future. [Disclosure: I wrote the foreword to Massoud’s memoir, which I do not benefit from financially in any manner.]
BERGEN: When the Americans left Afghanistan three years ago, they left behind $8.5 billion dollars worth of military equipment, according to an estimate by the UN. That’s more than the defense budget of some European nations. Does this make your task of resisting the Taliban more difficult?
MASSOUD: The $8.5 billion worth of military equipment abandoned by the Americans has of course altered the battlefield dynamics, but it hasn’t dampened our determination and commitment. Yes, the Taliban are now better armed than ever before. However, military history is full of examples where determination and strategy overcame material advantages. The Taliban may have the weapons, but we have the will of the people – and history shows that’s a far more powerful force.
What’s more concerning is the Taliban’s transformation of Afghanistan into a black market for these weapons. We know that they are not just arming themselves; they’re fueling global terror networks. This isn’t just about our resistance; it’s about preventing Afghanistan from becoming a nexus of international terrorism.
BERGEN: When your father, Ahmad Shah Massoud, was fighting the Taliban before 9/11, he controlled some territory inside Afghanistan and could be resupplied from neighboring Tajikistan. You are not in Afghanistan, and it’s hard for you to supply your forces inside Afghanistan as you control no territory in Afghanistan. You do have a political office in Tajikistan, but no other countries support you; how does this lack of support affect your ability to fight the Taliban?
MASSOUD: Our current position differs strategically from my father’s era, but our determination remains unshaken. Since 2021, we’ve not only survived but expanded our influence, despite minimal external support. It is important to emphasize that we are not just fighting the Taliban; we’re engaged in a broader conflict against a coalition of regional and global terror groups. When al Qaeda and the Pakistani Taliban supply fighters to the Taliban, it’s clear that our struggle is an extension of the global war on terror.
However, let me be clear: to defeat these 20 terrorist organizations in Afghanistan threatening global security, we require international backing. It’s unrealistic to expect us to single-handedly neutralize this threat without resources. Our fight isn’t just for Afghanistan; it’s for global security. Any nation that perceives terrorism as a threat must recognize the strategic necessity of supporting our cause and efforts.
BERGEN: What support do you need?
MASSOUD: We need any kind of support that will allow us to defeat this group. We believe we have capable forces who were trained for 20 years to pursue counterterrorism. For this reason, we are asking for resources instead of foreign forces to liberate our country.
BERGEN: What do you say to those who say your resistance movement doesn’t have much of a chance against the well-armed Taliban and without financial and military support from other countries?
MASSOUD: Those who underestimate our resistance fail to grasp the lessons of Afghanistan’s history. Despite our current lack of external support, we’ve consistently grown in strength and numbers. The Taliban may control territory and possess billions in arms, but they lack the most crucial asset – the support of the people of Afghanistan. Our history proves that popular legitimacy, not weaponry, determines ultimate victory. Even the communist regime [which controlled Afghanistan from 1979 to 1992], which was far stronger than today’s Taliban, fell due to lack of popular support. Our resistance is expanding because we represent and embody the will of the people.
BERGEN: Will the Taliban still be in charge in Afghanistan a decade from now? If not, why not?
MASSOUD: The Taliban’s grip on Afghanistan is already slipping. Their lack of discipline, competence, legitimacy, and internal disunity makes their long-term rule ineffective. We don’t just hope for their downfall – we’re working to ensure it.
In Vienna, Austria, this year we initiated a political process, uniting Afghanistan’s diverse political and civil groups. This isn’t only opposition – it’s the foundation of a democratic alternative for Afghanistan’s future. We’re not waiting for the Taliban to fail; we’re building the system that will replace them.
The fractures within the Taliban are widening. Their implosion is not a matter of if, but when. When that moment comes – and it will come sooner than many expect – we’ll be ready. The democratic government we’re preparing will fill the void, representing all citizens and bringing stability to our nation.
A decade from now, Afghanistan won’t just be free of Taliban rule – it will be on the path to becoming a beacon of democracy in the region. That’s not wishful thinking – it’s our objective.
BERGEN: Has the Taliban created an “inclusive” government as they promised?
MASSOUD: The Taliban’s promise of an inclusive government has proven to be nothing but propaganda. The fundamentally reject the core democratic principle that political legitimacy stems from the will of the people and free elections. Their current power structure is a sham, with various factions of their terrorist organization vying for control and systematically marginalizing each other.
The very notion that this group could create an inclusive government is absurd when they can’t even maintain unity within their own ranks. Their internal power struggles and ideological inflexibility make any form of genuine inclusivity impossible. They’ve demonstrated time and again that their only interest is in consolidating power for their extremist vision.
BERGEN: Flawed presidential elections produced flawed Afghan governments. How culpable were Afghanistan’s leaders like President Ashraf Ghani for what transpired in Afghanistan?
MASSOUD: The government of Afghanistan was corrupt and flawed. The flaws in Afghanistan’s previous governments were systemic and deep-rooted. I consistently opposed these administrations precisely because of their corruption and ineffectiveness.
The root of the problem lies in the political system adopted after 2004, which was fundamentally unsuited to Afghanistan’s diverse demographic reality. Afghanistan is a highly diverse country without an ethnic majority. Its constitution concentrated excessive power in Kabul, essentially creating a presidential monarchy. This centralization was a primary factor in the government’s weakness and the marginalization of numerous communities.
The situation worsened dramatically during Ashraf Ghani’s presidency. His further centralization of power, limiting decision-making to only himself and a small circle of advisors, exacerbated the alienation of large segments of our population.
Recognizing this flaw, I advocated for the decentralization of power in a 2020 New York Times article. I firmly believe that Afghanistan’s path to peace and stability lies in the distribution of power. It is a strategic requirement for building a stable, resilient nation that can withstand internal divisions and external threats.
BERGEN: In all the discussions about the mistakes made in Afghanistan, sometimes it’s easy to lose sight of what went right. In addition to the rise of independent media and the provision of education to girls and jobs for women, what else worked? Programs like the National Solidarity Programme, which offered small grants for public works to local communities in consultation with those communities?
MASSOUD: Yes, despite challenges and setbacks in Afghanistan, it’s important to acknowledge the significant progress made during the two decades after 9/11. The rise of independent media was a cornerstone of this progress, giving voice to diverse perspectives and creating a more informed population. The expansion of education for girls and employment opportunities for women were transformative. Programs like the National Solidarity Programme were particularly effective.
BERGEN: What was the effect of the Trump administration’s 2020 Doha peace agreement with the Taliban and President Joe Biden announcing in April 2021 that he was going to go through with the total US withdrawal?
MASSOUD: The Trump administration’s 2020 Doha deal with the Taliban and President Biden’s later announcement of a total US withdrawal in April 2021 had detrimental effects on Afghanistan’s stability. These decisions legitimized the Taliban on the international stage while signaling the end of substantial Western support for the government of Afghanistan at the same time.
The Doha agreement, in particular, undermined the morale of our security forces and government officials. It created a sense of certainty about the Taliban’s return to power. Biden’s withdrawal announcement made it worse. It triggered a rapid loss of confidence in the government’s ability to stand independently. These policy decisions, which sought to end America’s longest war, sacrificed the hard-won progress of two decades and betrayed the trust of millions of our people.
BERGEN: Did the Taliban win at the negotiating table with the United States, what they couldn’t win on the battlefield from them?
MASSOUD: The Taliban’s true victory wasn’t on the battlefield; it was at the negotiating table.  Prior to the negotiations, their territorial control was limited. The negotiation process itself became their launch pad to power. This diplomatic engagement legitimized a terrorist group. It turned them from insurgents to political actors. Had the US simply withdrawn without these negotiations, the Taliban wouldn’t be in power today.
The consequences were devastating – it demoralized Afghanistan’s armed forces, normalized relations with terrorists, facilitated the release of thousands of extremists from our prisons, and paved the way for the fall of our government.
This colossal mistake handed the Taliban a victory they couldn’t achieve through force of arms.
BERGEN: This year, you published a book, “In the Name of My Father: Struggling For Freedom In Afghanistan.” What was the main message of the book?
MASSOUD: My book is more than a memoir – it’s a manifesto for Afghanistan’s future and a testament to our ongoing struggle. I lay out my convictions on democracy, women’s rights and the role of Islam in our society. These are the foundational principles upon which we’re building our resistance.
BERGEN: What is your vision of the future? The Taliban control more of the country than they did before 9/11. They’re better armed. They’ve been fighting for 20 years. So, what’s the end goal here for you?
MASSOUD: Let me be very clear about our vision and end goal. We are fighting for a democratic, decentralized and pluralistic Afghanistan where every citizen, regardless of gender, ethnicity or religious belief, enjoys equal rights. This is our non-negotiable objective.
Yes, the Taliban currently control more territory and are better armed than before 9/11. But control of land and possession of weapons does not mean legitimate governance or popular support.
We’re not just resisting the Taliban; we’re building the foundation for a new Afghanistan. We’re creating a system that’s resilient against extremism and responsive to the diverse needs of all our citizens.
Make no mistake – we are prepared for a long struggle. This isn’t just a fight against the Taliban; it’s a fight for the soul and future of our nation, and we are determined to win, no matter the odds."
3GGFE0TQEP_5BE4RXYMZ00XMBX,America’s massive hotel strike just got even bigger,"By Gloria Pazmino and Chris Isidore, CNN","3 minute read Updated 8:26 AM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240902,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/02/business/hotel-strike/,"Baltimore hotel workers are joining a massive nationwide strike against three major hotel chains during one of the biggest travel holidays of the year.
Unite Here, the union representing hotel workers, said approximately 200 hotel workers walked off the job in Baltimore at the Hilton Inner Harbor this morning.
Hotel union workers are now on strike at hotels across 9 US cities. As many as 10,200 hotel workers at 25 hotels stretching from Boston to the West Coast to Hawaii went on strike starting early Sunday morning. But, as planned, 840 went back to work Tuesday.
“I walked out today because we just cannot keep working paycheck to paycheck, not able to pay our bills,” Jerome Roberts, a dishwasher at the Hilton Baltimore Inner Harbor said in a statement. “Going on strike is hard, but not nearly as hard as trying to get by on what we are getting paid. We told the bosses in our negotiations how much we are struggling right now but they didn’t care. We are on strike to make them pay.”
Workers say they want higher pay, better conditions and more staff to help. The union is asking for a restoration of many of the pandemic-era cuts that hotels made, including daily room cleaning. The union says the travel and hotel industries have recovered from the pandemic but worker salaries have not reflected the comeback.
The hotels are reportedly still open but guests are contending with a skeleton staff unable to provide full services.
“We’re on strike because the hotel industry has gotten off track,” Gwen Mills, International President of Unite Here, said in a statement Sunday morning. “During Covid, everyone suffered, but now the hotel industry is making record profits while workers and guests are left behind. Too many hotels still haven’t restored standard services that guests deserve. Workers aren’t making enough to support their families. Many can no longer afford to live in the cities that they welcome guests to.”
The hotel chains facing striking workers include Hilton, Hyatt and Marriott. The hotels have 23,776 rooms between them in the cities of Baltimore, Boston, San Diego, San Francisco, San Jose, Seattle, as well as Honolulu and Kauai in Hawaii, and Greenwich, Connecticut, according to the union.
The union is threatening to possibly expand the strike to as many as 65 hotels in 12 different cities, possibly adding hotels in Oakland, California, as well as Providence, Rhode Island, and New Haven, Connecticut. Spokespeople for Hilton and Hyatt told CNN on Friday they are committed to reaching deals with the union, but they also will continue to serve customers during any work stoppage.
Hyatt said in a statement it is disappointed by the union’s decision to strike. “We look forward to continuing to negotiate fair contracts and recognize the contributions of Hyatt employees,” said Michael D’Angelo, head of labor relations at Hyatt.
Last year, the 15,000 members of the same union went on strike during the Fourth of July holiday weekend at 65 hotels in Los Angeles and Orange counties in Southern California. They returned to work a few days later but staged a series of rolling strikes in the months that followed, sometimes tied to major tourist periods, such as the weekend of Taylor Swift concerts in Los Angeles.
These strikes are set to end after three days."
3I0FERM4X0_DNXWTJ15OE1WN5W,Cathay Pacific inspects entire A350 fleet after finding engine problems,"By Chris Lau and Juliana Liu, CNN","4 minute read Updated 3:42 AM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240903,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/02/business/hong-kong-cathay-pacific-a350-hnk-intl/,"Hong Kong’s flag carrier Cathay Pacific has canceled dozens of flights as it conducts an inspection of its entire Airbus A350 fleet after finding engine problems affecting the plane.
The airline, one of the world’s largest users of the long-haul jet, said it identified an engine component failure on flight CX383 from Hong Kong to Zurich on Monday. The plane later returned to Hong Kong.
“This component was the first of its type to suffer such failure on any A350 aircraft worldwide,” Cathay said in a statement sent to CNN. A thorough inspection of its 48-plane fleet revealed “a number of the same engine components that need to be replaced,” it added. It did not detail the nature of the engine issue.
By Tuesday afternoon, the company said it had identified 15 aircraft with affected engine parts that require replacement. Three had been fixed, it said, adding that all affected aircraft will resume operations by Saturday.
Cathay had earlier canceled 24 flights operating over Monday and Tuesday amid inspection and repair work. The carrier is expected to cancel 10 regional return flights on Wednesday, but long-haul services should not be affected, it said.
According to Reuters, which cited an unnamed source, the incident involved a problem with a fuel nozzle, a component that directs fuel inside the engine. CNN has reached out to Cathay for additional comment.
The issue affecting the A350 has emerged after rival Boeing (BA) suffered a number of serious and high-profile problems. The American plane maker has spent months embroiled in a safety crisis since the mid-air blowout of one of its door plugs on a 737 Max flight operated by Alaska Airlines earlier this year.
Cathay said it had contacted the aircraft manufacturer about the engine problem, as well as the engine maker, Rolls-Royce, and regulators. According to Airbus, the A350 family uses two Trent XWB turbofan engine models from Rolls-Royce. An Airbus spokesperson referred questions to Rolls-Royce.
The British aerospace company confirmed in a statement that flight CX383 was “powered by Trent XWB-97 engines,” adding it was “committed to working closely with the airline, aircraft manufacturer and the relevant authorities to support their investigation into this incident.” Its London-traded shares closed more than 6% lower on Monday.
Shukor Yusof, founder of Endau Analytics, a firm that tracks the aviation industry, said the A350 was “very safe,” but the problem appeared to be arising out of logistical delays involving components, parts and other engine materials.
“Other airlines are affected, too, albeit on different scales, but the problem isn’t going away anytime soon due to manpower shortages, among other things,” he added.
Air traffic tracking website Flightradar24 showed that CX383, normally a 13-hour flight, took off from Hong Kong International Airport on Monday at 4:24pm local time. The engine issue appears to have been spotted quickly.

Instead of going north, the A350-1000 flew south and made circles near Hong Kong before diverting back to the city. It landed safely about 75 minutes later.
The Trent engine in question was harshly criticized by Tim Clark, president of Emirates, at the Dubai Airshow in November, according to Reuters.
At the time, Clark reportedly dismissed a possible deal to buy A350-1000 jets, the larger of two models offered by Airbus, blaming a dispute with Rolls-Royce over the poorer-than-expected durability of its engines and pressure for higher servicing prices.
Rolls-Royce later said it was working on improving the Trent XWB-97 engines and denied that it was defective, according to Reuters. Months later, in August, engine problems — among other challenges — hit Boeing.
An issue affecting the plane maker’s long-delayed 777X aircraft dealt yet another blow to its reputation for quality. Boeing said it had paused testing after discovering problems in a structural component between the engine and the plane’s wings in a test flight.
Boeing said in a statement that it had identified a component that did not perform as designed and that it was replacing the part.
The 777X, billed by Boeing as the “world’s largest and most efficient twin-engine jet,” was supposed to enter service four years ago. It had been expected to have delivered several hundred of the planes by now. But it has been plagued by delays and cost overruns. It now has a revised launch date of 2025.

3LVA2ABG74_ZMPMEIM6E8EDGWZ,DC’s streets are flooded with illegal firearms. Officials are suing three gun shops they say are a big part of the problem,"By Gabe Cohen, CNN","3 minute read Updated 9:40 PM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240903,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/03/politics/washington-dc-guns/,"Attorneys general in Washington, DC, and Maryland are suing three firearms dealers in Maryland, accusing the stores of knowingly selling dozens of guns to straw purchasers who illegally re-sold the weapons to criminals in DC and its surrounding Maryland suburbs.
In one case, the three stores located in Montgomery County — Engage Armament, United Gun Shop and Atlantic Guns — sold 34 guns in a six-month period to a Maryland resident named Demetrius Minor who then transferred the firearms to a convicted felon with a lengthy criminal history, according to the lawsuit. Minor was convicted for the purchases, the lawsuit states.
Nine of those guns have been recovered at crime scenes in the DC area. The rest, officials say, are most likely still on the street.
“There was no plausible lawful explanation for Mr. Minor’s excessive handgun purchases over such a short period,” the civil lawsuit reads. “He was obviously engaged in illegal straw purchasing—but the Defendants did not care. They kept taking his money and selling him more guns, putting the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area at risk.”
A representative of Atlantic Guns, Inc. told CNN in an email that “Atlantic Guns, Inc. has never and will never knowingly sell to someone who we have reason to believe is committing a straw purchase. Until we have received and reviewed the complaint, we are unable to comment further.”
CNN has reached out to Engage Armament and United Gun Shop for comment.
In 2023, violent crime exploded in DC, surging 40%. Since then, the numbers have declined but are still hovering above pre-pandemic levels.
Gun recoveries in DC have more than doubled over the past decade and are hitting record highs, and 95% of those illegal firearms come from outside the District, according to DC Attorney General Brian Schwalb.
“We need to get to the source,” Schwalb said at a news conference Tuesday. “We need to get to the suppliers. We need to stop guns from getting into the district in the first place. We can’t keep asking the back end to deal with gun violence when it’s people at the front end, the distributors who in pursuit of profits, are driving violence.”
The lawsuit will seek financial damages from the three gun stores. But beyond monetary penalties, officials say they’re hoping the lawsuit will disrupt the practice of selling guns to straw purchasers.
A report from Maryland’s attorney general’s office identified these three gun shops as the top three retailers of crime guns between August 2020 and July 2021, according to Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown.
“Many of us have watched the news, and we wonder, where are all these guns coming from? Well, today, we have part of the answer, and we’re taking serious action,” Brown said.

Rhanni S. Davis, 30, was charged Tuesday with four counts of first-degree murder, the Forest Park Police Department said in a news release.
He appeared in a Maywood court Wednesday wearing a tan Cook County jumpsuit with shackles around his hands and ankles.
Prosecutors told the court evidence will show Davis shot one victim twice in the head and back, shot a second person in the side of the face and the arm and then shot a third victim in the back of the head. Davis moved to the next train car and approached the fourth victim from behind. The victim raised his hands in a defensive posture before Davis fired, prosecutors said.
Prosecutors told the court Davis has a history of criminal activity, including a disorderly conduct offense in 2020, and two other prior arrests that were both dismissed. Davis’ attorney, Robert Fox, told the court he had a Firearm Owner’s Identification card, training in security and home health care, and no prior convictions. Davis recently worked at a local Taco Bell, the attorney added.
Cook County Circuit Court Judge Elizabeth Ciaccia-Lezza said the facts alleged by the state were “absolutely horrific and appalling.”
“This defendant defines violent,” Ciaccia-Lezza said. “The public would not be safe with any amount of movement by this defendant.”
Davis is due back in court on September 27.
The court hearing came two days after the mass shooting early Monday morning targeted four people who appeared to be sleeping on the train. Davis was detained about 90 minutes after the shooting was reported around 5:30 a.m. on the Blue Line train heading to the Forest Park suburb west of downtown.
The attack raised further concerns about the safety of public transit systems in American cities like Chicago and New York. Ridership levels plunged during the Covid pandemic and have had a muted recovery since, in part due to perceptions of disorder and crime.
Still, police emphasized Tuesday they believe this was an isolated and random attack. There is no identified motive at this time, Forest Park Police Department Det. Lt. Dan Pater said during the news conference.
“Allegedly, this man came onto a train while people were sleeping … and pumped bullets into their bodies,” Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx said Tuesday. “We want answers. Right now, we don’t have an answer as to why anyone would engage in such a heinous, heinous act. But as it stands … we have enough for the purposes of charging first-degree murder.”
The early morning shooting happened in two train cars, where three victims were shot in one car and the fourth in another, with a total of six rounds, police said.
Surveillance video was instrumental in identifying the suspect, police said.
Forest Park police released two surveillance videos Wednesday showing Davis casually walking in a train station.
The first video, from 5:04 a.m. CT Monday, shows a Blue Line train arriving at the Harlem station when a man in a gray outfit jumps out of the moving train, falls onto the platform, and then gets up and hustles away. After the train comes to a full stop, a person wearing a black shirt, black ski mask and black backpack then walks in the same direction.
The second video, taken at about 5:06 a.m. CT, shows the same man in the ski mask casually walking out of a train station.
Three of the victims were identified as 60-year-old Adrian Collins, 28-year-old Simeon Bihesi and 64-year-old Margaret A. Miller, the Cook County Medical Examiner’s office told CNN on Tuesday. The other victim was a man in his 50s, but no additional identifying information was available as police said they are still trying to reach the man’s family.
Police recovered a Glock 43 9mm pistol they confirmed Tuesday was the weapon used in the shooting.
CTA’s Blue Line spans 27 miles between O’Hare International Airport and Forest Park, passing through or near dozens of neighborhoods and downtown Chicago. Service on the line resumed Monday evening.

The victims may have been homeless, Forest Park Deputy Chief Chris Chin told CNN Monday, but Pater indicated Tuesday they “don’t have any information that proves or disproves otherwise.”
“Although this was an isolated incident, this heinous and egregious act of violence should never have occurred, nonetheless on a public transit train,” the transit authority said in a statement.
“This obviously is shocking, you know, it is uncommon to have a mass shooting like this,” said Chin. “This is an isolated incident, so it can happen anywhere. Obviously, there’s a little bit more concern because it is on a mass transit system,” he added. “For people to feel unsafe, it’s justified.”
CNN and the Gun Violence Archive define a mass shooting as a shooting that injured or killed four or more people, not including the shooter.
Forest Park Mayor Rory Hoskins said the shooting is an “outlier” for the city.
Hours after the shooting, another passenger was seriously injured in a stabbing on the Red Line, Chicago police said in a statement. The incident began as a verbal altercation between a 37-year-old victim and an unknown man, who at some point took out a “sharp object” and repeatedly stabbed the victim, police said.
“The victim fled from the train at the Wilson Red Line station, and relocated, on foot, to the 4700 block of N. Broadway. The victim was then transported to Illinois Masonic Hospital initially listed in critical condition,” police told CNN.
A suspect in the stabbing has yet to be found and detectives are investigating.

3PSTA214Q5_1T6FH1D3FIWWCE3,Evidence in January 6 case against Trump could be released before election under new schedule,"By Katelyn Polantz and Tierney Sneed, CNN","3 minute read Updated 5:43 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/05/politics/january-6-case-evidence-release/,"Judge Tanya Chutkan has set a schedule in the federal election subversion case against former President Donald Trump that will allow prosecutors to release never-before-seen evidence, such as grand jury transcripts, ahead of the presidential election.
The deadline for the filing from prosecutors is September 26, according to the latest order from the judge, which largely sides with special counsel Jack Smith’s proposed schedule discussed at Thursday’s hearing. Trump’s defense team had sought to delay the public release of evidence in the case until after the November election.
The evidence the prosecutors reveal in late September may not be immediately public, and Chutkan will be able to control its release. It is likely it would become available, though, with potentially some redactions.
This is the one of several filings the judge expects before voters head to the polls. She has not scheduled additional hearings or a trial date.
Chutkan’s scheduling order would allow for her to resolve the immunity issues on a much quicker timeline than the former president proposed, with a deadline for the final round briefs on the immunity matter set for October 29. There is no hearing scheduled on the immunity question in her new order, but she could request oral arguments on the matter later on.
Related article Takeaways from Donald Trump’s election interference court hearing
At a hearing focused on scheduling Thursday morning, there was also acknowledgement among the parties and the judge that the scope of Trump’s immunity in the newly revised election subversion case would likely be appealed.
Beyond just the immunity issue, Chutkan’s new order sets deadlines for a number of substantive filings to be submitted before the election. She has set a timeline for Trump’s challenge to the indictment on statutory grounds to be briefed in October. She has also requested that Trump file his challenge to the legality of Smith’s appointment and for the special counsel to respond in late October, with the final brief from Trump on that issue due on November 7, two days after the election.
At Thursday’s scheduling hearing, Chutkan made clear she would not take into account the presidential campaign in crafting the next steps in the case. She rebuffed the defense team’s concerns about the government getting to decide what evidence is aired on the public court record during a “sensitive time” close to the election.
A key disagreement between Trump and the special counsel was which side should file the initial brief on whether the superseding indictment handed up last week comports with the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling.
Smith’s team said Thursday that they wanted to file an initial brief that would include “substantial exhibits” that would lay out for the judge the context, form and content of relevant evidence in the case – including evidence not in the indictment.
Trump’s lawyers meanwhile were also pushing idea that Chutkan should decide first whether the allegations specific to former Vice President Mike Pence are immunized, with the defense claiming that if they are covered by immunity, the whole case should be dismissed.
Chutkan on Thursday additionally expressed her skepticism to a Trump plan to challenge the indictment on the grounds that Smith was illegally appointed, even as she allowed his team the opportunity to do so.

During an episode of the “Happy Sad Confused” podcast, Ryder revealed that she and her former costar still text regularly and “we always say who it is, even though it says it on the text.”
“So like on his birthday I go, ‘Happy birthday, my husband’ and then he’s like, ‘Hey, my wife, I love you KR 57,’” Ryder said. “Like on each birthday he’s like KR 57 or whatever his age is. He’s always done that.”
The pair costarred in the 1992 Francis Ford Coppola directed drama “Bram Stoker’s Dracula” in which their characters had a wedding scene.
In a 2018 interview to promote their rom-com “Destination Wedding,”  Ryder said she believed she and Reeves had actually wed.
“In that scene, Francis [Ford Coppola] used a real Romanian priest,” she explained. “We shot the master and he did the whole thing. So I think we’re married.”
Three years later, Reeves talked about it during a video he shot for Esquire.
“We did a whole take of a marriage ceremony with real priests,” he said. “Winona says we are [married]. Coppola says we are. So I guess we’re married… under the eyes of God.”
During the recent podcast, Ryder raved about working with Reeves. However, the “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice” star demurred on possibly doing a “John Wick” action film because “involves a lot of stunt” and she’s “thinking of my bones.”
“I would literally do anything though with him,” she said about costarring with Reeves. “He is so special.”"

While speaking in his official capacity at an event at the Royal United Services Institute in the United Kingdom, Del Toro said, “The United Sates and the world need the mature leadership of President Biden,” according to OSC. Del Toro went on to say, “We cannot afford to have a president who aligns himself with autocratic dictators and rules whose interpretation of democratic principles is suspicious [at] best.”
The Hatch Act is a federal law that prohibits federal employees from engaging in political activity while on duty or acting in an official capacity.
In a subsequent television interview with the BBC, Del Toro said he had a “strong conviction” that Biden “has provided the mature leadership, both in the United States and stabilizing our economy, which was faced by many challenges early as he took office.”
Del Toro then went on to question whether former President Donald Trump “abided by the core values of our country, protecting the freedoms of Americans and other people around the globe and protecting democracy itself. And when you have someone who doesn’t align to those core principles, it makes you wonder, you know, should you be supporting that individual?”
In a letter addressed to the president, Special Counsel Hampton Dellinger wrote that Del Toro “impermissibly asserted his personal political campaign views during official agency business.”
But in a response to OSC, a lawyer for Del Toro argued that the secretary’s comments were “spontaneous and unpremeditated” with a limited American audience and therefore did not violate the Hatch Act.
The Office of the Special Counsel is an independent organization within the federal government whose job is in part to enforce the Hatch Act and investigate alleged violations.
CNN has reached out to the Navy and the Office of the Secretary of the Navy for comment.
Since the beginning of the Biden administration, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has made it clear how important it is to keep the military outside of politics. In one of his earliest news conferences, Austin said, “It’s really important to me that this department remain apolitical. We’re going to do everything within our power to make sure that our troops, our leadership - both civilian and military - remain focused on the task at hand and understand that they are not a part of the political apparatus there.”
Asked about the OSC findings, deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh stressed the importance keeping the military outside of politics. At a news briefing on Thursday, Singh said it’s important to “maintain the trust and confidence of the American people, which requires us to avoid any action that could imply the support of any political party, candidate or campaign.”"

3XGAEJKYHL_ZY03HOSBCFK2RRT,Hamas’ brutal new tactics signal new phase in war and hostage crisis,"By Christian Edwards, CNN","7 minute read Updated 9:06 AM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240903,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/03/middleeast/hamas-israel-hostage-deal-raise-stakes-intl/,"Editor’s Note: A version of this story appears in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here.
With its announcement that militants guarding Israeli hostages in the buildings and tunnels of Gaza had “new instructions” to kill them if Israeli troops closed in, Hamas signaled the opening of a chilling new chapter in an already brutal war.
Seizing on a spasm of public outrage in Israel at Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s inability to bring home the remaining hostages, Hamas released a comic book-style image of a kneeling figure threatened with a gun﻿, followed by a video of Eden Yerushalmi, 24, a bartender at the Nova music festival and one of six hostages who Israel says were shot at close range in Hamas captivity last week before Israeli forces could reach them.
In a cruel twist of timing – the funerals of the slain hostages had taken place on Sunday and Monday – Hamas said it would drip-feed footage of what it described as the “final messages” of the remaining five. It released a second video on Tuesday, featuring Ori Danino, a 25-year-old who was abducted from the Nova music festival on October 7. Danino had helped other festival-goers escape the horror. It was not clear when any of the footage was filmed – nor whether it was intended that the videos would be used in this way.
Hamas’ new tactics – which Yerushalmi’s family say amount to “psychological terror” – will further fan the fury in Israeli society. For the past three days, crowds have swelled in multiple Israeli cities, with protesters blaming Netanyahu for, in their view, sacrificing Israeli citizens to stay in power, as right-wing members of his coalition have threatened to bring down the government should he end the war.
After a general strike that brought the country to a near halt on Monday, thousands of protesters took to the streets again on Tuesday, with demonstrations in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Hod HaSharon, Haifa, Herzliya and Ra’anana. In Tel Aviv, some of the largest crowds gathered outside the Begin Gate of the Kirya – the military headquarters – where a site had been set aside for demonstrators including families of hostages to gather. Video footage showed fires on the street, police attempting to extinguish the flames and protesters waving flags and demanding the release of the hostages held in Gaza. Police said later they had arrested three people suspected of rioting.
Yet, it remains far from clear whether such public demonstrations of anger will compel Netanyahu to change Israel’s approach to the war in Gaza.
Some analysts say that unlike earlier in the war, Hamas may no longer believe that keeping hostages gives it leverage over Israel.

“Hamas has taken the hostage issue out of the equation. It knows that this current Israeli administration is not interested in any kind of hostage release deal,” Tahani Mustafa, a senior Palestine analyst at Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank, told CNN. “I don’t think they consider them as substantial playing cards any longer.”
In a statement Monday evening, Hamas spokesperson Abu Obaida said the new instructions had come into place after an “incident” in Nuseirat, seeming to refer to an Israel Defense Forces operation in June that rescued four Israeli hostages from a refugee camp in central Gaza.
The raid, which killed 274 Palestinians, occurred mid-morning when the streets were teeming with people shopping at a nearby market. Some of the captors were killed, and the IDF successfully retrieved the hostages unharmed, further weakening Hamas’ leverage in negotiations with Israel.
Since then, the IDF has rescued one more hostage – Farhan Al-Qadi, 52, a Bedouin Israeli citizen who was retrieved from a tunnel in Gaza last week.
When Hamas took some 250 people hostage from southern Israel on October 7, “they thought they could try to leverage them for a prisoner exchange deal,” Mustafa said. Although an exchange deal was struck as early as November, no further agreement has been reached 10 months later.
The successful rescues may have helped Netanyahu to argue that Israel’s twin war aims of destroying Hamas and returning the hostages can be pursued simultaneously, making the cries for a ceasefire-for-hostages deal less urgent.
But, after the murder of the six hostages under Hamas’ new directive, hundreds of thousands of Israelis took to the streets on Monday to demand Netanyahu’s government strike a deal to free the hostages, in one of the largest demonstrations since the war began. Many wondered if the nationwide outrage might be enough to force his hand.
Instead, a defiant and bellicose Netanyahu used his first public comments since the discovery of the bodies to double down on his strategy in the strip. He said Israel will retaliate strongly against Hamas for the killing of the six hostages, hinting that the response would be akin to the strike against Hezbollah in July that killed the Iran-backed group’s top commander Fu’ad Shukr.
He stressed again his commitment to fighting until Hamas is defeated and repeated his refusal to withdraw soldiers from the border between Gaza and Egypt – a new sticking point threatening once again to derail talks to reach a deal.
Although Netanyahu has refused to cede ground under growing pressure, analysts say the killing of the six hostages by Hamas has been a turning point, leading many in the country to ask whether Israel is reaching the limits of what its military power can achieve, and whether its offensive may be endangering the more than 100 hostages from the country still being held in Gaza.
“The penny that dropped for a lot of Israelis is that going after Hamas is not complementing the return of the hostages. It is hindering and hampering the return of the hostages,” Ori Goldberg, an Israeli political analyst and lecturer at Reichman University in Tel Aviv, told CNN.
“It became very clear that the presence of the IDF played a direct part in the decision of their Hamas keepers to kill them,” he said. “The sense that the Netanyahu government is incompetent, that Netanyahu is doing all of this for his own reasons, is now much more powerful for a lot of people. So I think it is a watershed moment.”
Nimrod Novik, a fellow at the Israel Policy Forum and former senior adviser to the late Prime Minister Shimon Peres, said many Israelis have felt two waves of grief over the past three days: first, for the death of the six hostages, and then, following Netanyahu’s speech, “the realization that Netanyahu is determined to pursue an open-ended occupation of Gaza.”
The death of the six hostages also caused the latest spat between Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. According to reports in Israeli media, the two men argued furiously over whether, as part of any ceasefire deal, the Israeli military should leave the Philadelphi Corridor – a 14-kilometer (8.7-mile) stretch of land running along the border between Gaza and Egypt.
Although Netanyahu has recently begun to strongly insist that Israel maintain a military presence in the corridor for security reasons, Hamas has long been clear that the proposal is a non-starter. Gallant reportedly told Netanyahu that insisting on this condition means “there won’t be an agreement and there won’t be any hostages released.”
Regardless, the cabinet proceeded to vote on the plans Netanyahu presented, approving them by eight to one, with Gallant the only dissenter.
Novik, the former adviser to Peres, said the newfound focus on the Philadelphi Corridor is merely symbolic.
His “discovery” of the corridor and the effective elevation of its status to a holy site “has no security merit,” Novik said.
If anything, an occupation of the corridor – which runs alongside densely populated towns and cities – risks endangering Israeli troops, as Israel’s previous occupation of the territory that ended in 2005 showed, Novik warned.
“They’re sitting ducks,” he said. “And if Hamas managed to kill our troops in 2004 before it had the kind of munitions and equipment that they have today, the results are going to be even more devastating.”
Since the issue of the corridor was raised last month, Hamas has said it will not agree to Netanyahu’s red line.
“At this point, they cannot accept anything short of the demands they are now calling for: A complete cessation of hostilities and the full withdrawal of Israeli troops,” Mustafa said. “If they were to accept anything short of what they’re demanding, that would be political suicide for the movement.”
Netanyahu’s defiant speech on Monday may have extinguished hopes that the killing of the six hostages could lead to a change in course. Former IDF spokesperson Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, who has become more critical of the government since leaving his post earlier this year, said about the remaining hostages after Netanyahu’s speech: “He sealed their fate.”
The insistence on maintaining troops along the corridor may also spell further tension between Israel and the United States, which has throughout the months-long negotiations insisted that Israel must fully withdraw from Gaza after the war.
When asked Monday whether Netanyahu was doing enough to reach an agreement, President Joe Biden said simply: “No.”

Whatever it is, there’s something about spy flicks we can’t get enough of. Since the genre’s emergence, espionage has taken over both big and small screens, from long-standing franchises like James Bond, to newer efforts like the “Kingsman” series or the subversive “The 355.”
On TV, the success of shows like “Homeland,” “The Americans,” and the newer “Slow Horses” — which begins its fourth season Wednesday on Apple TV+ — highlight our collective fascination with spy narratives.
Even in a time where the genre movie has all but faded in favor of endless remakes and sequels, where television shows are often canceled shortly after they air, spy stories still grip our imaginations and studios’ pockets.
But the genre is more than just splashy gimmicks helmed by a suave protagonist. The ubiquity of these stories reveals something deeper, not just about our world, but about ourselves.
As a genre, espionage was first born from literature, where spy novels and spy fiction grew in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, alongside increasing globalization and imperial force, said film historian Samhita Sunya. An early example is Rudyard Kipling’s 1901 novel, “Kim,” which follows an Irish boy living in India during British rule, who eventually becomes a spy.
The book is an early indication of what spy novels, and later, the spy genre as a whole, grew to be: portrayals of larger, geopolitical fears. The genre then peaked during the Cold War era, Sunya said, amidst worries of nuclear catastrophe between the US and the former USSR.
As these tensions play out on the global stage, they also play out in popular media. “Dr. No,” the first James Bond movie, released in 1962, is a prime example. The titular Dr. No, who is part of the international terrorist group SPECTRE, is a half Chinese, half German nuclear scientist, eventually defeated by Bond.
“It was almost maintaining this balance of power, and this fear of third parties also going nuclear,” Sunya said. “And that included stateless organizations, as well as anxiety about China becoming a nuclear power.”
Now, we’re experiencing another peak in the espionage genre, Sunya said. In a world of artificial intelligence and the threat of disease following the global pandemic, similar anxieties are once again arising — and making their way into spy fiction.
Last year’s “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One” and “Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre” epitomize those modern fears. In both films, saving the world means defeating either a corrupt sentient AI or stopping an AI tool from being used for evil.
These movies were released during a year dominated by AI. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman appeared in front of a Senate panel calling for increased governmental regulation of the controversial technology, and the Biden administration launched an executive order aiming to address the associated risks.
These confounding anxieties, in real life and in the media, feed into each other. The lines between fiction and reality can start to blur.
“You’re seeing it in art forms like films and TV, or books. That’s making people more interested in these narratives. And then they’re hearing in the media, or from government sources, that there is a real risk as well,” said Julia Tatiana Bailey, an art historian and curator at the Rudolfinum Gallery in Prague. “It just feeds into this paranoia.”
Spy fiction isn’t all just sociopolitical underpinnings. These movies have become blockbusters for a reason. They are global escapades — see Italy’s grandiose Amalfi Coast and the bustle of Mumbai, India, in Christopher Nolan’s 2020 spy thriller “Tenet.”
Or let your eyes feast on the visual buffet that is Daniel Craig stalking the streets of Mexico City during a Day of the Dead parade in 2015’s “Spectre” — a 4-minute scene that alone has gathered almost 4 million views on YouTube. In 1996’s “Mission: Impossible,” some of the film’s most dramatic moments are backdropped by the cobblestone streets of the Czech Republic’s Prague.
Of course, there are also the gadgets, the cars, the sex, even the outfits — all of which lends a certain erotic thrill that has become synonymous with the genre, and contributed to its wide appeal.
In the 1960s, for example, Eurospy films — a genre of movies that emerged in Europe mimicking the Bond movies — became hugely popular in South Asia, Sunya said. Newspapers would advertise these movies as “adults only,” because of their association with this type of erotic spectacle. Still, these movies became so popular that other countries began developing their own spy films, too.
The genre, then, became its own universe, existing outside of the geopolitical context with which it plays. We romanticize spies and the glamor around them, enough to ignore the political tensions and nervous questions some stories raise.
Ultimately, most Americans don’t know much about what spies are actually doing, Bailey said. We know covert activity happens because, occasionally, it’s publicly revealed. Last year, for example, China claimed a CIA spy was embedded in the Chinese military. This activity could be all around us, existing beneath our everyday lives. That mystery is what makes espionage so appealing in fiction.
“We’re getting an insight through fiction into a world that we know is there, but we just have no other access to it,” Bailey said.
Spy fiction teeters along that line of knowing and unknowing. On one hand, those stories are made-up figments of the author’s imagination. On the other hand, there are clandestine activities happening behind the scenes — and that secrecy plays into our anxieties, too.
“There’s a lot of interesting questions to ask about what’s reality, and what’s our sense of reality, and who’s controlling us,” Bailey said. “And all these questions come through spy stories as well.”
Nowadays, the life of a spy is much less glamorous than what might be presented to us on our screens, Bailey said. Think less exciting car chases, more sitting at a desk looking up data.
But the image of spies running around chasing bad guys is a fun one. In espionage fiction, there’s a clear good guy and bad guy. The work itself is courageous and risky. Our protagonists become heroes, and we are their accomplices, trying to solve the problem of the day right alongside them.
Yet spy fiction and its ongoing popularity reveal how we use these stories to understand real-life issues, Sunya said.
“The forms and stories that that takes, even if extremely imaginative or exaggerated or spectacular, end up telling us something about how we’re trying to make sense of the real world in that moment,” she said.
Sure, there are sociopolitical reasons why certain spy movies and shows are made and popularized in specific moments. The genre can also expose our fears about our world, or our increasing distrust in governmental institutions.
Still, we’ll turn to espionage fiction and all its blockbuster charm. Who, after all, can resist a good story?"
41437A107P_C5U530DV40Q2SRA,Evidence in January 6 case against Trump could be released before election under new schedule,"By Katelyn Polantz and Tierney Sneed, CNN","3 minute read Updated 5:43 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/05/politics/january-6-case-evidence-release/,"Judge Tanya Chutkan has set a schedule in the federal election subversion case against former President Donald Trump that will allow prosecutors to release never-before-seen evidence, such as grand jury transcripts, ahead of the presidential election.
The deadline for the filing from prosecutors is September 26, according to the latest order from the judge, which largely sides with special counsel Jack Smith’s proposed schedule discussed at Thursday’s hearing. Trump’s defense team had sought to delay the public release of evidence in the case until after the November election.
The evidence the prosecutors reveal in late September may not be immediately public, and Chutkan will be able to control its release. It is likely it would become available, though, with potentially some redactions.
This is the one of several filings the judge expects before voters head to the polls. She has not scheduled additional hearings or a trial date.
Chutkan’s scheduling order would allow for her to resolve the immunity issues on a much quicker timeline than the former president proposed, with a deadline for the final round briefs on the immunity matter set for October 29. There is no hearing scheduled on the immunity question in her new order, but she could request oral arguments on the matter later on.

At a hearing focused on scheduling Thursday morning, there was also acknowledgement among the parties and the judge that the scope of Trump’s immunity in the newly revised election subversion case would likely be appealed.
Beyond just the immunity issue, Chutkan’s new order sets deadlines for a number of substantive filings to be submitted before the election. She has set a timeline for Trump’s challenge to the indictment on statutory grounds to be briefed in October. She has also requested that Trump file his challenge to the legality of Smith’s appointment and for the special counsel to respond in late October, with the final brief from Trump on that issue due on November 7, two days after the election.
At Thursday’s scheduling hearing, Chutkan made clear she would not take into account the presidential campaign in crafting the next steps in the case. She rebuffed the defense team’s concerns about the government getting to decide what evidence is aired on the public court record during a “sensitive time” close to the election.
A key disagreement between Trump and the special counsel was which side should file the initial brief on whether the superseding indictment handed up last week comports with the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling.
Smith’s team said Thursday that they wanted to file an initial brief that would include “substantial exhibits” that would lay out for the judge the context, form and content of relevant evidence in the case – including evidence not in the indictment.
Trump’s lawyers meanwhile were also pushing idea that Chutkan should decide first whether the allegations specific to former Vice President Mike Pence are immunized, with the defense claiming that if they are covered by immunity, the whole case should be dismissed.
Chutkan on Thursday additionally expressed her skepticism to a Trump plan to challenge the indictment on the grounds that Smith was illegally appointed, even as she allowed his team the opportunity to do so.

46PZLRI46R_LIE8ER28Z1UR83U,Exclusive: Ukraine army chief reveals the strategy behind Kursk incursion,"By Ivana Kottasová, Madalena Araujo and Victoria Butenko, CNN","5 minute read Published 1:00 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/05/europe/ukraine-army-chief-kursk-incursion-exclusive-intl/,"Russia had been planning to launch a new attack on Ukraine from the Kursk region before Kyiv’s surprise cross-border incursion, Ukraine’s Commander-in-Chief Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi told CNN in an exclusive interview Thursday.
In his first television interview since becoming military chief in February, the general told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour that he believed the Kursk operation had been a success.
“It reduced the threat of an enemy offensive. We prevented them from acting. We moved the fighting to the enemy’s territory so that [the enemy] could feel what we feel every day,” Syrskyi said, in a rare interview that offered a candid assessment of the war.
Last month, Ukrainian forces stormed into Kursk in a cross-border incursion that caught even American officials by surprise. It signaled that, despite Russia’s advantage in terms of men and armor, its military has vulnerabilities.
Related article Ukraine’s Zelensky says Russia incursion is part of victory plan he intends to show Biden
In what is the most detailed explanation of the rationale behind the incursion, Syrskyi outlined the key objectives of the operation: to stop Russia from using Kursk as a launchpad for a new offensive, to divert Moscow’s forces from other areas, to create a security zone and prevent cross-border shelling of civilian objects, to take prisoners of war and to boost the morale of the Ukrainian troops and the nation overall.
Speaking to Amanpour at an undisclosed location near the frontline, the general, who took over as army chief in February, said Moscow moved tens of thousands of troops to Kursk, including some of its best airborne assault troops.
And while admitting that Ukraine was under immense pressure in the area around Pokrovsk, the strategic city that has for weeks been the epicenter of war in eastern Ukraine, Syrskyi said his troops have now managed to stall the Russian advances there.
“Over the last six days the enemy hasn’t advanced a single meter in the Pokrovsk direction. In other words, our strategy is working.” he said.
“We’ve taken away their ability to maneuver and to deploy their reinforcement forces from other directions … and this weakening has definitely been felt in other areas. We note the amount of artillery shelling as well as the intensity of the offensive have decreased,” he said.
Speaking to Amanpour just after inspecting the frontlines on Thursday, Syrskyi said that there’s no doubt that Ukraine is outgunned and outmanned as it tries to defend itself against the Russian aggression.
“The enemy does have an advantage in aviation, in missiles, in artillery, in the amount of ammunition they use, of course, in personnel, tanks, infantry fighting vehicles,” he said.
But Syrskyi also said the fact that Russia has such a material advantage has forced Ukraine to become smarter and more efficient in the way it’s fighting the war.
“We cannot fight in the same way as they do, so we must use, first of all, the most effective approach, use our forces and means with maximum use of terrain features, engineering structures and also, to use technical superiority,” he said, highlighting Ukraine’s advanced drone program and other home-grown high-tech weaponry.
Syrskyi was named Ukraine’s commander in chief in February, after President Volodymyr Zelensky fired Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyi. He took over at a particularly difficult time for Ukraine.
The months-long delays in the delivery of US military assistance caused critical ammunition shortages.
At the same time, Ukraine was struggling to replenish its troops, exhausted and diminished after fighting Russia’s relentless offensive for two years.
Syrskyi said recruiting more soldiers was a priority. The Ukrainian government then passed a controversial mobilization law, requiring all men between 18 and 60 to register with Ukraine’s military and to carry their registration documents on them at all times – an effort to make the recruitment process more transparent and fair.
Seven months later, the new recruits are arriving to the frontlines. But several commanders have told CNN that not all of the new soldiers are ready to fight and are routinely abandoning their positions.
Syrskyi admitted his troops are heading to the battlefield after receiving less training than he’d like them to.
“Of course, everyone wants the level of training to be the best, so we train highly qualified professional military personnel,” he said. “At the same time, the dynamics at the front require us to put conscripted servicemen into service as soon as possible,” he added, explaining that new recruits get one month of basic military training followed by half a month to a full month of more specialized training before they are sent to fight.
Syrskyi told Amanpour that the delays in US military assistance did cause major setbacks on the battlefield and led to a slump in morale – something he admitted was still an issue.
He said he takes frequent trips to the frontlines and makes sure he spends time with his troops.
“We speak the same language … we understand each other no matter who I am talking to – whether this is an ordinary soldier, a rifleman, for example, or a brigade commander, or a battalion commander,” he said.
“I have been in this war since 2014,” he said, referring to Russia’s incursion into the Donbas 10 years ago. “In other words, the frontline is my life. We understand each other, I know all the problems that our servicemen, soldiers, and officers experience,” he added.
Syrskyi ended the candid interview by thanking Ukraine’s Western allies for their support. Switching from Ukrainian to English, he said: “Together we are stronger. Together we can win.”"

Mohammed Mansour, a journalist for the Palestinian news agency WAFA, was injured when the car he was driving was struck by gunfire, according to video of the aftermath and his employer.
Footage filmed in the car by freelance journalist Jarah Khalaf shows a chaotic scene, as Mansour races through the streets and blood pours from his leg. All journalists were wearing flak jackets with “press” labels, and the car bore a “press” identifier on its hood.
“The occupation surprised us by shooting at us directly. Our colleague Mohammed Mansour was here in this car,” said Khalaf. “The army shot at us more than once, even though we had press signs and were wearing body armor and everything.”

WAFA said that the Israeli military “fired live bullets directly at the vehicle,” which was carrying four journalists reporting on the Tuesday raid. The Palestine Red Crescent Society said that it treated four journalists who were injured by gunfire and shrapnel.
CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for comment.
Violence from the Israeli offensive in Gaza since the Hamas-led October 7 attacks has spilled into the occupied West Bank in recent months. The IDF unleashed a barrage of raids and airstrikes in multiple parts of the territory on August 28 – including in the cities of Jenin, Tubas and Tulkarem – bulldozing highways and razing buildings to rubble.
The IDF has said that its operations in the West Bank are necessary “in order to remove immediate terror threats in real time.”
Humanitarian groups have accused the Israeli military of using disproportionate force against Palestinian residents, inflicting severe damage on critical infrastructure and disrupting health care services. On Tuesday, a UN spokesperson warned that Israeli forces are using “lethal war-like tactics” in the occupied territory, with people being killed, injured and displaced – and have blocked critical access to aid organizations.
On Monday, two Palestinian journalists were injured by shrapnel and had to dodge Israeli bulldozers while covering the devastation left by forces in the city of Jenin, according to video obtained by CNN and interviews with the journalists. The sound of gunfire can be heard in the background.
In another video, reporters film Israeli military bulldozers tearing up the surface of a street in Jenin. The IDF says this is done to find and dismantle explosive devices.
“This was one of the craziest and most dangerous days of coverage, as we were directly targeted,” Shatha Hanaysha, a reporter for the Mondoweiss news website, said on Monday. She told CNN that she sustained minor shrapnel injuries to her leg. “We saw Israeli journalists with the military today … While they fire at us, they treat the Israeli journalists in a different way. These are double standards.”
Khalaf said he was also among the journalists filming the Israeli military bulldozers on Monday, when suddenly “a bulldozer started backing on us.”
“We moved down the road when the bulldozer turned … and chased after us,” added Khalaf. “We were trapped behind a wall, but the bulldozer kept coming forward toward us when it started destroying shops and the sidewalk we were on. We were trapped for a few minutes before we managed to get away.”
Israeli forces have killed 33 Palestinians in the West Bank, including six children and two elderly people, since launching the operation last month, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah. Another 130 people have been injured. The ministry does not differentiate between civilians and militants.
The Al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas’ armed wing, said Friday that three of its members had been killed."
4822DZVBJA_WS2OC6527UK7Z0I,Harris kicks off fall campaign blitz with Labor Day events in key states,"By Alison Main and Arit John, CNN","5 minute read Updated 8:19 PM EDT, Mon September 2, 2024",20240903,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/02/politics/2024-harris-trump-labor-day/,"Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign held a string of Labor Day-themed events in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania on Monday, marking the unofficial launch of the fall campaign sprint in the states that will determine the November election.
The events come as Harris seeks to extend her momentum over the next two months. While the Democratic presidential nominee has sought to expand the map of states where she is competitive, the Labor Day stops point to the importance of winning those three “blue wall” states that propelled President Joe Biden to victory in 2020.
Biden joined Harris for a rally in Pittsburgh on Monday evening, the president’s first joint campaign appearance with the vice president since ending his reelection bid and endorsing her.
“I’ll be on the sidelines, but I’ll do everything I can to help,” Biden said. “Are you ready to make Donald Trump a loser again?”
Harris used the Pennsylvania event to say that US Steel should be owned domestically and that she opposed the company’s purchase by the Japanese-owned Nippon Steel.
“The president mentioned it: US Steel is a historic American company, and it is vital for our nation to maintain strong American steel companies. And I couldn’t agree more with President Biden, US Steel should remain American owned and American operated,” Harris said to a crowd of union members.
In a statement, a Nippon Steel spokesperson defended the deal, arguing that “U. S. Steel and the entire American steel industry will be on much stronger footing” under the acquisition.
Harris’ remarks in Pennsylvania largely echoed an earlier event in Detroit, where she emphasized the “dignity of work” and vowed to strengthen protections for collective bargaining to a crowd of union members and leaders, while drawing sharp contrasts with opponent Donald Trump.
“We celebrate unions because unions helped build America, and unions helped build America’s middle class,” she told a packed high school gymnasium here in Michigan.
Harris was joined onstage by national union leaders, including United Auto Workers president Shawn Fain, American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten and National Education Association president Becky Pringle.
The vice president reiterated her support for the PRO Act, legislation that would ensure workers’ rights to unionize and collectively bargain for workplace changes, and vowed to “end union busting once and for all.”
Monday’s events come 64 days ahead of Election Day and, as Harris noted in her remarks, 24 days before mail-in absentee voting begins in Michigan and 14 days before it begins in Pennsylvania. The vice president echoed previous warnings that the race would be close to the end.
“I’m telling you we know how they play, we know what they do,” she said. “So let’s not pay too much attention to the polls. Let’s know, like labor always does, we are out here running like we are the underdog in this race because we know what we are fighting for.”
Meanwhile, her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, proudly boasted his ties to organized labor at a union event in Milwaukee, celebrating Labor Day by declaring himself in “the pocket” of unions and daring Republicans to “roll the damn dice” if they want to criticize his support for labor.
Walz detailed his union membership as a former public school teacher, his record of backing unions in Congress and as Minnesota’s governor, and highlighted Harris’ support for unions.
Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, had no scheduled events Monday. Trump used his social media site to bash Harris over high gas and grocery costs and tout his work renegotiating America’s trade deal with Mexico and Canada.
“We can’t keep living under this weak and failed ‘Leadership,’” Trump said on Truth Social.
The Harris campaign knocked the former president for not holding any events on the holiday.
“Donald Trump is ditching workers on Labor Day because he is an anti-worker, anti-union extremist who will sell out working families for his billionaire donors if he takes power,” campaign spokesperson Joseph Costello said in a statement.
Ahead of Harris’ Labor Day remarks in Detroit, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer praised the vice president’s record and bashed the Republican ticket as disconnected from the common man.
“Look, if your most famous line is ‘You’re fired,’ you sure as hell don’t understand workers,” Whitmer later said, referencing Trump’s catchphrase on his former reality show “The Apprentice.” “I want our next President to say to workers, whomever she might be, I’ve got your back.”
Whitmer said Harris has been part of “the most pro-labor administration in American history,” and praised Harris’ work as a senator and attorney general to stand with picketing workers and take on big banks and pharmaceutical companies, as well as Walz’s work to bring infrastructure investments to his state and raise minimum wage for delivery drivers.
Trump has been critical of labor leaders, including the United Auto Workers’ Fain, but has sought the support of workers in the same Rust Belt states Harris and Walz campaigned in Monday. The former president has focused his attention on the Biden administration’s efforts to boost the production and purchase of electric vehicles, which Trump has argued will come at the expense of autoworkers.
Michigan Trump allies railed against Harris on the issue of auto manufacturing ahead of the Democratic presidential nominee’s Labor Day visit to Detroit.
“What makes America great, part of it, is our economy, and the Harris administration is coming after autoworkers’ jobs,” Rep. Lisa McClain, a Michigan Republican, told reporters on a call Monday morning. “There will continue to be more layoffs.”
McClain, who represents the northern part of the metro Detroit area, as well as Republican Rep. John James, who represents a neighboring district, both argued that Biden-Harris administration policies meant to increase the producing of electric vehicles in the US are unrealistic.
The Harris campaign has pushed back on previous claims by Trump and Vance, including that the vice president supported a “mandate” for all electric vehicles. The administration’s goal is to have EVs comprise half of all new vehicle sales by 2030.

48J1X9YMC1_6DBD13LJ8BQ52RQ,Parents are not OK right now. Here’s what they can do,"Analysis by Kara Alaimo, CNN","5 minute read Updated 12:58 PM EDT, Fri September 6, 2024",20240901,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/01/health/parenting-stress-tips-surgeon-general-wellness/,"Parents and caregivers are working more hours and spending more time taking care of their children than parents did in the past — all while juggling sign-ups for extracurricular activities, playdates, school forms, doctor appointments and more.
No wonder they’re stressed. And the nation’s top doctor agrees.
US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy, a father of two, issued an advisory warning on Wednesday that the pressure that parents are under has become a public health problem. Some 41% of parents reported they can’t function most days because of stress, and 48% said they’re completely overwhelmed by stress, the advisory said, citing a 2023 American Psychological Association survey.
Parents are struggling with the high costs of childcare, education and health care, the advisory warned. They’re straining to find enough time for work, childcare and the mental load of parenting. They’re worried about school shootings and the mental health challenges many children are facing.

They’re also challenged by how to handle kids’ use of social media and their own, because parents are facing an “intensifying culture of comparison” encouraged by social media influencers showing off their supposedly perfect parenting, according to the advisory.
Things are even worse for parents with added stressors, such as those who are single, have children with special needs or have recently divorced.
And if parents are stressed, kids get stressed. Children were twice as likely to have behavioral, developmental or mental disorders and four times likelier to have poor mental health when their primary caregiver had poor mental health, according to a 2021 study.
It’s no surprise that parents’ mental health struggles can hurt our whole society by driving up health care costs and lowering economic productivity, the advisory noted.
“Simply put, caregivers need care, too,” the advisory warned.
It’s true that lot of these problems require action by lawmakers and employers, and this advisory should serve as a wake-up call to both that health care and childcare should be more affordable and accessible.
In the meantime, what can parents do? Anna Seewald, a psychologist and host of the “Authentic Parenting” podcast, told me parents can make changes to protect their physical and mental health amid all these challenges.
Related article Parents are feeling lonely. Here’s why it matters
Our society makes life incredibly hard for parents, the advisory noted, so parents could try to reevaluate their expectations of themselves.
“Parents put a lot of pressure on themselves to always be calm and patient and have well-behaved kids who do a lot of extracurricular activities,” Seewald said, but she noted doing so often isn’t realistic. “High expectations and social comparisons lead to big resentments and frustration.”
It’s better for parents to be realistic about what they can do given their circumstances.

Many parents who work with Seewald are spending loads of time on social media. Even deleting a single app can free up a substantial amount of time and energy, she said. “You don’t notice how they drain your time, but that’s a background stressor for a lot of people in a world of many stressors — and it’s one that you can control.”
Parents can also benefit from simplifying their kids’ activities. “You don’t need to go to two different birthday parties for 4-year-olds in a single weekend,” she said. “Preserving and protecting your own energy and time is more important.” If it’s something you’d enjoy, “maybe you hire a babysitter for an hour, maybe you invite a neighbor over for coffee,” she said.
One way for parents to find more time for themselves is to ask for help from the community — such as asking a kind neighbor or family member to watch their kids so they can take a break. Seewald said it’s also important for parents to think through what responsibilities —such as laundry or carpooling — they can delegate to other people.

Part of the time parents devote to themselves needs to include connecting with other people in person, Seewald said. “So many parents feel lonely and isolated. Seeing a friend helps you vent and talk about problems and get the emotional support you need, even if it’s limited and you see one person each week,” she said.
Parents can meet some self-care needs even with their kids around — and with small pockets of time, Seewald said. “If you put on music and dance with your kids and are silly for 10 minutes before you make dinner, your mood changes because of the movement,” she said. “Little interventions like that make a big difference, and they’re free.”
Related article Sleep disorders are associated with more parental stress
Spending time in nature also helps, she said. “You can go to the backyard or to a park, even if it’s for 15 minutes, even with kids, and feel the sun or watch the sunset. There’s no cost, but it regulates the nervous system and gives you a sense of awe and connects you to something bigger,” she pointed out.
Above all, Seewald recommended that parents practice self-compassion, which means “being kind and gentle with ourselves when we make mistakes, when we yell at our kids,” she said. “Feeling inadequate and shameful is a recipe for failure.”
The surgeon general has made clear that parents in the United States are not OK. While it’s on lawmakers and employers to solve many of these problems, it’s also critical for parents to practice self-care instead of waiting for the problems to be fixed. (That’s going to take awhile). Being kind and realistic with themselves, finding time to connect with friends and nature, and asking for help are all ways to help manage the mother lode of stresses parents are under.

4HNKTQB7UL_FPALSTQ3DEADSXT,Emhoff’s reaction to hostage murders underscores unique way he speaks for Harris,"By Edward-Isaac Dovere, CNN","4 minute read Published 8:31 AM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/05/politics/doug-emhoff-kamala-harris-israeli-hostages/,"The murders of six more Israeli hostages marked a critical new moment for Doug Emhoff, who’s speaking out on his own and Kamala Harris’ behalf, as only a Jewish American and the spouse of a presidential candidate can.
“In light of the retraumatizing of the tragedy of the weekend, speaking here, even though it’s so hard to do – this is a way that I can use this voice,” the second gentleman said Tuesday at a vigil for the hostages in Washington, DC.
For Emhoff, it’s a reflection of historical circumstances: he has spoken often about how he reconnected to his Judaism after seeing the response he received when Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris for the ticket four years ago. Then as second gentleman, he felt compelled first by the rise in antisemitism and then the October 7 Hamas terror attacks to speak up about how much hurt he felt.
Now, with his wife suddenly the Democratic nominee and both of them thrust more into the spotlight — and as the world approaches the anniversary of those attacks and Israel’s ensuing war in Gaza — friends and advisers say they’re seeing a man continuing to search for his own response to an issue that is policy, politics and personal all at once. And advisers and campaign aides are trying to match strategy with a principal whose emotions and determination have struck them in both his private comments and public remarks.
As Donald Trump attacks Jews who vote for Harris as being self-hating, it was Emhoff who sat in the front row of Tuesday night’s vigil – brought together by an array of Washington-area Jewish groups and hosted at the Adas Israel synagogue – wiping tears from his eyes, then struggling to speak through his grief as he stepped to the microphone.
“This is raw,” he said, telling the hundreds assembled he was there “as a fellow congregant, fellow mourner and as a Jew.”
“When Doug talks about how the VP encouraged him to be closer to his Jewish faith and take on antisemitism as an issue, it may be affirming to Jewish voters,” a friend of Emhoff told CNN. “But it also illuminates how they support each other as a couple, the connection to faith they both have, and that is important for all voters to know.”
As Biden has amped up public pressure on Benjamin Netanyahu to accept a ceasefire and hostage release deal, some outside allies have suggested the Israeli prime minister is instead trying to maneuver toward Trump’s benefit. And with voters on all sides of the issue uncertain of where Harris stands, every twist in events could complicate her efforts to win in Michigan, which has a sizable Arab and Jewish populations, but also some other key battlegrounds where the number of Jewish voters is larger than the 2020 margins of victories.
Several people who know Emhoff said that Hersh Goldberg-Polin’s murder hit him particularly hard. He knew the 23-year-old’s parents. He’d just seen them at the Democratic National Convention. The ache of knowing that the hostage only a few years younger than his daughter had been killed just days before his body was found has been overwhelming. It’s left him raw. Going to the vigil, one person who knows him told CNN, was about standing up as a leader — but also about feeling like he needed to be with his community amid the horror and the shock.
“How you all feel right now is how I feel. And how we all feel is something that Kamala hears directly from me almost each and every day,” Emhoff said on Tuesday night. “I share what I’m feeling with Kamala as my partner, as my wife – not just as our vice president. She knows. She gets it. She cares. She’s committed. Hersh’s loss feels so personal to the two of us, just like it feels to all of you.”
Ted Deutch, the former Florida congressman and current CEO of the non-partisan American Jewish Committee, praised the second gentleman while introducing him at the vigil for “reminding the world that an attack on any one of us is an attack on all of us.”
“He understands the unique agony of feeling that our cries for justice have gone unheard and yet he knows that our strength lies in our unity,” he added.
Emhoff has long stressed that he has no policy role in the administration or the campaign, and he continues not to. But the perspective has changed — until six weeks ago, he was married to a leader who was deferential to policy set by Biden. But after being elevated to the Democratic nominee, his wife is being watched closely for any shifts on Israel policy she might make.
Campaign aides say they expect Emhoff to continue to be key as he races around the country campaigning and fundraising, with anxiety already building over how the anniversary of October 7 will play out less than a month before Election Day.
Emhoff says he won’t stop speaking out, linking the need to remind the world repeatedly of what happened to the events of the Holocaust.
“If we don’t tell this story again and again,” he said at the vigil, “we have no hope of ‘Never Again.’”"

Lula da Silva made the remarks in an interview with CNN affiliate CNN Brasil published Monday, days after Musk’s social media site X was suspended in the country, making it inaccessible in a major market.
“The Brazilian justice system may have given an important signal that the world is not obliged to put up with Musk’s extreme right-wing anything goes just because he is rich,” the president said.
Lula da Silva’s comments are the latest salvo in a long-running feud with Musk over free speech, far-right accounts and misinformation in the country. Over the weekend, Brazilians, including the president, bid farewell to X, with some posting links to their profiles on other social media platforms.
Brazil is an important market for X, which has struggled with the loss of advertisers since Musk acquired Twitter and renamed the platform last year. Some 40 million Brazilians, roughly one-fifth of the population, access X at least once per month, according to market research group Emarketer.
Access to the platform was blocked after Brazil’s Supreme Court ordered the suspension of X nationwide, because Musk refused to name a legal representative in the country.
The court had previously issued orders to block multiple X accounts as part of the country’s sweeping investigation into the spread of misinformation online and hate speech aimed at undermining the country’s democracy.
Accounts that the platform has previously shut down on Brazilian orders include lawmakers affiliated with former President Jair Bolsonaro’s right-wing party and activists accused of undermining Brazilian democracy.
Musk, a self-proclaimed “free speech absolutist” has repeatedly claimed the court’s actions amount to censorship, and his argument has been echoed by Brazil’s political right.
Musk once again waded into Brazilian politics on Tuesday by sharing a link on X to an upcoming demonstration that bills itself as a march for “freedom, protesting judicial overreach and defending free speech.”

The couple were caught having sex on August 22 while in the grounds of a shrine in Kesennuma –- a small coastal town about 500 kilometers (310 miles) north of Tokyo –- and faced charges of disrespecting a place of worship.
Police told CNN that they arrested the man, fearing he could be a flight risk, but did not arrest the woman after concluding there was no risk of her fleeing.

The man has since been released from custody, but the police said they could not disclose details of his punishment and did not clarify whether he was a tourist or a resident. These cases don’t always end in forced repatriation, the police added, and can result in a fine.
Although such a case is rare, there have been other instances of people being arrested for disrespecting Japanese shrines.
Last year, a 17-year-old Canadian was brought in for questioning for allegedly scratching the name “Julian” with his nail into a wooden pillar at a UNESCO-listed temple in the historic city of Nara, local police told CNN at the time.
“The boy admitted his act and says it was done not with the intent of harming Japanese culture,” a police official said.  “He is now with his parents, who were with him when the incident occurred.”

His family wants answers,"By Rebekah Riess and Melissa Alonso, CNN","2 minute read Published 1:59 PM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/04/us/florida-nursing-home-death/,"A grieving Florida family is demanding answers after a man was found dead in a storage closet more than a week after he was reported missing at a North Miami nursing home and rehab center.
Elin Etienne’s body was discovered in the closet at the North Dade Nursing and Rehabilitation Center on Monday morning, North Miami Police Department Maj. Kessler Brooks told CNN.
Etienne, 71, was reported missing on August 22, police said. A missing person’s poster for him was issued on August 23, according to a police department post on X.
Etienne’s family says he had dementia – which the facility disputes, police told CNN.
“They said that he signed himself out, he doesn’t have the capacity to sign himself out,” family member Kimberly Etienne told CNN affiliate WSVN.
“At North Dade Nursing and Rehab, we are deeply committed to the health, well-being and safety of our residents, above all else,” center administrator Stephanie Pena said in a statement released to CNN.
“Our team is cooperating fully with the appropriate authorities, including law enforcement and our state regulatory partners. We are compassionate caregivers, and that will help get us through this difficult experience.
“At the same time, we remain committed to ensuring our residents continue receiving the high-quality care they have come to expect from our facility,” Pena said.
The local medical examiner removed Etienne’s body and autopsy results are pending, Brooks said. The investigation is ongoing, he said.
Family members gathered outside the nursing facility this week. “The entire family is here, and there’s been no answers,” Kimberly Etienne told WSVN.
North Dade Nursing and Rehabilitation Center has a two out of five stars overall rating, with only one star for health inspections and two for staffing, according to Medicare.gov.
It has faced over $23,000 in federal penalties over the last three years. Medicare says a facility can face a penalty for issues including “serious health or fire safety citation,” or failures “to correct a citation for a long period of time.”"

What to know if you sign one,"By Jeanne Sahadi, CNN","5 minute read Published 6:00 AM EDT, Mon September 2, 2024",20240803,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/02/business/noncompete-agreements-what-to-know-now/,"A Texas judge late last month struck down a nationwide ban on noncompete agreements that was supposed to take effect this Wednesday.
Existing noncompete agreements will therefore now remain in place. And employers may still ask you to sign one as a condition of employment. That is, unless and until a higher court decides otherwise, or Congress passes a law prohibiting it. But, if that does happen, it could take years.
In the meantime, if you’re working under a noncompete agreement — or are considering signing one — here’s what you need to know and do, because in some cases the agreement may not be enforceable.
Generally speaking, noncompetes prohibit you from working for your employer’s competitors within a given geographic distance for a given period of time. For example, you may be prohibited from working for a competitor within 50 miles of your current job for a year after leaving.

So, understand exactly how you will be constrained when you leave your current job — whether you quit, get laid off or are fired for cause — and what, if anything, you are getting in exchange for signing away your right to work where you wish.
Also understand how the location of competitors is defined, because the agreement might preclude you from working at a company within a given distance not just from your own work site, but also that of your company’s satellite locations.
“Read your agreement. You’d be surprised how many people don’t,” said Michael Fiffik, managing partner of Pennsylvania-based Fiffik Law Group PC. His law firm also provides services through LegalShield, which connects people with lawyers in their state to advise them on their noncompete agreements and other matters at little to no charge when they sign up for a monthly plan that costs just under $30 and can be canceled at any time.
Also, when considering whether to sign a noncompete, “think about it in the context of your career path,” Fiffik suggested. By that he means if it’s typical in your line of work to move up by moving on every few years, signing a noncompete might be problematic.
And, in general, everyone should review the paperwork they signed when they took their job, because they may not even be aware they signed one, said Donna Ballman, an employee-side employment law attorney in Florida and author of “Stand Up For Yourself Without Getting Fired.”
“Some (noncompete provisions) are disguised as a ‘confidentiality agreement’ or ‘bonus agreement,’ or even (may appear) in job applications. Most people sign that giant stack of paperwork they get at the beginning of their employment without reading it carefully,” Ballman wrote in an email to CNN.
The state where you’re working may impose restrictions or outright bans, which may render your noncompete invalid. Start by checking online with your state’s labor department and the state’s attorney general. This interactive map, from the Economic Innovation Group, also provides a quick rundown of current state restrictions and bans.
For instance, in California, two new laws went into effect reiterating and making plain what has been true since the 1800s: Noncompetes are, with few exceptions, unlawful and unenforceable, according to Robert Ottinger, founder of Ottinger Employment Lawyers.
That includes anyone in California who is employed by a company headquartered elsewhere or whose job is relocated to California. “The minute you set foot in California, [the noncompete agreement] evaporates,” Ottinger said, even if it says it is subject to the laws of another state.
In New York, many agreements are unenforceable because they don’t meet the multipart test the state requires of such agreements to be valid, including not imposing undue hardship on an employee. In Ottinger’s experience, “there’s a 90% or higher chance of it being invalid. … If you take it before a judge, the judge will not enforce it,” he said. That is especially the case for low- and mid-level workers, he added. “We’ve had dog walkers and sandwich makers subject to them. We win almost every time.”
By contrast, many other states impose far fewer restrictions. And some, like Kansas and South Carolina, impose none at all, according to the Economic Innovation Group.
Even where workers are least protected by state law, you still may have recourse if you feel your noncompete agreement is egregious.
“Federal and state antitrust law still applies, so it’s still illegal to have a noncompete agreement for the purpose of preventing competition. Employers must have a legitimate interest to protect, such as protecting confidential information or trade secrets, customer goodwill, extraordinary or specialized training the employer provided, or special relationships with customers developed as a result of the employment,” Ballman said.
And the Federal Trade Commission, which created the now struck-down rule banning noncompetes, notes that it is not prevented from “addressing noncompetes through case-by-case enforcement actions.”
Ballman said that there are some defenses against a noncompete that most states will recognize. “These include where the employer breaches the agreement first, where there is no legitimate interest to protect other than preventing competition, where the length of time or the scope is overbroad, or where public health or safety would not be served.”
And there may be other ways to prove your noncompete is illegitimate, especially when the employer indicates that it is intended to protect confidential information. For instance, Ballman said, “many employers don’t actually take measures to protect that so-called confidential information. If it’s on the website, if they allow some employees to compete but not others, if they brag about customers on social media, then there’s a great argument that the information isn’t confidential after all.”
All that said, “there’s no magic wand to get out of these,” she added. So, knowing what you’re getting into before signing anything and consulting with a knowledgeable employee-side employment attorney in your state may save you a lot of time and stress when you do eventually move on to a new job."
4SWPMA8OT6_22MCVGH7UN375VK,Trump seeks stay of sentencing for hush money conviction,"By Kara Scannell, CNN","2 minute read Updated 3:52 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/04/politics/trump-seek-sentencing-delay-hush-money/,"Lawyers for Donald Trump asked a federal appeals court on Wednesday to stop his sentencing until the judges can hear the former president’s legal argument to move the hush money case into federal court.
The last-ditch request comes after a federal judge rejected Trump’s motion to move the state case into federal court and delay the sentencing currently scheduled for September 18.
Trump’s lawyers said, “absent the requested stay, the New York County proceedings are scheduled to proceed to sentencing and ‘judgment of conviction’ on September 18, 2024 … which could result in the immediate incarceration of President Trump and irreparable harm to the impeding election before this Court has an opportunity to address the federal interests implicated by this appeal.”
Specifically, Trump’s lawyers are asking the appeals court to pause the federal judge’s ruling so the case is not sent back to the state court where Trump will be sentenced.
Trump filed a motion to appeal the decision denying the move into federal court Wednesday morning. That evening his lawyers filed motions with the federal judge and the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals to stay the federal judge’s ruling until the appeals court can hear an argument on the merits of moving the case to federal court. The one-two effort is Trump’s latest attempt to delay his sentencing.
Trump’s lawyers have argued the case should be moved into federal court following the Supreme Court’s decision this summer that granted immunity for some of Trump’s conduct that fell within his official powers.
Prosecutors with the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office have opposed the challenge to move the case into federal court and in a filing Thursday urged the federal appeals court to reject Trump’s effort to hold up his sentencing, saying that there is no basis for an appeal.
“As an initial matter, defendant mischaracterizes the nature of this appeal,” prosecutors wrote.
Prosecutors added that even if the appeals court would consider the request, they urge the judges to wait until Judge Juan Merchan, who presided over the trial, rules on Trump’s effort to postpone his sentencing until after the election.
Merchan could issue a decision as soon as this week.

Harris’ comments marked the first time she lent her voice to the dispute over the proposed sale of US Steel to Nippon Steel, Japan’s biggest steelmaker.
“The president mentioned it: US Steel is a historic American company, and it is vital for our nation to maintain strong American steel companies,” Harris said at the Labor Day event after being introduced by Joe Biden. “And I couldn’t agree more with President Biden, US Steel should remain American owned and American operated.”
The White House has previously opposed the controversial deal, with Biden saying it is “important that we maintain strong American steel companies powered by American steel workers.” Biden outlined his position during a March event in Pittsburgh, nicknamed “Steel City,” where he visited the headquarters of the United Steelworkers and called for higher tariffs to protect American manufacturing.
One week prior, when Biden hosted Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida for a state visit, Kishida was asked by a reporter whether he saw US politics influencing the $14 billion takeover bid. Kishida said, “Japan believes that appropriate procedures based on law is being implemented by the US government” to evaluate the deal.
Biden, asked the same question, said simply that he stands with both American workers and American allies overseas, without elaborating on his further involvement.
For the deal to close, it needs approval from both the Justice Department, which enforces antitrust laws, and the normally low-profile but powerful Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which evaluates takeovers on national security grounds. That committee comprises members of Biden’s cabinet, including the secretaries of treasury, commerce, defense, state, homeland security and the attorney general.
It remains unclear to what extent Biden or Harris, in their official capacity, will work to block the deal on national security grounds in the treasury-led review.
Representatives for US Steel and Nippon Steel declined to comment on whether the companies had briefed Harris on the deal.
In August 2023, US Steel rejected a takeover bid by Ohio-based Cleveland Cliffs to buy the company for $7.3 billion. After months evaluating alternate suitors, US Steel agreed to sell to Japan’s largest steelmaker for more than twice what Cleveland Cliffs had proposed paying. US Steel shareholders overwhelmingly voted in support of the Nippon deal.
Under the current terms of the deal, US Steel would retain its name and Pittsburgh headquarters. Nippon has also pledged an additional $1.3 billion to refurbish two outdated mills in Pennsylvania and Indiana.
In a statement to CNN, US Steel’s chief executive officer said those investments go well beyond what the company would be able to do on its own.
“The bottom line is these are investments in the future of American steelmaking and the employees, families, and communities that rely on it,” CEO David Burritt told CNN. “US Steel will be a much stronger company as a result of the transaction and these investments – the entire American steel industry will be stronger and more globally competitive, too.”

4VFDMWHBLZ_R2YPWNDA5SM6OS2,"KFile: Harris move to the center on border wall, asylum contradicts her years of progressive immigration positions","By Andrew Kaczynski, Em Steck and Daniel Medina, CNN","6 minute read Published 3:30 PM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/04/politics/kfile-harris-border-wall-asylum-contradicts-progressive-immigration-positions/,"Vice President Kamala Harris likes to portray herself as tough on the border and immigration.
Recent TV ads highlight her time as a “border state prosecutor” who aggressively targeted criminal cartels and drug smugglers, as well as her support for “the toughest border security bill in decades.”
That bill, which failed in the Senate in February and again in May, included $650 million for new border wall construction. Images of the border wall built during the Trump administration are featured in the Harris ads, yet Harris repeatedly criticized the wall over the years, describing it as an affront to both hers and America’s values.
In her 2019 book, “The Truths We Hold,” Harris called the wall “useless” and said it was “nothing more than a symbol, a monument standing in opposition to not just everything I value, but to the fundamental values upon which this country was built.”
A CNN KFile review of Harris’ social media posts found that she criticized the border wall more than 50 times during the Trump administration, calling it, among other things, “stupid,” “useless,” and a “medieval vanity project.”
As she tries to strengthen her image on the border, Harris will have to reckon with her years of opposing some of the very policies she now embraces. That includes building more border wall and also making it harder for migrants to come to the US seeking asylum.
Harris has tacked to the middle on other key issues, such as no longer banning fracking or supporting Medicare for All — positions she once supported before being picked as Joe Biden’s vice presidential nominee.
In an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash last Thursday, Harris said, despite her policy shifts, “my values have not changed.”
Immigration and the border remain significant vulnerabilities for Harris and the Democratic party, according to some national polls, although recent polling suggests Harris has managed to narrow the gap.
Not all border work stopped during the Biden administration.
In 2021 and 2022, the administration continued work near the border wall to prevent flooding, complete prior construction of access roads and close “small gaps that remain open from prior construction activities and remediating incomplete gates.”
In October 2023, the Biden administration allowed the additional building of border wall in Texas, with Biden saying he had to use money appropriated for the wall in 2019 and could not redirect it.
“I tried to get them to reappropriate it, to redirect that money. They didn’t, they wouldn’t. And in the meantime, there’s nothing under the law other than they have to use the money for what it was appropriated. I can’t stop that,” Biden told reporters in the Oval Office at the time.
In response to questions from CNN, a Harris campaign aide said in referencing the recent campaign ad that it was “inaccurate to imply a few images” are “somehow representative of the VP’s overall policy position on a complex issue when the entirety of the ad, the VP’s remarks as the nominee, and the governance of this Administration have been clear where she stands on border security - supporting the bipartisan border agreement.”
Along with extending funding for more border barriers and hiring more federal immigration authorities, the border security bill that Harris has vowed to sign as president would also largely bar migrants from seeking asylum if they crossed the border unlawfully. Many of the people who encounter Border Patrol agents at the southern border are migrants seeking asylum and claim to be fleeing conflict or persecution in their home country.
A CNN KFile review of Harris’ comments from 2017 through August 2020, before Biden picked her as his running mate, found that she repeatedly pledged to “honor the process” of asylum established decades ago and slammed policies that restricted asylum seekers.
Harris was one of seven US senators who signed onto an amicus brief in late 2018 supporting a lawsuit filed by asylum seekers challenging a Trump administration rule that effectively barred all asylum claims outside ports of entry.
“United States law is crystal clear that men, women, and children who arrive at any point on our borders may seek asylum,” read the brief. “In our democratic system, laws may not be overturned by Executive fiat.”
A judge struck down that rule in August 2019 and the Trump administration lost its appeals.
While running for president in 2019, Harris pledged to respect asylum law and called restricting asylum a “stain on our moral conscience.”
“Under a Harris administration, issues like asylum, for example, we are gonna honor the process and not try to circumvent the process and expedite the process for the sake of some political goal as opposed to the sake of justice and fairness,” Harris said on the “Pod Save America” podcast in 2019.
She reiterated the pledge in several tweets at that time, writing in July 2019, “As president, I will immediately put in place a meaningful process to review asylum cases. I will release children from cages. I will get rid of the private detention centers. It’s time we had a president whose actions reflected the values of our country.”
During a June 2019 interview with CBS News, she vowed that a Harris administration would honor established asylum procedures, stating, “If they are deserving of protection, we will give it to ‘em.”
A year later, in June 2020, Harris was one of 34 senators to sign a congressional letter criticizing the Covid-era Title 42 authority, which allowed the government to bar migrants from entering the country because of the public health crisis. The letter equated Trump’s asylum policies to the denial of safe passage to Jewish refugees fleeing the Holocaust.
Shortly after Biden and Harris took office in 2021, the mass influx of asylum seekers at the US-Mexico border significantly strained US immigration resources. The Biden-Harris administration initially kept Title 42 in place. In 2022, Republicans sued to keep the administration from ending Title 42, which it finally did in May 2023 when it announced the end of national Covid-era emergency restrictions.
As vice president, Harris was tasked with overseeing diplomatic efforts to address the root causes of migration.
Despite this role, Harris’ current stance on asylum marks a notable departure from her earlier promises to uphold the asylum process and protect vulnerable migrants.
After Senate Republicans abandoned the border bill at the behest of Trump, the Biden administration took executive actions to restrict asylum. In June, Biden signed an executive order largely barring migrants who cross the border illegally from seeking asylum once a daily threshold is reached, a departure from longstanding US asylum policy.
While Harris has yet to publicly comment on her plans for asylum, her campaign manager has signaled Harris would continue implementing Biden’s executive orders curbing asylum.
Throughout the Trump administration, Harris was a consistent critic of the border wall.
In April 2018, Harris signed onto a letter that urged the appropriations committee to reduce funding for the border wall and to halt hiring new Border Patrol agents.
CNN identified one of the border walls in her new campaign ads as constructed during Trump’s presidency in Sasabe, Arizona, in an area where there had not previously been border wall. The other walls feature signs that they were Trump-era walls, such as so-called anti-climbing plates that were built during the Trump years.
“It’s the president’s vanity project,” Harris said in June 2019 at an event promoting her book. “Let’s just point to the facts and the evidence and the data. And the fact is that we are not facing a crisis.”
“This president rode a wave into office of vilifying, a whole population of people,” she said at another event in 2019. “His multi-billion dollar vanity project called a wall is nothing more than a distraction from the fact that he actually hasn’t focused on working people in America. So instead of focusing on the needs of working families in America, he creates a scapegoat, a boogeyman.”

The Chinese Coast Guard (CCG) said a Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) ship had “deliberately collided” with one of its vessels near the disputed Sabina Shoal, according to state broadcaster CCTV.
“At 12:06, the Philippine ship No. 9701 deliberately collided with the Chinese ship No. 5205, which was normally enforcing rights and law enforcement, in an unprofessional and dangerous manner, resulting in a collision. The responsibility lies entirely with the Philippines,” CCG spokesman Liu Dejun said on Saturday.
PCG spokesperson Jay Tarriela said the Chinese side had “deliberately rammed” a Philippines vessel.
“This afternoon, the Chinese Coast Guard vessel deliberately rammed and collided with the BRP Teresa Magbanua three times, despite no provocation from the Philippine Coast Guard,” he wrote in a post on X.
Related article A dangerous new flashpoint is fast emerging in the South China Sea
The dueling accounts come as Chinese and Philippine vessels have engaged in multiple collisions and face-offs over the past week near Sabina Shoal, also known as Xianbin Reef.
The disputed atoll lies just 86 miles from the Philippines’ west coast and 745 miles from China.
A spokesperson for the US State Department said it condemned China for “deliberately colliding three times” with the Philippine vessel.
“On multiple occasions throughout August 2024, (China) has aggressively disrupted lawful Philippine aerial and maritime operations in the South China Sea, including at Sabina Shoal,” said the spokesperson Matthew Miller said.
Miller added that the US called on China to comply with international law and “desist from dangerous and destabilizing conduct.”
China claims almost all of the South China Sea as its sovereign territory despite an international ruling to the contrary.
The escalation in tensions comes just weeks after Beijing and Manila struck a temporary deal to lower tensions that had been rising all summer at another nearby reef, where China’s increasingly aggressive tactics had raised alarm across the region as well as in Washington, a mutual defense ally of the Philippines.

The phenomenon, also known as “atypical drowning,” means they had no water in their lungs, tracheas or stomachs, said a spokesperson for the lawyer of the captain of the Bayesian, which went down off the coast of the Sicilian port of Porticello on August 19.
There is no medically accepted “dry drowning” condition — “dry drowning” or other terms such as secondary drowning or delayed drowning are sometimes used to describe patients whose condition worsened after a drowning rescue or who had very little water in the lungs. However, the American Red Cross and other health organizations have recommended against using the terms; people may experience health impacts after being in water but it’s not the same as drowning, it says.
The cause of death of the first four victims suggests that they had found an air bubble in the cabin in which five of the victims’ bodies were discovered, and had consumed all the oxygen before the air pocket turned toxic due to carbon dioxide, according to local media reports.
The autopsies of American lawyer Chris Morvillo, his wife Neda Morvillo, Morgan Stanley banker Jonathan Bloomer and his wife Anne Elizabeth Judith Bloomer were carried out on Wednesday at the Forensic Medicine Institute of the Palermo Polyclinic hospital, officials said.
Autopsies on British tech titan Mike Lynch and his 18-year-old daughter are expected to be carried out on Friday.
No date has been set yet for the autopsy of Recaldo Thomas, the ship’s onboard chef – due to the difficulty reaching his family in Antigua.
All seven victims were scanned for injuries last Saturday, which found none had suffered broken bones or other physical injuries that might have contributed to their deaths.
The prosecutor investigating the case first suggested earlier in August the idea that the victims had been searching for an air pocket.
The autopsies are part of the criminal investigation into the ship’s captain James Cutfield, the ship’s machine engineer Tim Parker Eaton and sailor Matthew Griffith, who was on watch the night of the accident. None of the men is in Italy.
They are being investigated for “multiple manslaughter” and for causing a shipwreck, but authorities say this doesn’t mean they will be charged with any crimes. They were allowed to leave the country by the prosecutor in charge of the investigation.
The 56-meter yacht sank within 16 minutes of being struck by a downburst or tornado on the early morning of August 19. The ship will have to be raised for the investigation and to ensure that the 18,000 liters of fuel onboard do not leak into the sea around the port of Porticello near Palermo.
Bids have been sent out for the salvage, which will be paid for by the company of Lynch’s wife Angela Bacares, which owns the yacht.
Toxicology results on the seven victims are expected in the coming days. No alcohol or drug tests were carried out on any of the crew members, the prosecutor said in a press conference after all the victims’ bodies had been recovered.
Lynch and his business partner Stephen Chamberlain, who died after being struck by a car the day the Bayesian sank, had been acquitted of fraud charges in a US court in June 2024. The charges were related to the sale of their company Autonomy to Hewlett Packard, which has said it will not drop its civil lawsuit for $4 billion in damages now being heard in a UK court.

53EADCMGC3_7VS9HH1NT0D1R5O,"US official lays out new details on Gaza ceasefire talks, says Netanyahu comments on Philadelphi Corridor not constructive","By Kevin Liptak, Alex Marquardt and Jennifer Hansler, CNN","5 minute read Updated 7:18 AM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/04/politics/gaza-ceasefire-talks-netanyahu-philadelphi-corridor/,"A prospective hostage and ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas is 90% completed, but disputes remain over the exchange of prisoners for hostages and the redeployment of Israeli forces in Gaza, according to a senior US administration official and others familiar with the matter.
American officials, with Qatar and Egypt, have for months worked to broker a deal to bring an end to the nearly year-long conflict. Those negotiations have taken on new urgency following the killings of six hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, and American officials have said they are preparing to present a “final” offer to the parties soon.
It’s not the first time over the past several months that US negotiators have described the talks as entering their end stage, only for hopes to be dashed. That’s a reality US officials have acknowledged in recent days.
The painstaking negotiations have prompted the families of the remaining Americans held by Hamas to press the White House to explore a separate agreement with Hamas that would secure the release of their relatives. So far, US officials have said they are focused only on the larger deal.
A senior Biden administration on Wednesday offered one of the most detailed looks yet at key elements of the negotiations, which spokespeople for the US government said they would not negotiate in public. The official offered the previously unreported details after repeated public statements by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu casting doubt on his potential willingness to accept a deal, despite claims by the US that he had agreed to a “bridging proposal.”
The agreement itself makes no mention of the length of the Egypt-Gaza border known as the Philadelphi Corridor, the official told reporters on a call on Wednesday. Netanyahu has held two news conferences this week to argue that maintaining permanent control of the corridor is vital to Israeli security.
“The first war goal was to destroy Hamas’ military and governing capabilities. The second was to free our hostages, and the third was to ensure that Gaza never again poses a threat to Israel. And all three of those goals – all three of them – go through Israel’s control of the Philadelphi corridor,” Netanyahu said Wednesday at a news conference for foreign press.
That emphasis on Philadelphi in Netanyahu’s recent public statements hasn’t been constructive, the official said.
“In my view, the less that’s said about particular issues, the better,” the official said, adding: “Staking out concrete positions in the middle of a negotiation isn’t always particularly helpful.”
In the agreement being discussed for the first phase of a deal, Israel Defense Forces are supposed to withdraw from “densely populated areas,” the official said. Israel argues that the border isn’t one and is vital to preventing weapons smuggling into Gaza.
In the second phase, the IDF is supposed to withdraw entirely from Gaza.
The official said Hamas’s recent killing of six hostages had “colored” the ongoing negotiations and thrown into question Hamas’s willingness to reach a deal.
Hamas said this week that militants guarding Israeli hostages in the buildings and tunnels of Gaza had “new instructions” to kill them if Israeli troops closed in.
Still, the talks remain ongoing on finalizing the 18-paragraph proposal that American officials believe is the best chance of securing the hostages’ release.
Of the 18 paragraphs, all but four are finished and agreed to, the official said.
“We still see this deal, this very complex but necessary arrangement, as really the most viable, perhaps the only viable, option for saving the lives of the hostages, stopping the war, bringing immediate release to Gazans, and also making sure we fully account for Israel’s security,” the official said.
It’s essentially down to the prisoner exchange and the deployment of Israeli forces, the official said.
The deal on the table currently includes the release in the first phase of some 800 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, including some serving life sentences, the official said. They would be released for the remaining female, elderly and wounded or sick hostages, which was believed to be around 30.
Yet Hamas has proved to be a frustrating negotiating partner of this issue, the official said.
“There was some progress on last week but is difficult and requires Hamas to engage on it. Otherwise you just can’t move forward,” the official said.
Frustrated by the progress of the talks, some families of Americans still held hostage by Hamas have asked the Biden administration to look into a deal that would go around Israel to secure their loved ones’ release. US national security adviser Jake Sullivan met with the families virtually over the weekend.
While not ruling out such a possibility, US officials have stressed this week that the broader deal is the best, and potentially only, viable option to secure the hostages’ release.
“We are working on a proposal that would release all the hostages, including the American hostages, and that is the proposal that we’ve been talking about in the region last week, and it was the same proposal that the president met with his team over the weekend to discuss. That is what we’re working on,” White House national security spokesman John Kirby said on Tuesday.
The broader deal being discussed carries a significant aid component that would be launched immediately once the first phase goes into effect.
As part of the deal, 600 aid trucks a day would be allowed into Gaza, including 50 trucks of fuel. Equipment to clear rubble, supplies to support internally displaced Gazans and provisions for rehabilitating infrastructure would also be included in the first phase of the three-phase agreement.
Although the negotiators are working to close the remaining gaps, it is unclear when the in-person negotiations will resume. The latest round wrapped up last week. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said earlier Wednesday, “We want to get this proposal developed as soon as possible and get it over to Israel and Hamas and then try to get a final agreement.”

53JZ71MB82_A1I685MKGIM26JL,Two rescued from yacht after terrifying night at sea amid 20-foot waves,"By Hilary Whiteman, CNN","3 minute read Updated 9:10 PM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240903,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/03/australia/yacht-rescue-off-nsw-coast-intl-hnk/,"Two people have been rescued after a terrifying night at sea as six-meter (20-foot) waves tossed their stricken yacht nearly 200 miles (322 kilometers) off Australia’s eastern coast as they drifted at speed towards New Zealand.
Authorities were first alerted to the crew’s crisis around 1 p.m. on Monday, when they deployed a distress beacon, but it was hours before the first rescue helicopters located the vessel.
The 20-meter yacht, the Spirit of Mateship, had lost power and communications and was being hit by winds of up to 90 kilometers an hour (56 mph) as well as waves up to six meters high.
“(The helicopter’s crew) were able to fly above the yacht, and they could communicate via radio to the yacht, but they were unable to pick them up,” said Ben Flight, duty manager at the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Response Center.
Another rescue attempt was later abandoned due to rough seas, forcing the two people – named by New South Wales police as Brett, 60, and Lisa, 48 – to spend what Flight described as a “horrible” night at sea.
“They weren’t injured, but the vessel had suffered a mechanical issue of some kind, and they couldn’t steer, and they couldn’t make their own way through the water, so they were drifting, and they were taking on water as well. So, they were in quite a serious situation,” said Flight.
“They were sort of just at the mercy of the elements. They would have been moving around quite uncomfortably. It would have been particularly windy, noisy, probably quite wet as well.”
Two Australian Navy ships – HMAS Arunta and HMAS Canberra – answered calls for help, as well as Royal Australian Air Force C-130J Hercules aircraft, according to the Australian Defence Force (ADF).
The ships, along with a nearby merchant vessel, monitored the yacht’s location overnight, and the rescue resumed in the early hours of the morning, when conditions had eased.
NSW Police vessel Nemesis arrived at the yacht about 3 a.m. Tuesday and deployed a smaller boat to rescue the sailors around 7:30 a.m. in choppy seas with swells of four meters to five meters.
The couple returned to shore on the Nemesis on Tuesday evening, telling reporters in Sydney that they were “glad to be back.”
“The boat is more than seaworthy. It’s just mainly we were tired and seasick and couldn’t continue any further,” said Brett.
Flight said the outcome would have been much worse if the crew hadn’t deployed the distress beacon, which issues a satellite alert to advise the rescue coordination center of their location.
The Spirit of Mateship has competed in the prestigious Sydney to Hobart yacht race several times, crewed by wounded veterans and army personnel.
Together they raised money to support army veterans. However, the yacht has changed hands since then, according to Flight."
57QXMYCYKC_8X4AKTNMDMMIQPR,Tim Walz’s brother stands by criticism of his policies but says Facebook ‘wasn’t the right platform’ to express views,"By Aaron Pellish, CNN","4 minute read Published 3:37 PM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/04/politics/jeff-walz-criticism-brother-policies/,"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s brother said Tuesday that he doesn’t agree with the Democrat’s policies but expressed some remorse for inserting himself into the spotlight after he posted on social media last week he is “100% opposed” to his brother’s political views and was considering officially endorsing former President Donald Trump.
Jeff Walz, the older brother of Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate, told NewsNation in an interview that he didn’t intend to “influence the general public” with social media posts that indicated his support for Trump over Harris’ and his brother’s campaign and said he has no plans to be campaigning “for him or against him” ahead of November’s election.
The Harris-Walz campaign declined to comment.
Jeff Walz’s comments come after he wrote on Facebook that he hasn’t spoken to his brother in eight years but is “100% opposed to all his ideology.”
In another comment on Friday, he responded to someone suggesting he “get on stage” with Trump and offer his official endorsement by saying he’s weighing his family’s privacy against his desire to keep his brother out of higher public office, indicating he knows “stories” about Gov. Walz that would reflect poorly on him.
“I’ve thought hard about doing something like that!” he wrote in response to the idea of formally endorsing Trump. “I’m torn between that and just keeping my family out of it. The stories I could tell. Not the type of character you want making decisions about your future.”
Jeff Walz said he regrets sharing his views on Facebook, and explained he made the posts to clarify his views to people in his life who thought he was aligned with Tim Walz politically.
“It was a post that – that I made because I was getting a lot of feedback from my friends, old acquaintances, thinking that I was feeling the same way that my brother did on the issues, and I was trying to clarify that just to friends,” he told NewsNation. “I used Facebook, which wasn’t the right platform to do that for.”
Jeff Walz lamented the distance between him and his brother, saying “it’s too bad” they’ve grown apart and expressing hope for the possibility they can “disagree and still be civil brothers.” He added that any “stories” he had to share about Tim Walz wouldn’t reveal anything “hidden” about him.
“My little brother, when we were younger, we would go on family trips and in a station wagon. And the thing was, nobody wanted to sit with him, because he had car sickness and would always throw up on us,” he said. “That sort of thing. There’s really nothing else hidden behind there. People are assuming something else.”
Jeff Walz declined to share with NewsNation who he would be voting for in November. But he has a history of supporting Trump dating back to 2016.
The Facebook comments he posted on Friday occurred underneath a post he originally wrote on March 30, 2023, the same day Trump was indicted by a grand jury in New York as part of the investigation into hush money payments made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election. Trump was eventually found guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records.
“We’ve just become a third world banana republic,” he wrote that day.
He previously donated $20 to Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, federal campaign finance records show. And on the day after Election Day in 2022, he appeared to react to stronger than expected performances by Democrats in races across the country except in his home state of Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis won reelection by 19 points.
“Sure glad to live in Florida today!,” he wrote at the time.
Jeff Walz is one of three of Tim Walz’s siblings. They have a sister, Sandy, who lives in Nebraska, and a brother, Craig, who died in 2016.
His brother’s apparent opposition to his campaign puts Tim Walz in company with Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who have both seen family members criticize their presidential bids. Trump has faced continued attacks from his niece, Mary Trump, and his nephew, Fred Trump, who have both published books about their uncle. Kennedy’s siblings condemned his campaign at various points over the past year, including after he dropped out of the race in August and endorsed Trump."

The operation will now shift into a search and recovery phase, local media reported, citing Zaliha Mustafa, a minister in the Prime Minister’s Department in the Federal Territories.
Mustafa said several factors went into the decision, including concerns over the safety and health of the rescue personnel, Singaporean newspaper the Straits Times reported.
Vijaya Lakshmi Gali, an Indian national, fell into the sinkhole on the morning of Aug. 23, according to the High Commission of India in Kuala Lumpur.
Surveillance footage shows the woman walking on a pavement along a busy road when the sinkhole suddenly opened beneath her. She plunged into the eight-meter gap while people around her scrambled for safety.
Malaysian authorities mounted an extensive, multi-agency rescue effort involving the Royal Malaysian Police, the Fire and Rescue Department and the Civil Defense Force, among others.
They tried a variety of tools and techniques to locate her, including excavations, flushing portions of the drain system, sending divers to search the city’s sewage line, using high-pressure water jets to remove obstacles, and mapping inaccessible areas with remote cameras and ground-penetrating radar, according to the High Commission of India in Kuala Lumpur.
Authorities found no trace of her apart from a pair of slippers, the Associated Press reported.
CNN has reached out to Malaysian authorities and the Indian High Commission in Kuala Lumpur for more information."
5H0Q165Y87_1BJ9I8CG0D2LYLL,‘He was hunting’: Witness describes Colorado man accused of killing 10 at King Soopers in 2021 mass shooting,"By Ray Sanchez and Andi Babineau, CNN","9 minute read Updated 7:05 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/05/us/king-soopers-mass-shooting-trial/,"A retired emergency room physician on Thursday described the “calm expression” on the face of a shooter “hunting” down shoppers at a Boulder, Colorado, grocery store more than three years ago when 10 people were gunned down.
The testimony came after jurors heard a prosecutor describe the final moments of the victims during opening statements in the long-delayed trial of Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa.
Alissa is facing 10 counts of murder, 38 counts of attempted murder and numerous other charges after a judge ruled last year that he was fit to stand trial in the mass shooting at King Soopers on March 22, 2021. He pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity last November.
Days before the massacre Alissa was able to purchase a Ruger AR-556, which he used in the killings, after passing a background check, according to court records and the owner of a gun shop in Arvada, Colorado.
The mass shooting occurred in a state familiar with such tragedies, including the 1999 Columbine High School massacre in which 12 students and a teacher were killed and the 2012 Aurora movie theater shooting that claimed 12 lives.
One witness, Dr. Alison Sheets, a retired emergency room physician, told jurors Thursday that an afternoon of grocery shopping was interrupted by “loud noises.” She initially crouched behind a cardboard display before sliding sideways into a shelf of potato chips. Her yellow ski jacket blended with the yellow bags of chips, providing her cover, she said. She recalled gunshots and screaming.
At one point, Sheets testified, she could see the shooter walking by the aisle where she was hiding.
“He was hunting … as he walked by,” she said.
She added, “I did see his eyes. He was looking down the aisle… I sort of remember the stare looking down that aisle. It was not something I wanted to lock eyes with. So I turned away pretty quickly.”
She described a “calm expression” on the shooter’s face.
In the next aisle, Sheets testified, she heard a familiar sound from her work in emergency medicine.
“I heard someone die – just a little breath of exhalation of someone collapsing and dying. And I smelled blood after that,” she said, adding that she’s had “the unfortunate experience of seeing and being around multiple people who have passed.”
“I heard no other sounds from that spot for the remainder of the day,” Sheets said calmly.
Several jurors appeared visibly upset; some family members of the victims sniffled in the gallery. The defense did not cross-examine the seven witnesses who testified Thursday.
In its opening statements, the defense said it was “not contesting that the person that killed 10 innocent people and brought fear to so many others and grief and suffering to countless” was the defendant sitting in court.
Public defender Sam Dunn said Alissa has a “severe … treatment-resistant form of schizophrenia” and was “in the throes of a psychotic episode” the day of the shooting. The defendant told a psychologist during an evaluation that he heard “consistent voices … Just the consistent voices.”

On that March afternoon three years ago, prosecutor Michael Dougherty told jurors in his opening statements, the gunman picked “the perfect place for a mass shooting,” a bustling supermarket where people were stocking up for the week, stopping in for coffee, or picking up lunch.
“King Soopers is more than just a supermarket. It’s their place. It’s a community spot,” Dougherty said. “It’s the place they go over and over and over again. And on this day, it’s a place people will go and die.”
As Dougherty addressed the jury, Alissa – in a white button-down shirt with stripes and dark gray slacks and wearing dark-framed glasses – frequently looked around the courtroom and into gallery, mostly at victims’ families. He seemed to pay close attention.
The slaughter commenced at 2:25 p.m., and for 10 victims “their time on earth is about to come to an end,” the prosecutor told the jury.
“Each one of them, each one of the 10, had lives and families and loved ones and careers and dreams. They had gone there thinking about what they were going to make for dinner, who they were going to have dinner with, a loved one they would never see again.”
Dougherty then recalled the horrifying final moments of the 10 people who died that day, starting with Neven Stanisic, 23, who had fixed the espresso machine at the Starbucks and was on the phone with a co-worker in the minutes before he was killed in the parking lot. Kevin Mahoney, 61, described as a “loving husband, father and grandfather” and a Soopers regular, also was gunned down outside the grocery store. The prosecutor said his body was nearly run over by a woman he had just exchanged a smile with when she sped out of the parking lot in fear moments later.
The victims included Teri Leiker, 51, a longtime Sooper employee and fixture in the community who was fatally shot while bagging groceries with a smile on her face, according to Dougherty. And Jody Waters, 65, who lived the final seconds of her life hiding under a checkout counter. The shooter killed the first eight victims in 68 seconds.
At one point, the defendant spared the life of a 90-year-old man who the prosecutor said showed “no fear” or panic as he came face to face with the gunman.
“What does this tell you? This will tell you that the defendant was intentionally targeting people who were in fear and who were running, who he had power over, who he was scaring and who he could chase and kill,” Dougherty said.
He reminded jurors what they will need to decide, noting the shooter hunted down and executed his victims over and over and “finished them off.”
Related article How the shooting unfolded
“Was the defendant so diseased or defective in mind that he was incapable of distinguishing right from wrong with respect to the murder of 10 individuals and the attempt to murder 25 more or suffering from a condition of mind caused by mental disease or defect, as the statute reads, that prevented him from forming a culpable mental state?” the prosecutor said.
“And in this case, it’s going to be intent. That’s what this case is going to come down to… The central issue is going to be his claim of not guilty by reason of insanity. Mental illness does not mean someone’s insane. Mental illness does not mean someone is insane when someone kills someone, or two people, or three people, or 10 people.”
In the end, realizing he was surrounded and outgunned, the defendant tried to ambush nearly a dozen officers moving in on him in the rear of the supermarket. He fatally wounded an officer before Alissa himself was wounded in the leg, the prosecutor said.
“At this moment, he’s done his ability to instill fear in others, that’s over. And the killing is over,” Dougherty said.
The defendant hears police announce: “The store is surrounded. Surrender now.”
“When you ask yourself in deliberations, did the defendant know the difference between wrong and right, you’ll ask yourself this question, ‘What did he do when they demanded that he surrender?’” Dougherty said, noting the shooter immediately put down his gun and ammo and removed all his clothes except for his underwear.
“I surrender. I give up,” the prosecutor said witnesses reported hearing the defendant yell.
“That’s how you’re going to answer the question of, ‘Did you know the difference between wrong and right?’ He stripped down to his underwear because he knew that if he presented any armed threat to law enforcement, they would likely shoot him again and kill him. And he wanted to live.”
But Dunn stressed that Alissa is far along the schizophrenic spectrum and being treated with Clozaril, which he called “the anti-psychotic of often last resort.”
Under Colorado law, Dunn told jurors, “You can understand what you’re doing is illegal, and you can be insane.”
For someone like Alissa suffering from delusional, paranoid thinking, the public defender added, “Your reality is not the reality of the world, it’s the reality of the illness in your mind.”
Alissa’s “disorganized thinking led to nonsensical, illogical behaviors,” Dunn told the jury.
The defendant’s family emigrated from Syria when Alissa was very young. His disorder went untreated because in Syrian culture mental illness is sometimes confused with demonic possession, Dunn said. That’s what Alissa’s father thought was ailing his son.
A district court judge in 2021 initially ruled Alissa incompetent to stand trial after he was evaluated by a defense expert, two doctors from a state hospital and a doctor selected by the prosecutors, according to court documents filed by the Boulder County District Attorney’s Office. Doctors determined Alissa’s condition got worse while at the Boulder County Jail. He was later sent to the state hospital for treatment.
Last October, however, the judge found him competent, noting that although Alissa was diagnosed with schizophrenia, evaluations did not show he suffered delusions that would interfere with his ability to stand trial.
Colorado District Court Chief Judge Ingrid Bakke at the time “strongly urged” the Colorado Mental Health Institute in Pueblo to retain him due to the “gravity of this case.” The state hospital granted the request. Alissa had been in the hospital for more than a year before his condition began to improve when he resumed taking his antipsychotic medication, according to Bakke’s order.
On July 30, Bakke granted a defense motion asking that Alissa be returned to the Boulder County jail. His lawyers argued that keeping him in Pueblo would deprive “his ability to understand the nature and object of these proceedings.”
Noting Alissa’s right to “consult with counsel” and “meaningfully participate” in his defense, his attorneys wrote: “The magnitude of this case is plain and obvious.”
Families of the victims have grown frustrated with delays in the case, a prosecutor told the court last summer. And more than three years after the bloodshed, a clear motive continues to elude authorities.
The afternoon of the shooting, Boulder police 911 received multiple calls, according to a court affidavit. One caller told dispatchers the shooter shot out the window of a car and chased a man toward the street. Others said the shooter wore “an armored vest.”
Multiple callers said they were hiding in the grocery store. Employees told dispatchers they “observed the suspect shoot an elderly man in the parking lot. The suspect then walked up to the elderly man, stood over him and shot him multiple additional times,” the affidavit said.

Among the people killed was 51-year-old Boulder police Officer Eric Talley, who was one of the first to respond, former Boulder Police Chief Maris Herold said at the time. Witnesses told dispatchers the shooter fired at police, the affidavit said. Officers had exchanged gunfire with Alissa at the store, according to Herold.
The other victims included store manager Rikki Olds, 25; store employee Denny Stong, 20; Tralona “Lonna” Bartkowiak, 49; Suzanne Fountain, 59;  and Lynn Murray, 62.
Witnesses described the confusion and fight for survival in the grocery aisles. Some shoppers fled through rear doors to the employee area, where workers helped them navigate the unfamiliar space to safety. Others hid in storerooms. One man waiting for a Covid vaccine grabbed his two young daughters and hid in a coat closet. A pharmacy technician took cover under a desk and called her family to say she loved them.
Alissa, by the time he was arrested less than hour after the first 911 calls, had “removed all his clothing and was dressed only in shorts,” according to the affidavit. He sustained a gunshot wound to his upper right thigh.
Alissa’s family emigrated from Syria, his 34-year-old brother, Ali Aliwi Alissa, told CNN at the time. The brother said Alissa was paranoid and often believed he was being followed. The suspect lived most of his life in the United States."
5I4L0BZYBP_2YEER8DCKZIGAIX,"Boeing’s next big problem could be a strike by 32,000 workers","By Chris Isidore, CNN","5 minute read Updated 4:17 PM EDT, Mon September 2, 2024",20240901,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/01/business/boeing-strike-threat/,"Boeing has experienced all manner of bad news in the last six years, and almost nothing but problems. Later this month it could add a strike by 32,000 workers to its list of woes.
The contract between Boeing and the International Association of Machinists is due to expire at 11:59 pm PT on September 12. Without a new contract, the workers who build its planes in Washington state are set to start the first strike at the company in 16 years. And right now, the chances of a deal don’t look good, according to the head of the union local.
“We’re far apart is on all the main issues — wages, health care, retirement, time off,” Jon Holden, president of IAM District 751, told CNN this past week. “We continue to work through that, but it’s been a tough slog to get through.”
It’s just the latest in a series of serious and high-profile problems at a company that has dealt with fatal crashes traced to a design flaw in its best-selling jet, accusations that it put profits and production speed ahead of quality and safety, tanking aircraft sales, an agreement to plead guilty to criminal charges that it deceived regulators, and massive financial losses covered by soaring levels of debt.
Both sides say they want to reach a deal without a strike. But the anger of rank-and-file union members over recent contract concessions and difficulties at the once-proud company could make reaching that deal in the short time remaining a tall order.
The launch of Boeing’s long-delayed 777X aircraft has encountered another problem, forcing the company to pause testing and dealing yet another blow to Boeing's reputation. CNN’s Tom Foreman reports.

“We continue to bargain in good faith as we focus on the topics that are important to our employees and their families,” said a statement from Boeing. “We’re confident we can reach a deal that balances the needs of our employees and the business realities we face as a company.”
But Holden said that any deal that can win the support of the rank-and-file needs to recapture some of the concessions the union gave up in two previous agreements since 2008.
Both those talks were contract extensions, rather than negotiations for new deals. And in both cases the union felt forced to agree to concessions, including increased payments by members for health insurance and the loss of traditional pension plans, or risk losing thousands of jobs. Boeing was threatening to build nonunion facilities to handle the production of the 737 Max and the 777X. Boeing, which has one non-union 787 Dreamliner plant in South Carolina, dropped plans to move production of the Max and 777X after the labor deals were reached.
Boeing goes into these talks with a brand new CEO, Kelly Ortberg, who started the job on August 8. He issued a statement that he wants to “reset our relationship” with the union after meeting with Holden and other union leadership in his first week on the job. But Holden said he has not seen any differences in Boeing’s stance at the bargaining table.
Ortberg’s predecessor, former CEO Dave Calhoun, also told investors in July that Boeing’s intention is to avoid a strike and seemed to signal it’d be willing to pay what it takes to avoid a work stoppage.

“We know wage asks will be big,” he said. “We’re not afraid to treat our employees well in this process. So, we’re just going to work as hard as we can not to have a strike.”
The company said that wages for IAM members have increased 60% over the last 10 years due to general wage increases, cost-of-living adjustments and incentive pay. But the union is still angry over the earlier concessions. It is also seeking improved time off and also better job guarantees so it won’t be faced once again with the threat of losing work to nonunion plants.
“We cannot go through another period where a year or two from now where our jobs are threatened,” Holden said,
Numerous unions, including the Teamsters at UPS and the United Auto Workers union at GM, Ford and Stellantis, won double-digit wage increases in recent union deals. But in those and many other cases, they were negotiating with companies making record profits and with plenty of resources to satisfy union demands.
By contrast, the problems at Boeing have resulted in $33.3 billion in core operating losses over the course of the last five years, forcing the company to go deeply into debt. It is in danger of having that debt downgraded to junk bond status, but Holden insists that the union still has leverage in these talks.
Despite its problems, Boeing is still a major force in the US economy and shutting it down will have a wide-ranging impact. Beyond the 32,000 union members out of the nearly 150,000 US employees, the company estimates its own economic impact at $79 billion, supporting 1.6 million direct and indirect jobs at more than 9,900 suppliers spread across all 50 states.
But perhaps more importantly, Boeing is one of only two major suppliers of commercial jets to the airline industry. And the industry is already dealing with Boeing’s delayed deliveries that can’t be ramped back up until it addresses questions about the safety and quality of its planes.
“They haven’t said they can’t afford our proposals,” he said. “They  are reasonable. We’re in a tough position because of decisions they made to keep increasing the dividend and share repurchases, cutting R&D. They’ve been paralyzed to launch a new airplane. It’s because of those decisions and the crashes that we’re in this position.”
One of the union’s bargaining goals is to get a union representative on the Boeing board of directors, which has faced harsh criticism for the company’s many problems.
“The board certainly deserves to be criticized,” Holden said. “We don’t want to run the company. But we want to make sure our voices are being heard about the decisions being made. We love the Boeing Company. It’s the people on the board who don’t. They sacrificed its integrity.”"
5J1ETN8CH1_BVKOFDDFMTX3QIQ,Trump’s hardline new quest to destroy Harris’ momentum,"Analysis by Stephen Collinson, CNN","7 minute read Updated 9:57 AM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240903,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/03/politics/trump-quest-destroy-harris-momentum/,"Donald Trump is trying to crush Democratic nominee Kamala Harris’ persona as a force of change and to destroy her personal credibility as a potential president as their still-fresh competition careens into the final nine weeks before Election Day.
In recent days, the ex-president has unveiled a broad assault using the insult-driven politics with which he won power in 2016, even as his advisers have been pleading with him to focus his attention on top voter concerns including high prices and immigration.
He is seizing on foreign tragedies to accuse the vice president of responsibility for the deaths of US troops in Afghanistan and claiming she’s complicit in killings of hostages in Gaza. He and his running mate, JD Vance, implied her mixed race — heritage that millions of Americans share — is evidence of a sinister “chameleon”-like character that also explains policy reversals on energy and immigration. In an ugly moment, he amplified a sexually themed social media slander against her. And his dark campaign ads allege she will slash Social Security benefits by welcoming millions of undocumented migrants to the country.
And in a reprise of past GOP campaigns branding Democratic nominees as extreme liberals, Trump and his supporters are trying to frame Harris as a communist and a “Bolshevik.” South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem blasted Harris’ running mate, Tim Walz, as a “security risk” because he once taught in China. And Trump has also started to imply the coming election might not be “free and fair” and said in an interview that aired Sunday that it was ridiculous to indict him for “interfering” in the 2020 election. This and other recent comments raised the specter of another national nightmare if he loses in November and refuses to accept defeat.
Trump’s desperation to find traction has also seen him perform his own policy gyrations on reproductive rights as he seeks to narrow a huge gender gap in polling. But his credibility may already be shattered after he built the conservative Supreme Court majority that overturned the nationwide constitutional right to an abortion. Vance also seems to have a knack for alienating female voters — like when he compared Harris to a nerve-struck Miss Teen USA contestant.
Trump is not simply being true to his ill-disciplined self. He’s illustrating his struggle to respond to Harris’ transformation of the race. Increasingly brazen attempts to puncture Harris’ bubble of hope also betray frustration in the Trump camp that she’s managing to distinguish herself from her boss and is presenting a fresher option than her 78-year-old GOP rival. And Trump is showing that there’s almost nothing he won’t do to win.
Trump’s invective amounts to some of the most hardline political rhetoric in years, even by his own standards, and means the next two months are likely to be brutal.
The question is whether this barrage of negative attacks is merely successful in stoking feelings of existential anger Trump uses to drive his base the polls, or whether it begins to tarnish Harris at the margins in battleground states.
It may make some sense for Trump to throw everything he can think of at Harris. In two presidential elections, the ex-president has never risen above 49% of the vote in the so-called blue wall states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin or in the national popular count. So his chances in November may depend more on destroying the current feel-good factor around Harris and depressing her prospects among small groups of persuadable voters in swing states than on holding out hope of winning over new voters himself.
But Trump’s behavior brings its own risks. His antics last week, including a grinning, thumbs-up gravesite campaign photo-op in Arlington National Cemetery that may have broken the law, could bolster Harris’ warnings that Americans are pining for a chance to leave the bitterness and chaos of the Trump era behind.
Even though Harris has restored the contest to a neck-and-neck race, her campaign recognizes the still potent threat from Trump. “Make no mistake: the next 65 days will be very hard,” Harris campaign manager Jennifer O’Malley Dillion wrote in a weekend memo despite arguing the vice president has multiple paths to the White House. “This race will remain incredibly close, and the voters who will decide this election will require an extraordinary amount of work to win over.”
Harris campaigned in Detroit and with Biden in Pittsburgh to mark Labor Day on Monday, reflecting the importance of union members. Blue-collar workers traditionally voted Democrat, but Trump’s cultural transformation of the GOP now appeals to many workers, especially in rural areas. And Harris’ appearance with Biden in the Steel City previewed how the lame-duck president could help her campaign in a state and among a voting demographic where he remains popular.
The campaign swing comes a week before the critical meeting between Harris and Trump on a debate stage slated for September 10 in Philadelphia — one of the final foreseeable turning points of this campaign, with mail-in voting starting later this week.
Trump’s feral political offensive is a warning for Harris about what may lay ahead and underscores how hard it will be to prolong the smooth rollout of her sudden candidacy, her pick of Walz and her successful convention. But the ex-president’s intensity is also a sign — which is reflected in favorable public polling nationally and in swing states — that his early efforts to negatively define her have not worked.
Harris is being criticized by Republicans for a lack of policy specificity and reversing previous positions on fracking and immigration. But her adoption of centrist positions also appears to be squeezing Trump and frustrating his efforts to land a decisive political attack. Her decision to take on high grocery prices with a vow to clamp down on supermarket giants might explain how she’s narrowed the gap with Trump on who is most trusted on the economy.
The flap over Trump’s visit to Arlington National Cemetery last week also showed how the ex-president’s hardball tactics could hurt him as much as her.
Trump’s honoring of 13 US service members killed in a suicide bombing amid the chaotic US evacuation of Afghanistan in 2021 highlights one of the worst moments of the Biden-Harris administration. And while the vice president joined Situation Room meetings on the crisis, it’s not clear yet whether Trump can saddle her with personal responsibility for the deaths in the minds of voters since Biden was commander in chief at the time.
Harris took steps to counter Trump’s Afghan gambit when she wrote on social media that he had “disrespected sacred ground all for the sake of a political stunt” in filming campaign videos at gravesites and that this was part of a pattern of disparaging the sacrifices of American warriors. Trump responded by posting videos of some of the relatives of the fallen soldiers accusing Harris and Biden of complicity in the murder of their loved ones and supporting Trump.
The harrowing episode showed how Trump is willing to cross lines that more conventional politicians would consider off-limits. While some voters might consider he’s honoring slain troops, others might agree with Harris that he is seizing on the deaths of Americans in foreign wars for political gain.
On other issues, Harris is refusing to be drawn into gutter for political fights with Trump that might tarnish her image. For instance, the vice president was asked by CNN’s Dana Bash in an exclusive interview last week about Trump’s claim that she “happened to turn Black” for political reasons. “Same old tired playbook. Next question, please,” Harris said.
The Harris campaign did, however, jump on Trump’s argument that he did nothing wrong in 2020. The ex-president said in a Fox News interview that aired Sunday: “Whoever heard you get indicted for interfering with a presidential election, where you have every right to do it?”
Harris-Walz spokesperson Sarafina Chitika folded his comment into the campaign’s wider argument that it’s time to consign Trump’s dictatorial instincts to the past. “The American people are ready for a new way forward. They know Vice President Harris is the tough-as-nails prosecutor we need to turn the page on chaos, fear, and division, and uphold the rule of law,” Chitika said.
The exchange encapsulated the bets at the center of the campaign’s bitter endgame: Trump is putting his faith in a searing attempt to do anything it takes to bring Harris down; the vice president is wagering that his extreme attempts to do so will convince enough voters he’s unfit to return to the Oval Office."
5L76ZF7ISS_FYA1XVNDZ32L7SP,At least 129 killed during mass prison break attempt in DR Congo,"By Niamh Kennedy and Nimi Princewill, CNN","3 minute read Updated 2:52 PM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240903,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/03/africa/dr-congo-prison-break-intl/,"More than 120 people have been killed in an attempted mass breakout from the largest prison in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the latest in a series of violent attacks on jails in the central African nation.
Prisoners tried to break out en masse from the Makala Central Prison in the capital, Kinshasa, at around 2 a.m. local time (9 p.m. ET) on Monday, Interior Minister Jacquemain Shabani Lukoo Bihango told reporters.
“The provisional human toll stands at 129 dead including 24 by gunshot after warning. The others died by jostling, suffocation and some women were raped,” Bihango said. He added that 59 people were receiving medical care.
One Kinshasa resident, Daddi Soso, told Agence France-Presse that gunfire rang out for several hours during the incident and that he later saw security vehicles removing bodies from the scene.
A series of graphic videos circulating on social media - not verified by CNN - showed dozens of bloodied corpses on the ground.

Extensive damage to several prison buildings was also seen in interior ministry video. A large hole is shown in one exterior wall, where bricks appear to have been removed, while the walls of other buildings are black and burnt out.
Video filmed inside the prison showed several ransacked rooms with debris, burnt office furniture and papers strewn across the floor.
Several prison buildings including offices, the registry, the infirmary and food depots were destroyed by fires during the attempted prison break, the minister told the press conference.
Interior minister Bihango convened a crisis meeting of the country’s defense and security services on Tuesday after receiving instructions from the country’s “senior hierarchy.”
The government is relieved “by the restored calm,” he said, adding that investigations into the incident are ongoing.
More than 12,000 inmates, mostly pretrial detainees, were held in the Makala prison before the attempted jailbreak even though the facility could only contain 1,500 people, according to a recent report by Amnesty International which highlighted the “appalling” detention conditions at the facility.
In a statement on social media Monday, Justice Minister Constant Mutamba condemned the prison break attempt as a “pre-meditated act of sabotage.”
Mutamba barred public prosecutors from transferring any inmates to Makala prison “until further notice” as part of a series of measures he announced to tackle overcrowding at the country’s prisons.
In a statement on X, the European Union called for “an independent and rapid investigation to shed light on these tragic events and establish responsibilities.”
Prison breaks are common in the DRC, with several attacks being launched on correctional facilities in recent years.
More than 50 inmates, including the leader of a religious sect, broke free from the Makala prison in 2017 following an invasion by the group.
And in 2020, a rebel group linked to ISIS claimed responsibility for a jailbreak that freed nearly 1,000 inmates from a prison in Beni, in northeastern DRC. At least 11 people, including security personnel, were killed in that attack.
Another prison break was recorded the following year at Matadi, one of the country’s oldest prisons, which saw the escape of 189 prisoners. More than 200 other detainees escaped from the same prison in 2022 after seizing weapons from the facility’s armory.

The beluga, nicknamed Hvaldimir, rose to fame in 2019 after being spotted wearing a specially-made harness with mounts for a camera, sparking claims that the animal may have been trained by the Russian military.
Two Norwegian animal rights groups alleged on Wednesday that the whale was “shot to death” after Hvaldimir was found dead over the weekend in southern Norway.
OneWhale and NOAH are calling for a criminal investigation “based on compelling evidence that the whale was killed by gunshot wounds,” OneWhale, which describes itself as a “nonprofit committed to protecting Hvaldimir and relocating him to a wild population of belugas,” wrote in an Instagram post.
It added that “several veterinarians, biologists, and ballistics experts have reviewed [the] evidence of Hvaldimir’s injuries, determining that the whale’s death was the result of a criminal act.”
The post included pictures of what appeared to be holes and streaks of blood on the lifeless body of the whale. CNN is unable to independently verify their claim that the whale was shot.
The organizations filed a police report to the Sandnes Police District and the Norwegian National Authority for Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime.
The Southwestern Police District confirmed to CNN on Wednesday that it has received a request to investigate the death of Hvaldimir, though the unit has not yet determined whether it will open a formal inquiry.
“I don’t think we’ve had a case like this before,” said Southwestern Police District Superintendent Victor Fenne-jensen, who declined to comment on whether his department had investigated rumors that the whale was a Russian spy.
He added, Hvaldimir was “kind of a celebrity.”
However, Marine Mind, another non-profit that advocates for protecting marine life, has called the public to “refrain from speculation” until the country’s Veterinary Institute has finished its own investigation.
It was Marine Mind that found Hvaldimir’s body in the bay. “When we found Hvaldimir on Saturday, it was not possible to immediately determine the cause of death, and therefore it is important to refrain from speculation until the institute has completed its work,” Marine Mind posted to its Facebook page on Wednesday.

Before Hvaldimir’s death, OneWhale and NOAH had been collaborating to relocate him to a safer area in northern Norway, and had obtained permits from the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries. CNN has reached out to the Norwegian Ministry of Climate and Environment for comment.
Norwegian public broadcaster NRK reported that his body was found floating at the Risavika Bay in southern Norway Saturday by a father and son who were fishing, according to the Associated Press (AP).
The beluga, named by combining the Norwegian word for whale — hval — and the first name of Russian President Vladimir Putin, was lifted out of the water with a crane and taken to a nearby harbor where experts for experts to examine, AP reported.
Marine biologist Sebastian Strand told NRK Hvaldimir’s cause of death was not immediately clear and that no major external injuries were visible on the animal, the AP reported.
Back in 2019, experts told CNN that Hvaldimir was a trained animal, and evidence suggested that the whale had come from Russia.
Jorgen Ree Wiig, a marine biologist at Norway’s Directorate of Fisheries, told CNN that the Hvaldimir’s harness appeared “specially made” and had “mounts for GoPro cameras on each side of it.”
That the harness clips read “Equipment St. Petersburg” only contributed to the popular theory that he came from Murmansk, Russia, and was trained by the Russian navy."

“The victims, they were all passengers on the train early this morning,” said Forest Park Deputy Chief Chris Chin. “The train was in motion on the way into Forest Park.”
The victims may have been homeless, Chin told CNN. Investigators are working with the Chicago Transit Authority to review surveillance footage of the shooting, which police said happened in two train cars: three in one car and the fourth in another.
“We don’t know for sure what (the victims’) social status is. Looking at the videos, they were asleep on the train,” Chin said.
A suspect was taken into custody about an hour an a half after the shooting, which investigators believe to be an isolated incident and a random attack, police said. Surveillance video was instrumental in identifying the suspect, police said.
“The CTA has great cameras. Their surveillance cameras are excellent,” Chin said.
Three agencies — Forest Park police, Chicago police and the CTA — worked together to track and capture the suspect, Chin said.
Chin told CNN the suspect likely exited the train at the Harlem stop on CTA’s Blue Line. He eventually got on the Pink Line, where he was apprehended by police. Law enforcement also recovered a firearm.
“I was able to watch some of the videos and it seems like they were able to track, locate and then identify or at least be able to pinpoint … OK, this is who Forest Park is looking for. And Chicago was able to nab him and we were able to swoop in and take him into custody.”
“Although this was an isolated incident, this heinous and egregious act of violence should never have occurred, none the less on a public transit train,” the transit authority said in a statement.
As investigators continue to comb through the evidence, prosecutors will have 48 hours from the time of his arrest to announce any charges against the suspect.
“This obviously is shocking, you know, it is uncommon to have a mass shooting like this,” said Chin. “This is an isolated incident, so it can happen anywhere. Obviously, there’s a little bit more concern because it is on a mass transit system,” he added. “For people to feel unsafe, it’s justified.”
CTA’s Blue Line spans 27 miles between O’Hare International Airport to Forest Park, passing through or near dozens of neighborhoods and downtown Chicago.

Forest Park Mayor Rory Hoskins said during a news conference the police and fire departments respond to the same area of Forest Park “probably more than any other location in our jurisdiction,” appealing to state leadership for additional public safety resources and law enforcement personnel.
He said he has traveled to Springfield in the past to call for more resources to deal with mental health and opioid addiction.
The mayor described this shooting an “outlier,” saying the city hasn’t really experienced this kind of shooting before.
Monday’s shooting is among 381 mass shootings in the United States so far this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which, like CNN, defines a mass shooting as one with four or more victims, not including the shooter. There have been an average of 1.5 mass shootings per day in the US in 2024.
Hours after the shooting, another passenger was seriously injured in a stabbing on the Red Line, Chicago police said in a statement. The incident began as a verbal altercation between a 37-year-old victim and an unknown man, who at some point took out a “sharp object” and repeatedly stabbed the victim, police said.
“The victim fled from the train at the Wilson Red Line station, and relocated, on foot, to the 4700 block of N. Broadway. The victim was then transported to Illinois Masonic Hospital initially listed in critical condition,” police told CNN.
A suspect in the stabbing has yet to be found and detectives are investigating.

5XTSWXM80G_RNNZBO9YRAQS0OW,OPEC+ extends oil output cuts again through November,"By Krystal Hur, CNN","2 minute read Updated 4:16 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/05/investing/opec-extend-oil-output-cuts/,"The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies — the coalition of the world’s top oil producers known as OPEC+ — said Thursday that it is extending oil production cuts once again as crude and fuel prices continue to slump.
The countries making up the organization will extend their production cuts of 2.2 million barrels per day through November and plans to phase out those voluntary cuts beginning in December until November 2025, OPEC+ said in a Thursday release.
This isn’t the first time OPEC+ has extended output cuts in a bid to boost crude prices. The group in June lengthened the 2.2 million barrels per day cut through the end of September. That same month, OPEC+ extended a cut of 1.65 million barrels per day announced in April 2023 until the end of 2025.
Oil prices rose initially but settled slightly lower Thursday. West Texas Intermediate crude futures, the US benchmark, settled at $69.15 barrel. Brent crude futures, the international benchmark, settled at $72.69 a barrel.
Oil prices have declined this year despite continued output cuts and ongoing geopolitical tension in the Middle East. Concerns about waning demand in China, the world’s largest oil importer, have helped keep a lid on prices, as has record output from the United States. US oil fell below $70 a barrel Wednesday for the first time since December 12, 2023.
OPEC+ has restrained output for about two years in an effort to prevent a huge supply surplus that could weigh on prices and hurt the oil-dependent economies of its member states.
In June, the International Energy Agency said that a glut of oil supply could weaken the sway OPEC+ has over oil prices. Global oil supply could outstrip demand by a “staggering” 8 million barrels per day by 2023, according to forecasts published by the agency in its medium-term oil market report.
The agency said in July that it expects global oil demand to grow by 970,000 barrels per day in 2024, up slightly from its 960,000 barrels per day forecast the prior month. In May, the IEA had projected demand to grow by 1.1 million barrels per day.

Britain’s High Court in 2022 ruled mostly in favor of the US technology company, which accused Lynch and his former finance director of fraud over its $11 billion takeover of his software company Autonomy. Hewlett Packard is seeking up to $4 billion in damages and the judge is expected to issue a decision on the final sum soon.
Lynch’s widow, Angela Bacares, could now be liable for the damages. Lynch died when his yacht, the Bayesian, sank in a storm off Sicily on August 19.
Months before the sinking, Lynch was acquitted in a separate US criminal trial of fraud and conspiracy charges in the deal.
Hewlett Packard initially celebrated the costly acquisition of Lynch’s company in 2011 but quickly came to regret it. The company said in a statement Monday that it had “substantially succeeded” in its civil fraud claims against Lynch and Sushovan Hussain, the former finance director.

“It is HPE’s intention to follow the proceedings through to their conclusion.”
However, the judge in the UK civil case has already ruled that the amount payable in damages would be “substantially less” than the company is seeking.
A spokesperson for Lynch’s family declined to comment.
Lynch and his daughter Hannah were among six passengers who died when the 56-meter (184-foot) luxury yacht went down. One crew member, the boat’s chef, also died, while 15 people survived the disaster. They had gathered on the yacht to celebrate Lynch’s acquittal.
Officials initially said the yacht was struck by a tornado over the water, known as a waterspout, but the weather phenomenon was re-identified as a downburst. Prosecutors in Italy are investigating the captain on possible charges including manslaughter."

A federal judge in Manhattan denied his initial request to move the case to the Southern District of New York on Tuesday. Trump’s attorneys filed a notice of appeal of that decision soon after.
Trump’s legal team filed the petition last week to move the state case to federal court in the wake of the Supreme Court’s presidential immunity decision. They also asked the federal judge to postpone Trump’s sentencing, currently set for September 18.
Last week, Trump’s attorneys asked Judge Juan Merchan to refrain from issuing a decision over presidential immunity to allow the process in federal court to play out. Merchan had previously said he’d rule on that motion September 16.
In a letter filed with the state court on Wednesday, the Manhattan district attorney’s office said Trump now has no basis for his request to pause the state proceedings because of that federal ruling.
“Because there is no pending notice of removal with the federal court, there is no basis for the relief sought in defendant’s August 29 letter-motion,” the letter says.
The letter does not reference Trump’s notice of appeal.
Merchan still has not ruled on Trump’s separate request to delay the sentencing until after the election.
The judge could issue a decision as soon as this week.

Critics of the phrase, which refers to the land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, say that it calls for the abolishment of the Israeli state. The Anti-Defamation League accused the slogan of being antisemitic and a “rallying cry (that) has long been used by anti-Israel voices, including supporters of terrorist organizations such as Hamas.”
But the chant is also frequently used at pro-Palestinian demonstrations by protesters who say it is to call for equal rights and an independent state for Palestinians. It can refer to Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza who are restricted in their movements and from visiting Jerusalem.
The Board said it reviewed three cases involving the use of “From the River to the Sea” on Facebook and said that all appeals to remove the content were closed without human review. Those users then appealed to the Board, which exists for users to challenge Meta’s appeals process on Facebook, Instagram or Threads.
“Specifically, the three pieces of content contain contextual signs of solidarity with Palestinians – but no language calling for violence or exclusion. They also do not glorify or even refer to Hamas, an organization designated as dangerous by Meta,” the decision said. The posts and comments also didn’t contain threats of violence or physical harm.
Though the majority of the Board agreed the phrase has multiple meanings, the decision noted that a minority believed it glorifies Hamas because it appeared in the group’s 2017 charter.
“The phrase’s use by this terrorist group with explicit violent eliminationist intent and actions, does not make the phrase inherently hateful or violent – considering the variety of people using the phrase in different ways,” the Board said.
The Board said the decision underscores tensions in protecting free expression and political speech.
In June, a Palestinian-American engineer sued Meta, accusing his former employer of discriminating against pro-Palestinian speech and wrongfully firing him when he investigated those issues.
“The employee was dismissed for violating Meta’s data access policies, which we make clear to employees will result in immediate termination,” Meta spokesperson Andy Stone said in a statement to CNN at the time.
The company said it is expanding on its hate speech policies. In July, Meta said it would remove posts that have the term “Zionist” when used in conjunction with antisemitic tropes or dehumanizing rhetoric.
“These cases have again underscored the importance of data access to effectively assess Meta’s content moderation during conflicts, as well as the need for a method to track the amount of content attacking people based on a protected characteristic,” the decision said.
The chant had been contentious even before the Israel and Hamas war, which has killed more than 40,000 Palestinians after Hamas’ October 7th attack that killed more than 1,200 Israelis and took 250 hostage. For example, in 2018 CNN said it severed ties with a liberal pundit after he called for a “free Palestine from the river to the sea.”
But new attention has been drawn to the chant as protesters call for an end to the war, and the phrase is frequently used at protests ranging from college campuses to large cities. In Germany, using the slogan “From the river to the sea” is now a criminal offense. In December, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) filed a discrimination complaint on behalf of a Black Muslim Arab American teacher in Maryland after she was placed on administrative leave for her email signature, which contained the slogan. US Congress member Rashida Tlaib was censured for using the phrase.
The slogan used in the cases had wide reach through Meta’s platforms. In one case, a likely AI-generated image of floating watermelon slices that formed the slogan was viewed about eight million times and reported by 937 users.

Grayson, 30, is now charged with murder in the July 6 death of Sonya Massey; he has pleaded not guilty. Massey, a mother of two, joined Breonna Taylor and Atatiana Jefferson on a list of Black women killed in their own homes by law enforcement – whose deadly use of force came under scrutiny.
Massey’s death has led to renewed calls for a national, comprehensive database for tracking officers’ disciplinary issues or criminal offenses.
“Sonya Massey lost her life due to an unjustifiable and reckless decision by former Deputy Sean Grayson,” the Sangamon County sheriff said in a statement after firing Grayson.
An attorney representing Grayson, Daniel Fultz, declined to comment to CNN for this story.
Now, more details are emerging about Grayson’s alleged misconduct prior to killing Massey. Here’s a timeline of some of Grayson’s issues with the law, the military and his work in policing – which spanned six agencies in four years:"

Then a crash sounded, a rare 3,500-year-old jar was broken on the ground, and her son stood over it, aghast.
“It was just a distraction of a second,” said Geller, a mother of three from the northern Israeli town of Nahariya. “And the next thing I know, it’s a very big boom boom behind me.”
The Bronze Age jar that her son, Ariel Geller, broke last week, has been on display at the Hecht Museum in Haifa for 35 years. It was one of the only containers of its size and from that period still complete when it was discovered. It was likely used to hold wine or oil, and dates back to between 2200 and 1500 B.C.
What could be considered every parent’s worst nightmare became a learning experience Friday, as the Geller family returned to the museum, which is associated with Haifa University in northern Israel. Ariel gifted the museum a clay vase of his own and was met with forgiving staff and curators.
Alex Geller said Ariel — the youngest of his three children — is exceptionally curious, and that the moment he heard the crash last Friday, “please let that not be my child” was the first thought that raced through his head.
“I’m embarrassed,” said Anna Geller, who said she tried desperately to calm her son down after the vase shattered. “He told me he just wanted to see what was inside.”
The jar was one of many artifacts exhibited out in the open, part of the Hecht Museum’s vision of letting visitors explore history without glass barriers, said Inbal Rivlin, the director of the museum.
She said she wanted to use the restoration as an educational opportunity and to make sure the Gellers — who curtailed their initial museum visit soon after Ariel broke the jar last week — felt welcome to return.

Nahariya, where the family lives, is in an area just south of Israel’s border with Lebanon that has come under Hezbollah rocket fire for more than 10 months, in a conflict linked to the war in Gaza. The family has been visiting museums and taking day trips around Israel this summer to escape the tensions, Alex Geller said.
There were a lot of kids at the museum that day, and he said when he heard the crash he prayed that the damage had been caused by someone else. When he turned around and saw it was his son, he was “in complete shock.”
He went over to the security guards to let them know what had happened in hopes that it was a model and not a real artifact. The father even offered to pay for the damage.
“But they called and said it was insured and after they checked the cameras and saw it wasn’t vandalism they invited us back for a make-up visit,” Alex Geller said.
Experts were using 3D technology and high-resolution videos to restore the jar, which could be back on display as soon as next week.
“That’s what’s actually interesting for my older kids, this process of how they’re restoring it, and all the technology they’re using there,” Alex Geller said.

Roee Shafir, a restoration expert at the museum, said the repairs would be fairly simple, as the pieces were from a single, complete jar. Archaeologists often face the more daunting task of sifting through piles of shards from multiple objects and trying to piece them together.
Shafir, who was painstakingly reassembling the jar, said the artifacts should remain accessible to the public, even if accidents happen because touching an artifact can inspire a deeper interest in history and archaeology.
“I like that people touch. Don’t break, but to touch things, it’s important,” he said."
6GQOTH8M2A_T43O4UKGRAMKZDR,Got an unaffordable or incorrect medical bill? Calling your hospital billing office will usually get you a discount,"Analysis by Erin Duffy, University of Southern California","4 minute read Published 6:00 AM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/03/health/medical-bill-the-conversation-partner/,"Editor’s note: The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer. CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation, a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation.
What do you do when you disagree with or can’t afford a medical bill?
Many Americans struggle to pay medical bills, avoid care because of cost worries or forgo other needs due to health care cost burdens.
It can be hard to understand what you’re being charged for on a medical bill. I’m a health policy and economics researcher who studies insurance and out-of-pocket health care expenses, and even I sit at my kitchen table trying to wrap my head around bills and explanations of benefits.

In my newly published research, I surveyed a nationally representative sample of 1,135 American adults – a subset of participants from the University of Southern California’s Understanding America Study – to find out how they handle troubling medical bills. I learned that advocating for yourself can pay off when it comes to medical bills, and you may be missing out on financial relief when you don’t pick up the phone.
My team and I found that 1 in 5 patients had received a health care bill in the prior year that they disagreed with or couldn’t afford. Nearly 35% of the bills came from doctor’s offices, nearly 20% from emergency rooms or urgent care and over 15% from hospitals. Other sources of bills included labs, imaging centers and dental offices.

A little over 61% of respondents contacted the billing office about a troubling bill, but 2 in 5 did not. Why not? About 86% of patients said they did not think it would make a difference.
But reaching out got results. Nearly 76% of patients who reached out got financial relief for an unaffordable bill. Nearly 74% who spoke up about a potential billing mistake received bill corrections. For those who negotiated their bills, nearly 62% saw a price drop.
Additionally, 18% of patients who reached out got a better understanding of their bill, 16% set up payment plans and a little over 7% got the bill canceled altogether. Nearly 22% said their issue was unresolved, and 24% reported no change.
The majority of people who reached out about their medical bills reported that it took less than one hour to handle their issue.
We found that people with a more extroverted and less agreeable personality – based on the Big Five Personality Test – were more likely to reach out about a medical bill. People without a college degree, with lower financial literacy or with no health insurance were less likely to reach out to a billing office.
Differences in who does and doesn’t call about a medical bill may be exacerbating inequalities in how much people end up paying for health care and who has medical debt.
Many Americans are in health plans with high out-of-pocket cost sharing, including high-deductible plans. This so-called consumer-directed health careparadigm is intended to motivate consumers to be more cost-conscious when seeking care and navigating their bills. But by design, it puts the burden on patients to deal with billing issues.

Another recent study my team and I conducted found that 87% of U.S. hospitals offer their own payment plans, but only 22% of these put plan details on their websites. You have to call for more information.
In another recent study, my team called hospitals as “secret shoppers” planning an elective knee surgery. We sought information critical to assessing affordability: financial assistance, payment plans and payment timing options. While the information was often available, it was hard to access. We couldn’t reach a representative with information at about 18% of hospitals, even after calling on three different days. We were typically directed to three different offices to get all the information we wanted.
Policymakers have made strides in price transparency in recent years. For example, hospitals are required to post prices for their products and services. Practices and policies that further reduce the administrative burden of accessing aid and navigating troubling bills.
Patients who make the call are benefiting when it comes to medical bills.
A colleague who knew I was working on this study asked me for advice about a $425 bill her household had received for a lab test at an urgent care center. The bill seemed inflated and unfair, forcing an unexpected stretch to her budget.

I told her it was worth a call to the billing office to express her feelings about the bill and see whether any adjustments could be made to the amount owed or the timing of payment.
It was worth the call. The billing office representative offered three options on the spot: a.) a payment plan, b.) a prompt payment of $126 paid immediately over the phone to settle the account, or c.) financial assistance if eligible based on income.
My colleague chose option b and paid less than one-third of the original bill amount.
The next time you get a medical bill that troubles you, pick up the phone or ask a disagreeable extrovert to make the call for you.

Is it the Aston Martin car chases, always along some scenic route? The exotic locales? The beautiful love interests — culminating in a steamy rendezvous? Or, is it just the British accents?
Whatever it is, there’s something about spy flicks we can’t get enough of. Since the genre’s emergence, espionage has taken over both big and small screens, from long-standing franchises like James Bond, to newer efforts like the “Kingsman” series or the subversive “The 355.”
On TV, the success of shows like “Homeland,” “The Americans,” and the newer “Slow Horses” — which begins its fourth season Wednesday on Apple TV+ — highlight our collective fascination with spy narratives.
Even in a time where the genre movie has all but faded in favor of endless remakes and sequels, where television shows are often canceled shortly after they air, spy stories still grip our imaginations and studios’ pockets.
But the genre is more than just splashy gimmicks helmed by a suave protagonist. The ubiquity of these stories reveals something deeper, not just about our world, but about ourselves.
As a genre, espionage was first born from literature, where spy novels and spy fiction grew in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, alongside increasing globalization and imperial force, said film historian Samhita Sunya. An early example is Rudyard Kipling’s 1901 novel, “Kim,” which follows an Irish boy living in India during British rule, who eventually becomes a spy.
The book is an early indication of what spy novels, and later, the spy genre as a whole, grew to be: portrayals of larger, geopolitical fears. The genre then peaked during the Cold War era, Sunya said, amidst worries of nuclear catastrophe between the US and the former USSR.
As these tensions play out on the global stage, they also play out in popular media. “Dr. No,” the first James Bond movie, released in 1962, is a prime example. The titular Dr. No, who is part of the international terrorist group SPECTRE, is a half Chinese, half German nuclear scientist, eventually defeated by Bond.
“It was almost maintaining this balance of power, and this fear of third parties also going nuclear,” Sunya said. “And that included stateless organizations, as well as anxiety about China becoming a nuclear power.”
Now, we’re experiencing another peak in the espionage genre, Sunya said. In a world of artificial intelligence and the threat of disease following the global pandemic, similar anxieties are once again arising — and making their way into spy fiction.
Last year’s “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One” and “Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre” epitomize those modern fears. In both films, saving the world means defeating either a corrupt sentient AI or stopping an AI tool from being used for evil.
These movies were released during a year dominated by AI. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman appeared in front of a Senate panel calling for increased governmental regulation of the controversial technology, and the Biden administration launched an executive order aiming to address the associated risks.
These confounding anxieties, in real life and in the media, feed into each other. The lines between fiction and reality can start to blur.
“You’re seeing it in art forms like films and TV, or books. That’s making people more interested in these narratives. And then they’re hearing in the media, or from government sources, that there is a real risk as well,” said Julia Tatiana Bailey, an art historian and curator at the Rudolfinum Gallery in Prague. “It just feeds into this paranoia.”
Spy fiction isn’t all just sociopolitical underpinnings. These movies have become blockbusters for a reason. They are global escapades — see Italy’s grandiose Amalfi Coast and the bustle of Mumbai, India, in Christopher Nolan’s 2020 spy thriller “Tenet.”
Or let your eyes feast on the visual buffet that is Daniel Craig stalking the streets of Mexico City during a Day of the Dead parade in 2015’s “Spectre” — a 4-minute scene that alone has gathered almost 4 million views on YouTube. In 1996’s “Mission: Impossible,” some of the film’s most dramatic moments are backdropped by the cobblestone streets of the Czech Republic’s Prague.
Of course, there are also the gadgets, the cars, the sex, even the outfits — all of which lends a certain erotic thrill that has become synonymous with the genre, and contributed to its wide appeal.
In the 1960s, for example, Eurospy films — a genre of movies that emerged in Europe mimicking the Bond movies — became hugely popular in South Asia, Sunya said. Newspapers would advertise these movies as “adults only,” because of their association with this type of erotic spectacle. Still, these movies became so popular that other countries began developing their own spy films, too.
The genre, then, became its own universe, existing outside of the geopolitical context with which it plays. We romanticize spies and the glamor around them, enough to ignore the political tensions and nervous questions some stories raise.
Ultimately, most Americans don’t know much about what spies are actually doing, Bailey said. We know covert activity happens because, occasionally, it’s publicly revealed. Last year, for example, China claimed a CIA spy was embedded in the Chinese military. This activity could be all around us, existing beneath our everyday lives. That mystery is what makes espionage so appealing in fiction.
“We’re getting an insight through fiction into a world that we know is there, but we just have no other access to it,” Bailey said.
Spy fiction teeters along that line of knowing and unknowing. On one hand, those stories are made-up figments of the author’s imagination. On the other hand, there are clandestine activities happening behind the scenes — and that secrecy plays into our anxieties, too.
“There’s a lot of interesting questions to ask about what’s reality, and what’s our sense of reality, and who’s controlling us,” Bailey said. “And all these questions come through spy stories as well.”
Nowadays, the life of a spy is much less glamorous than what might be presented to us on our screens, Bailey said. Think less exciting car chases, more sitting at a desk looking up data.
But the image of spies running around chasing bad guys is a fun one. In espionage fiction, there’s a clear good guy and bad guy. The work itself is courageous and risky. Our protagonists become heroes, and we are their accomplices, trying to solve the problem of the day right alongside them.
Yet spy fiction and its ongoing popularity reveal how we use these stories to understand real-life issues, Sunya said.
“The forms and stories that that takes, even if extremely imaginative or exaggerated or spectacular, end up telling us something about how we’re trying to make sense of the real world in that moment,” she said.
Sure, there are sociopolitical reasons why certain spy movies and shows are made and popularized in specific moments. The genre can also expose our fears about our world, or our increasing distrust in governmental institutions.
Still, we’ll turn to espionage fiction and all its blockbuster charm. Who, after all, can resist a good story?"
6KDH81SPY2_UVI0MWBER7H9G99,Scientific discovery that turns mouse skin transparent echoes plot of H.G. Wells’ ‘The Invisible Man’,"By Katie Hunt, CNN","5 minute read Updated 4:32 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/05/science/food-dye-transparent-mice-skin/,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.
In H.G. Wells’ 1897 science fiction novel, “The Invisible Man,” the protagonist invents a serum that makes the cells in his body transparent by controlling how they bend light.
More than 100 years later, scientists have discovered a real-life version of the substance: A commonly used food coloring can make the skin of a mouse temporarily transparent, allowing scientists to see its organs function, according to a new study published Thursday in the journal Science.
The breakthrough could revolutionize biomedical research and, should it be successfully tested in humans, have wide-ranging applications in medicine and health care, such as making veins more visible to draw blood.
Researchers made the skin on the skulls and bellies of live mice transparent by applying a mixture of water and a yellow food coloring called tartrazine. Washing away any remaining solution reversed the process, which did not harm the animals. The mice’s fur was removed before the application of the solution.
“For those who understand the fundamental physics behind this, it makes sense; but if you aren’t familiar with it, it looks like a magic trick,” said the study’s first author, Zihao Ou, assistant professor of physics at the University of Texas at Dallas, in a statement.
The “magic” uses insights from the field of optics. Light-absorbing dye molecules enhance the transmission of light through the skin by suppressing the tissue’s ability to scatter light.
The dye, when mixed with water, modifies the refractive index — a measure of the way a substance bends light — of the aqueous part of the tissue to better match the index of proteins and fats in the tissue. The process is akin to a dissipating cloud of fog.
“We combined the yellow dye, which is a molecule that absorbs most light, especially blue and ultraviolet light, with skin, which is a scattering medium,” said Ou, who conducted the study as a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University in California.

“Individually, these two things block most light from getting through them,” he said. “But when we put them together, we were able to achieve transparency of the mouse skin.”
Once the dye had completely diffused into the skin, the skin became transparent.
“It takes a few minutes for the transparency to appear,” Ou said. “It’s similar to the way a facial cream or mask works: The time needed depends on how fast the molecules diffuse into the skin.”
The team experimented with chicken breasts before conducting work on live animals.
In mice, the researchers were able to observe blood vessels directly in the surface of the brain through the transparent skin of the skull. The mice’s internal organs were visible in the abdomen as well as the muscle contractions that move food through the digestive tract.
The transparent areas take on an orangish color, Ou said, similar to that of the food dye.
The dye used in the solution is commonly known as FD&C Yellow No. 5, certified for use by the US Food and Drug Administration. The synthetic dye is frequently used in orange- or yellow-colored snack chips, candy coating, ice cream and baked goods. However, a 2021 study by the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment linked the coloring with behavioral difficulties and decreased attention among children. A state bill, if signed into law, would ban the use of the food coloring in food served in public schools in California.
Ou said it was important that the dye is biocompatible — safe for living organisms. “In addition, it’s very inexpensive and efficient; we don’t need very much of it to work,” he said.
The researchers have not tested the process on humans, and it’s not clear what dosage of dye or delivery method would be necessary. Human skin is about 10 times thicker than that of a mouse, according to the researchers.
“Looking forward, this technology could make veins more visible, easing … the procedure of drawing blood or administering fluids via a needle — especially for elderly patients with veins that are difficult to locate,” said senior author Guosong Hong, a Stanford assistant professor of materials science, via email.
“Moreover, this innovation could assist in the early detection of skin cancer, improve light penetration for deep tissue treatments like photodynamic and photothermal therapies, and make laser-based tattoo removal more straightforward.”
Christopher Rowlands, a senior lecturer in the department of bioengineering at Imperial College London, said he was “kicking himself” for not coming up with the same insight as the Stanford-led team, which is based on the widely studied and long-standing physics principle called Kramers-Kronig relations: When a material absorbs a lot of light at one color, it will bend light more at other colors.
“It’s blatantly obvious when someone points it out, but no one had thought of it for 100 and something years,” said Rowlands, who wasn’t involved in the study but coauthored a commentary published alongside the research.
Along with Jon Gorecki, an experimental optical physicist at the same institution who also wasn’t involved in the study, Rowlands wrote that the approach offered a new way to visualize the structure and activity of deep tissues and organs in a living animal in a safe, temporary and noninvasive manner.
Related article Old mice grow young again in study. Can people do the same?
“It just works. You rub it on a mouse, and you can see what it had for breakfast. It’s that powerful,” he added.
Rowlands and Gorecki said that existing methods to turn tissue transparent use solutions that have side effects such as dehydration and swelling and can alter the structure of the tissue. However, tartrazine was used at a low concentration, and its effects were easily undone, potentially facilitating prolonged study of biological processes in live animals, they wrote.
The duo noted the discovery was an example of life imitating art, with the dye solution echoing the serum imagined in “The Invisible Man.”
“The protagonist (in the story) invents a serum that renders the cells in his body transparent by precisely controlling their refractive index to match that of the surrounding medium, air,” they wrote.
“One hundred twenty-seven years later … biocompatible dyes make living tissues transparent by tuning the refractive index of the surrounding medium to match that of the cells.”

However, Ou and Hong said a totally invisible mouse was a stretch: The current approach cannot render bone transparent.
“So far, we only tested soft tissues, including brain, muscle, and skin. We haven’t done much investigation with hard tissues such as bone, so I am not sure if we would be able to make the mouse completely invisible,” Ou said via email.
“However, a partially transparent (mouse) will already enable numerous research opportunities to answer questions relating to development, regeneration, as well as aging.”"
6KI3OOX3H9_U1X4T0AW0FVW4JC,"‘Ferocious violence’ accompanied ‘shocking’ levels of abuse at Ireland’s religious-run schools, report finds","By Kara Fox, CNN","4 minute read Updated 9:09 AM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/04/europe/ireland-child-sex-abuse-schools-report-intl/,"Nearly 2,400 allegations of sexual abuse across hundreds of Ireland’s religious-run schools have been documented in a new report, marking the latest grim revelations to emerge from the country’s historic Church-State entanglement.
The report, released Tuesday, documented 2,395 allegations of historical child sexual abuse, involving 884 alleged abusers in 308 schools across the country.
Most of the allegations were reported from the records of 42 religious orders that currently run or previously ran schools in Ireland. The scope of the allegations ranges from 1927-2013. More than half the men accused – which include teachers and priests – have died, it said.
Ireland’s Minister for Education Norma Foley said Tuesday that the level of abuse detailed in the report was “truly shocking – and so is the number of alleged abusers.”
She called the report a “harrowing document, containing some of the most appalling accounts of sexual abuse.”
More than 140 survivors provided harrowing testimony for the report, describing being molested, stripped naked, raped and drugged in “an atmosphere of terror and silence.”
Their abuse was often “accompanied by ferocious violence,” the 700-page report said.
Most of the survivors interviewed for the report are men now in their 50s, 60s and 70s. Some said it was the first time they‘d spoken about the abuse and its impact on them, with many saying that their childhood “stopped the day the abuse started.”
Some survivors said the abuse was “so pervasive” that it could not have gone unnoticed by senior leadership within the religious orders that were running the schools. They added that they believed some of those leaders not only ignored the abuse but facilitated and participated in it.
Others said that they believed there had been a “cover-up” in the schools or by the religious order, and “collusion” between the State and Church.
“Many participants said that they felt that the power of the Catholic Church permeated their lives in every way and, for the majority, they felt there was no one they could tell, including their parents,” the report said.
The Catholic Church has been deeply entwined with the Irish state for much of its history. Although a referendum in the 1970s drastically reduced the Church’s political sway, it remained pervasive in many aspects of civil society. Today, nearly 90% of schools in Ireland remain Catholic, even though the percentage of the population that identifies as such is much lower.
As adults, survivors detailed a litany of difficulties stemming from the abuse, including failed relationships, mental and physical health problems and addiction issues. Some said that the abuse made them decide not to have children. Others who did said it impacted their parenting.
Many survivors said that they had moved away from family and friends to avoid memories of childhood trauma and described feeling alienated from religious services. Some avoided attending a parent’s funeral or other family event because they said they could not enter a church as a result of the abuse.
A government-mandated investigation into sexual abuse at religious-run boarding and day-schools was first launched after Ireland’s national broadcaster RTÉ aired a documentary in 2022 that highlighted systemic sexual abuse at Blackrock College, a prestigious private school in Dublin.

The report found that the abuse was spread across public and private schools, including 17 special education schools – which recorded 590 allegations involving 190 alleged abusers.
Foley said on Tuesday that the Irish government would begin a process of establishing a commission to further investigate the abuse and that a redress scheme would be established.
She said that religious orders have a “moral obligation” to contribute to any future redress scheme.
Meanwhile, those religious orders have not committed to contribute to the Mother and Baby Homes redress scheme, which opened for applications earlier this year.
The 2021 Mother and Baby Homes report found that 9,000 babies and children died in 18 of Ireland’s mother and baby homes – church-run institutions where unmarried women were sent to deliver their babies in secret, often against their will – over eight decades.
The religious congregations who ran Ireland’s Magdalene Laundries – workhouses where thousands of women and girls lived and worked without pay for years in “harsh and physically demanding” situations – have also declined to contribute to a State redress scheme set up in 2013 to compensate the survivors of those institutions."

The decision came after the estate of the late R&B artist and songwriter Isaac Hayes sought an emergency injunction to stop the Trump campaign from using the song at campaign events, alleging the campaign does not have approval.
Judge Thomas Thrash Jr. made the ruling from the bench in court in Atlanta, Georgia.
“I do order Trump and his campaign to not use the song without proper license,” he said.
The judge denied a motion by the Hayes estate to force the Trump campaign to take down any previously recorded uses of the song.
Ronald Coleman, an attorney for Trump, told members of the media after the hearing that “the campaign has no interest in annoying or hurting anyone. And if the Hayes family feels it hurts or annoys them, that’s fine, we’re not going to force the issue.”
Coleman said they were pleased the judge didn’t order the campaign to take down any previous uses of the song.
Hayes died in 2008 after suffering a stroke. He was 65.
The 1966 song, co-written by Hayes and David Porter, was performed by Sam Moore and Dave Prater, who were professionally known as the duo Sam & Dave. Prater died in 1988.
CNN has reached out to a representative for Moore for comment.
According to court documents obtained by CNN, attorneys for the Hayes estate claim that the campaign has not “obtained a valid public performance license” and are requesting “compensatory damages for the unauthorized use” of Hayes’ music.
The Hayes estate alleges that Trump began using Hayes’ material as “outro” music at campaign events in 2020 and have continued to use his music in 2024, as seen in one of Trump’s recent posts on Truth Social in which “Hold On, I’m Comin’” can be heard playing at a rally.
“We are very grateful and happy for the decision by Judge Thrash,” Isaac Hayes III said after the hearing. “I want this to serve as an opportunity for other artists to come forward that don’t want their music used by Donald Trump or other political entities.”

In their response to the lawsuit, attorneys for the Republican National Committee and the Trump campaign claim the Hayes estate is not the license holder for the song.
On Monday, Hayes III posted a letter dated June 5, 2024, that he said was from BMI, an organization that collects license fees from businesses for the use of music.
“Donald Trump for President has been claiming they had a valid @BMI license to play “Hold On, I’m Coming” for weeks. FALSE,” the post on X reads. “Donald Trump for President has not had valid license for nealy 100 days, and @realDonaldTrump has NEVER had a license. Not to mention the numerous uses before Nov. 30th, 2022.”
The estate is the first to end up in court over complaints of Trump and his campaign allegedly using music they had not properly licensed, but other artists have complained.
Beyoncé, Bruce Springsteen, Celine Dion, Prince’s estate and Foo Fighters have publicly complained and/or disavowed Trump using their music.

6MNGR27QHU_2ZB3E3RMYSK80CH,Takeaways from Donald Trump’s election interference court hearing,"By Tierney Sneed and Jeremy Herb, CNN","7 minute read Updated 6:02 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/05/politics/takeaways-trump-jan-6-election-hearing/,"It didn’t take long after Thursday’s hearing in the federal election subversion case against Donald Trump – the first proceeding before Judge Tanya Chutkan since the Supreme Court granted the former president some immunity in the prosecution – for the trial judge to decide a schedule for the next steps in the case that lets prosecutors make public new evidence before the 2024 election.
Chutkan made clear that a potential trial date is far off, but she issued a scheduling order Thursday afternoon to push the case forward and tackle the question of presidential immunity following the Supreme Court’s July ruling — allowing prosecutors to issue a filing later this month, with supporting evidence, to defend special counsel Jack Smith’s reworked indictment that was handed up last week.
During the hearing, Chutkan previewed her thinking on how the case should advance. She was skeptical of the Trump team’s request that she first decide whether the then-Vice President Mike Pence-related allegations in the indictment were immune, and Chutkan repeatedly stressed the discretion she believes she has for how she structures the proceedings in her courtroom.
Though Thursday’s one-hour-and-15-minute hearing was mainly about process, a sharp back-and-forth she had with a Trump attorney brought attention to how the 2024 election is looming over the case.
Here are takeaways from the hearing:
The judge did not issue a ruling from the bench on the schedule, but she issued an order with her schedule to deal with several pretrial motions – including immunity – on Thursday afternoon.
During Thursday’s hearing, prosecutors explained why they want the chance to file an opening brief that would argue why they believe their new indictment complies with the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling. Trump’s attorneys argued against that and proposed a longer schedule.
Chutkan’s scheduling order called for the first brief to be filed by prosecutors on September 26, after Chutkan pushed prosecutor Thomas Windom for dates on how quickly the special counsel’s office could file the brief they proposed defending the new indictment.
Windom deferred to the judge – not putting on the record a date itself – while telling the judge they would need two to three weeks, meaning the end of this month.
“We do actually have to write this thing,” Windom said, prompting Chutkan to joke that maybe Windom had it in his binder.
“I would be surprised by that,” Windom responded.
At the same time, he emphasized that prosecutors would leave the exact timing “to the court’s discretion.”
Chutkan’s scheduling order included deadlines for a reply brief from Trump’s lawyers on October 17 and a reply from the special counsel on October 29 – meaning the filings will come in the final weeks of the campaign, and Chutkan could decide the issue more quickly than what Trump’s lawyers proposed. There is no hearing scheduled on the immunity question in her new order, but she could request oral arguments on the matter later on.
The evidence the special counsel’s office will reveal in its late September filing may not be immediately public, and Chutkan will be able to control its release. It is likely it would become available, though, potentially with redactions.
As the judge debated with Trump attorney John Lauro over how quickly she should move to allow the prosecution to file a brief defending their indictment on immunity, they eventually addressed the political elephant in the courtroom: the looming presidential election.
After a back and forth with the judge over what the process should be for deciding the immunity issues in the case, Lauro acknowledged that among his team’s concerns about the prosecutors’ proposed approach is what would be aired on the court’s public record at a “sensitive time.”
The crux of the process disagreement comes down to who gets to file their immunity brief first and when that brief gets filed.
“This court is not concerned with the electoral schedule,” Chutkan pushed back.
“We are talking about the presidency of the United States,” Lauro said.
“I am not talking about the presidency,” Chutkan said. “I am talking about a four-count indictment.”
“The subtext of your argument here about these sensitive times … it strikes me that what you’re trying to do is affect the presentation of this case so as not to impinge on an election,” she added.
Lauro denied that his arguments were connected to the presidential campaign.
“The decisions here will not just affect this case, it will affect the republic going forward,” Lauro said.
Trump has repeatedly complained that the new indictment filed last week was an attempt to interfere with the campaign – just as he complained about his New York trial in the spring – but Chutkan’s comments signaled she isn’t going to wait until after November 5 before moving forward on the issues that have to be dealt with in the case following the Supreme Court’s immunity decision.
At the end of Thursday’s hearing, Chutkan acknowledged the elephant in the room: There were still too many issues to resolve to set a trial date in the case.
“It’s sort of an exercise in futility at this point,” she said, noting that whatever decision she makes on immunity will be appealed, which means the trial will pause once again while the appellate process plays out.
Both Trump’s lawyers and prosecutors agreed that it was too soon to set a trial date.
While Chutkan’s schedule on the next steps in the case does get the immunity issue moving, all sides in the case – prosecutors, Trump’s attorneys and the judge – acknowledged Thursday that her ruling on immunity would almost certainly be appealed.
Of course, it’s not just the appeals process that makes a future trial so murky. If Trump wins the 2024 election, he is poised to toss out the special counsel and the case against him altogether once he returns to office.
Chutkan did not seem particularly convinced that, when deciding the immunity issues in the case, she should deal specifically with the Pence-related claims first.
Trump’s attorneys made the aggressive argument, first laid out in their filings late last week, that the whole case must fall if Trump’s interactions with his vice president are deemed immune from prosecution.
In Thursday’s hearing, Lauro was particularly focused on that argument and tried to persuade the judge that dealing with the Pence conduct as a standalone issue would be a more efficient way of doing things.
He contended that it would save the court from doing lengthy briefings on other the allegations in the indictment if she decides the whole case must be dismissed on the Pence issue alone. He also insisted that the Supreme Court viewed a finding that the Pence conduct was immune as fatal to the indictment, a claim Chutkan shot down.
“The ruling is clear, crystal clear,” Lauro said, prompting a chuckle from Chutkan.
Chutkan hinted that she was dubious of Trump’s coming attempt to get the DC case dismissed on the grounds that Smith was supposedly illegally appointed, even as Chutkan has said she’d let the former president file that motion to dismiss.
She took a swipe at the ruling that Judge Aileen Cannon handed down this summer dismissing the classified documents case on that basis, calling that ruling not particularly “persuasive.”
She also emphasized that a concurrence by Justice Clarence Thomas – which Cannon’s ruling cited – that laid out those constitutional concerns was “dicta,” meaning non-binding language. And she noted that there is already DC Circuit precedent on the books upholding the constitutionality of special counsels, which would be binding on her as a trial judge in Washington, DC.
Nevertheless, she is letting the Trump team take a shot. However, when his lawyers file the motion that asks for permission to formally make those arguments, they must elaborate on why they should be allowed to do so, Chutkan said.
Chutkan requested in Thursday afternoon’s order that Trump file his challenge to the legality of Smith’s appointment and for the special counsel to respond in late October, with the final brief from Trump on that issue due on November 7, two days after the election.

Working with the Syrian Democratic Forces, the US captured Khaled Ahmed al-Dandal early Sunday morning. Al-Dandal helped ISIS fighters who had escaped from detention facilities in Syria, including recently escaped fighters, CENTCOM said.
Last week, five ISIS detainees escaped from the Raqqa detention facility in Syria. The Syrian Democratic Forces recaptured two of the escapees, but the other three remain at large, CENTCOM said.
More than 9,000 ISIS detainees are held in over 20 detention facilities in Syria. The US is working to repatriate as many of the detainees as possible, but the process is incredibly slow. The large number of ISIS detainees held in the facility has made them a target for ISIS attacks as the group tries to free the prisoners.
“If a large number of these ISIS fighters escaped, it would pose an extreme danger to the region and beyond,” said Gen. Erik Kurilla, the commander of US Central Command. “We will continue to work with  the international community to repatriate these ISIS fighters to their countries of origin for final adjudication.”
The capture of al-Dandal comes just days after a separate raid against ISIS in Iraq in which seven US service members were wounded. Conducted with the Iraqi Security Forces, the operation killed 15 ISIS militants, US officials said, as the militaries targeted the hideouts of several ISIS leaders.
All of the injured service members are stable, according to three defense officials, and one of the injured was evacuated out of the region for additional care."
6UMCWOVHJ8_2VI7ZJ4BS4TNZI9,Brazil’s president says world doesn’t have to put up with Elon Musk’s ‘far right’ ideology just because he’s rich,"By Juliana Liu, CNN","2 minute read Published 12:45 AM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/04/tech/brazil-lula-elon-musk-x-suspension-hnk-intl/,"Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva says the world isn’t obliged to put up with billionaire Elon Musk’s “far-right anything goes” agenda because of his immense wealth.
Lula da Silva made the remarks in an interview with CNN affiliate CNN Brasil published Monday, days after Musk’s social media site X was suspended in the country, making it inaccessible in a major market.
“The Brazilian justice system may have given an important signal that the world is not obliged to put up with Musk’s extreme right-wing anything goes just because he is rich,” the president said.
Lula da Silva’s comments are the latest salvo in a long-running feud with Musk over free speech, far-right accounts and misinformation in the country. Over the weekend, Brazilians, including the president, bid farewell to X, with some posting links to their profiles on other social media platforms.
Brazil is an important market for X, which has struggled with the loss of advertisers since Musk acquired Twitter and renamed the platform last year. Some 40 million Brazilians, roughly one-fifth of the population, access X at least once per month, according to market research group Emarketer.
Access to the platform was blocked after Brazil’s Supreme Court ordered the suspension of X nationwide, because Musk refused to name a legal representative in the country.
The court had previously issued orders to block multiple X accounts as part of the country’s sweeping investigation into the spread of misinformation online and hate speech aimed at undermining the country’s democracy.
Accounts that the platform has previously shut down on Brazilian orders include lawmakers affiliated with former President Jair Bolsonaro’s right-wing party and activists accused of undermining Brazilian democracy.
Musk, a self-proclaimed “free speech absolutist” has repeatedly claimed the court’s actions amount to censorship, and his argument has been echoed by Brazil’s political right.
Musk once again waded into Brazilian politics on Tuesday by sharing a link on X to an upcoming demonstration that bills itself as a march for “freedom, protesting judicial overreach and defending free speech.”

6VP8ZPRDVD_0XPYHGUN4C3WE3O,Parents are not OK right now. Here’s what they can do,"Analysis by Kara Alaimo, CNN","5 minute read Updated 12:58 PM EDT, Fri September 6, 2024",20240901,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/01/health/parenting-stress-tips-surgeon-general-wellness/,"Parents and caregivers are working more hours and spending more time taking care of their children than parents did in the past — all while juggling sign-ups for extracurricular activities, playdates, school forms, doctor appointments and more.
No wonder they’re stressed. And the nation’s top doctor agrees.
US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy, a father of two, issued an advisory warning on Wednesday that the pressure that parents are under has become a public health problem. Some 41% of parents reported they can’t function most days because of stress, and 48% said they’re completely overwhelmed by stress, the advisory said, citing a 2023 American Psychological Association survey.
Parents are struggling with the high costs of childcare, education and health care, the advisory warned. They’re straining to find enough time for work, childcare and the mental load of parenting. They’re worried about school shootings and the mental health challenges many children are facing.

They’re also challenged by how to handle kids’ use of social media and their own, because parents are facing an “intensifying culture of comparison” encouraged by social media influencers showing off their supposedly perfect parenting, according to the advisory.
Things are even worse for parents with added stressors, such as those who are single, have children with special needs or have recently divorced.
And if parents are stressed, kids get stressed. Children were twice as likely to have behavioral, developmental or mental disorders and four times likelier to have poor mental health when their primary caregiver had poor mental health, according to a 2021 study.
It’s no surprise that parents’ mental health struggles can hurt our whole society by driving up health care costs and lowering economic productivity, the advisory noted.
“Simply put, caregivers need care, too,” the advisory warned.
It’s true that lot of these problems require action by lawmakers and employers, and this advisory should serve as a wake-up call to both that health care and childcare should be more affordable and accessible.
In the meantime, what can parents do? Anna Seewald, a psychologist and host of the “Authentic Parenting” podcast, told me parents can make changes to protect their physical and mental health amid all these challenges.
Related article Parents are feeling lonely. Here’s why it matters
Our society makes life incredibly hard for parents, the advisory noted, so parents could try to reevaluate their expectations of themselves.
“Parents put a lot of pressure on themselves to always be calm and patient and have well-behaved kids who do a lot of extracurricular activities,” Seewald said, but she noted doing so often isn’t realistic. “High expectations and social comparisons lead to big resentments and frustration.”
It’s better for parents to be realistic about what they can do given their circumstances.

Many parents who work with Seewald are spending loads of time on social media. Even deleting a single app can free up a substantial amount of time and energy, she said. “You don’t notice how they drain your time, but that’s a background stressor for a lot of people in a world of many stressors — and it’s one that you can control.”
Parents can also benefit from simplifying their kids’ activities. “You don’t need to go to two different birthday parties for 4-year-olds in a single weekend,” she said. “Preserving and protecting your own energy and time is more important.” If it’s something you’d enjoy, “maybe you hire a babysitter for an hour, maybe you invite a neighbor over for coffee,” she said.
One way for parents to find more time for themselves is to ask for help from the community — such as asking a kind neighbor or family member to watch their kids so they can take a break. Seewald said it’s also important for parents to think through what responsibilities —such as laundry or carpooling — they can delegate to other people.

Part of the time parents devote to themselves needs to include connecting with other people in person, Seewald said. “So many parents feel lonely and isolated. Seeing a friend helps you vent and talk about problems and get the emotional support you need, even if it’s limited and you see one person each week,” she said.
Parents can meet some self-care needs even with their kids around — and with small pockets of time, Seewald said. “If you put on music and dance with your kids and are silly for 10 minutes before you make dinner, your mood changes because of the movement,” she said. “Little interventions like that make a big difference, and they’re free.”

Spending time in nature also helps, she said. “You can go to the backyard or to a park, even if it’s for 15 minutes, even with kids, and feel the sun or watch the sunset. There’s no cost, but it regulates the nervous system and gives you a sense of awe and connects you to something bigger,” she pointed out.
Above all, Seewald recommended that parents practice self-compassion, which means “being kind and gentle with ourselves when we make mistakes, when we yell at our kids,” she said. “Feeling inadequate and shameful is a recipe for failure.”
The surgeon general has made clear that parents in the United States are not OK. While it’s on lawmakers and employers to solve many of these problems, it’s also critical for parents to practice self-care instead of waiting for the problems to be fixed. (That’s going to take awhile). Being kind and realistic with themselves, finding time to connect with friends and nature, and asking for help are all ways to help manage the mother lode of stresses parents are under.

6W9JQAB4HY_6CJPFWHND0K3EN1,Netanyahu is unequivocal about ceasefire and hostage agreement with Hamas: ‘There’s not a deal in the making’,"By Mick Krever, Jennifer Hansler and Alex Marquardt, CNN","6 minute read Updated 11:22 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/05/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-hamas-agreement-intl/,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday was as clear as he has ever been that he does not believe a ceasefire and hostage deal is likely in Gaza in a sharp rebuke to the Biden administration’s insistence it’s close at hand.
“There’s not a deal in the making,” Netanyahu told Fox News. “Unfortunately, it’s not close.”
His comments stand in stark contrast to the relentlessly hopeful messaging from the Biden administration over the past months. On Sunday, President Joe Biden claimed that the parties were on the verge of a deal, and on Wednesday, a senior administration official claimed 90% of the agreement had been completed.
That, Netanyahu said, is “exactly inaccurate.”
Netanyahu’s rebuff of the US’ assessment of a prospective deal is the latest instance in a string of public comments this week from the Israeli prime minister casting doubt on the potential agreement months in the making.
US officials have been reticent to directly criticize Netanyahu – even as he has repeatedly broken with the administration’s position and cast doubt on his adherence to a potential deal – although a National Security Council official on Thursday acknowledged “frustrations” in the process while still continuing to insist a deal is close.
“It’s exactly inaccurate. There’s a story, a narrative out there, that there’s a deal out there,” the Israeli Prime Minister said of the statement from the American official the day prior that “basically, 90 percent of this deal has been agreed.”
On Sunday, when Israel announced that the bodies of six hostages has been found executed by Hamas, Biden still argued that negotiators were on the “verge of having an agreement.”
US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby doubled down on those assessments in comments to the press Thursday, saying, “90% – verge of a deal. You call that optimistic, I call that accurate.”
Asked about Netanyahu’s comments, Kirby said, “I’m just not going to get into a public back and forth through all of you in the press with Prime Minister Netanyahu.”
“I will just say that this process has at times been cumbersome. We have faced setbacks and setbacks and more setbacks, and without question, we here in the administration are frustrated that we still haven’t been able to conclude this deal,” he said.
“There’s lots of reasons for that, but I’m not going to lie to you and say that that we haven’t been frustrated. Of course we have. We want to see the hostages home as soon as possible. But I would also say that as frustrating as it has been at times, and as unhelpful as – not just public comments, but even private machinations in the negotiation process – have been to closure of the deal, it has not dimmed one bit President Biden’s commitment to trying to see this through,” Kirby said.
Kirby also dismissed the idea that the administration was overly optimistic about the prospects of a deal, saying that “we do believe that we have made an immense amount of progress in the last few months in terms of getting the structure of the deal in place, but nothing is negotiated until everything is negotiated.”
The senior Biden administration official on Wednesday said that the majority of the details of the first phase of the agreement had been worked out. The remaining sticking points, they said, are related to the withdrawal of Israeli forces within Gaza away from populated areas and the exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners.
“Other than that, that’s about it,” the senior official said.
On the prisoner exchange, the official accused Hamas of adding new “non-starters” for the prisoners they want to see released.
“What Hamas has been demanding here, the Israelis have come forward to meet the terms as best they can,” the official said. “And Hamas, frankly, on this issue, we’ve had a pretty frustrating process.”
The official said Hamas’s recent killing of six hostages had “colored” the ongoing negotiations and thrown into question Hamas’s willingness to reach a deal.
On where Israel Defense Forces troops move to during the first phase of a deal, the agreement under discussion makes no mention of the length of the Egypt-Gaza border known as the Philadelphi Corridor, the official told reporters Wednesday. Instead, it says in the first phase that the IDF is supposed to withdraw from “densely populated areas,” the official said. Israel argues that the border isn’t one and is vital to preventing weapons from being smuggled into Gaza.
Netanyahu has held two news conferences this week to argue that maintaining permanent control of the Philadelphi Corridor is vital to Israeli security.
“The first war goal was to destroy Hamas’ military and governing capabilities. The second was to free our hostages, and the third was to ensure that Gaza never again poses a threat to Israel. And all three of those goals – all three of them – go through Israel’s control of the Philadelphi corridor,” Netanyahu said Wednesday at a news conference for foreign press.
That emphasis on Philadelphi in Netanyahu’s recent public statements hasn’t been constructive, the official said.
On Thursday, Netanyahu claimed Hamas “don’t agree to anything. Not to the Philadelphi Corridor, not to the keys of exchanging hostages for jailed terrorists, not to anything. So that’s just a false narrative.”
Hamas on Thursday said that Netanyahu has used “evasions and deceptive maneuvers” to avoid reaching an agreement on a ceasefire in Gaza.
The head of the organization’s negotiating team, Khalil Al-Hayya, said in a speech released on Telegram that the “series of evasions and deceptive maneuvers practiced by Netanyahu to evade the obligation to reach an agreement on a ceasefire is now fully exposed to the mediators, the American administration, global public opinion, and even the (Israeli) public.”
Netanyahu is facing mounting accusations that he has purposefully blocked a deal with Hamas. The Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth, citing a document it obtained, reported that Netanyahu in July effectively spiked a draft of a hostage and ceasefire deal by introducing a raft of new, eleventh-hour demands.
Several news outlets, including CNN, have reported on the late July demands made by Netanyahu, but this is the first time the Israeli document has been obtained in full.
In the Fox News interview, Netanyahu rejected allegations that he has obstructed a deal.
“The obstacle to the end of this war is Hamas. The obstacle to the release of hostages is Hamas. The ones who butchered in a sling, murdering six people in cold blood, riddling them with bullets and then firing bullets into their heads is Hamas. It’s not Israel. It’s not me.”
Netanyahu was also questioned about reports that the families of American hostages still held by Hamas are lobbying the US Administration to unilaterally seek their loved ones’ release.
“I don’t know,” he said. “You know, I don’t judge the families. They’re going through enormous anguish.”
In an interview with CNN’s Kaitlin Collins on Thursday evening, Israeli ambassador Danny Danon was asked why Netanyahu’s latest comments contrast with more optimistic pronouncements from the White House.
“We want to lower expectations,” he said.
“In May the US proposed a deal, we said yes, Hamas said no,” Danin said, adding the same happened in August, contradicting the reporting Yedioth Ahronoth and others.
Israel was continuing to send its intelligence head and other officials to negotiations, Danon argued, and he reiterated blame on Hamas for the lack of progress in talks. “Every time we get closer to reach an agreement Hamas will come up with another excuse why not to sign an agreement,” he said.
Meanwhile, a Biden administration official told CNN Thursday the US has made no offer to Hamas in an attempt the secure the release of American hostages held captive in Gaza, noting that the US does not have the leverage for a unilateral deal with the group.
“Because of Hamas’ demands, there has not been a formal offer for a side deal made because no such deal is possible,” the official said.

700207NJSA_8ZM4E9CI3ACKDDY,"China’s New York envoy ‘performing his duties as usual’ after Chinese agent case, Beijing’s consulate says","By Yong Xiong and Nectar Gan, CNN","6 minute read Updated 2:10 AM EDT, Fri September 6, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/05/us/china-new-york-envoy-intl-hnk/,"China’s consulate in New York has denied reports that its top diplomat was removed in the aftermath of an alleged Chinese agent bust, saying the consul general is “performing his duties as usual.”
“Consul General Huang Ping is performing his duties as usual. We hope the media will refrain from sensationalizing false information,” a spokesperson for the Chinese Consulate General in New York told CNN in a statement Wednesday.
The statement appears to contradict remarks made earlier by New York Gov. Kathy Hochul – whose former aide was charged with acting as an agent for the Chinese government – and the State Department, which claimed the Chinese envoy had left his position.
Hours later, the consulate published a press release on its website with photos showing Huang busy at work on Tuesday. In the photos, Huang was seen visiting the Philadelphia home of a former American pilot who helped China to fight Japan during World War II.
At a fundraising event on Thursday evening, Huang, who has been the consul general since December 2018, indicated that he would be leaving his position soon, citing the length of his term and the retirement age for Chinese government officials.
“I’ve been here six years already. I surpassed my term, which used to be three to four years. I’ve surpassed my (retirement) age. In China, government officials retire at 60,” the 61-year-old told the audience at the China Institute Blue Cloud Gala.
“I think it’s time for me to go home and start a new life,” Huang said.
An official at the Chinese embassy in Washington confirmed to CNN that Huang’s term is coming to an end, but did not offer a specific date for his departure. The official said plans for Huang’s departure had been set in motion long ago and have nothing to do with the recent indictment against Linda Sun.
This latest Chinese explanation, however, while confirming Huang remains in his post for now, does at least partially echo the US State Department’s previous response his term was coming to an end — albeit with a slightly different timeframe.
The envoy’s employment status was first thrown into the spotlight after Sun, a former aide to Hochul and her predecessor Gov. Andrew Cuomo, was charged on Tuesday with secretly acting as an agent of the Chinese government.
Sun was charged with violating and conspiring to violate the Foreign Agents Registration Act, visa fraud, alien smuggling and conspiracy to launder money, according to an unsealed copy of the indictment.
Sun’s husband and co-defendant, Chris Hu, was also charged with money laundering conspiracy and conspiracy to commit bank fraud as well as misusing means of identification, prosecutors said.
Details contained within the indictment appear to match some publicly available information, including an interaction between Sun and Huang, the consul general.
For example, at the request of Chinese government representatives, Sun allegedly obtained an unauthorized proclamation from the New York Governor’s Office – a formal framed document that bears the state seal and the governor’s signature – to present to a Chinese official at an event celebrating the Lunar New Year in January 2023, prosecutors said in the indictment.
A photo posted on the website of China’s Foreign Ministry shows Sun presenting a framed New York State proclamation to Huang at the Lunar New Year reception of the Chinese consulate in New York on January 17, 2023.
US prosecutors say the Chinese government gave Sun lavish, expensive gifts in return for violating internal rules and state government protocols while she served as an aide to the two New York governors in a scheme that enriched her family to the tune of millions of dollars.
Among the gifts she received were at least four deliveries of Nanjing-style salted duck between 2021 and 2022, prepared by the personal chef of the Chinese official to whom she later presented the proclamation, according to the indictment. Other examples of gifts in the indictment included travel reimbursements, hotel rooms and event tickets.
Sun was born in Nanjing, a city in eastern China’s Jiangsu province, and moved to the US with her parents at a young age, according to the overseas Chinese affairs office of the Jiangsu provincial government.
A statement released by the office in 2017 said Sun had led two to three American delegations to visit China every year since 2012, when she started to work for Gov. Cuomo.
Sun has denied the allegations. Defense attorney Seth DuCharme addressed reporters outside court Tuesday, saying “we have a lot of confidence in our case.”
“A lot of the allegations in this indictment are frankly perplexing, overly inflammatory,” he said. “As you heard in court today, we are looking forward to our day in court. The defendants are exercising their right to a speedy trial as soon as they can; we have a lot of confidence in Chris and in Linda.”
An attorney for Sun, Jarrod Schaeffer, told CNN the charges “are inflammatory and appear to be the product of an overly aggressive prosecution.”
“We are also troubled by aspects of the government’s investigation. As we said today in court, our client is eager … to defend against these accusations in the proper forum – a court of law,” Schaeffer said.
The case has threatened to spiral into a diplomatic row between Washington and Beijing, in part because of contradicting statements about the fate of China’s top diplomat in New York.
At a news conference earlier Wednesday, Hochul said she spoke by phone at the request of Secretary of State Antony Blinken to a high-ranking State Department official about Huang’s status.
“I had conveyed my desire to have the consul general from the People’s Republic of China in the New York mission expelled,” she said. “And I’ve been informed that the consul general is no longer in the New York mission.”
State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller later clarified that Huang “was not expelled.”

“Our understanding is that the consul general reached the end of a regular scheduled rotation in August, and so rotated out of the position, but was not expelled,” Miller said.
“But of course, when it comes to the status of particular employees of a foreign mission, I would refer you to the foreign country to speak to it. But there was no expulsion action,” he added.
In a statement Wednesday, China’s embassy in Washington said reports saying Huang was expelled were “completely inconsistent with the facts” and “made malicious speculations.”
Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the embassy, said Chinese diplomats in the US “have never and will not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries.”
“Their normal performance of duties in the US should not be interfered with or disrupted in any way. We firmly oppose relevant parties and the media fabricating and spreading false information,” Liu added.
China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was unaware of the aide accused of working for China.
“I am not aware of the situation you mentioned,” spokesperson Mao Ning said at a regular news briefing Monday, adding, “I will not comment on the domestic cases in the United States, but we oppose malicious associations and slander against China.”"

The report lends credence to charges often leveled at the prime minister – most notably by hostage families – of purposefully prolonging the war and torpedoing deals for his political benefit. Far-right members of Netanyahu’s coalition have pledged to bring down the government should he end the war.
Several news outlets, including CNN, have reported on the late July demands made by Netanyahu, but this is the first time the Israeli document has been obtained in full.
Among the 11th-hour demands, according to the newspaper, was that Israel retain control of the Egypt-Gaza border area – a condition Netanyahu has since portrayed as non-negotiable, including at a press conference on Wednesday.
Yedioth Ahronoth also reported that at least three of six hostages found dead in Gaza by the Israel Defense Forces over the weekend were due for release as part of the May draft agreement – Carmel Gat, Aden Yerushalmi, and Hersh Goldberg-Polin.
The Israeli Prime Minister’s Office in August confirmed to CNN the existence of the document but denied that it added “new conditions to the May 27 proposal.” The statement came in response to a report by the same Israeli correspondent who wrote the Yedioth Ahronoth report, Ronen Bergman, this time in The New York Times.

A senior Israeli official on Wednesday said the new report was “misinformed, misleading and hampers the chance of achieving the release of hostages.”
But separately, an Israeli source familiar with the talks said Netanyahu’s demands were to blame for the deaths of the hostages over the weekend.
“Two months ago, when he (Netanyahu) put the obstacles, he said no to the deal,” the source told CNN. “The hostages died because he insisted.”
The Hostages Families Forum said this weekend that “the finding of the bodies yesterday is a direct result of Netanyahu’s thwarting of the deals.”
On July 25, a senior US Administration official told CNN that negotiators were “closer than we’ve ever been” and that it was “up to the Israelis to accept it.”
Yedioth Ahronoth reported that rather than accepting that proposal, the Israeli negotiators submitted new demands, making changes to the proposals they themselves had originally made.
The new demands were nicknamed the “Netanyahu Outline,” the newspaper reported.
Hamas at the time said that Netanyahu had “returned to the strategy of procrastination, evasion, and avoiding reaching an agreement by setting new conditions and demands.”
Bergman, writing in Hebrew, wrote in Tuesday’s report that among the new demands was that Israeli forces continue to occupy the Egypt-Gaza border area, known as the Philadelphi Corridor, and maintain a 1.4-kilometer perimeter in Gaza along the Israeli border. The newspaper posted maps reportedly from the late-July Israeli response. The original May 27 proposal, according to Yedioth Ahronoth, offered an eventual full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.
The Israeli source familiar with the talks who spoke to CNN said: “The moment he (Netanyahu) insisted to stay in Rafah, to stay in the Philadelphi corridor, it was very clear that it was an obstacle.”
At Wednesday’s press conference, at which only foreign media were allowed, Netanyahu doubled down on his argument that control of the corridor is central to Israel’s war aims.
“The first war goal was to destroy Hamas’ military and governing capabilities. The second was to free our hostages, and the third was to ensure that Gaza never again poses a threat to Israel. And all three of those goals – all three of them – go through Israel’s control of the Philadelphi corridor,” Netanyahu said in English.
Israel’s prior lack of control of the corridor had allowed Iran to arm Hamas, the prime minister argued, adding, “It’s clear Gaza must be demilitarized, and it can only be demilitarized if the Philadelphi corridor remains under firm control and is not a supply line for armaments and for terror equipment.”
However, he insisted he was still willing to make a deal, saying, “The real obstacle to making a deal is not Israel, and it’s not me. It’s Hamas.”
In a Telegram post Wednesday, Hamas condemned Netanyahu’s refusal to withdraw from the corridor, saying it was an attempt to “thwart reaching an agreement.”
Frustration at what many see as Netanyahu’s failure to secure a deal has continued to mount in Israel, with demonstrations on Wednesday marking the fourth straight day of protests since the bodies of the six hostages were found.
Large crowds of protesters gathered outside the homes of members of the Knesset (Israel’s parliament) on Wednesday night to demand a deal be reached, according to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.
Videos released by the forum show demonstrations in various cities, including Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.
Protests also took place outside the Israel Defense Force’s (IDF) Kirya headquarters in Tel Aviv.
In a sign of the growing hostility toward Netanyahu, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum demanded Wednesday that he stop wearing the yellow ribbon pin, which has become a symbol of support for the hostages.
However, it was clearly visible on the Israeli prime minister’s lapel during the press conference Wednesday – a meeting where CNN’s Jeremy Diamond pressed him to answer the question of a hostage’s wife who wanted to know if her husband, Israeli-American Keith Siegel, would come back alive or dead.
“I spoke to Aviva Siegel tonight… she told me that she believes that you are sentencing her husband Keith to die by prioritizing the Philadelphi Corridor over a deal, and she has this question for you: is Keith going to come home alive or dead?” Diamond asked.
Netanyahu responded, “I’ll do everything to make sure that Keith and all the other hostages come back” – though he did not reply specifically to the alive or dead part of the question.
“I’m telling you that if we relieve the pressure, if we get out of the Philadelphi Corridor, we’re not going to get the hostages back,” the Israeli prime minister continued. “Certainly, we’re going to condemn a lot of them to stay there.”
He went on to say he could “understand the torment of families,” adding that many of the families also did not believe Israel would be able to get hostages released during November’s temporary truce or previous negotiations. “I believe that our strategy is the best way to achieve both goals – both releasing, freeing the hostages and ensuring that Gaza never poses a threat to Israel again.”
A diplomatic source familiar with the matter told CNN on Wednesday that there would be no ceasefire deal until Israel and Hamas settle the dispute around the deployment of Israeli troops along the Philadelphi corridor.
“Things are very tense. Very much up in the air,” the source said.
David Barnea, the director of Israel’s intelligence agency Mossad, met on Monday with officials from Qatar, which is mediating a deal, but there are “no meetings this week and nothing planned,” the source said.
CNN understands that during his visit to Doha, Barnea insinuated that while troop withdrawal from the Philadelphi corridor in Phase One of a deal is not up for discussion, it may be possible in Phase Two.
In its report on Tuesday, Yedioth said Israeli negotiators in July insisted as part of their new demands on specific guarantees that Palestinian civilians be allowed to return to northern Gaza would not bring weapons with them.
Netanyahu’s team, also for the first time, submitted a list of 40 hostages it wanted released as part of a first phase of a potential agreement, the paper reported. It added that the move was controversial because the Israeli negotiators were themselves determining whom they considered to be “sick,” and thus eligible for release, rather than leaving it vague.
Finally, the newspaper reported that the new Israeli demands said a specific group of long-term Palestinian prisoners to be exchanged for female Israeli soldiers be sent “abroad” after their release, rather than – as the previous agreement reportedly stated – “abroad or into Gaza.”
In its August statement to CNN, the Prime Minister’s Office said that this proposal did “not introduce new terms. To the contrary, it includes essential clarifications to help implement the May 27 proposal.”

7F8F3V13ZY_6ZI4BZN0XGBOF5O,The Iberian lynx is back from the brink. Now virtual fences could save it from becoming roadkill,"By Victoria Barauna, CNN","5 minute read Updated 6:23 AM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,http://www.cnn.com/science/spain-iberian-lynx-virtual-fence-spc-c2e/,"At the start of the 21st century, Spain’s once-abundant lynx population was on the verge of extinction, decimated by a combination of habitat loss, a decline in its main prey, hunting, and road accidents.
After decades of conservation work, the Iberian lynx has made a remarkable recovery, and a new initiative is using a high-tech system to protect the wild cat from one of its deadliest enemies: road traffic.
“In 2001, there were less than 50 mature individuals in the wild, distributed over two populations,” explains Dr Urs Breitenmoser, a carnivore ecologist and former senior scientist at the University of Bern, who co-chairs the Cat Specialist Group at the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).
By 2022, that number soared to 648, according to IUCN and it estimates the population of young and mature lynx to now be more than 2,000.
The turnaround is the result of a €100M ($112 million) conservation project — funded by the EU and the Spanish government — that has involved conservationist groups, as well as national and regional authorities across southern Spain.
Conservation strategies such as restocking populations of its main prey, rabbits, and restoring habitats, for example by converting pine plantations back to their original scrubland, have paid off and in June this year, the IUCN upgraded the status of the Iberian lynx from endangered to vulnerable. “For a relatively large carnivore, it is an incredible speed of recovery,” says Breitenmoser.
Yet, the IUCN acknowledges that the Iberian lynx remains threatened. It’s highly dependent on wild rabbits for food, which are particularly vulnerable to viruses. Poaching continues to be a threat, as does climate change, which is affecting lynx habitats, and road safety still is an issue.
To help with dispersion, lynx have territories of up to 20 square kilometers — although it can vary greatly — which Breitenmoser describes as “clever trick of nature to avoid inbreeding.” But being able to range freely throughout often requires crossing busy roads.
In the 1980s, roadkill played a key role in lynx mortality in the Doñana area (a prominent spot for the Iberian lynx) accounting for almost 17% of deaths. To tackle this issue, in the early 2000s, conservation programs introduced safety measures, installing fencing and underpasses that provide a safe way for lynx to walk between habitats without having to cross any roads.
Between 2006 and 2011, roadkill, accounted for 6.6% of the deaths in Sierra Morena and 8.6% in Doñana.  That may not sound like much, but Breitenmoser explains that given that lynx populations were critically endangered at the time, the impact was significant.
“Twenty years ago, each roadkill was a real catastrophe. Even if you were to say that one lynx or two lynx are not important, in this situation, each individual was important,” Breitenmoser says.
Even as the species recovers, preventing roadkill is a priority and a project run by the regional government of Andalusia is using “virtual fences” to protect lynx from traffic. Sensors are placed 50 meters apart at the side of key roads, detecting when an animal is in the vicinity and warning them away when cars approach, explains Francisco Javier Salcedo Ortiz, coordinator of the LIFE Lynx-Connect project. “The sensors also activate once they detect the cars’ headlights, warning the animals with sound and light signals to not to cross,” he says.
In Jaén, Andalusia, 4.5 kilometers of virtual fences were installed along a main road in 2022 and in Granada, both physical and virtual fences are being installed on a 20-kilometer stretch.
The project is also having an impact on drivers, who often slow down when the sound and light alarms are triggered. “We have definitely noticed that there has been a reduction in the speed of drivers when the device is activated,” says Marcos López-Parra, who works as a lynx recovery plan technician for the regional government in Andalusia. “We are reducing the risk of collision.”
Similar technology has been used in central Italy to protect the Marsican Brown bear from road traffic, with the addition of infrared sensors and thermic cameras to detect animals’ presence beside roads, before sending an audible alert to drivers to slow down. The organization behind the initiative claims that it was nearly 100% effective.
Ortiz says that in a five-year timeframe, almost €4.5 million ($5 million) will be spent on improving habitats and nearly €2.9 million ($3.2 million) on boosting connectivity, including virtual fences.
The hope is that helping lynx to safely cross roads will increase encounters between different populations, which could benefit the cats in Andalusia, nearby Extremadura and even neighboring Portugal. Breitenmoser says connectivity between neighboring populations is essential for maintaining “the genetic and demographic health of a large population.”
There are some even more inventive technologies in development. Scientists from Spain’s University of Córdoba are leveraging the chemical signals used by lynx during breeding season to create artificial scent trails that could connect different populations via underpasses.
The first year of the project focused on completing analyses at a molecular level and the researchers are now experimenting in the field. The final task will be creating a scent corridor and checking if the cats follow it. The study is planned to be completed by September 2025.
“It’s still in an initial stage, but it’s an interesting alternative as it can be cheaper than what has been typically done on highways and can help lynx cross safely underneath roads,” says Ortiz.
Conservationists say that efforts to help the lynx will benefit other wildlife in the region. “It (the lynx) plays a very important ecological role by influencing a lot of other species, not only the rabbit population that it eats from, but also meso-predators like foxes,” Breitenmoser explains. “It may provide some services to other large carnivores like the imperial eagle,” which also relies on wild rabbit populations to survive, he adds.
Innovation aside, for Ortiz the future of the Iberian lynx depends on co-operation. “The success of a project is defined by the ability to build something through the sum of many parts,” he says. “We must involve all sorts of sectors, including hunters, landowners, conservationists and more.”"
7IDI4Z1UDS_H0Q8EBTHM7GAHS1,"Murder suspect in Chicago train mass shooting is ordered held without bond. ‘This defendant defines violent,’ judge says","By Cheri Mossburg, Bill Kirkos, Lauren Mascarenhas, Brad Parks and Virginia Langmaid, CNN","5 minute read Updated 5:03 PM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240903,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/03/us/chicago-train-shooting-tuesday/,"The Chicago man who was charged with murder in the fatal shootings of four Chicago train riders earlier this week was ordered held without bond at his first court appearance Wednesday.
Rhanni S. Davis, 30, was charged Tuesday with four counts of first-degree murder, the Forest Park Police Department said in a news release.
He appeared in a Maywood court Wednesday wearing a tan Cook County jumpsuit with shackles around his hands and ankles.
Prosecutors told the court evidence will show Davis shot one victim twice in the head and back, shot a second person in the side of the face and the arm and then shot a third victim in the back of the head. Davis moved to the next train car and approached the fourth victim from behind. The victim raised his hands in a defensive posture before Davis fired, prosecutors said.
Prosecutors told the court Davis has a history of criminal activity, including a disorderly conduct offense in 2020, and two other prior arrests that were both dismissed. Davis’ attorney, Robert Fox, told the court he had a Firearm Owner’s Identification card, training in security and home health care, and no prior convictions. Davis recently worked at a local Taco Bell, the attorney added.
Cook County Circuit Court Judge Elizabeth Ciaccia-Lezza said the facts alleged by the state were “absolutely horrific and appalling.”
“This defendant defines violent,” Ciaccia-Lezza said. “The public would not be safe with any amount of movement by this defendant.”
Davis is due back in court on September 27.
The court hearing came two days after the mass shooting early Monday morning targeted four people who appeared to be sleeping on the train. Davis was detained about 90 minutes after the shooting was reported around 5:30 a.m. on the Blue Line train heading to the Forest Park suburb west of downtown.
The attack raised further concerns about the safety of public transit systems in American cities like Chicago and New York. Ridership levels plunged during the Covid pandemic and have had a muted recovery since, in part due to perceptions of disorder and crime.
Still, police emphasized Tuesday they believe this was an isolated and random attack. There is no identified motive at this time, Forest Park Police Department Det. Lt. Dan Pater said during the news conference.
“Allegedly, this man came onto a train while people were sleeping … and pumped bullets into their bodies,” Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx said Tuesday. “We want answers. Right now, we don’t have an answer as to why anyone would engage in such a heinous, heinous act. But as it stands … we have enough for the purposes of charging first-degree murder.”
The early morning shooting happened in two train cars, where three victims were shot in one car and the fourth in another, with a total of six rounds, police said.
Surveillance video was instrumental in identifying the suspect, police said.
Forest Park police released two surveillance videos Wednesday showing Davis casually walking in a train station.
The first video, from 5:04 a.m. CT Monday, shows a Blue Line train arriving at the Harlem station when a man in a gray outfit jumps out of the moving train, falls onto the platform, and then gets up and hustles away. After the train comes to a full stop, a person wearing a black shirt, black ski mask and black backpack then walks in the same direction.
The second video, taken at about 5:06 a.m. CT, shows the same man in the ski mask casually walking out of a train station.
Three of the victims were identified as 60-year-old Adrian Collins, 28-year-old Simeon Bihesi and 64-year-old Margaret A. Miller, the Cook County Medical Examiner’s office told CNN on Tuesday. The other victim was a man in his 50s, but no additional identifying information was available as police said they are still trying to reach the man’s family.
Police recovered a Glock 43 9mm pistol they confirmed Tuesday was the weapon used in the shooting.
CTA’s Blue Line spans 27 miles between O’Hare International Airport and Forest Park, passing through or near dozens of neighborhoods and downtown Chicago. Service on the line resumed Monday evening.

The victims may have been homeless, Forest Park Deputy Chief Chris Chin told CNN Monday, but Pater indicated Tuesday they “don’t have any information that proves or disproves otherwise.”
“Although this was an isolated incident, this heinous and egregious act of violence should never have occurred, nonetheless on a public transit train,” the transit authority said in a statement.
“This obviously is shocking, you know, it is uncommon to have a mass shooting like this,” said Chin. “This is an isolated incident, so it can happen anywhere. Obviously, there’s a little bit more concern because it is on a mass transit system,” he added. “For people to feel unsafe, it’s justified.”
CNN and the Gun Violence Archive define a mass shooting as a shooting that injured or killed four or more people, not including the shooter.
Forest Park Mayor Rory Hoskins said the shooting is an “outlier” for the city.
Hours after the shooting, another passenger was seriously injured in a stabbing on the Red Line, Chicago police said in a statement. The incident began as a verbal altercation between a 37-year-old victim and an unknown man, who at some point took out a “sharp object” and repeatedly stabbed the victim, police said.
“The victim fled from the train at the Wilson Red Line station, and relocated, on foot, to the 4700 block of N. Broadway. The victim was then transported to Illinois Masonic Hospital initially listed in critical condition,” police told CNN.
A suspect in the stabbing has yet to be found and detectives are investigating.

7KE46D3H4L_5UGED0UG5YEH2YZ,Ukraine carries out one of its biggest-ever drone attacks on Russia,"By Brad Lendon and Isaac Yee, CNN","5 minute read Updated 2:10 PM EDT, Mon September 2, 2024",20240902,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/02/europe/ukraine-big-drone-attack-russia-intl-hnk/,"Ukraine launched one of its biggest-ever drone attacks on Russia over the weekend, hitting a refinery and power station deep inside the country, according to videos posted on social media and geolocated by CNN.
The short videos show plumes of smoke rising from targets in Moscow and the neighboring Tver region.
The Russian Defense Ministry acknowledged the size of the Ukrainian attack, but downplayed its effectiveness, saying Sunday that 158 Ukrainian UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) “were destroyed and intercepted by on-duty air defense” overnight in 15 regions, including over the capital.
Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin said two drones were shot down in the area of the Moscow Oil Refinery. No casualties were reported, but the second downed drone damaged a technical building at the refinery and caused a fire, which the mayor said had been localized and did not affect the plant’s operation.
The Tver region’s governor, Igor Rudenya, said on social media that a fire caused by the drone attack on the Konakovo district has been extinguished and that gas and electricity services to the area were operating normally.
The Ukrainian drone strikes follow others in the past week, including one last Thursday that set fire to oil reservoirs at a refinery in the Rostov region of Russia, according to the Ukrainian Defense Ministry.
Social media video geolocated by CNN showed a large cloud of black smoke billowing from the Atlas oil depot in Rostov following the strike.
The recent wave of Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory began last month, when Kyiv’s troops launched a cross-border incursion into the Kursk region on August 6.
Just on Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin acknowledged that “people are going through tough ordeals, especially in the Kursk region,” as Ukrainian forces attempt to “destabilize the situation along the border.” But the attack has not stifled Russia’s offensive in the eastern Donbas region, added Putin.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky the Kursk offensive is going “according to plan,” but admitted “difficulty” in the eastern Ukrainian cities of Pokrovsk and Toretsk.
Zelensky said the most recent drone assaults deep inside Russia were justified by Moscow’s repeated attacks on his country.
“Just in the past week, Russia has launched over 160 missiles of various types, 780 guided aerial bombs, and 400 strike UAVs of different kinds against our people,” Zelensky said in a post on X.
On Monday, at least three people were wounded by strikes in Kyiv, as well as the eastern Kharkiv and Sumy regions, according to Ukrainian authorities. Those came after 41 people were injured following a Russian attack on civilian infrastructure in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, local authorities said.
“Russia is once again terrorizing Kharkiv, striking civilian infrastructure and the city itself,” Zelensky said on X, calling on allies to “give Ukraine everything it needs to defend itself.”

“It is entirely justified for Ukrainians to respond to Russian terror by any means necessary to stop it,” Zelensky said, reiterating his call for Western countries to lift restrictions on the use of long-range weapons, which have that prevented their use to hit targets inside Russia.
“This includes decisions to carry out long-range strikes on Russia’s missile launch sites, destroy Russian military logistics, and conduct joint efforts to shoot down missiles and drones – everything that will help us resist Russian evil,” Zelensky said.
Russia has repeatedly targeted Ukraine’s energy infrastructure with missile and drone attacks since its invasion.
Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov told CNN last week that he has presented the Biden administration with a list of targets inside Russia that Kyiv wants to hit with US-supplied long-range weapons, including the Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS).
Fired from mobile launchers, ATACMS have a range of up to 300 kilometers (186 miles) and can deploy single high-explosive warheads or up to 900 submunitions, according to the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba also urged allies to “abandon baseless fears” and “lift restrictions on the country’s legitimate right to self-defense.”
“Ukraine is forced to fight with hands tied behind its back,” Kuleba said on Monday.
“We have explained what kind of capabilities we need to protect the citizens against the Russian terror that Russians are causing us, so I hope we were heard,” Umerov said in an interview with CNN’s Alex Marquardt.
But a US official said many of Ukraine’s high-value targets in Russia are outside the range of ATACMS. Russia’s military has pulled its high-value military assets far away from the front lines, including the aircraft launching glide bombs that have wreaked havoc on Ukrainian targets.
Umerov has pushed back on the assessments, saying Ukraine has presented the US a list of targets they would use ATACMS to strike.
An analysis last month from a Washington-based think tank, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), supported Ukrainian claims there are high-value targets inside Russia within range of ATAMCS.
ISW said it had identified 233 Russian targets – “large military bases, communications stations, logistics centers, repair facilities, fuel depots, ammunition warehouses, and permanent headquarters” – in range of ATACMS that are immobile assets, meaning Moscow cannot move them out of harm’s way.
And ISW said Ukraine would only need to use ATACMS to strike some of those targets to have a significant impact on Russia’s ability to fight on the front lines.
While it pushes for the US to lift the ATACMS restrictions, Ukraine has been developing new longer-range indigenous weapons.
Zelensky announced last month that his country has a new jet-powered drone that can strike deep into Russia.
He said the Palianytsia “missile-drone” had been used in combat for the first time and was much faster and more powerful than the country’s existing fleet of drones, according to Ukrainian state media.
The Ukrainian president said he wouldn’t give any more specific details on the Palianytsia. But he hailed the new weapon’s “long-range” capabilities, hinting that it may surpass the up to 1,500-kilometer (932 miles) range of Ukraine’s current drone fleet.

7PD6HXYH9R_9I9UONM1V2Q8WG1,Celebrity ‘Russian spy’ whale found dead in Norwegian waters,Story by Associated Press,"2 minute read Updated 7:36 AM EDT, Mon September 2, 2024",20240902,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/01/world/russian-spy-whale-dead-in-norway-intl-hnk/,"Norway (AP) — A white beluga whale named “Hvaldimir,” first spotted in Norway not far from Russian waters with a harness that ignited rumors he may be a Moscow spy, has been found dead.
The Norwegian public broadcaster NRK reported that the whale carcass was found floating at the Risavika Bay in southern Norway Saturday by a father and son who were fishing.
The beluga, named by combining the Norwegian word for whale — hval — and Russian President Putin’s first name Vladimir, was lifted out of the water with a crane and taken to a nearby harbor where experts will examine it.
“Unfortunately, we found Hvaldimir floating in the sea. He has passed away but it’s not immediately clear what the cause of death is,” marine biologist Sebastian Strand told NRK, adding that no major external injuries were visible on the animal.
Strand, who has monitored Hvaldimir’s adventures for the past three years on behalf of the Norway-based Marine Mind non-profit organization, said he was deeply affected by the whale’s sudden death.
“It’s absolutely horrible,” Strand said. “He was apparently in good condition as of (Friday). So we just have to figure out what might have happened here.”
The 4.2-meter (14-foot) long and 1,225-kilogram (2,700-pound) whale was first spotted by fishermen near the northern island of Ingøya, not far from the Arctic city of Hammerfest, in April 2019 wearing a harness and what appeared to be a mount for a small camera and a buckle marked with text “Equipment St. Petersburg.”
That sparked allegations that the beluga was “a spy whale.” Experts said the Russian navy is known to have trained whales for military purposes.
Over the years, the beluga was seen in several Norwegian coastal towns and it quickly became clear that he was very tame and enjoyed playing with people, NRK said.
NGO Marine Mind said on its site that Hvaldimir was very interested in people and responded to hand signals.
“Based on these observations, it appeared as if Hvaldimir arrived in Norway by crossing over from Russian waters, where it is presumed he was held in captivity,” it said.
Norwegian media have speculated whether Hvaldimir could have been used as “a therapy whale” of some sort in Russia."
7SAKI4G37G_XUQF797CAIA0NTW,Man accused of plotting wife’s rape by at least 50 strangers over almost 10 years in French trial,"By Camille Knight, Emmanuel Miculita and Caroline Baum, CNN","4 minute read Updated 4:02 PM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240903,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/03/europe/france-man-accused-strangers-rape-wife-intl-latam/,"A man is on trial accused of repeatedly drugging and raping his wife, as well as encouraging dozens of other men to rape her in their home while she was unconscious, court documents show.
The alleged victim, Gisèle, 72, appeared in a courtroom in Avignon, France, on Monday for the opening of the trial, sunglasses on, her daughter and two sons by her side.
For the next four months, she will come face to face with her accused abusers, most of whom are complete strangers to her.
Prosecutors say the defendant, Dominique, 71, would recruit men online to rape his wife, after drugging her with sleeping pills and anti-anxiety medication. CNN is not using the full names of the man and wife to protect the identities of other family members.
He faces nine charges including several counts of rape with aggravating circumstances, the drugging of a victim to commit rape, and the sharing of images related to those assaults.
Prosecutors were able to put together a case because Dominique documented a number of the alleged assaults on camera.
Held in pre-trial detention since 2020, courtroom sketches show the defendant entered the courtroom in a black t-shirt and sat facing his wife.
“He recognizes that he’s done what he has done,” his lawyer, Béatrice Zavarro told journalists in court on Monday. “There was not an ounce of contestation during the whole investigation.”
In the dock, the men accused of taking part in these rapes sat with their heads down.
Police have identified at least 92 sexual assaults committed by 72 men, with ages ranging from 26 to 74, court documents show.
Fifty were identified, and most have been charged with either aggravated or attempted rape and are standing trial alongside Gisèle’s husband.
The ordeal lasted almost ten years, the first alleged assaults dating back to 2011.
The crimes came to light in 2020 when Dominique was caught filming under women’s skirts in a shopping center.
After police seized his phone and computer, they say they found evidence of the rapes. An investigation was opened and the wife was made aware of the abuse she had endured for almost ten years.
Court documents show that Dominique has told investigators that the other men were all aware his wife had been drugged without her knowledge, something a number of the other defendants deny.
Christophe Huguenin-Virchaux, a lawyer for one of the men told CNN affiliate BFMTV on Tuesday that his client “admits that sexual relations did in fact take place” but that they took place as part of a “sexual game between a husband and his wife that he was invited to,” adding that he was “not aware that Gisèle was drugged or under medication.”
Throughout the trial, Gisèle will see and hear what was done to her.
On Tuesday, she sat through a reading of the horrific acts she was subjected to, as well as the arguments from each of the defendants’ lawyers.
“It was very difficult,” one of her lawyers, Stéphane Babonneau told CNN on Tuesday. “It was unbearable for her to hear people say they thought she was pretending to sleep and were convinced it was consensual,” he added.
Last Friday ahead of the trial, another one of her lawyers, Antoine Arebalo-Camus told reporters “she had no idea what had been inflicted on her, so she has no memory of the rapes she suffered for 10 years.”
Gisèle could have requested the trial be held privately, but Babonneau told CNN “she wanted it to be a public trial so that everyone can hear and get an idea of the excuses given by men in such circumstances.”
Gisèle’s daughter says her mother sought medical advice for the memory loss and extreme fatigue she was experiencing as a side effect of the drugs.
Speaking to French media in several interviews, she said that her mother “saw doctors, she saw neurologists,” and that the medical profession failed to detect the problem.
The daughter has now started an awareness campaign called “M’endors Pas,” meaning “Don’t put me to sleep” on drug-facilitated sexual assault.
The trial began on September 2 in the southern French town of Avignon, and a verdict is due on December 20 this year."
7T0T0EM3SU_D5FTP86ATEK2XPG,Start of early voting in North Carolina could be delayed after ruling in RFK Jr. ballot challenge,"By Ethan Cohen, CNN","2 minute read Updated 6:13 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/05/politics/early-voting-north-carolina-kennedy/,"The first ballots in the nation are scheduled to start going out Friday in North Carolina, but that could be delayed after a judge ordered a temporary pause on ballot distribution.
The ruling came in response to a request from former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to remove his name from the ballot.
North Carolina’s Democratic-controlled State Board of Elections voted along party lines last week to reject Kennedy’s request, saying that it wouldn’t be practical to reprint ballots and delay the start of voting.
Kennedy, who dropped out of the race last month and endorsed former President Donald Trump, then challenged that decision in court.
Wake County Superior Court Judge Rebecca Holt denied the former candidate’s request Thursday but also ordered a pause to allow Kennedy to appeal.
In her written order, the judge ordered the state not to proceed with mailing absentee ballots before noon Friday.
Holt found that rejecting Kennedy’s request would lead to “minimal” harm to him but that removing his name would be a significant burden for elections officials.
“The court can find no practical, personal or pecuniary harm to the plaintiff should his name remain on the ballot,” Holt said from the bench “The defendant, however, would have to reprint the ballots at considerable cost and effort and will likely find themselves in violation of the state mandated deadline for distributing absentee ballots.”
After the hearing, Paul Cox, the general counsel for the state elections board, instructed counties to not send ballots out Friday morning.
However, Cox said ballots would need to be go out Friday afternoon, unless an appeals court ordered a further delay.
As CNN previously reported, since endorsing Trump, Kennedy has sought to withdraw his name from the ballot in competitive states in order to boost the former president’s chances of winning there. But he has encountered obstacles to those attempts beyond North Carolina.
On Tuesday, a Michigan judge ruled that he must remain on the ballot in the battleground state after Kennedy filed a lawsuit asking the court to remove him. The elections commission in Wisconsin – another Midwestern battleground also ruled last week that Kennedy will appear on the ballot despite a similar request to withdraw.

7U4MNFO508_8MWMH9FDR4GQB5N,This tourism experience costs $800 for an hour. Here’s why it’s worth it,"By Joe Minihane, CNN","8 minute read Updated 6:33 AM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/uganda-gorillas-treks-sustainable-tourism/,"Editor’s Note: This CNN Travel series is, or was, sponsored by the country it highlights. CNN retains full editorial control over subject matter, reporting and frequency of the articles and videos within the sponsorship, in compliance with our policy
Kenya has the majestic Maasai Mara. The reputation of the verdant, fauna-filled Ngorongoro Crater in Tanzania precedes it. Rwanda’s Virunga volcanoes have become the go-to for once-in-a-lifetime encounters with mountain gorillas. And further south, Botswana, Namibia and South Africa are seen as essential stop-offs for those hungry to experience the best wildlife Africa has to offer.
Yet one country is easily forgotten when it comes to spending time in true wilderness and getting up close to nature: Uganda.
This East African gem has it all for the wildlife obsessive: the plains of Queen Elizabeth National Park, home to tree-climbing lions and leopards; the Kazinga Channel with its hippos, elephants, crocodiles and stunning fish eagles; and Bwindi Impenetrable Forest.
Quite simply, it’s underrated and waiting to be explored – especially one profound tourism experience that costs $800 an hour, but is said to be worth every single dollar.
That huge price tag is part of a pattern of big-budget experiences in Uganda that, although inaccessible to many wallets, could help set the country on the path to sustainable tourism at a time when many destinations are now being overwhelmed by visitors.
In Bwindi Impenetrable Forest, home to the largest mountain gorilla population in the world, with over 500 roaming the dense woodland, it costs $800 for foreign non-residents to head out on a strictly timed one-hour trek to meet a group of habituated gorillas. These are led by experts from the Uganda Wildlife Authority, with small groups of eight people assigned to visit one of 18 habituated groups each day.
For $1,500, visitors can take part in a habituation process. Those with a cold are not allowed to take part, such is the concern around passing on the disease to these incredible animals, which share 98% of their DNA with humans.
Although it’s possible to travel relatively cheaply on either side of this experience, many visitors make this bucket-list activity part of a premium adventure. Again, the high price tag usually results in money going to support the at-risk environment.
Volcanoes Safaris has been operating in the region for over 25 years and in July 2024 it opened its fourth luxury lodge in Uganda. Kibale Lodge sits in an unrivaled location, with the Rwenzori Mountains to the West and the Kazinga Channel to the south. With just eight rooms, or bandas, it’s at the very highest end of eco-tourism in Uganda, with rates starting at $1,200 per person per night. Volcanoes is, however, at pains to talk about how it leans on local knowledge and skills to create and sustain its business.
In Kibale it is working with the Jane Goodall Institute to organize community outreach programs, specifically working to build a new generation of women leaders in conservation. And throughout the construction of the lodge learning from local people was vital, says Volcanoes founder Praveen Moman.

“We work in ‘the barefoot villager’ style, sitting down together and working out practical local approaches to aesthetics, making everything locally, whatever the origin of the design,” he says.
“Volcanoes’ in-house construction team is comprised of engineers, fundis, decorators and upholsterers that live in the communities surrounding Volcanoes lodges,” adds Kevin James, Volcanoes Safaris’ chief operating officer.
For example, he says the company’s head of construction, Cyprien Serugero, was born near the Virunga Lodge across the border in Rwanda. He was involved at every stage of the construction of that lodge and now ensures that those living close to the sites in Uganda are able to enjoy the same opportunity.
James says that the company employs over 200 full-time and 300 casual staff from Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Some 85% of those who work at the lodges themselves are drawn from the communities which surround them.
While this work has been successful, one of the biggest issues surrounding sustainable tourism in Uganda centers on “conservation refugees.” The Batwa were forcibly removed from Gahinga and Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Parks on their creation in 1991. While gorilla populations in these areas rebounded, these hunter-gatherers, one of the oldest indigenous tribes in the entire continent, became displaced within their own country. No compensation was paid and years of ostracization followed. With the tribe unused to traditional farming methods, they have faced persecution and discrimination at every turn.
“We believe that the focus of conservation and tourism must be on communities,” says James.
“Local people will only be supporters of tourism and conservation if they receive a tangible benefit. They need to have food on the table, education for the next generation, and progress in their lives. If they are part of the ecotourism and conservation chain and share in its success, then they have an incentive to protect the wildlife and the parks.”

At Volcanoes’ Gahinga Lodge there is a 13-acre permanent Batwa settlement, home to 100 people from 18 families. There is land for crops, a dedicated vocational center for training and passing down ancient rites to the next generation and the opportunity for guests to meet elders and tribal leaders to learn directly about their way of life. It’s a powerful experience and one that lingers long in the mind after visiting.
“The forest is heavily guarded, we know we could be shot [if we go there],” said Batwa tribal leader Safari Monday, speaking his native Rufumbira dialect via an interpreter, back in 2019. “But I understand the restrictions. I don’t think about it.”
Monday spread his arms wide and grinned as he took in what was now his and that of his fellow tribespeople. A place to call home after four years living beneath makeshift shelters. It’s not the same as being in his native habitat, but does go some way to redress the balance and create a path towards a better future.
There is no denying that the model of highly priced, high-quality tourism has the potential to be successful when considered from a sustainability angle, at least when it comes to nature. It’s evident in the numbers of mountain gorillas in particular. According to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the population stood at over 1,000 in 2018 when the last census was conducted, up from 680 in 2008. This is believed to be a direct result of expensive, heavily policed gorilla treks.
While costly, the money raised from the treks allows the UWA and other authorities to pay for greater protection of mountain gorillas from illegal poachers and to prevent devastating habitat loss. Being just a few meters from a mother tending to her young or a silverback staring gruffly into the middle distance is unquestionably one of the most profound things a traveler can do and paying all that money makes a lot of sense.
While such costs may seem extreme, the alternative is something operators cannot entertain, especially when the environment is so fragile and the imperative of balancing the needs of local communities so vital.
According to UK-based operator Responsible Travel, charging high prices and guarding the experience so heavily is key.
“When it comes to the mountain gorillas, low tourist numbers and heavy restrictions are not simply a gimmick,” it says, “… they are essential to prevent the gorillas from becoming distressed or from catching diseases.”
Related article Baby boom for Uganda’s endangered mountain gorillas
Moreover, local people and the environment won’t see any benefit from a mass tourism model which has caused so many issues across the planet, particularly in famously fragile ecosystems such as Australia’s Great Barrier Reef and Vietnam’s Ha Long Bay.
“The great ape national parks of Uganda and Rwanda are tiny natural habitats under immense pressure,” says Kevin James. “There is increasing population pressure around the parks, which is predicted to double in the next 25 years. Local people need land to live on and from which to make a living. If development is not controlled around National Parks, wildlife could be overwhelmed.”
Despite this, he says, tourism, and especially sustainable tourism, has to be part of the solution.
“Volcanoes has seen that without tourism the animals have no value and therefore there’s no economic incentive to safeguard their future. Sensitive and controlled tourism is crucial. However, if tourism is uncontrolled, it risks putting undue pressure through disease and stress on the great apes which will not be conducive to their survival.
“It is imperative that the unique tourism protocols and IUCN best practices guidelines are followed to ensure a positive future for the great apes in the Albertine Rift. It is a very delicate balance.”
According to EU Africa Rise, a European Union-funded body that supports sustainability in East Africa, tourism accounted for 5.9% of Uganda’s GDP in 2019, with a growing awareness of the need for sustainable certification, something which can be expensive for start-ups and small operators.
“Although Uganda struggles internationally with its brand recognition and image (especially compared with regional peers such as Kenya and Tanzania), it does receive very high satisfaction ratings from travelers that visit the country,” according to EU Africa Rise, in a March 2024 report entitled “Towards a Sustainable Tourism economy in Uganda.”
Despite this, there is a growing push towards creating a high-quality experience for travelers in Uganda that is, crucially, both sustainable in terms of development and employment, and where local people are made to feel part of that work.
According to the Adventure Travel Trade Association’s Annual Industry Snapshot Report from June 2023, cited by EU Africa Rise, 68% of operators surveyed had obtained or were trying to gain sustainable certification globally. Yet the Global Sustainable Tourism Criteria, considered the sustainability gold standard for operators, alongside Travelife, a similar certification platform, are seen as too costly by tourism businesses in Uganda. EU Africa Rise says there needs to be a more cost-effective way for Ugandan businesses to gain such recognition, which would in turn allow them to market themselves as among the best in the world.
That Volcanoes, Responsible Travel and EU Africa Rise are doing such important work means that sustainable tourism can grow and even thrive in Uganda. But it needs to be based around a model where expensive trips that fund research and communities come first, all the better to stop these places being overwhelmed and potentially lost forever."
7UAPQ9SFR2_NJ388EM12NQXPHO,"After NY governor says China’s consul general was removed, State Department says ‘there was no expulsion action’","By Gloria Pazmino, Mark Morales and Celina Tebor, CNN","5 minute read Updated 6:35 PM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/04/us/china-consul-general-ny-expelled/,"Following New York Gov. Kathy Hochul’s comments Wednesday that China’s consul general in New York was removed from his position after her former aide was charged with acting as an agent for the Chinese government, the US State Department said later that “there was no expulsion action.”
The diplomat had reached the end of their regularly scheduled rotation and left at the end of August, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Wednesday at a briefing.
However, a spokesperson for the Chinese Consulate General in New York said diplomat Huang Ping is “performing his duties as usual,” according to a statement to CNN Wednesday, seemingly conflicting with the comments made by Hochul and the State Department.
At a news conference earlier Wednesday, Hochul said she was on the phone with a high-ranking State Department official at the request of Antony Blinken about Huang Ping’s status. Hochul spoke with Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell, Miller said.
Hochul said during the phone call she “conveyed my desire to have the consul general from the People’s Republic of China at the New York Mission expelled, and I’ve been informed that the consul general is no longer in the New York Mission.”
When asked to clarify if the consul general was expelled, Hochul responded, “I know that they’re no longer in their position. That’s all I know.”
Miller said there was no expulsion action: “The consul general was not expelled. Our understanding is that the consul general reached the end of a regularly scheduled rotation in August, and so rotated out of the position, but was not expelled.”
“But, of course, when it comes to the status of particular employees of a foreign mission, I would refer you to the foreign country to speak to it, but there was no expulsion action,” Miller said.
“That said, foreign interference, including attempts to influence through covert activities that should be registered under the Foreign Agents Registration Act and are not registered, are things that we take very seriously, as you saw by the action the Department of Justice took yesterday,” Miller added.
When asked about the consul general’s involvement, Hochul said, “I believe that the Chinese government, with their behavior, in doing this and working with Linda Sun, is not acceptable – it is a statement by us that we’re not tolerating this. Anybody representing that government needs to move on. That was what we made clear.”
Hochul’s comments came after Sun, a former deputy chief of staff to Hochul and an aide to then-Gov. Andrew Cuomo, was charged with violating and conspiring to violate the Foreign Agents Registrations Act, visa fraud, alien smuggling and money laundering conspiracy, according to an unsealed copy of the indictment.

Her husband and co-defendant, Chris Hu, was also charged with money laundering conspiracy and conspiracy to commit bank fraud as well as misusing means of identification, federal prosecutors said Tuesday.
Sun and Hu both pleaded not guilty to all charges in federal court Tuesday afternoon. Sun’s bond is set at $1.5 million and her husband’s is set at $500,000.
Hochul said Wednesday she’s been helping the Department of Justice for months and will continue to work with them.
She called Sun’s actions an “absolute betrayal of the trust of two administrations in state government,” and went as far as “even forging my signature on documents.”
Hochul said the FBI “asked her one question” – to verify whether something was her signature.
Hochul said Sun was a “mid-level aide” and said she didn’t have contact with her “very often” and had “no real role in my policies” as governor.
The governor said she feels “confident in our vetting process right now.”
“We have very high levels of background checks,” Hochul said.
The governor cautioned she wasn’t able to provide detailed information about the investigation into Sun: “There’s an ongoing investigation, there’ll be court proceedings, maybe a trial – all this will be revealed but it’s not information I can divulge at this time,” she said.
Sun acted as “an undisclosed agent of the Chinese government while her husband, Hu, facilitated the transfer of millions of dollars in kickbacks for personal gain,” prosecutors said in a news release.
While working for state government, Sun influenced the messaging of high-level state officials regarding issues of importance to China, blocked Taiwanese government representatives from access to the officials, and obtained official New York State proclamations for Chinese government representatives without authorization, prosecutors alleged in the indictment.
The couple’s arrest comes at a time when US-China relations remain fraught over a host of frictions including Beijing’s aggressions in the South China Sea and toward Taiwan, and US trade controls targeting China.
CNN has reached out to the US State Department and the Chinese Embassy in Washington for comment.
Related article A former New York official is accused of acting on behalf of the Chinese government. Here’s a timeline of her alleged actions
An attorney for Sun, Jarrod Schaeffer, told CNN the charges “are inflammatory and appear to be the product of an overly aggressive prosecution.”
“We are also troubled by aspects of the government’s investigation. As we said today in court, our client is eager … to defend against these accusations in the proper forum – a court of law,” Schaeffer said.
A defense attorney for Hu, Seth DuCharme addressed reporters outside court Tuesday, saying, “We have a lot of confidence in our case.”
“A lot of the allegations in this indictment are frankly perplexing, overly inflammatory,” he said. “As you heard in court today, we are looking forward to our day in court. The defendants are exercising their right to a speedy trial as soon as they can; we have a lot of confidence in Chris and in Linda.”
China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was unaware of the aide accused of working for China.
“I am not aware of the situation you mentioned,” spokesperson Mao Ning said, adding, “I will not comment on the domestic cases in the United States, but we oppose malicious associations and slander against China.”

The child was arrested Sunday afternoon after admitting to killing Joe Cornelius Sr., 82, and Keisha Miles, 31, in Minden, Louisiana, earlier that day, Police Chief Jared McIver said during a news conference Tuesday.
Cornelius was a former longtime Minden city councilman and former interim mayor of Minden, the current mayor said.
“Joe Cornelius’ years of service to Minden were marked by his commitment and dedication to the betterment of our community,” Mayor Nick Cox said in a release posted to Facebook. “On a personal note, I am grateful for his friendship and the many ways he supported me and others in our city.”
The boy, who was described only as a relative of the victims, has been charged with two counts of first-degree murder and is being held on a $500,000 bond, McIver said. It is unclear if the child will be tried as an adult.
CNN is working to determine if the boy has legal representation.
Police found the victims in a home with gunshot wounds after a family member called 911, McIver said. Authorities found two weapons hidden on the property, and their calibers matched empty shell casings left at the scene, the chief said without elaborating. It is unknown how the child got hold of the weapons, McIver added.
The boy told responding officers “a story at first that just didn’t add up,” before he was taken to the police station by a guardian and eventually confessed to the crime, McIver said.
The chief added the motive behind the double slaying remains unknown.
“We are still piecing the puzzle pieces together right now, there is a lot of pieces to put together, a lot of evidence that has been collected,” McIver said. “Who knows why someone would do something this malicious, and at that age.”
McIver said everybody in the community knew “Mr. Joe,” adding “The city is in mourning.”
“That’s what hurts the most, when you know somebody that’s been in the community that long that’s reached so many people, there’s a sorrow.”
Cox again lauded Cornelius’ career at Tuesday’s news conference.
“Joe Cornelius was more than just a public servant. He was a committed leader who dedicated many years to the service of the city of Minden,” Cox said. “Joe’s efforts to improve Minden have left a lasting impact that will be remembered for years to come.”
Minden is about 30 miles east of Shreveport and has a population of just more than 12,600.

The hotels are reportedly still open but guests will deal with a skeleton staff unable to provide full services. UNITE HERE, the union representing the striking workers, says they are striking not just for better pay but also better working conditions, including the return of automatic daily room cleaning that many hotels dropped during the pandemic.
“We’re on strike because the hotel industry has gotten off track,” Gwen Mills, International President of UNITE HERE, said in a statement Sunday morning. “During Covid, everyone suffered, but now the hotel industry is making record profits while workers and guests are left behind. Too many hotels still haven’t restored standard services that guests deserve. Workers aren’t making enough to support their families. Many can no longer afford to live in the cities that they welcome guests to.”
Aissata Seck, a banquet food server who has worked at Hilton Park Plaza in Boston for 18 years, said her rent has increased from $1,900 to $2,900 in the last five years. “My pay only covers my rent,” she told CNN. She is now working as an Uber driver to make ends meet.
Apple Ratanabunsrithang, a cook at Hilton Union Square in San Francisco, told CNN’s Gloria Pazmino that she “has to work two jobs to survive in the city,” and while wages are important, so is keeping health care benefits. “The majority of people that work and are in the union are long established — they’ve worked 10, 20, 30 years. So their whole life is working at a hotel, which is physical work, so the health care is very important,” she said.
Mills told CNN that the lack of daily room cleaning not only costs jobs for her union’s members — reducing housekeeping employment by nearly 40% — but it also increases a cleaning staff’s workload, since it requires tending to rooms that haven’t been cleaned for a number of days.
The hotel chains facing striking workers include Hilton, Hyatt and Marriott. The hotels have 23,000 rooms between them in the cities of Boston, San Diego, San Francisco, San Jose, Seattle, as well as Honolulu and Kauai in Hawaii, and Greenwich, Connecticut, according to the union.
The union is threatening to possibly expand the strike to as many as 65 hotels in 12 different cities, possibly adding hotels in Baltimore, Oakland, California, as well as Providence, Rhode Island, and New Haven, Connecticut. Spokespeople for Hilton and Hyatt told CNN on Friday they are committed to reaching deals with the union, but they also will continue to serve customers during any work stoppage.
Hyatt said in a statement it is disappointed by the union’s decision to strike. “We look forward to continuing to negotiate fair contracts and recognize the contributions of Hyatt employees,” said Michael D’Angelo, head of labor relations at Hyatt.
Last year, the 15,000 members of the same union went on strike during the Fourth of July holiday weekend at 65 hotels in Los Angeles and Orange counties in Southern California. They returned to work a few days later but staged a series of rolling strikes in the months that followed, sometimes tied to major tourist periods, such as the weekend of Taylor Swift concerts in Los Angeles.
These strikes are set to end after three days, as occurred in Los Angeles’ work stoppage. The union has yet to determine whether or not they will return on a rolling basis as they did in Southern California last year, Mills told CNN on Friday ahead of the strike deadline. A return of rolling strikes has not been ruled out.
The union eventually reached deals for all but three of the hotels they had targeted, but those agreements weren’t reached until earlier this year.
This has been a particularly busy Labor Day weekend for travel with AAA expecting a 9% increase in domestic travel compared to last year and the Transportation Security Administration expecting record passenger screenings at US airports.

8297R7762P_VFD4EUXORUC0YT5,Remote Indigenous tribe kills two loggers encroaching on their land in Peru,Story by Associated Press,"3 minute read Published 10:47 AM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/05/americas/indigenous-tribe-kills-loggers-peru-intl-scli/,"Two loggers have been killed by bow and arrow after allegedly encroaching the land of the uncontacted Mashco Piro Indigenous tribe deep in Peru’s Amazon, according to a rights group.
The group, known as FENAMAD, defends the rights of Peru’s Indigenous peoples. It says tensions between loggers and Indigenous tribes are on the rise and more government protective action is needed.
Two other loggers in the attack were missing and another was injured, FENAMAD said, and rescue efforts were underway.

The rights group, which represents 39 Indigenous communities in the Cusco and Madre de Dios regions in southeastern Peru, said the incident took place on August 29 in the Pariamanu river basin while loggers were expanding their passageways into the forest and came into contact with the reclusive and renowned territorial tribe.
“The Peruvian state has not taken preventive and protective measures to ensure the lives and integrity of the workers who have been gravely affected,” the group said in a statement Tuesday, adding authorities have yet to arrive in the area since the incident.
FENAMAD said the attack happened just 25 kilometers (15.5 miles) from a July incident, when the Mashco Piro again attacked loggers. The group said in their statement that even though they advised the government of the risk of a rise in violence, nothing has been done.
“It’s a heated and tense situation,” said Cesar Ipenza, an Amazon-based lawyer who specializes in environmental law in Peru. “Undoubtedly, every day there are more tensions between Indigenous peoples in isolation and the different activities that are within the territory that they ancestrally pass through.”
There have been several other previous reports of conflicts. In one incident in 2022, two loggers were shot with arrows while fishing, one fatally, in an encounter with tribal members.

In January, Peru loosened restrictions on deforestation, which critics dubbed the “anti-forest law.” Researchers have since warned of the rise in deforestation for agriculture and how it is making it easier for illicit logging and mining.
Ipenaza said some effort has been made by authorities in the area, like mobilizing a helicopter, but overall there has been “little commitment” by Peru’s Ministry of Culture, responsible for the protection of Indigenous peoples.
The Ministry of Culture did not immediately respond to a message Wednesday seeking comment on the attack and their protection efforts.
The attack took place a day before the Forest Stewardship Council suspended the sustainability certification of a logging company for eight months which rights groups and activists have accused of encroaching on the Indigenous group’s land.
“It’s absurd that certifiers like the FSC keep the certification of companies that clearly and openly violate basic human rights and Indigenous rights,” said Julia Urrunaga, director of the Peru program at the Environmental Investigation Agency. “How terrible that people have to keep dying and that it has to be an international scandal for action to be taken.”"
8367715IHV_TOZENJQGEXJUEGR,Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson reflects on ‘groundbreaking’ path to the Supreme Court in new memoir,"By John Fritze and Lauren del Valle, CNN","7 minute read Updated 7:07 AM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240903,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/03/politics/ketanji-brown-jackson-new-memoir/,"Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson is using a new memoir published Tuesday to reflect on a personal journey that has already earned her a place in history.
Jackson recalls sinking into her chair when she was an appeals court judge – her blood “a roaring ocean in my ears” – when President Joe Biden called in early 2022 to say he would nominate her to the high court, setting her on a path to become the first Black woman to serve as a Supreme Court justice.
“From my perspective, my arrival at the pinnacle of the legal profession was indeed groundbreaking, the culmination of a life spent toiling in relative obscurity, marked by my being suddenly thrust into the white-hot spotlight of national prominence,” Jackson writes in her book, “Lovely One.”
She added, “For many, my seat at the table represents the realization of our country’s highest ideals in a land that promises opportunity and equality to all.”
Jackson, who turns 54 this month, joined the Supreme Court two years ago and is already establishing herself as a thoughtful questioner, a prolific opinion writer and a reliable vote for the court’s liberal wing.  Biden’s first and only nominee, Jackson succeeded Justice Stephen Breyer, for whom she once clerked.
In the coming days, Jackson will travel across the country to promote the memoir, speaking to sold-out theaters as well as public libraries. This week, she’ll speak in New York, Washington, DC, Atlanta and Miami.
Her memoir doesn’t delve deeply into the law or behind-the-scenes workings of the Supreme Court. Instead, she tells the story of a modern family – and, specifically, a modern mother – juggling a demanding career alongside a young family, including a daughter diagnosed at 11 with mild autism spectrum disorder.
Jackson details impossible commutes and childcare stresses, parent-teacher conferences that don’t go as planned and stolen naps in Safeway parking lots borne of exhaustion.
But she also focuses on the triumphs at home and at work, including her relationship with her husband, Dr. Patrick Jackson, a prominent surgeon; a diagnosis that helped her eldest daughter thrive; and a nomination to a US District Court judgeship during the Obama administration.
The book’s title is a reference to Jackson’s name. Chosen by her parents from a list provided by an influential aunt, “Ketanji Onyika,” they were told, meant “Lovely One” in an African dialect.
“As I grew older, the sound of my name would often remind me of my aunt,” Jackson writes. “And when people would tell me that my name was unique, creative, and beautiful, I would think of it as a tribute to the woman who had gifted it to me.”
The book offers a personal and relatable narrative of a prominent justice at a time when the high court as an institution is under considerable scrutiny for a series of ethics scandals and politically charged rulings on abortion, guns and presidential immunity.
Speaking at the famed Apollo Theater in Harlem on Tuesday night to promote the book, Jackson acknowledged that the court shouldn’t be exempt from public criticism – though she didn’t embrace any specific ideas for how to address its slipping support.
“The court is an institution that doesn’t have any other mechanism of enforcement than public trust. And so it’s particularly significant when there is a deficit of trust,” Jackson said. “This sort of how our system works – the judges, in my view, are not beyond criticism or constraint. We are a government branch. We are government servants and officials. And so in a democracy, the people decide the form and the structure of government. And so in order to decide that people have to be engaged, they have to debate these issues. And that’s what we see happening now.”
Expanding on those remarks during an appearance on CBS’ “The Late Show” Tuesday, Jackson acknowledged that public perception of the high court is “problematic.”
“I’m aware that that is the public perception, and I think it’s problematic for the court that that’s a perception that the public has, because we really rely on public trust in order to do our jobs,” Jackson said. “It’s a concern.”
Jackson on Tuesday night recalled some of the preparation she underwent for her confirmation in 2022, which at times grew testy as Republicans attempted to get her to define her judicial philosophy and explain some of her sentencing decisions as a federal trial court judge. In one-on-one interactions, the senators were “lovely,” she said, which helped her cope with the sometimes-brutal moments of her confirmation hearing.
“It was also super helpful in the hearing because we had had a conversation, so I said, ‘Oh, I see. You’re not really talking to me, right?’” she said. “’You must be talking to your constituents or to someone else.’”
She recalled some of the best advice she received from White House advisors during her preparation for the confirmation battle that helped her maintain her composure.
“You can get angry, or you can be a Supreme Court justice,” she said she was counseled.
Born in Washington, DC, in 1970, Jackson in her memoir pins her good fortune, at least in part, on timing. She came of age at the dawn of the post-Civil Rights era, with a family that impressed upon her the significance of the moment for African Americans. Jackson not only capitalized on that opportunity but was fixated on meeting the challenges put before her.
“I had understood from the outset that my learning curve as a district court judge would be the steepest I had ever encountered,” she writes about taking her seat on the federal bench in 2013. “I intended to be unimpeachable as I climbed.”
At least some of the landmark anti-discrimination laws that Jackson cites in her book, including the Voting Rights Act of 1965, are now being challenged at the Supreme Court. During Jackson’s first term on the court, a majority of her colleagues barred consideration of race to ensure diversity on college campuses. Jackson dissented in one of those cases and recused herself in another, involving Harvard College, because she had previously served on the school’s board of overseers.
The memoir is being published by Random House weeks before the Supreme Court begins a new term in October that will feature cases dealing with transgender rights, ghost guns and the federal regulation of e-cigarettes. Jackson reported receiving nearly $894,000 from Random House last year, though that is likely only the first of multiple payments.
While justices often publish memoirs after serving for at least several years on the court, Jackson’s went on sale just more than two years after she was seated – far faster than any of her colleagues’ recent books. Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett have also announced book deals and Justice Neil Gorsuch published a book of his own earlier this summer.
Though she briefly touches on general legal controversies – such as those dealing with criminal sentencing – Jackson avoids mentioning cases before the court. At one point, she appears to question the way some of her colleagues are focusing on history in their rulings.
“Whose history,” she asks, is being considered in those analyses?
“It is true that not everyone was represented at the table when our country was being birthed, or when our vaunted Constitution was being hammered out,” she writes. “Yet the principles of liberty and equality that the framers adopted and that are now enshrined as the bedrock of our society mean that, today, every citizen can enter those rooms, protected by laws that recognize the civil liberties and human rights of all Americans.”
Jackson writes at length about her older daughter, Talia, who is academically gifted but who sometimes struggled with social interactions and transitions at school. After years of navigating what Jackson describes as “outright trauma,” her daughter was diagnosed with autism.
“There is no use in pretending that we weren’t completely devastated by the long-overdue confirmation of what I had suspected all along: that our older child was on the autism spectrum,” Jackson writes. At the same time, Jackson described the news as something of a relief.
“We could end our denial,” she writes.
“As Talia learned to advocate for herself through the years, she would educate us about how she was not ‘a person with autism’ but, rather, was autistic – by which she meant that her autism was an identity as much as her being Black and female,” Jackson writes. “Autism was another lens through which she engaged the world, with full awareness of her strengths and mindful of her trials.”
In thinking about her place in history, Jackson writes that the framers of the Constitution probably couldn’t have foreseen her story – her struggle and, ultimately, her successes.
“I highly doubt that any of them could have envisioned me, the descendant of enslaved Africans, the offspring of parents raised in the Jim Crow era, and a post–civil rights daughter, donning a borrowed robe to take her oath of judicial office and join the ranks of that esteemed branch of government,” Jackson writes. “But that is the very genius of the framers’ foundational guarantee of liberty and justice for all.”

84NIMKD149_OBOC0CF2RH76YRF,A former New York official is accused of acting on behalf of the Chinese government. Here’s a timeline of her alleged actions,"By Elizabeth Wolfe, CNN","8 minute read Updated 11:06 AM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/04/us/timeline-linda-sun-kathy-hochul-aide/,"Allegations of money laundering, falsified signatures and surreptitious communications fill the federal indictment brought against Linda Sun, a longtime New York governors’ aide who was charged Tuesday with acting as an agent for the Chinese government.
Sun, a former deputy chief of staff to New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and aide to former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, faces 10 counts, including violating the Foreign Agents Registrations Act, visa fraud, alien smuggling and money laundering conspiracy, according to an unsealed copy of the indictment.
Federal prosecutors allege Sun has been operating for years as an undisclosed agent of the People’s Republic of China, using her high-ranking positions in New York government to fulfill the PRC’s requests and further the interests of the Chinese Communist Party.
In the indictment, prosecutors lay out Sun’s alleged efforts to allow the PRC access to private government communications, influence the governors’ public remarks on China and block the Taiwanese government from communicating with Cuomo and Hochul.
As Sun served in high-ranking positions in New York, her husband, Chris Hu, is accused of orchestrating the transfer of millions of dollars in “kickbacks” from the PRC, which the couple used to purchase expensive properties and luxury cars, prosecutors said. Hu was also charged with money laundering conspiracy and conspiracy to commit bank fraud as well as misusing means of identification.
During a federal court hearing Tuesday, prosecutors alleged the defendants used shell companies, iCloud accounts and WeChat messages – with everything in Mandarin – in their alleged crimes.
These are the ‘gifts’ prosecutors say ex-aide to two New York governors got from the Chinese government
Sun and Hu both pleaded not guilty to all charges Tuesday afternoon. Sun’s bond is set at $1.5 million and her husband’s is set at $500,000. Both will have their travel limited to New York City, Long Island, Maine and New Hampshire.
An attorney for Sun, Jarrod Schaeffer, told CNN the charges “are inflammatory and appear to be the product of an overly aggressive prosecution.”
“We are also troubled by aspects of the government’s investigation. As we said today in court, our client is eager … to defend against these accusations in the proper forum – a court of law,” Schaeffer said.
Here is a timeline of some of the key allegations against Sun as she moved through the New York State government:
August 2012: Sun is hired by then-Gov. Cuomo’s administration as director of Asian American affairs and Queens representative. She left the office in 2015 to be the director of external affairs for Empire State Development, which handles economic development across the state.
June 9, 2016: Sun messaged a PRC official to inform them the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office, which effectively serves as the island’s embassy in the US, had invited then-Lieutenant Gov. Hochul to appear at SelectUSA, an investment summit in Washington, DC, to be held later that month, according to the indictment.
“They sent the invitation to another colleague trying to bypass me. I am working on it right now to resolve the issue,” Sun wrote to the PRC official, according to the indictment. Later, Sun followed up to say, “It’s all been taken care of satisfactorily.”
Prosecutors note that on June 21, 2016, Hochul attended a SelectUSA reception hosted by the PRC Embassy and the China General Chamber of Commerce – USA, instead of an event held by Taiwan.
February 2018: Sun became Cuomo’s deputy chief diversity officer.
March 2018: Prosecutors accuse Sun of committing visa fraud by supplying unauthorized invitation letters on behalf of the governor’s office to a delegation of PRC representatives, which helped the delegation obtain visas to enter the US, according to the indictment.
The letters, which Sun was not authorized to issue or sign, bore falsified handwritten versions of Hochul’s signature, the indictment alleges.
The PRC delegation from the Henan Province arrived in the US in June 2018, where they met with Hochul to discuss economic cooperation between their province and New York, the document said.
January 2019: Sun wrote to a PRC official, “I very much value my relationship with the consulate and have done many things to make the relationship between the state and the consulate flourish during my tenure with (Politician-1),” according to the indictment. Though Politician 1 is unnamed, Sun was serving under Cuomo at the time.
“Certainly I have managed to stop all relationships between the TECO and the state. I have denied all (r)equests from their office,” Sun said, according to the indictment.
The PRC official responded, “I know and do appreciate your help” and referred to Sun as “the most important hub connecting us with (Politician-1) and his team,” the document said.

March 16, 2020: Sun gave an unnamed Chinese official access to a private conference call held by New York State government leaders discussing their response to the Covid-19 pandemic and rising hate crimes against Asian Americans, the indictment alleges.
Sun, who was then acting as deputy chief diversity officer under Cuomo, “surreptitiously added” the PRC official to the call, though the official was not on the invitation list, the indictment alleges.
“At the close of the call, PRC Official-4 commented that the call was ‘(v)ery useful,’” it adds.
Prosecutors listed the call as evidence Sun allegedly violated the Foreign Agents Registration Act.
July 2020: Sun moved to the New York State Department of Financial Services, where she worked as Superintendent for Intergovernmental Affairs and Chief Diversity Officer.
Sometime in 2021: In 2021, Sun and Hu purchased millions of dollars in real estate, which prosecutors said was possible due to hefty financial rewards from their alleged efforts to aid the PRC, according to the indictment.
Sometime that year, the couple purchased a $3.6 million parcel of real estate in Manhasset, New York, and a $1.9 million ocean-view condominium in Honolulu, Hawaii, the indictment said. The couple didn’t take out any mortgage loans to make the purchases, the document notes.
Prosecutors noted the couple’s spending far outpaced the income noted on their federal tax returns that year. But shortly before making the purchases, Hu received more than $2.1 million in wire transfers from a PRC-based account under the name of his business partner, the indictment alleges.
“Sun did not report the real estate acquisitions on her financial disclosure statements, as she was obligated to do,” the indictment reads.
January 2021: Sun worked to remove mention of China’s mass detention of Muslim Uyghurs from Hochul’s public remarks, according to the indictment.
On January 12, after receiving a request from a PRC official, Sun said she would ask Hochul to record a video in honor of Lunar New Year, the document said. She asked the officials, “Can you share with me some talking points of things you want her to mention(?) I can make sure to include it in her remarks.”
A few days later, Sun told the PRC official she had argued with Hochul’s speechwriter, who had insisted the then-lieutenant governor should mention “the ‘Uyghur situation,’” the indictment said. Sun said she would not allow Hochul to mention the Uyghurs, it added.
Ultimately, Hochul did not mention the Uyghurs in her public Lunar New Year message, the indictment said.
That same month, the US officially determined China was committing genocide and crimes against humanity against Uyghur Muslims and ethnic and religious minority groups in the northwestern region of Xinjiang. China strongly denied allegations of human rights abuses.
August 24, 2021: Hochul became governor of New York after Cuomo resigned amid a parade of scandals. The following month, Sun became Deputy Chief of Staff in the governor’s office and served as Hochul’s advisor.
September 2022: Sun transferred to the New York State Department of Labor as its Deputy Commissioner for Strategic Business Development.
January 2023: After receiving a request from PRC government representatives, Sun obtained an unauthorized proclamation from the New York Governor’s Office to be presented at an event celebrating the Lunar New Year, prosecutors said.
“Sun obtained this proclamation from an Office of Correspondence employee outside ordinary channels and did not follow protocol by seeking supervisory authorization to create such a proclamation,” the indictment reads.
The Office of Correspondence employee mailed the proclamation to Sun’s personal address, and Sun sent a gift basket to the home of a relative of the employee, the indictment said.
When questioned by the NYS Office of the Inspector General, Sun initially denied requesting any proclamations since moving to the Department of Labor, but later admitted to requesting the Lunar New Year proclamation for a PRC official, the document said.
March 2, 2023: Sun is terminated from her position with the Department of Labor. However, Sun reportedly continued to attend events held by Asian community members claiming to represent the Department of Labor, the indictment said.
August 10, 2023: Sun received a cease-and-desist letter from the Department of Labor, which said she “allegedly attended public and professional events purporting to represent [her]self as an agency official” after she was terminated, the indictment said.
July 2024: Federal investigators raided a home belonging to Sun and Hu.
Hochul called Sun’s alleged behavior “a betrayal of trust” that left the governor furious, outraged and “absolutely shocked,” she said during an appearance with WNYC radio.
Hochul said her office fired Sun in 2023 “the second we discovered some levels of misconduct” and “alerted the authorities – and hence we ended up with what happened here today.”
The depth of the allegations against Sun was apparent to the governor and her staff only after reading details of the indictment, said Hochul, who emphasized to WNYC that Sun worked less than two years for her administration and was initially hired by the previous one.
Rich Azzopardi, a spokesperson for Cuomo, said in a statement that national security “must be free from foreign influence.”
“While Ms. Sun was promoted to deputy chief of staff in the subsequent administration, during our time she worked in a handful of agencies and was one of many community liaisons who had little to no interaction with the governor,” the statement said.

Anger at Netanyahu – who has been accused of stalling efforts for a deal by some hostage families and their supporters – reached a boiling point Sunday as protesters responded in fury to the news that another six captives had been found killed in Gaza. Israel’s largest labor union called for a general strike on Monday and threatened to shut down the “entire Israeli economy.”
The extent of the strike early Monday was not yet clear but supporters have vowed a national response.
Three of the six hostages found dead, including Israeli-American Hersh Goldberg-Polin, had been expected to be released in an eventual ceasefire, Israeli officials told CNN. Autopsies showed they were shot at short range on Thursday or Friday morning; Israeli forces announced the recovery of their bodies from an underground tunnel in Rafah on Saturday.
The details of their deaths fueled anger that was palpable across the country as protesters blocked highways, waved Israeli flags, and chanted, “we won’t abandon them” in reference to the more than 100 hostages, including 35 believed to be dead, being held in Gaza, according to data from Israeli Prime Minister’s Office. The vast majority of those hostages were taken during Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel, when some 1,200 people were killed and more than 200 taken captive.
In Tel Aviv, a group of protesters stood behind a mock cemetery while holding signs saying “named after Benjamin Netanyahu,” as they cast blame on the prime minister for the  deaths of the hostages.
Later in the evening, police threw stun grenades at protesters blocking the Ayalon highway in the city, according to video verified by CNN. Naama Lazimi, a member of Israel’s parliament who was present at the demonstration, said on X that stun grenades “were thrown toward both sides where the demonstrators were standing in complete surprise and without any advance warning.”
Israeli police also fired foam from a water cannon at protesters on the highway – prompting demonstrators to chant, “Officer, who are you keeping safe?”
Police arrested 29 people in the city, accusing them of vandalism, disorderly conduct and attacking officers.
The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said at least 700,000 people took part in protests across Israel, with an estimated 550,000 of them in Tel Aviv. CNN cannot independently verify the figures and has asked Israeli police to provide an estimation of the crowd size.
In Tel Aviv, crowds were visibly emotional; many shouted “sorry” as the names of the six hostages were recited on a loudspeaker during the protest, which organizers said was the biggest since the start of the war.
One protester told CNN said she was there to show support for her cousin, whose body was repatriated by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) overnight. “I’m here every week, I wanted to show her father and other parents that we are here for them,” she said. “And on the other side, we’re incredibly angry at the government. What they’ve been doing is unforgivable.”
In Jerusalem, protesters called for Netanyahu to resign as the government held a cabinet meeting. Eden Kramer, who attended the rally with a toddler in a stroller, said she was also demonstrating for the child’s future. “We hope everyone will come out today to bring a message to the government: We can’t keep up like this anymore,” she said.
The discovery of the six hostage bodies has thrown negotiations for a deal into question.
Skepticism has mounted over Netanyahu’s willingness to strike one given fierce opposition from far-right ministers in his coalition. The Israeli prime minister’s political future largely depends on his far-right coalition partners – several of whom have already threatened to leave the government and cause its collapse if he agrees to the deal.
During a cabinet meeting on Sunday, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant lambasted the Israeli government for what he said was prioritizing control of a key border area known as the Philadelphi corridor over a deal to free hostages, calling it a “moral disgrace.”
The Philadelphi corridor, a 14-kilometer (8.7 mile) stretch that runs along the border between Gaza and Egypt, is currently controlled by the IDF. The deployment of Israeli troops along the corridor during the first phase of a ceasefire agreement has been a major point of contention between Israel and Hamas, with Hamas saying Israeli troops must withdraw from the border zone. Netanyahu says control of the corridor is needed to prevent Hamas from resuming arms smuggling through tunnels underneath it.
Gallant, who has increasingly found himself isolated within Netanyahu’s cabinet on the issue of a hostage deal, warned his colleagues Sunday that “if we continue on this path, we won’t manage to achieve the goals that we set for ourselves.”
He added, “If we want the hostages alive, we don’t have time.”
A senior US official said the killings of the hostages called into question how serious Hamas is about reaching a deal as three of them were set to be released as part of the ceasefire agreement.
“US officials had been working on a final package together with Qatar and Egypt. The package included Hersh (Goldberg-Polin) and a number of the hostages who were just executed,” the senior US official said Sunday.
“This calls into question Hamas’ seriousness about a deal, even as pressure also builds on Israel and Netanyahu personally.”
A source familiar with the ceasefire talks told CNN it wasn’t clear how the killings would affect the discussions, adding that the impact will likely be seen in the next day or two.
The “situation is complicated,” the source said. There are currently no in-person joint negotiations with the parties, but the source said discussions continue through the regular channels.
US President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris will meet in the Situation Room on Monday with the US team negotiating a deal, according to the White House.
Israel’s far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has asked the country’s attorney general to request urgent injunctions to prevent the planned nationwide strike on Monday.
In a letter addressed to Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara, Smotrich argued that a strike would hurt the economy during wartime and set a dangerous precedent. The attorney general’s office has not yet commented on the request.
He had earlier instructed the finance ministry’s salary department to pass on a directive that anyone who joins the strike on Monday will not be paid.
The chairman of Israel’s largest trade union, known as Histadrut, warned on Sunday that the country was “in a downward spiral, and we don’t stop receiving body bags.”
Arnon Bar-David, who called for the strike, told a press conference that “only a strike would shock, and that’s why I’ve decided that starting tomorrow at six in the morning, the entire Israeli economy will shut down.”
He added that the strike would include the shutdown of Ben-Gurion Airport. In a statement, Ben-Gurion Airport said it would be “open for flights and landings on Monday, September 2.”
The Hebrew University of Jerusalem said it would join the strike, which it described as a “response to the tragic news of the murder of our student Carmel Gat, along with five other Israeli hostages.”
Gat, a 40-year-old occupational therapist, was taken by Hamas from her parents’ home in the border kibbutz of Be’eri in southern Israel on October 7.
A spokesperson for the university said the shutdown would be more extensive than previous measures taken since the beginning of the war, such as a partial strike in June.

89QXH7D1IX_4CY8E1MPQ680OO0,Maduro decrees Christmas will start in October as Venezuela cracks down on dissent,"By Stefano Pozzebon, CNN","3 minute read Updated 1:17 AM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/03/americas/christmas-venezuela-october-maduro-intl-latam/,"Christmas will start next month in Venezuela, authoritarian leader Nicolas Maduro has decreed – even as thousands of Venezuelans look set to pass the holidays behind bars amid his government’s crackdown on political unrest.
“September smells like Christmas!” Maduro said in his weekly television show on Monday, to the apparent delight of his audience.
“This year and to honor you all, to thank you all, I am going to decree the beginning of Christmas on October 1. Christmas arrived for everyone, in peace, joy and security!” he said.
Maduro’s decree – not the first of its kind, but the earliest – comes as Venezuela grapples with the fallout from July’s presidential election, which saw Maduro claim a third term despite global skepticism and outcry from the country’s opposition movement.
Just a few hours before Maduro’s announcement, Venezuelan authorities published an arrest warrant for his main rival, opposition leader Edmundo Gonzalez, accusing him of “crimes associated with terrorism.” Gonzalez has failed to respond to three summons regarding an investigation into an opposition website that posted results from the contested vote, the Venezuela Prosecutor’s Office said.
Maduro has been under pressure at home and abroad since claiming victory. The opposition coalition backing Gonzalez insists the presidential vote was stolen, publishing online vote tally sheets, which experts say indicate Maduro actually lost the presidency by a significant margin.
The US and other neighboring governments have demanded that Venezuelan authorities reveal granular voting data to verify the outcome. US authorities this week also announced that a Venezuelan plane used by Maduro for international travel was seized in the Dominican Republic.
A second plane linked to Maduro is under 24-hour surveillance by authorities in the Dominican Republic, a source with knowledge of the matter told CNN.
Protests over the vote in the streets of Venezuela have been fiercely repressed. Some 2,400 people have been arrested, and many others are now fleeing the country. Some are hiding in their homes, telling CNN they are afraid to step foot outside due to intimidation by government supporters.
The crackdown is the deadliest in years, according to a new analysis by Human Rights Watch, which says it has documented 11 killings that it says took place in the context of mass political protests over the July 28 vote.
“On average, [this year] is much more intense in terms of the amount of people that have died in the context of post-electoral violence and protest,” HRW Director for the Americas Juanita Goebertus told CNN.
Non-governmental organizations have reported 24 people killed.

“In terms of detention, more than 2400 [people arrested], that is way above the data we saw in 2014 and 2017,” Goebertus added, referring to previous cycles of protests in Venezuela that were also repressed in violence.
Maduro, despite his jollity on Monday, has been at the forefront of the crackdown, ordering the opening of two new prisons to accommodate detained protesters and openly calling for everyone in the streets to be imprisoned.
He has also endorsed what is informally referred to as “Operation Knock-Knock” – a play on the name of a popular Venezuelan Christmas song, repurposed to evoke the sound of government security services knocking on critics’ doors.
“Knock Knock! Don’t be a crybaby … You’re going to Tocorón (a jail)” Maduro shouted at a rally last month.
This is not the first time Maduro has extended the official national period of Christmas celebration, which in Venezuela often comes with extra bonuses for public employees and more lavish gifts in government handouts.
Last year, Maduro ordered Christmas to start on November 1, later expressing regret that he didn’t start it earlier. In 2021, with the country reeling from the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns, Maduro decreed that Christmas would start on October 4 as a tactic to boost the economy.
The Venezuelan Episcopal Conference on Tuesday protested the unilateral acceleration of Christmas, warning that the holiday “is not to be used for political or propaganda goals.”
“Christmas commences on December 25,” it said in a statement."
8CDROPSL5Y_5RJ5CFUTJKSGBQ3,Biden and Netanyahu at odds again after US president says Israeli PM not doing enough in ceasefire-hostage release talks,"By Kevin Liptak, Nikki Carvajal and Alex Marquardt, CNN","5 minute read Updated 9:17 PM EDT, Mon September 2, 2024",20240902,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/02/politics/biden-netanyahu-ceasefire-hostage-deal/,"President Joe Biden said Monday that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is not doing enough to secure the release of hostages held by Hamas and added he is “close” to presenting a final deal to negotiators working to strike a hostage and ceasefire agreement in Gaza.
The president’s comments came as he was returning to the White House to huddle with American officials who have been working to secure a deal that would pair a release of hostages held in Gaza with a pause in the fighting. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee for president, also attended the meeting before joining Biden for a campaign event in Pittsburgh.
The hostage release efforts gained new urgency over the weekend with the discovery of the bodies of six hostages in a tunnel beneath the southern Gaza city of Rafah, including the Israeli-American citizen Hersh Goldberg-Polin.
The deaths have sparked outrage inside Israel, leading to enormous protests and a nationwide strike Monday. Demonstrators have called on Netanyahu to put aside political ambitions to strike an agreement that would allow hostages to be released.
Asked Monday whether Netanyahu was doing enough to reach an agreement, Biden said simply: “No.”
His one-word answer kept with Biden’s reluctance to criticize Netanyahu in public, but nonetheless reflected deep frustrations inside the White House at how the Israeli leader has handled the conflict and the hostage talks.
A senior Israeli source criticized Biden’s statement, saying: “It is remarkable that President Biden is trying to pressure Prime Minister Netanyahu, who agreed to both the president’s proposal on May 31 and to the American bridging proposal on August 16, and not Hamas’ leader Sinwar, who continues to oppose any deal.”
“The president’s statement is also dangerous because it comes days after Hamas executed 6 hostages, including an American citizen.”
A US official responded to that criticism by saying, “The president has been clear that Hamas is responsible for killing Hersh and the others and Hamas leaders will pay for their crimes. He is also calling for urgency from the Israeli government in securing the release of the missing remaining hostages.”
It’s the latest sign of discord between the two leaders who have a long relationship that at times is contentious and has been worn thin over the last year during Israel’s war in Gaza in response to the October 7 attacks by Hamas.
Biden later deflected questions about the Israeli response to his statement. As the president left for Pittsburgh, CNN’s Arlette Saenz asked him what more he wanted Netanyahu to do.
“We’re in the middle of negotiations,” Biden said.
Asked about Netanyahu’s comments about him, Biden responded: “We’re still in negotiations – not with him, but my colleagues from Qatar and Egypt.”
American officials said the deaths of the six hostages over the weekend would likely apply new pressure on Netanyahu to reach an agreement, though the officials also said it raised questions about how serious Hamas is toward striking a deal.
“We’re very close to that,” Biden said when asked by CNN if he was planning to present a final proposal.
Asked Monday how the new deal being finalized would be different than other failed proposals, Biden responded: “Hope springs eternal.”
As he was arriving back at the White House after the Pittsburgh rally, Biden was asked whether he had plans to speak to the prime minister.
“Eventually,” he responded.
Netanyahu was more vociferous in his complaints about how Hamas is treating the ceasefire talks. He said in a news conference Monday that Israel has already shown “seriousness in the negotiations” and now “Hamas has to make the concessions.”
“On August 19, Secretary (Antony) Blinken said, Israel accepted the US proposal. Now Hamas must do the same. On August 28 – that’s five days ago, five days ago – the deputy CIA director said that ‘Israel shows seriousness in the negotiations. Now, Hamas must show the same seriousness,’” he said. “I want to ask you, what has changed in the last five days? What has changed? One thing – these murderers executed six of our hostages. They shot them in the back of the head. That’s what’s changed.”
“Now, after this, we’re asked to show seriousness? We’re asked to make concessions? What message does this send Hamas? It says, kill more hostages. Murder more hostages. You get more concessions,” Netanyahu argued, adding that international pressure should be directed at Hamas.
“I don’t believe that either President Biden or anyone serious about achieving peace and achieving the release would seriously ask Israel, Israel, to make these concessions. We’ve already made them. Hamas has to make the concessions,” Netanyahu said.
Following the news of the killing of the six hostages in Gaza, officials involved in the mediation of the ceasefire talks have been on the phone discussing ways to push the ceasefire and hostage deal forward, a source familiar with the discussions told CNN.
But then Netanyahu gave his press conference Monday evening, arguing that Israel will never leave the Philadelphi corridor, “and this guy torpedoed everything in one speech,” the source said in an initial reaction.
Mossad director David Barnea also traveled to Doha and met with Qatari Prime Minister Mohammad Abudlrahman Al Thani on Monday.
Lead Hamas negotiator Khalil Al-Hayya told Al Jazeera on Sunday there would be no deal without the Israel Defense Forces withdrawing from the Philadelphi corridor, which runs along the Egypt-Gaza border. Between the hostages and the Israeli military presence in the corridor, the “Philadelphi was more important,” Hayya alleged.
Netanyahu’s recent insistence on staying in Philadelphi represents a change in position, sources familiar with the negotiations said. When Biden announced the framework on May 31 – which he said Israel had agreed to – it envisioned an IDF withdrawal eastward from populated areas. According to a draft published in Israeli media, there was no mention of Philadelphi.
In the weeks that followed, Israel then added remaining in Philadelphi as a condition, and the recent negotiations have discussed what the IDF presence along the border would look like.
A permanent IDF presence in the Philadelphi corridor would also contradict the US position on the future of Gaza. On Blinken’s most recent trip to Israel in August he told reporters that the US will not accept “any long-term occupation of Gaza by Israel.” Administration officials have made clear they expect a full withdrawal by Israel from Gaza as the result of any permanent ceasefire agreement.

8Q3HHBNQBC_0OFHCG4TFDJ3JZ4,Netanyahu defiant as protesters demanding a ceasefire-for-hostages deal bring Israel to a halt,"By Helen Regan, Irene Nasser, Tamar Michaelis, Dana Karni, Andrew Raine and Rob Picheta, CNN","6 minute read Updated 8:12 PM EDT, Mon September 2, 2024",20240902,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/02/middleeast/israel-general-strike-hostage-deal-intl-hnk/,"Hundreds of thousands of protesters took to Israel’s streets in fresh fury on Monday over the government’s failure to secure a ceasefire-for-hostages deal with Hamas. Demonstrations could be seen in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Caesarea and other sites across the country, fueled by the killing in Gaza of six hostages, whose bodies were retrieved by Israeli soldiers this weekend.
Several gatherings targeted the homes of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, with protesters lighting fires and chanting: “You are the leader - you are guilty!” near one of Netanyahu’s private residences in Caesarea. In Tel Aviv, protesters outside the US Embassy chanted “Shame!” late into the evening, video showed.

Netanyahu has been accused of stalling efforts for a deal by some hostage families and their supporters. More than 100 hostages, including 35 believed to be dead, are still being held in Gaza – the vast majority of them taken during Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel, when some 1,200 people were killed and more than 200 taken captive
The scenes outside the Israeli leader’s homes culminated a day of anger that brought much of the country to a halt, following a call by the country’s largest labor union, known as Histadrut, to shut down the “entire” economy. Flights in and out of Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion International Airport were also stopped for two hours.
But in a press conference Monday evening, the Israeli leader struck a note of defiance, batting away criticisms – including from US President Joe Biden – that he is not doing enough to secure a deal. He asked for “forgiveness” from the families of the six hostages for failing to bring them back alive, but insisted it should be Hamas that “has to make the concessions.”
He also vowed to retaliate and extract a “heavy price” from the militant group that controls Gaza, for the killing of the six hostages, whose autopsies showed they were shot at short range on Thursday or Friday morning.
Hamas meanwhile escalated its own threats on Monday, with a public warning that more hostages held in Gaza would return “inside coffins” if Israel attempts to free them militarily.
A statement released by the militant group said that its fighters guarding prisoners held in the Palestinian enclave had received “new instructions” on how to deal with hostages if Israeli forces get close, and released an illustrated poster apparently showing hostages threatened with a gun.
Monday saw the largest general strike to have taken place in Israel since March 2023, when there was a similar mass walkout over Netanyahu’s controversial attempts to overhaul the country’s judiciary.
According to union Histadrut, hundreds of thousands of Israelis joined the protests Monday, just a day after half a million took to the streets on Sunday for what protest organizers said was one of the biggest nationwide protests since the outbreak of Israel’s war on Hamas. Israeli police said they had seven demonstrators in Tel Aviv for “violating public order and disrupting traffic.”
Netanyahu’s defiant stance following the discovery of the six hostage bodies has thrown further doubt on the negotiations for a ceasefire-for-hostages deal.
Even before the killing of the six hostages, the talks had become bogged down, with one key disagreement centering on control of a border area known as the Philadelphi corridor.
Netanyahu says control of the 14-kilometer (8.7-mile) strip of land along Gaza’s border with Egypt is needed to prevent Hamas from resuming arms smuggling through tunnels underneath it. However, the deployment of Israeli troops along the corridor has been a major point of contention between Israel and Hamas in the ceasefire talks, with Hamas saying Israeli troops must withdraw from the border zone.
“Hamas doesn’t want us to be there and that’s why I insist on being there,” the Israeli leader said on Monday.
During a cabinet meeting over the weekend, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant had lambasted the Israeli government for what he said was prioritizing control of the corridor over a deal to free hostages, calling it a “moral disgrace.”
The relative of one of the hostages who was shot dead in southern Gaza also blamed Netanyahu and his stance on the corridor for their deaths. Gil Dickmann, the cousin of Carmel Gat, told CNN that the Israeli government “cold-bloodedly” crossed a “red line” by prioritizing the corridor over the lives of the hostages.
“We know that Hamas has agreed to a deal at some point, and Israel was the one putting on more and more terms and actually postponing the deal,” Dickmann said on Monday. “Right now, we know the decisions that our Prime Minister Netanyahu has made it impossible for Carmel and other hostages to return and put their lives in great danger, and that’s what killed them.”
But on Monday, even as he acknowledged dissent within his cabinet, Netanyahu doubled down.
“We’re not going to withdraw from the Philadelphi corridor,” Netanyahu told a press conference on Monday evening. “The axis of evil needs the Philadelphi corridor. We need to have it under our control,” he said.
Disagreements over the corridor are only one of the splits within the cabinet over the conduct of the war that have become increasingly public and rancorous in recent months, reflecting deep divisions at the top of Israel’s government.
Just on Monday, Israel’s far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said he was using his power to prevent a “reckless deal” and ensure “that there will be no negotiations at all.”
He was speaking to members of Gvura, a right-wing organization representing the families of Israeli soldiers killed in Gaza.
But American officials described new urgency in reaching a ceasefire-for-hostages deal. US national security adviser Jake Sullivan said while meeting the families of Americans held hostage that “the next few days will be critical” in the push to free those still held by Hamas.
Alongside the strikes, the funeral of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, one of the six hostages found dead, was held in Jerusalem on Monday. Speaking at the ceremony, Jon Goldberg-Polin said he hoped his son’s death would be “the fuel that will bring home the remaining 101 hostages.”
“Hersh, we failed you. We all failed you. You would not have failed you. You would have pushed harder for justice,” he said. “You would have worked to understand the other, to bridge differences.”
“The 23 years of life that we had with you were a blessing. We now will work to make your legacy a similar blessing,” Goldberg-Polin said. “You were a really great guy. I love you.”
As well as an impact on flights, some Israeli municipalities said they joined the strike, including Tel Aviv and Haifa, according to a list from the Histadrut outlining who joined the action as well as statements from some of the cities.
The list also includes government ministries that impact a wide range of public services, the document shows, including parts of the Prime Minister’s Office, the Interior Ministry, and others. CNN has reached out to the Prime Minister’s Office for comment.
Hospitals and healthcare facilities worked on a weekend schedule and on an emergency basis, according to the statement.
The country’s teachers’ union said it would not join the strike, according to a statement from the union, though support staff at schools did.
However, Israel’s biggest universities joined the strike, including the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv University.

8QVK4JTPE2_PYDJ3OHSYJBOCIH,Hostage families call for public to mobilize after Israeli military reports finding several bodies in Gaza,"By Lauren Izso, Raja Razek and Kaanita Iyer, CNN","3 minute read Updated 8:33 PM EDT, Sat August 31, 2024",20240901,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/08/31/middleeast/israel-recovers-bodies-gaza-intl-latam/,"A group representing the families of Israeli hostages held in Gaza has called for the public to mobilize after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reported finding “a number of bodies” in the war-torn territory.
The demands by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum came as thousands rallied across Israel on Saturday demanding that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sign a ceasefire-for-hostages deal.
The IDF said in a statement Saturday that it had “located a number of bodies during combat in the Gaza Strip,” but it has not confirmed whether any of the bodies are those of hostages and asked the public to “refrain from spreading rumors.”
However, many Israelis have taken the statement to mean that more Israeli hostages have been found dead and it has amplified calls for the government to secure a ceasefire-for-hostages deal.
Israel launched its war against Hamas in Gaza after the militant group’s cross-border October 7 attacks, in which more than 1,200 Israelis were killed and 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli authorities.
More than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the war began, according to the health ministry in the enclave.
“Netanyahu abandoned the hostages! This is now a fact,” a statement issued by the families’ forum read.
“Starting tomorrow the country will tremble. We call on the public to prepare. We will stop the country,” the statement continued.
The forum said it will release more details about what it is calling for on Sunday.
US President Joe Biden said Saturday evening that his staff has been in touch with Israeli officials about the unfolding situation but noted that the bodies had not yet been identified. Biden also called for an end to the war, expressing optimism that an agreement could be reached on a ceasefire-for-hostages deal and adding that parties involved in the negotiation have said they “agree on the principles.”
“It’s time this war ended,” Biden added. “I think we’re on the verge of having an agreement. It’s time to end it. It’s time to finish it.”
The US, Qatar and Egypt, who have acted as mediators, this month renewed a push to reach a hostage and ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas.

The mediators have proposed a three-phase approach: a first phase involving a six-week ceasefire; a second phase that would release all hostages and a withdrawal of all IDF presence from Gaza; and a third reconstruction phase.
However, the current proposal, if agreed upon, essentially allows Israel and Hamas to abandon discussions after the first phase, and Israel has made it clear that a break in the fighting may be just that and it is not ready to agree to a permanent ceasefire.
More than 100 hostages taken from Israel were freed under a temporary truce last year and eight have been rescued alive – including Farhan Al-Qadi, who was recovered from a Hamas tunnel this week. However, more than 100 are thought to remain in Gaza.
CNN previously reported that there are 107 total hostages, living and dead, being held in Gaza, according to Israel’s Prime Minister’s Office and the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.
Of that number, 103 hostages are from the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel.
Of those, 33 are presumed dead, according to the forum.

Mohammed Mansour, a journalist for the Palestinian news agency WAFA, was injured when the car he was driving was struck by gunfire, according to video of the aftermath and his employer.
Footage filmed in the car by freelance journalist Jarah Khalaf shows a chaotic scene, as Mansour races through the streets and blood pours from his leg. All journalists were wearing flak jackets with “press” labels, and the car bore a “press” identifier on its hood.
“The occupation surprised us by shooting at us directly. Our colleague Mohammed Mansour was here in this car,” said Khalaf. “The army shot at us more than once, even though we had press signs and were wearing body armor and everything.”

WAFA said that the Israeli military “fired live bullets directly at the vehicle,” which was carrying four journalists reporting on the Tuesday raid. The Palestine Red Crescent Society said that it treated four journalists who were injured by gunfire and shrapnel.
CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for comment.
Violence from the Israeli offensive in Gaza since the Hamas-led October 7 attacks has spilled into the occupied West Bank in recent months. The IDF unleashed a barrage of raids and airstrikes in multiple parts of the territory on August 28 – including in the cities of Jenin, Tubas and Tulkarem – bulldozing highways and razing buildings to rubble.
The IDF has said that its operations in the West Bank are necessary “in order to remove immediate terror threats in real time.”
Humanitarian groups have accused the Israeli military of using disproportionate force against Palestinian residents, inflicting severe damage on critical infrastructure and disrupting health care services. On Tuesday, a UN spokesperson warned that Israeli forces are using “lethal war-like tactics” in the occupied territory, with people being killed, injured and displaced – and have blocked critical access to aid organizations.
On Monday, two Palestinian journalists were injured by shrapnel and had to dodge Israeli bulldozers while covering the devastation left by forces in the city of Jenin, according to video obtained by CNN and interviews with the journalists. The sound of gunfire can be heard in the background.
In another video, reporters film Israeli military bulldozers tearing up the surface of a street in Jenin. The IDF says this is done to find and dismantle explosive devices.
“This was one of the craziest and most dangerous days of coverage, as we were directly targeted,” Shatha Hanaysha, a reporter for the Mondoweiss news website, said on Monday. She told CNN that she sustained minor shrapnel injuries to her leg. “We saw Israeli journalists with the military today … While they fire at us, they treat the Israeli journalists in a different way. These are double standards.”
Khalaf said he was also among the journalists filming the Israeli military bulldozers on Monday, when suddenly “a bulldozer started backing on us.”
“We moved down the road when the bulldozer turned … and chased after us,” added Khalaf. “We were trapped behind a wall, but the bulldozer kept coming forward toward us when it started destroying shops and the sidewalk we were on. We were trapped for a few minutes before we managed to get away.”
Israeli forces have killed 33 Palestinians in the West Bank, including six children and two elderly people, since launching the operation last month, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah. Another 130 people have been injured. The ministry does not differentiate between civilians and militants.
The Al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas’ armed wing, said Friday that three of its members had been killed."
8VTRWJHHXE_1ZZRP0W3S8PYEG6,Suspect arrested after attack on Jewish University of Pittsburgh students,"By Jay Croft, CNN","2 minute read Published 6:07 PM EDT, Sat August 31, 2024",20240901,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/08/31/us/pittsburgh-jewish-students-attack-arrest/,"University of Pittsburgh police arrested a person suspected of attacking a group of Jewish students with a bottle Friday night, the school announced on its website.
The incident occurred near the Cathedral of Learning on campus. Two students were treated at the scene. The suspect, who has no known affiliation with the school, was immediately arrested and was in custody, the university said.
“Upon learning about this incident, Pitt leadership contacted Hillel University Center to offer support to our students and also connected with our partners at the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh,” the university said. “We are grateful to our Pitt Police officers for their swift action, and our Student Affairs team for their ongoing student support.”
There was no ongoing threat to the public, the school said.
It said, “To be clear: Neither acts of violence nor antisemitism will be tolerated. Local and federal partners are supporting Pitt Police in this ongoing investigation.”
The fall semester began Monday.
“The safety of our Jewish students remains a priority, and we will continue to be a home away from home for them, providing them with care, support and community,” Hillel University Center said in a statement.
University police said the incident was not connected to an earlier shooting at the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, across the street from the Cathedral of Learning. Pittsburgh Public Safety shared on X a man had been shot in the leg around 5:30 p.m. and was in stable condition.
CNN has reached out to university police requesting additional information about the incident but has not received a response.
On October 27, 2018, a man burst into the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh and shot people with an AR-15-style rifle. Eleven people were killed and six others, including four responding police officers, were wounded. It was the deadliest ever attack on Jews in the United States.
A federal jury sentenced him to death last year after prosecutors said the attack was motivated by the man’s hatred toward Jews, immigrants and particularly the non-profit organization Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society."
8Y2VEBCYST_WEFKKMBCABQ8JOI,Former aide to New York governors charged with acting as an agent of the Chinese government,"By Gloria Pazmino and Mark Morales, CNN","8 minute read Updated 10:56 AM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240903,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/03/us/linda-sun-former-hochul-staff-arrest/,"A former aide to New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and former Gov. Andrew Cuomo was charged with acting as an agent for the Chinese government, US Attorney Breon Peace announced Tuesday.
Linda Sun, a former deputy chief of staff to Hochul and Cuomo aide, was charged with violating and conspiring to violate the Foreign Agents Registrations Act, visa fraud, alien smuggling and money laundering conspiracy, according to an unsealed copy of the indictment.
Her husband and co-defendant, Chris Hu, was also charged with money laundering conspiracy and conspiracy to commit bank fraud as well as misusing means of identification, prosecutors said.
Their home was raided by federal investigators in July, according to sources.
Sun acted as “an undisclosed agent of the Chinese government while her husband, Hu, facilitated the transfer of millions of dollars in kickbacks for personal gain,” prosecutors said in a news release.
While working for state government, Sun influenced the messaging of high-level state officials regarding issues of importance to China, blocked Taiwanese government representatives from access to the officials, and obtained official New York State proclamations for Chinese government representatives without authorization, prosecutors alleged in the indictment.
The couple’s arrest comes at a time when US-China relations remain fraught over a host of frictions including Beijing’s aggressions in the South China Sea and toward Taiwan, and US trade controls targeting China.
Sun and Hu were arrested at their Long Island residence Tuesday morning.
Sun and Hu both pleaded not guilty to all charges in federal court Tuesday afternoon. Sun’s bond is set at $1.5 million and her husband’s is set at $500,000. Both will have their travel limited to New York City, Long Island, Maine and New Hampshire. Their next court date was set for September 25.
During the hearing, prosecutors alleged the defendants used shell companies, iCloud accounts and WeChat messages – with everything in Mandarin – in their alleged crimes.
Defense attorney Seth DuCharme addressed reporters outside court Tuesday, saying “we have a lot of confidence in our case.”
“A lot of the allegations in this indictment are frankly perplexing, overly inflammatory,” he said. “As you heard in court today, we are looking forward to our day in court. The defendants are exercising their right to a speedy trial as soon as they can; we have a lot of confidence in Chris and in Linda.”
An attorney for Sun, Jarrod Schaeffer, told CNN the charges “are inflammatory and appear to be the product of an overly aggressive prosecution.”
“We are also troubled by aspects of the government’s investigation. As we said today in court, our client is eager … to defend against these accusations in the proper forum – a court of law,” Schaeffer said.
China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was unaware of the aide accused of working for China.
“I am not aware of the situation you mentioned,” spokesperson Mao Ning said, adding, “I will not comment on the domestic cases in the United States, but we oppose malicious associations and slander against China.”

Sun held several government titles for more than a decade. Public employment records and her LinkedIn profile show positions spanned across several agencies focused on New York’s economic development, labor and the executive chamber.
In 2009, Sun was hired as chief of staff in Rep. Grace Meng’s office when Meng was in the State Assembly. The administration of then-Gov. Andrew Cuomo then hired Sun in 2012, naming her director of Asian American affairs and Queens representative. Sun then became director of external affairs for Empire State Development, which handles economic development across the state. In 2018 the Cuomo administration re-hired her, naming her chief diversity officer; she later took a job in the state Department of Financial Services.
After Hochul ascended to the state’s top office in 2021, Sun was hired as deputy chief of staff, serving for about a year before heading for a post as deputy commissioner for strategic business at the Department of Labor, which terminated her employment in March 2023.
That 2023 firing happened after the governor’s office discovered “evidence of misconduct,” Hochul’s press secretary, Avi Small, said in a statement to CNN without elaborating about the misconduct.
“(We) immediately reported her actions to law enforcement and have assisted law enforcement throughout this process,” Small said.
Rich Azzopardi, a spokesperson for Cuomo, said in a statement that national security “must be free from foreign influence.”
“While Ms. Sun was promoted to deputy chief of staff in the subsequent administration, during our time she worked in a handful of agencies and was one of many community liaisons who had little to no interaction with the governor.”
Sun violated internal rules and state government protocols to benefit the Chinese government, according to court documents.
Among Sun’s activities, prosecutors say, she acted as an undisclosed agent of the People’s Republic of China and the Chinese Communist Party, acting at their request and engaging in political activities to further the interests of the CCP.
The indictment details an effort by Sun to secure “unauthorized invitation letters” from the office of the governor which were then used to facilitate travel by government officials with the People’s Republic of China into the United States for meetings with state officials in New York.
Sun’s unauthorized letters included false statements about immigration documents and “induced the foreign citizens into unlawfully entering the United States,” prosecutors wrote.
Prosecutors also allege she tried to “facilitate a trip” to China by a high-level, unnamed New York politician.
Sun and her husband received “substantial economic and other benefits” which included millions of dollars in transactions for PRC business activities of Hu, travel benefits, tickets to events, employment for Sun’s cousin in the PRC, a delivery of “Nanjing-style salted ducks prepared by a PRC official’s personal chef” that were then delivered to the residence of Sun’s parents, among others, according to the indictment.
They also laundered the monetary proceeds to buy real estate in New York and Hawaii and various luxury vehicles, according to the indictment.
Sun is accused of acting at the request of the Chinese government and the CCP to block representatives of the Taiwanese government from having access to state government officials because she knew CCP officials were “opposed to such diplomacy,” according to the court documents.
Prosecutors also said while the office of the governor did not have a position on recognizing Taiwan, Sun used her position to change both Cuomo’s and Hochul’s “messaging regarding issues of importance to the PRC and the CCP” and helped minimize interactions between the governor’s office and representatives from the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the US. Also known as TECO, the office serves as a de facto, yet unofficial, embassy to Taiwan. TECO maintains offices that provide consular and other services across various cities in the US, including New York.
Court documents show Sun used her position to block small shows of diplomacy. In January 2020, a TECO representative wrote a letter to Cuomo informing him of the latest presidential election results in Taiwan and requested a congratulatory message to be forwarded to Taipei. After an employee in the governor’s office flagged the request to Sun, she quickly blocked the effort, responding, “No letter; would set off political firestorm.”
By the time the pandemic arrived in New York, Sun was working behind the scenes to give Chinese officials access to New York government officials, prosecutors say. In one instance, prosecutors say Sun added a Chinese official to a “private New York State government conference call concerning the health response to the Covid-19 pandemic and the administration’s response to rising hate crimes against Asian Americans.” The call was not open to the public.
As the pandemic took hold, court documents say, Sun worked to ensure Cuomo was heaping public praise on Chinese officials for sending medical equipment to the city while simultaneously blocking Taiwan, which also sought public acknowledgment for providing 200,000 masks at the height of the pandemic that was ravaging New York.
In April 2020, a PRC official informed Sun that several Chinese foundations would donate 1,000 ventilators to the Greater New York Hospital Association, according to the indictment. In return, Sun told the official that Cuomo would call him to thank him for the donation. After waiting two hours for the call, the official complained that he had not yet heard from Cuomo. In turn, Sun apologized and indicated that Cuomo would thank him in public and on social media for facilitating the donation which was scheduled to arrive in New York the next day, according to the indictment.
Cuomo is not identified by name in the indictment, but his tenure as governor aligns with the timeline of the allegations.
An archived X post shows Cuomo posted a message of thanks from his government account the next day.
“We finally got some good news today. The Chinese government helped facilitate a donation of 1,000 ventilators that will arrive in JFK today. I thank the Chinese government, Jack Ma, Joe Tsai, the Jack Ma Foundation, the Tsai Foundation and Consul General Huang,” the post reads.
Hochul is furious, outraged and “absolutely shocked at how brazen” Sun’s behavior is alleged to have been, the governor said in an appearance Tuesday evening with WNYC radio.
“It was a betrayal of trust,” Hochul told WNYC about the allegations against Sun.
Hochul said her office fired Sun in 2023 “the second we discovered some levels of misconduct” and “alerted the authorities – and hence we ended up with what happened here today.”
When WNYC asked Hochul for details about why Sun was fired, the governor declined to give specifics, citing authorities’ investigation. The depth of the allegations against Sun were apparent to the governor and her staff only after reading details of the indictment, said Hochul, who emphasized to WNYC that Sun worked only 15 months for her administration and had initially been hired by the previous one.
New York State Senate Republican Leader Rob Ortt has called for an investigation into the alleged breach.
“The fact that a spy for a hostile nation was embedded at the highest levels of our state government under two administrations is an alarming security failure, jeopardizing both New York and the entire country,” Ortt said in a statement. “New York should be a beacon of freedom, a place where people flee from oppressive regimes, not a platform for spies to infiltrate our government and undermine our state and nation.”

8ZO6NBHMLU_2FGF4JPTDXT9LW8,This airport was once the gateway to Europe. Now no one’s heard of it,"By Will Noble, CNN","11 minute read Updated 9:50 AM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/travel/croydon-airport-london-aerodrome-gateway/,"The words “Croydon” and “destination” are not what you’d call soulmates. “I’m certain that of all the places I’ve visited,” writes Tom Chesshyre in “To Hull and Back,” a travelog that sets out to visit the lesser-appreciated parts of Britain, “I’m least likely to return to Croydon.”
The south London town is widely mocked for its none-too-idyllic high-rise skyline, a direct product of a megalomania of office-building between the late 1950s and early 1970s.
True, there’s a small hotel district in the east of the town, flagged by glowing signs for Leonardo and Hampton by Hilton. But it’s unlikely guests are planning a sightseeing tour of Croydon courtesy of one of the lime green trams snaking through the town. They invariably have an early morning flight to catch from Gatwick Airport, which lies just 16 miles southwest of Croydon. It’s far cheaper to stay here than to get an airport hotel.
Gatwick Airport, though, wasn’t always around. Just over a mile and a half southwest of Croydon’s modern hotels lies a Neoclassical hotel at the side of the busy Purley Way road.
The bar is usually propped up with sapped business people, but it was once populated with pilots with nicknames like “Dizzy” and Scruffy “the Undertaker” Robinson. They swigged beers and swapped stories about dense fog and near-misses, while their own framed caricatures hung behind the bar. This was – indeed, still is –  the Aerodrome Hotel, the first purpose-built airport hotel in the world.
And next to it stood Britain’s first international airport.
“My brother and myself went into my parents’ bedroom with its big brass bedstead and my father took us to the window and we saw this silver Zeppelin, lit up by searchlights, with the bursts of anti-aircraft shells exploding around it.”
This is the recollection of David Lean, who director of “Brief Encounter” and “Lawrence of Arabia,” but who was at the time a frightened young boy living in Croydon.
While the thought of London being bombed conjures up images of a smoke-shrouded St. Paul’s Cathedral in the Blitz, London and its surrounds were already under attack during World War I. Croydon was a target, and following a particularly devastating raid in 1915, a plot of land to the southwest of the town was requisitioned under the Defence of the Realm Act, and turned into Beddington Aerodrome.
From here, Sopwith Camels and Bristol Fighters sortied into the night sky, attempting to bring down the inflatable German “baby killers.”
Soon though, war came to an end, and it looked as though Croydon’s tenure as an airbase would too.
But then something happened. Hounslow Heath Aerodrome – which had technically operated Britain’s first international flights – was requisitioned by the War Office. Beddington joined up with the neighboring airfield at Waddon, which’d briefly been used to test new aircraft. Together they became Croydon Aerodrome.
Croydon 1.0 was hardly in the league of Singapore’s Changi International.
It was essentially a collection of cobbled-together wooden buildings and old army huts. The control tower was another hut, this one on stilts accessed by a ladder. Inside it, one visiting journalist found “magicians playing about with little levers and handles.”
The customs house was a glorified barn with signs tacked up above two doors: “British” and “Non-British.”
Imperial Airways’ first PR man, Robert Brenard, said the whole scene “reminded one forcibly of a Wild West township.”
Sheep had to be shooed off the runway. With no radar to speak of, pilots swooped low over train stations to glimpse the sign on the platform and figure out where they were.
One pilot claimed that when looking to land, he sniffed the air; if his nostrils picked up the ripe aroma of Beddington Sewage Works, he knew he was almost home. It’s unclear if he was joking.
The struggle to attract passengers was real. Flying in the early 1920s was an especially expensive affair, and many were anxious about it too – not surprising given how frequent accidents were.
As a forerunner to the deals offered by airlines today, there were special season tickets to Paris, and Easter holiday discounts. These had little effect.
The British government didn’t exactly help matters. “Civil aviation must fly by itself,” said Winston Churchill, who was secretary of state for air between 1919 and 1921. “The government cannot possibly hold it up in the air.” Churchill didn’t mention that he himself had taken flying lessons at Beddington, crashed and very nearly died.
While countries like France, the Netherlands and Germany enjoyed generous subsidies from their respective governments – and already had nascent versions of Air France, KLM and Lufthansa – the Brits were left to fend for themselves.
This could sometimes lead to some embarrassing situations. In “The Seven Skies: A Study of B.O.A.C. and Its Forerunners Since 1919,” John Pudney mentions an episode in which airline staff were ordered to pretend to be passengers during a flight to Germany. The flight would have otherwise been totally empty, save a renowned American lecturer, who the Brits didn’t want to embarrass themselves in front of.

Gradually, the tide turned and the government realized air travel wasn’t going away. In 1924, Britain’s first national airline, Imperial Airways, was formed. A race was set up between an Argosy airliner, the “City of Glasgow,” and the “Flying Scotsman” steam train, between London and Edinburgh. As it transpired, the “City of Glasgow” only pipped the train by 15 minutes, but there was now little doubt: flying would become the superior mode of transport.
Things gradually grew more sophisticated, destinations more ambitious. Harry Beck, who’d designed the iconic “circuit board” London Underground map, was commissioned to come up with a similar-style map flaunting Imperial Airways’ routes. Instead of Goodge Street, Dollis Hill, Ladbroke Grove and Camden Town, the “lines” led to Gaza, Delhi, Luxor and Cape Town.
Flights, though, were anything but direct. The “Kangaroo” route from Croydon to Charleville in Australia involved 28 stops – plus a train between Paris and Brindisi for good measure. On the plus side, passengers got to see so much more of the world when they traveled.
Slowly but steadily, passenger confidence (and numbers) grew. In 1927, 92-year-old Elizabeth Reeves, dressed, as the “Evening Standard” newspaper described her, in “Victorian period” clothes, took her first flight, becoming surely the oldest person at that time to ascend into the heavens, and come back down again. “I really don’t feel at all afraid,” Reeves smiled as she stepped onto the plane at Croydon, “but I had two small nips of whisky before I left home.”
While the birth of Imperial Airways had been a boon to British air travel, what turned it into a shining beacon was Croydon’s stunning Neoclassical airport complex, opened in January 1928.
Here was the first purpose-built air traffic control tower, departure lounge and airport shops. Walking in through the doors, passengers were greeted by an octagonal clock showing details of flights and departures.
A board on the wall detailed what the weather was doing in different corners of the globe. You could even buy French newspapers.
The Aerodrome Hotel opened next door at the same time, offering French-language menus. All of a sudden, Croydon was the height of sophistication.
Though you could fly from Croydon to almost anywhere, its flagship flight was Imperial Airways’ Silver Wing service, which departed from Croydon to Paris Le Bourget daily at 12.30 p.m., and from 1930 were flown on the majestic Handley Page HP-42s.
As these planes leveled out, white-jacketed stewards offered a choice of four Champagnes and 10 cocktails, and a six-course meal served on blue and white china, with metal cutlery, real glasses and damask tablecloths. The food had been sourced from Croydon’s Surrey Street market that morning.
Some of Croydon’s passengers still preferred to bring their own, as was the case with eccentric millionaire Nubar Gulbenkian, who had his valet prepare dishes of game consommé on board.
Croydon might not have had all the creature comforts of modern-day air travel, but the interwar years were undeniably a golden era.
It’s true that passengers had to go through the ordeal of being individually weighed.
It’s also true that the seats weren’t as comfortable as though on today’s airliners, made as they were from wicker.
The HP-42s pootled along at what we’d consider a snail’s pace (95 miles-per-hour top whack). Then again, from entering the airport, it took as little as 10 minutes to board your flight.
If the cabin got stuffy, you could open a window and feel the breeze in your hair. As planes flew low back then, you often had a scenic view out of the window.
In-flight movies didn’t come as standard of course, although Croydon did screen the first full-length in-flight movie. The year was 1925, and the film was “The Lost World,” based on Arthur Conan Doyle’s sci-fi dinosaur fiction. The pilot thoughtfully steered through dense clouds to darken the cabin.
As for the Aerodrome Hotel, it was a hit, not just with overnight guests, but with day-trippers too.
“It must be particularly emphasized,” reads the hotel’s literature from the time, “that the Aerodrome Hotel is not a mere terminus hotel, but is used frequently as a holiday resort and sightseeing base by tourists and motorists.”
Between 1932 and 1933, almost 70,000 took advantage of the hotel’s bar, restaurant and rooftop viewing platform, from which they could watch planes take off and land.
Others were happy to watch the wealthy female passengers making their way across the airport apron, while commenting on their choice of clothes.
Croydon became not just a destination, but the destination.
Celebrities – including Babe Ruth, Fred Astaire, John F. Kennedy, and Hollywood couple Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks – came.
Charlie Chaplin was familiar with Croydon too. Landing here in 1921, he was “kidnapped” by an overzealous cinema owner, who’d put on a fake mustache, pretended to be Chaplin’s chauffeur, and instead of driving him to the Savoy, had taken him to his picture house in the London district of Clapham.
In 1935, Agatha Christie published the Hercule Poirot novel “Death in the Clouds,” in which a woman is found murdered on a flight as it comes into land at Croydon.
Croydon had become part of popular culture.

Though the 1928 airport complex was a big step up from the original aerodrome, Croydon was still blighted by problems.
It was a distance from central London, and without its own railway station. Worse was the fog – thick and tenacious, thanks to Croydon’s location at the foot of the Surrey North Downs.
December 9, 1936, witnessed the biggest disaster ever to happen at Croydon, when a KLM airliner attempting to take off in the fog crash-landed into a house soon after, killing more than a dozen passengers and crew. Among them was a former prime minister of Sweden, and Juan de la Cierva, inventor of the autogyro.
Tragedies like this certainly didn’t help Croydon’s reputation, but something else would prove the coup de grâce.
Just as World War I had breathed unlikely life into Croydon Airport, World War II more or less took it away. The RAF took over, and civilian flights stopped. The airport was damaged by bombing, and lost many of its personnel in conflict too.
Though Croydon reopened after the war, in 1946, Heathrow took the reins as the country’s premier international airport. Croydon’s incredible story was coming to an end.
While the Aerodrome Hotel remains, so too does a large chunk of the Neoclassical airport, now a business center known as Airport House.
The closest you’ll get to traveling to Pakistan from here today is a chicken karahi from the Imperial Lounge restaurant, nestled in one corner of the ground floor. And yet, thanks to its remarkable preservation, you can still get a real sense of the airport in its heyday – particularly on its monthly open days.
Here, tour guides will lead you on fascinating tours taking in the departure lounge, its original mezzanine and skylight still intact; wicker chairs on which passengers were once whisked to far-flung lands; vintage booklets providing “Hints for Lady Passengers” (”Do not use much powder during the flight, as the temperature varies a good deal’).
It’s quite something to think that nearly two million passengers have bustled through this place.
Out the front of Airport House is a plinth-mounted de Havilland DH.114 Heron – frozen in mid-flight. It’s the same model of plane in which Geoffrey Last (talk about nominative determinism) flew Croydon’s final flight back in 1959. Such was the sense of loss from Croydonians, that as they watched the plane vanish into the skies, they set light to an effigy of the minister of transport and civil aviation. Up in the old control tower – also in fantastically good condition – meanwhile, you will find a framed poem by Ken Steel, “The Lost Airport.” It concludes:
Alas those happy times have passed and gone.
No more the neon beams its welcome light.
Croydon is dead, her halcyon days are done.
No more her klaxon stirs the summer night.
Croydon is dead, but though her sun has set,
In airmen’s hearts her fame is living yet.
Croydon, though, is far from dead. The airport may not be operating anymore, but just as it was back in the 1920s and ‘30s, it remains an attraction in its own right – still bringing in people from near and far, and in doing so, making Croydon the unlikeliest of destinations.
Croydon Airport Visitor Centre opens for public tours on the first Sunday of every month. Book ahead, as they often sell out.

Unite Here, the union representing hotel workers, said approximately 200 hotel workers walked off the job in Baltimore at the Hilton Inner Harbor this morning.
Hotel union workers are now on strike at hotels across 9 US cities. As many as 10,200 hotel workers at 25 hotels stretching from Boston to the West Coast to Hawaii went on strike starting early Sunday morning. But, as planned, 840 went back to work Tuesday.
“I walked out today because we just cannot keep working paycheck to paycheck, not able to pay our bills,” Jerome Roberts, a dishwasher at the Hilton Baltimore Inner Harbor said in a statement. “Going on strike is hard, but not nearly as hard as trying to get by on what we are getting paid. We told the bosses in our negotiations how much we are struggling right now but they didn’t care. We are on strike to make them pay.”
Workers say they want higher pay, better conditions and more staff to help. The union is asking for a restoration of many of the pandemic-era cuts that hotels made, including daily room cleaning. The union says the travel and hotel industries have recovered from the pandemic but worker salaries have not reflected the comeback.
The hotels are reportedly still open but guests are contending with a skeleton staff unable to provide full services.
“We’re on strike because the hotel industry has gotten off track,” Gwen Mills, International President of Unite Here, said in a statement Sunday morning. “During Covid, everyone suffered, but now the hotel industry is making record profits while workers and guests are left behind. Too many hotels still haven’t restored standard services that guests deserve. Workers aren’t making enough to support their families. Many can no longer afford to live in the cities that they welcome guests to.”
The hotel chains facing striking workers include Hilton, Hyatt and Marriott. The hotels have 23,776 rooms between them in the cities of Baltimore, Boston, San Diego, San Francisco, San Jose, Seattle, as well as Honolulu and Kauai in Hawaii, and Greenwich, Connecticut, according to the union.
The union is threatening to possibly expand the strike to as many as 65 hotels in 12 different cities, possibly adding hotels in Oakland, California, as well as Providence, Rhode Island, and New Haven, Connecticut. Spokespeople for Hilton and Hyatt told CNN on Friday they are committed to reaching deals with the union, but they also will continue to serve customers during any work stoppage.
Hyatt said in a statement it is disappointed by the union’s decision to strike. “We look forward to continuing to negotiate fair contracts and recognize the contributions of Hyatt employees,” said Michael D’Angelo, head of labor relations at Hyatt.
Last year, the 15,000 members of the same union went on strike during the Fourth of July holiday weekend at 65 hotels in Los Angeles and Orange counties in Southern California. They returned to work a few days later but staged a series of rolling strikes in the months that followed, sometimes tied to major tourist periods, such as the weekend of Taylor Swift concerts in Los Angeles.
These strikes are set to end after three days."

Then a crash sounded, a rare 3,500-year-old jar was broken on the ground, and her son stood over it, aghast.
“It was just a distraction of a second,” said Geller, a mother of three from the northern Israeli town of Nahariya. “And the next thing I know, it’s a very big boom boom behind me.”
The Bronze Age jar that her son, Ariel Geller, broke last week, has been on display at the Hecht Museum in Haifa for 35 years. It was one of the only containers of its size and from that period still complete when it was discovered. It was likely used to hold wine or oil, and dates back to between 2200 and 1500 B.C.
What could be considered every parent’s worst nightmare became a learning experience Friday, as the Geller family returned to the museum, which is associated with Haifa University in northern Israel. Ariel gifted the museum a clay vase of his own and was met with forgiving staff and curators.
Alex Geller said Ariel — the youngest of his three children — is exceptionally curious, and that the moment he heard the crash last Friday, “please let that not be my child” was the first thought that raced through his head.
“I’m embarrassed,” said Anna Geller, who said she tried desperately to calm her son down after the vase shattered. “He told me he just wanted to see what was inside.”
The jar was one of many artifacts exhibited out in the open, part of the Hecht Museum’s vision of letting visitors explore history without glass barriers, said Inbal Rivlin, the director of the museum.
She said she wanted to use the restoration as an educational opportunity and to make sure the Gellers — who curtailed their initial museum visit soon after Ariel broke the jar last week — felt welcome to return.

Nahariya, where the family lives, is in an area just south of Israel’s border with Lebanon that has come under Hezbollah rocket fire for more than 10 months, in a conflict linked to the war in Gaza. The family has been visiting museums and taking day trips around Israel this summer to escape the tensions, Alex Geller said.
There were a lot of kids at the museum that day, and he said when he heard the crash he prayed that the damage had been caused by someone else. When he turned around and saw it was his son, he was “in complete shock.”
He went over to the security guards to let them know what had happened in hopes that it was a model and not a real artifact. The father even offered to pay for the damage.
“But they called and said it was insured and after they checked the cameras and saw it wasn’t vandalism they invited us back for a make-up visit,” Alex Geller said.
Experts were using 3D technology and high-resolution videos to restore the jar, which could be back on display as soon as next week.
“That’s what’s actually interesting for my older kids, this process of how they’re restoring it, and all the technology they’re using there,” Alex Geller said.

Roee Shafir, a restoration expert at the museum, said the repairs would be fairly simple, as the pieces were from a single, complete jar. Archaeologists often face the more daunting task of sifting through piles of shards from multiple objects and trying to piece them together.
Shafir, who was painstakingly reassembling the jar, said the artifacts should remain accessible to the public, even if accidents happen because touching an artifact can inspire a deeper interest in history and archaeology.
“I like that people touch. Don’t break, but to touch things, it’s important,” he said."

“From my perspective, I don’t have any problem with an enforceable code,” Jackson, the newest member of the high court, told “CBS News Sunday Morning” in an interview about her new memoir.
“A binding code of ethics is pretty standard for judges. And so I guess the question is, ‘Is the Supreme Court any different?’” Jackson said. “And I guess I have not seen a persuasive reason as to why the court is different than the other courts.”
Asked whether she was considering supporting the idea, Jackson said she was “as a general matter.”

Jackson is the latest justice to indicate an openness to an enforceable code of ethics at a time when the Supreme Court is facing heavy scrutiny — and near record low approval ratings — because of private jet flights and luxury travel accepted by some members of the court. President Joe Biden called for an enforceable code of conduct in late July.
Jackson, Biden’s first and only nominee to the Supreme Court, declined to endorse any particular ethics policy.  She also declined to discuss Justice Clarence Thomas, who has been at the center of the court’s ethics controversies. Thomas initially failed to disclose trips and other gifts from GOP megadonor Harlan Crow, though the conservative justice has said he was following the court’s disclosure rules as he understood them at the time.
The high court adopted its own code of conduct last year. But the measure, while historic, was heavily criticized by ethics experts because it included no way to enforce its requirements. Justice Elena Kagan, a member of the court’s liberal wing, defended the code of conduct this summer but also conceded it would be more effective if it included an enforcement mechanism.
Jackson’s interview comes as she is promoting a new memoir, “Lovely One,” to be published Tuesday. She will also be speaking at events in New York, Washington and Atlanta this week.
Critics of a binding code of ethics have pointed to concerns about how to enforce rules against members of a tribunal who are supposed to be the final word on the law. Some proposals, including one advanced by Senate Democrats, would create a panel of lower court judges to review ethics matters.
“It really boils down to impartiality,” Jackson told CBS. “That’s what the rules are about. People are entitled to know if you’re accepting gifts as a judge, so that they can evaluate whether or not your opinions are impartial.”"
9LRWI8X7E9_9ODYBCGV3OTHLFA,Want job security in this uncertain market? A surprising trend is paying off,"By Elisabeth Buchwald, CNN","4 minute read Published 9:11 AM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240903,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/03/economy/college-jobs-blue-collar-workers/,"Going to college in the United States has long been considered the ticket to a higher-paying job. But the growing share of high school graduates who are enrolling in vocational schools instead of four-year programs may not be missing out on as much earnings potential as you might think.
From 2019 to 2024, hiring rates fell for workers in their 20s for roles that tend to require a bachelor’s degree, while hiring rates rose for roles requiring a vocational or associate’s degree, according to data from national payroll processing company ADP. And during that five-year span, enrollment in bachelor’s degree programs fell by 4%, while enrollment in vocational schools grew by 5%, according to data from the National Student Clearinghouse.
“The promise of quicker entry into the workforce, lower educational costs and the ability to earn higher wages earlier in their careers are compelling reasons for this trend,” said Bart Taylor, a professor at Texas A&M University, who teaches curriculum development for career and technical education programs.

That means that while the overall labor market shows signs of cooling, hiring for workers without a college education can still be a source of strength for the economy.
Earnings growth rates for workers with vocational or associate’s degrees are on par with those of bachelor’s degree recipients, according to the Atlanta Federal Reserve’s Wage Growth Tracker.
That said, bachelor’s degree recipients earned a median weekly salary of $1,493 last year compared to the $1,058 associate’s degree recipients earned, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The data for associate’s degree recipients includes people who graduated from academic and vocational programs.
But some industries that skew toward workers without a degree even notch higher wage growth than industries that favor degree holders. For example, pay for construction workers rose by 4.3% on average over the 12 months ended in July; in the professional services industry, wages climbed by 3.9%, according to the BLS.
Part of the shift toward trade and vocational school enrollment stems from a reevaluation of blue-collar work that happened during the pandemic, said Taylor, who is also the vice president of the trade and industrial education division at the Association for Career and Technical Education. “This has driven employers to offer more competitive wages and benefits to attract and retain workers.”
The practical, hands-on experience required for many blue-collar jobs couldn’t be taught virtually during the pandemic, he added. For instance, “although welding concepts could be taught online, students were deprived of the crucial practice time needed with real equipment.”
Now that many of those programs are operating normally again, more Americans are building trade skills to take jobs where there’s still a shortage of skilled labor, such as electricians, carpenters and plumbers.
Another factor behind the shift toward enrollment in vocational and trade schools is the advancement of artificial intelligence, said Ben Hanowell, director of people analytics research at ADP’s Research Institute.
Across all major working-age groups, Americans between the ages of 18 and 24 are the most concerned about AI replacing some or most of their existing jobs, according to a recent survey conducted by ADP.
This could help explain why the share of 20- to 24-year-olds working in blue-collar roles rose faster in recent years and remains higher compared to people 25 to 39, according to an August report Hanowell authored. Generally, blue-collar roles, which require more manual labor, tend to be thought of as less vulnerable to being replaced by AI, he said.
“This relative job security can contribute to the ongoing demand for these roles,” he told CNN. “Moreover, as AI and technology evolve, the demand for workers who can maintain, operate and work alongside these technologies may further enhance the value of trade skills.”
It’s unclear how the blue-collar workforce will hold up relative to the white-collar workforce should the overall labor market cool more significantly.
In any event, Taylor said he’s confident that the “appreciation for skilled trades is likely to persist.”
“However, a severe economic downturn could hamper the pace of wage growth and possibly lead to more job volatility,” he added."
9TBXVWHCRP_R14UUJKCMX7D6E0,The Iberian lynx is back from the brink. Now virtual fences could save it from becoming roadkill,"By Victoria Barauna, CNN","5 minute read Updated 6:23 AM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,http://us.cnn.com/science/spain-iberian-lynx-virtual-fence-spc-c2e/,"At the start of the 21st century, Spain’s once-abundant lynx population was on the verge of extinction, decimated by a combination of habitat loss, a decline in its main prey, hunting, and road accidents.
After decades of conservation work, the Iberian lynx has made a remarkable recovery, and a new initiative is using a high-tech system to protect the wild cat from one of its deadliest enemies: road traffic.
“In 2001, there were less than 50 mature individuals in the wild, distributed over two populations,” explains Dr Urs Breitenmoser, a carnivore ecologist and former senior scientist at the University of Bern, who co-chairs the Cat Specialist Group at the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).
By 2022, that number soared to 648, according to IUCN and it estimates the population of young and mature lynx to now be more than 2,000.
The turnaround is the result of a €100M ($112 million) conservation project — funded by the EU and the Spanish government — that has involved conservationist groups, as well as national and regional authorities across southern Spain.
Conservation strategies such as restocking populations of its main prey, rabbits, and restoring habitats, for example by converting pine plantations back to their original scrubland, have paid off and in June this year, the IUCN upgraded the status of the Iberian lynx from endangered to vulnerable. “For a relatively large carnivore, it is an incredible speed of recovery,” says Breitenmoser.
Yet, the IUCN acknowledges that the Iberian lynx remains threatened. It’s highly dependent on wild rabbits for food, which are particularly vulnerable to viruses. Poaching continues to be a threat, as does climate change, which is affecting lynx habitats, and road safety still is an issue.
To help with dispersion, lynx have territories of up to 20 square kilometers — although it can vary greatly — which Breitenmoser describes as “clever trick of nature to avoid inbreeding.” But being able to range freely throughout often requires crossing busy roads.
In the 1980s, roadkill played a key role in lynx mortality in the Doñana area (a prominent spot for the Iberian lynx) accounting for almost 17% of deaths. To tackle this issue, in the early 2000s, conservation programs introduced safety measures, installing fencing and underpasses that provide a safe way for lynx to walk between habitats without having to cross any roads.
Between 2006 and 2011, roadkill, accounted for 6.6% of the deaths in Sierra Morena and 8.6% in Doñana.  That may not sound like much, but Breitenmoser explains that given that lynx populations were critically endangered at the time, the impact was significant.
“Twenty years ago, each roadkill was a real catastrophe. Even if you were to say that one lynx or two lynx are not important, in this situation, each individual was important,” Breitenmoser says.
Even as the species recovers, preventing roadkill is a priority and a project run by the regional government of Andalusia is using “virtual fences” to protect lynx from traffic. Sensors are placed 50 meters apart at the side of key roads, detecting when an animal is in the vicinity and warning them away when cars approach, explains Francisco Javier Salcedo Ortiz, coordinator of the LIFE Lynx-Connect project. “The sensors also activate once they detect the cars’ headlights, warning the animals with sound and light signals to not to cross,” he says.
In Jaén, Andalusia, 4.5 kilometers of virtual fences were installed along a main road in 2022 and in Granada, both physical and virtual fences are being installed on a 20-kilometer stretch.
The project is also having an impact on drivers, who often slow down when the sound and light alarms are triggered. “We have definitely noticed that there has been a reduction in the speed of drivers when the device is activated,” says Marcos López-Parra, who works as a lynx recovery plan technician for the regional government in Andalusia. “We are reducing the risk of collision.”
Similar technology has been used in central Italy to protect the Marsican Brown bear from road traffic, with the addition of infrared sensors and thermic cameras to detect animals’ presence beside roads, before sending an audible alert to drivers to slow down. The organization behind the initiative claims that it was nearly 100% effective.
Ortiz says that in a five-year timeframe, almost €4.5 million ($5 million) will be spent on improving habitats and nearly €2.9 million ($3.2 million) on boosting connectivity, including virtual fences.
The hope is that helping lynx to safely cross roads will increase encounters between different populations, which could benefit the cats in Andalusia, nearby Extremadura and even neighboring Portugal. Breitenmoser says connectivity between neighboring populations is essential for maintaining “the genetic and demographic health of a large population.”
There are some even more inventive technologies in development. Scientists from Spain’s University of Córdoba are leveraging the chemical signals used by lynx during breeding season to create artificial scent trails that could connect different populations via underpasses.
The first year of the project focused on completing analyses at a molecular level and the researchers are now experimenting in the field. The final task will be creating a scent corridor and checking if the cats follow it. The study is planned to be completed by September 2025.
“It’s still in an initial stage, but it’s an interesting alternative as it can be cheaper than what has been typically done on highways and can help lynx cross safely underneath roads,” says Ortiz.
Conservationists say that efforts to help the lynx will benefit other wildlife in the region. “It (the lynx) plays a very important ecological role by influencing a lot of other species, not only the rabbit population that it eats from, but also meso-predators like foxes,” Breitenmoser explains. “It may provide some services to other large carnivores like the imperial eagle,” which also relies on wild rabbit populations to survive, he adds.
Innovation aside, for Ortiz the future of the Iberian lynx depends on co-operation. “The success of a project is defined by the ability to build something through the sum of many parts,” he says. “We must involve all sorts of sectors, including hunters, landowners, conservationists and more.”"
9Y2H6GB7YQ_KXWM19FVMEEUL76,New Maori Queen anointed following the death of her father,Story by Reuters,"3 minute read Published 5:49 AM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/05/world/new-maori-queen-anointed-intl-scli/,"A new Maori Queen was anointed Thursday, taking on the role at a time when New Zealand is facing some of the biggest challenges to race relations in two decades.
A statement released by representatives said Nga Wai Hono i te Po had been chosen by Maori elders to replace her father, King Tuheitia Pootatau Te Wherowhero VII, who died aged 69 last week following surgery.
“The new monarch was raised up in a ceremony known as Te Whakawahinga, in front of thousands of people gathered for the tangihanga (funeral and burial) of Kiingi Tuheitia,” a spokesperson for the Kiingitanga or royal family said.
The new queen is not crowned and instead a bible that has been used since 1858 was placed upon her head and Archbishop Don Tamihere used sacred oils to bestow prestige, sacredness, power and spiritual essence upon her.
Thousands gathered at Tuurangawaewae, the meeting place of the King movement, to farewell him in a traditional funeral.
Following the anointment of his daughter, the King’s coffin was taken to the Waikato River by hearse before being paddled in a flotilla of traditional Maori waka or canoe to Taupiri Mountain, where he was to be buried alongside other royals and high-profile Maori.
The Maori King or Queen is considered the paramount chief of several tribes, or iwi, but is not affiliated with all of them. The monarch’s role has no judicial or legal authority in New Zealand and is largely ceremonial.
The role is not necessarily hereditary but voted on by representatives from iwi across the country. The new queen, or Kuini, is the only daughter and youngest child of the former King and his wife Te Atawhai Makau Ariki and is aged 27.
Radio New Zealand says that the new monarch, who has two older brothers, was favored to ascend the throne, although it had not been a foregone conclusion.

The new queen holds a Master of Arts in Tikanga (societal lore of) Maori and has served on a number of boards include that of the Te Kohanga Reo National Trust, an organization charged with revitalizing Maori language, according to 1News.
New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said the government welcomed the new queen’s appointment as she carries forward the mantle of leadership left by her father.
Her anointment comes at a time when New Zealand is struggling with race relations.
New Zealand’s center-right coalition which took office last year has started undoing policies of previous governments, particularly those promoting the official use of the Maori language, the enhancement of Indigenous living standards and rights and efforts to repair some of the wrongs undertaken during colonization.
King Tuheitia held a gathering of tribes from across the country in January to discuss how to respond to government plans. As King Tuheitia told the thousands who attended that their voices matter, his daughter, the new queen stood beside him."

It’s the latest development in what has long been a frosty relationship between the US and Venezuela, and its seizure in the Dominican Republic marks an escalation as the US continues to investigate what it regards as corrupt practices by Venezuela’s government.
“This sends a message all the way up to the top,” one of the US officials told CNN. “Seizing the foreign head of state’s plane is unheard-of for criminal matters. We’re sending a clear message here that no one is above the law, no one is above the reach of US sanctions.”
The plane has been described by officials as Venezuela’s equivalent to Air Force One and it  has been pictured in previous state visits by Maduro around the world.
The Dominican Republic’s President Luis Abinader said the plane seized by the US on Monday was not registered under the name of the Venezuelan government, but rather under “the name of an individual.”
Foreign Minister of the Dominican Republic Roberto Álvarez said the country’s Attorney General’s Office received an order last May from a national court to “immobilize” the plane. The US had requested it be immobilized so they could search it for “evidence and objects linked to fraud activities, smuggling of goods for illicit activities and money laundering,” he said.
In a statement, US Attorney General Merrick Garland said that “the Justice Department seized an aircraft we allege was illegally purchased for $13 million through a shell company and smuggled out of the United States for use by Nicolás Maduro and his cronies.”
The plane, a Dassault Falcon 900EX, was purchased from a company in Florida, the Justice Department said, and was illegally exported in April 2023 from the United States to Venezuela through the Caribbean. It was used for Maduro’s international travels, and flew “almost exclusively to and from a military base in Venezuela,” according to the Justice Department.
Records show that the plane’s last registered flight was in March, flying from Caracas to the Dominican capital of Santo Domingo.
A second plane linked to Maduro’s regime is under 24-hour surveillance by authorities in the Dominican Republic, a source with knowledge of the matter told CNN.
The source did not specify details about the plane’s model, make or whether the aircraft had been requested to be immobilized.
The Venezuelan government described the Falcon’s seizure as “piracy” in a statement on Monday, and accused Washington of escalating “aggression” toward Maduro’s government following a contested presidential election this July.
“Once again, the authorities of the USA, in a recurring criminal practice that could not be labeled anything but piracy, have illegally seized an aircraft that has been used by the president of the Republic, justifying its action in coercive measures that, illegally and unilaterally, they impose around the world,” it said.
“The United States has already demonstrated that it uses its economic and military power to intimidate and pressure states such as the Dominican Republic to serve as accomplices in its criminal acts. This is an example of the supposed ‘rules-based order’, which, disregarding international law, seeks to establish the law of the strongest,” it said.
For years, US officials have sought to disrupt the flow of billions of dollars to the regime. Homeland Security Investigations — the second largest investigative agency in the federal government — has seized dozens of luxury vehicles, among other assets, heading to Venezuela.
“The plane was seized in violation of US sanctions with Venezuela and other criminal matters that we’re still looking at regarding this aircraft,” Anthony Salisbury,Special Agent in Charge, Homeland Security Investigations told CNN.
A high-ranking official from the Dominican Republic told CNN that Maduro’s aircraft had been in Dominican territory undergoing maintenance at the time it was seized by US authorities. The source added that the government had no record that Maduro’s private plane was in the country until it was seized.
US officials worked closely with the Dominican Republic, which notified Venezuela of the seizure, according to one of the US officials.

Multiple federal agencies were involved in the seizure, including Homeland Security Investigations; Commerce agents, the Bureau of Industry and Security; and the Justice Department.
The Dominican Republic’s Foreign Minister said the government did not participate in the US’ investigation and only “international legal cooperation” was required under the two countries’ bilateral agreements.
One of the next steps, upon arriving to the US, will be pursuing forfeiture, meaning the Venezuelan government has a chance to petition for it, and collecting evidence from the aircraft.
The US recently placed pressure on the Venezuelan government to “immediately” release specific data regarding its presidential election, citing concerns about the credibility of Maduro’s claimed victory.
Venezuela’s opposition has published more than 80% of tallies printed and collected from voting machines across the country. Though partial, the documentation appears to show that the opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia actually won the vote, several experts told CNN.
The situation in Venezuela has had implications for US politics as millions flee the country, many of whom have chosen to migrate to the US-Mexico border.
Earlier this year, the US reimposed sanctions on Venezuela’s oil and gas sector in response to the Maduro government’s failure to allow “an inclusive and competitive election” to take place.
After the controversial reelection of Maduro on July 28, Venezuela suspended commercial flights to and from the Dominican Republic.
Federal agencies, including HSI, have long been going after the Venezuelan government over corruption concerns. Over recent years, HSI has disrupted $2 billion worth of the Venezuelan government’s illicit proceeds or resources, including judgements, seizures, liquidation of bank accounts, according to one of the US officials.
In March 2020, the US Department of Justice charged Maduro, together with 14 current and former Venezuelan officials, with narco-terrorism, drug trafficking and corruption.
“For more than 20 years, Maduro and a number of high-ranking colleagues allegedly conspired with (Colombian left-wing guerrilla group) the FARC, causing tons of cocaine to enter and devastate American communities.,” then-Attorney General William Barr said at the time.
The State Department’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs has offered a reward of up to $15 million for information leading to Maduro’s arrest or conviction.
In 2017, two nephews of Maduro’s wife Cilia Flores were sentenced to 18 years in prison by a federal court in New York City for trying to smuggle up to 800 kilograms of cocaine into the United States on a private jet; the two were later released by the United States in a prisoners’ exchange in 2022.
“We see these officials and the Maduro regime basically fleecing the Venezuelan people for their own gain,” the US official said. “You have people who can’t even afford a loaf of bread there and then you have the president of Venezuela jetting around in a high-class private jet.”
Poor economic conditions, food shortages and limited access to health care have pushed more than 7.7 million people to flee Venezuela, marking the largest displacement in the Western Hemisphere.

A14VRXB6VX_3HFRDHB2QGRSUCO,These are the ‘gifts’ prosecutors say a former aide to New York’s governor received from the Chinese government,"By Emma Tucker, CNN","3 minute read Updated 5:43 AM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/03/us/new-york-linda-sun-china-gifts/,"US prosecutors say the Chinese government gave Linda Sun lavish, expensive gifts in return for violating internal rules and state government protocols while she served as an aide to two New York governors in a scheme that enriched her family by millions of dollars.
The former deputy chief of staff to New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and former aide to Gov. Andrew Cuomo acted as an undisclosed agent of the People’s Republic of China and the Chinese Communist Party, federal prosecutors say.

Sun was charged on Tuesday with violating and conspiring to violate the Foreign Agents Registrations Act, visa fraud, alien smuggling and money laundering conspiracy, according to an unsealed copy of the indictment. Her husband and co-defendant, Chris Hu, was also charged with money laundering conspiracy and conspiracy to commit bank fraud as well as misusing means of identification, prosecutors said.
The couple allegedly received “substantial economic and other benefits” from the Chinese government – including facilitating millions of dollars in business transactions – none of which were disclosed to New York state, according to the indictment. They were arrested at their Long Island residence Tuesday morning. Sun and Hu both pleaded not guilty to all charges in federal court Tuesday afternoon.
Here’s a rundown of the gifts prosecutors say the couple received from Chinese government officials and the leaders of US-based Chinese organizations:
• Sun and her family received at least four deliveries of “Nanjing-style salted ducks prepared by a PRC official’s personal chef” between 2021 and 2022. They were also invited to dinner at a PRC official’s house in 2023.
• An unnamed US permanent resident with business interests in China and who worked with “numerous US-based Chinese organizations” paid for Sun’s accommodation and travel to the PRC in 2019, along with event tickets in Beijing celebrating the 70th anniversary of the PRC’s founding.
• The millions of dollars in travel benefits Sun and her family received also included a presidential suite previously used by First Lady Michelle Obama in Beijing, where Sun stayed in 2018.
• After Sun was asked in 2017 by the president of an unnamed New York-based association of people from Henan province to speak at an event taking place in Zhengzhou, Henan, the association made travel arrangements, including hotel accommodations, for Hu, Sun and her parents, Hu’s PRC-based business partner and several representatives of carrier business whose services Sun frequently used. The Chinese government also partially funded the trip, the indictment says.
• The New York-based association also “agreed to make efforts to personally intervene as to PRC customs issues” to help her husband, a seafood exporter based in Queens, export “live lobsters” to Henan Province.
• While Sun traveled with a work colleague on official New York state business to Jiangsu Province, she received “undisclosed and unapproved” benefits from provincial officials, including a 10-year employment contract for Sun’s cousin in the PRC.
• A bank account held by Sun and Hu received a wire transfer in the amount of $47,895 from a PRC-based bank account in 2016, labeled “Payment for Traveling.”
• Tickets to various concerts and events, including the Chinese National Traditional Orchestra concert at Carnegie Hall in New York City in December 2015.

A1GJR7BZNZ_QJN0RWKAU99JACK,Michel Barnier named as new French prime minister,"By Dalal Mawad, Stephanie Halasz, Sophie Tanno and Emmanuel Miculita, CNN","4 minute read Updated 2:29 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/05/europe/france-prime-minister-michel-barnier-intl/,"Michel Barnier, the EU’s former chief Brexit negotiator, has become France’s new prime minister, the French president’s office says, ending two months of stalemate following inconclusive parliamentary elections.
In a statement on Thursday, the Élysée Palace said: “The President of the Republic has appointed Michel Barnier as Prime Minister. He has to form a united government to serve the country and the French people.”
The statement added that Barnier’s appointment comes after “an unprecedented cycle of consultations” in order to ensure a stable government.
Barnier, 73, a staunch Europhile, is a member of the Republicans party which represents the traditional right. He is best known on the international stage for his role in mediating the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union.
A 40-year veteran of French and European politics, Barnier has held various ministerial positions in France, including roles as foreign, agriculture and environment ministers. He served twice as a European commissioner as well as an adviser to President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen. In 2021, Barnier announced his bid for presidential elections but failed to garner enough support within his party.
Macron accepted the resignation of former Prime Minister Gabriel Attal and his government in July, after his centrist Ensemble alliance was defeated in the second round of France’s snap parliamentary election. The president has since faced calls from across the political divide to name a new PM. Last week, Macron told journalists during a trip to Serbia he was “making all the necessary efforts” to finalize a name.
“I will have the opportunity in a few days, in just a few weeks, to state the major legislative priorities and proposals on behalf of the new government before parliament. It will be a question of responding, as much as we can, to the challenges, to the anger, as you mentioned, to the suffering, to the feeling of abandonment, of injustice that runs through our cities, our neighborhoods and our countryside far too much,” Barnier said, speaking alongside Attal during the transfer of power at Hotel Matignon, the prime minister’s office in Paris.
Surrounded by his family, staff members and several lawmakers, Attal congratulated Barnier.
“The French know you. They know that you are a great local elected official,” said Attal, praising Barnier’s “almost unmatched experience of serving the state in various international and European functions.”
But he did not hide his frustration that his tenure came to such an abrupt end.
“Eight months is too short,” Attal said, warning that the country’s politics is suffering, “but recovery is possible.”
Barnier’s prospects for forming a stable government are unclear. Currently, France’s far-right National Rally (RN) is one of the largest parties in parliament following the election in early July. It has previously suggested it could be open to working with Barnier and would not immediately veto him.
Still, RN politician Laurent Jacobelli spoke disparagingly of Barnier, telling French television network TF1: “They are taking out of mothballs those who have governed France for 40 years.”
The leaders of France’s main far-right and far-left political parties reacted to the appointment of Barnier following Thursday’s announcement, with the far left condemning the decision.
Jordan Bardella, president of the far-right National Rally party, said on social media that his party will “judge” Barnier based on his inaugural “general policy speech, his budgetary decisions and his actions.”
Bardella’s party colleague Marine Le Pen also stressed in televised remarks that the party “will not participate in any government whatsoever” until after they have heard Barnier’s speech laying out his policy plans.
Le Pen did go on to commend Barnier on one level, describing the veteran politician as “someone who is respectful of the different political forces” and “capable” of addressing her party.
Meanwhile, Jean-Luc Melenchon of the far-left France Unbowed party delivered a stinging rebuke of President Macron, accusing him of “stealing” the parliamentary elections held in July.
“The president has just officially denied the results of the legislative elections that he himself had called for. He (Barnier) is a member, among others, of a party which was last in the legislative election. The election was therefore stolen from the French people,” Melenchon remarked in a televised speech.
The left-wing leader called on French people to protests against Barnier’s appointment from this Saturday.
Barnier served as the chief negotiator during the UK’s exit from the European Union. The lengthy talks between London and Brussels ran from 2016 to 2021 and he is known among Brexiteers in the UK for driving a hard bargain.
Born in January 1951 in a suburb of the Alpine city of Grenoble, Barnier was first elected to parliament at the age of 27."
A6VH4XF20E_I549H6FXOHSY9YK,Exclusive: John McCain’s son decries Trump appearance at Arlington as a ‘violation’ that turned cemetery into campaign backdrop,"By Natasha Bertrand, CNN","5 minute read Updated 5:05 PM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240903,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/03/politics/jimmy-mccain-decries-trump-arlington-appearance/,"When former President Donald Trump held a campaign event at Arlington National Cemetery last week, 1st Lt. Jimmy McCain says he viewed it as a “violation.”
The youngest son of the late Sen. John McCain had already been moving away from the Republican Party — just weeks ago, he changed his voter registration to Democrat and plans to vote for Kamala Harris in November, he told CNN in an exclusive interview this week.
But he is speaking out now for the first time about Trump because of the former president’s conduct at the hallowed ground where several generations of McCain’s family, including his grandfather and great grandfather, are buried.
“It just blows me away,” McCain, who has served in the military for 17 years, told CNN. “These men and women that are laying in the ground there have no choice” of whether to be a backdrop for a political campaign, he said.
“I just think that for anyone who’s done a lot of time in their uniform, they just understand that inherently — that it’s not about you there. It’s about these people who gave the ultimate sacrifice in the name of their country.”
McCain’s decision to speak out now is part of his broader shift away from the Republican Party and his family’s famously conservative roots. After years as a registered independent, he says he registered as a Democrat several weeks ago and plans to vote for Kamala Harris in November, adding that he “would get involved in any way I could” to help her campaign.
It’s a significant move for the son of a former GOP presidential candidate and Arizona senator. While other members of the McCain family have distanced themselves from Trump — including Jimmy McCain’s mother Cindy, who endorsed then-candidate Joe Biden in 2020, and his sister Meghan — none except Jimmy have publicly abandoned the Republican Party.
Despite her harsh criticisms of Trump, Meghan McCain indicated last week that she would still not endorse Harris. “I’m a lifelong, generational conservative,” she tweeted.
Jimmy McCain, who enlisted in the Marine Corps at age 17 and now serves as an intelligence officer in the 158th Infantry Regiment, had until now deliberately sought to avoid entering the political fray. Trump’s attacks on his father — that he was “not a war hero” because he was captured in Vietnam, and his reported description of the elder McCain as a “loser” — were deeply hurtful on a personal level, but not out of bounds politically, Jimmy McCain believes.
“One thing about John McCain is that he chose a public life,” McCain said. “So to attack him is really not out of the realm of his job description.”
For the younger McCain, though, the Arlington episode and how the campaign has reacted to it represents a whole new level of what he perceives as Trump’s disrespect for the fallen. And he believes it stems from Trump’s own insecurities about not having served.
“Many of these men and women, who served their country, chose to do something greater than themselves,” McCain said. “They woke up one morning, they signed on the dotted line, they put their right hand up, and they chose to serve their country. And that’s an experience that Donald Trump has not had. And I think that might be something that he thinks about a lot.”
McCain emphasized that he is speaking on his own behalf and his views do not represent those of the US Army. McCain received his commission and became an officer in US Army intelligence in 2022.
McCain’s anger over the Arlington episode was also particularly acute because when it happened, he had just returned from a seven-month deployment to a small US base on the Jordan-Syria border known as Tower 22.
He arrived there just weeks after three US service members were killed on the base in a drone attack by Iran-backed militants, and he says he thought of them when he saw Trump posing last Monday in front of gravestones.
“It was a violation,” McCain said. “That mother, that sister, those families, see that — and it’s a painful experience.”
Trump visited the cemetery last Monday following a wreath laying ceremony honoring the 13 US military service members who were killed at Kabul airport’s Abbey Gate in Afghanistan in 2021. His campaign filmed the visit, leading to an altercation with a cemetery staffer who attempted to prevent Trump’s team from photographing and filming in the area where recent US casualties are buried. According to the Army, doing so violates federal law, Army regulations and Defense Department policies.
Trump is not the first politician to violate a ban on political activity at Arlington. In fact, more than 20 years ago, John McCain said he made “a very bad mistake” when he released a campaign ad that featured a clip of him walking through the cemetery.
Trump and his campaign, however, have not issued such a mea culpa. Instead, according to the US Army, they ignored and “abruptly pushed aside” a cemetery staffer who protested the activity and published footage of the event later anyway. One of Trump’s campaign managers, Chris LaCivita, called the Army “hacks” and said it was “100% a manufactured story.”
Over the weekend, Trump’s campaign released taped statements from family members of some of the service members who were killed at Abbey Gate, who said they invited Trump to their loved ones’ graves. But the campaign’s video of the event, which they put on TikTok, showed other gravestones, too — including that of an Army Special Forces soldier who died by suicide, and whose family said they did not give the campaign permission to film it.
McCain, for his part, is now bracing to get more involved in this election cycle. While he has been involved in veteran advocacy work for years, he acknowledges that his own recent political shift has been deeply personal.
“John McCain was my father, and a lot of people lose that in the minutia,” McCain said. “He wasn’t ‘John McCain’ the way he is to the world. He was the man who loved me. And the one thing I’ve known about my dad since the moment I could think, was that he was a good man and that he had done his part. And for me to be with him towards the end of his life, hearing things [from Trump] like, he was a loser because he was captured—I don’t think I could ever overlook that.”"
A8LEH76FEN_AL45NYGHM7F8PKL,Dozens killed in Russian strike on military educational facility in central Ukraine,"By Ivana Kottasová, Svitlana Vlasova and Kosta Gak, CNN","3 minute read Updated 12:02 AM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240903,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/03/europe/ukraine-poltava-russia-attack-intl/,"A Russian strike against a military educational facility in central Ukraine killed 51 people and injured more than 200 others, according to Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office, in one of the deadliest single attacks since the start of Moscow’s full-scale invasion in February 2022.
President Volodymyr Zelensky said preliminary information indicated two ballistic missiles hit the facility in the city of Poltava and a nearby hospital on Tuesday morning.
“We say again and again to everyone in the world who has the power to stop this terror: air defense systems and missiles are needed in Ukraine, not somewhere in a warehouse,” Zelensky said in a statement.
The head of the Poltava region military administration, Filip Pronin, announced the latest death toll on Telegram, adding that that rescue crews continue to clear and search through the debris at the site. Pronin said authorities believe up to 18 more people may be under the rubble.
At least 10 residential buildings were also damaged in Poltava, he said.
Moscow has not commented on the attack, but a well-known Russian military blogger Vladimir Rogov reported earlier on Tuesday that Russia struck a military school in Poltava.
Speaking about the attack, President Zelensky repeated his call on Ukraine’s Western allies to supply Kyiv with more air defenses and lift restrictions on his country’s military using their weapons to strike inside Russia.
“Long-range strikes that can protect against Russian terror are needed now, not later. Every day of delay is, unfortunately, the death of people,” he added.
Speaking to CNN’s Christiane Amanpour in Kyiv, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the missile reached the target in a very short period of time. People were struck down as they were trying to get into the bomb shelter, officials said.
“The only way to intercept them was to have the Patriot system or a SAMP/T air defense system because they are the only one capable of intercepting ballistic missiles,” said Kuleba, who added that he originally came from the Poltava region.
Ukraine has received a handful of Patriot air defense systems from the United States and Germany, although Kyiv has consistently said the number was insufficient to allow it to effectively defend itself.
The Biden administration said in June it was prioritizing critical air defense capabilities for Ukraine over other countries to “ensure Ukraine’s survival.” But Kuleba made it clear on Tuesday that new weapons cannot come soon enough.
“I don’t know how many more tragedies like this have to occur for all promises to be fulfilled and for all new commitments to be made,” Kuleba added, reiterating Zelensky’s calls for more defense systems to be sent to Ukraine.
Local authorities said Tuesday was a “terrible day for Poltava” and declared three days of mourning. No more details would be released about the strike due to “security issues,” they said.
Ukrainian first lady, Olena Zelenska, described the attack as a “terrible tragedy for the whole of Ukraine,” as Western allies condemned the scale and force of the Russian strike.
“My deepest condolences to the families of those killed and injured in the Russian missile attack on Poltava,” Zelenska said. “Russia is taking away our most valuable asset – our lives. We will never forget this.”
British Foreign Secretary David Lammy paid tribute to those killed, in a post on X. “Russia’s strikes on Poltava are the latest sickening act of aggression in Putin’s abhorrent and illegal war in Ukraine,” he said on Tuesday. “We stand with Ukraine.”

AAKBAE6N6B_K2JUKPOEO4M4HDC,What we know about the couple killed at a nudist ranch in California,"By Nicole Chavez, CNN","4 minute read Updated 4:57 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/05/us/what-we-know-nudist-ranch-missing-couple/,"A husband and wife who settled at a nudist ranch nestled in a remote California canyon had been missing for days when a 911 call steered police to the house next door.
Their neighbor, Michael Royce Sparks, 62, has been charged with two counts of murder after police said he admitted to killing two people and human remains were found at his home. Authorities have confirmed the victims were the missing couple – Daniel Menard, 79, and his wife, Stephanie Menard, 73.
Since his arrest, Sparks has remained in custody and is expected to appear in court later this week. CNN has been unable to identify an attorney for Sparks or locate family members.
Redlands Police Chief Rachel Tolber said Tuesday she had never seen “this type of case” and it was “certainly concerning.”
As authorities search for a motive, here’s what we know about their deaths and the investigation so far:
The Menards lived in the Olive Dell Ranch resort in Southern California’s San Bernardino County, about 65 miles east of Los Angeles near the cities of Redlands and Colton. The 100-acre property has RVs and mobile homes where residents have lived for years. Others have visited for short-term stays, including during the resort’s annual 5k run.
Irene Engkraf, a neighbor of the Menards, told reporters the couple enjoyed playing poker, gathering with friends for karaoke and attending Bible study and church service on weekends.

“It felt so odd not having Stephanie sitting right next to me (at church) but I know God is with them, he’s with them wherever they are, and I can see them holding each other’s hands,” Engkraf said.
The couple was last seen at the home on August 24. The next day, Engkraf said she became worried when the Menards didn’t attend Sunday church service as usual. Their dog, a white Shih Tzu named Cuddles, was also missing.
She first saw the Menards’ car sitting “abandoned” down the road from their home, and later entered the couple’s home using a spare key but found no signs of them. Stephanie’s purse and both of the Menards’ phones were there and their bed was empty, Engkraf said.
Neighbor Tammie Wilkerson told CNN affiliate KCAL the Menards were a loving couple who took care of each other.
“Stephanie was a bit of a spit fire. She told you what she thought. She didn’t have any problem doing that and she took care of Dan so well,” Wilkerson said.
It wasn’t until several days had passed following the Menards’ disappearance that police received a tip from Sparks’ family, which prompted his arrest and a days-long search for evidence at his home.
A family member called 911 saying Sparks was involved in the Menards’ disappearance, adding he “had admitted to killing two people and was threatening suicide,” Tolber, the police chief, said Tuesday.

“I believe that there may have been other people that were texted, but the initial call that started our focus on him was from the family,” Tolber said.
Officers arrived at Sparks’ mobile home and found him hiding inside a 5-foot-deep concrete space under the home. San Bernardino County District Attorney Jason Anderson described the space as similar to a “homemade basement” underneath the home.
Before police could arrest Spar﻿ks, they had “lengthy negotiations” with him because he was armed and barricaded, Redlands Police Department spokesperson Carl Baker said Friday. Sparks attempted to shoot himself but his weapon misfired, police said.
Engkraf, the neighbor who reported the Menards as missing, described Sparks as a “loner” who “didn’t socialize so much.”
After Sparks’ arrest last week, authorities searched his home and found human remains, police said. The San Bernardino County Sheriff-Coroner Department confirmed Thursday the remains were those of the Menards.
Their cause and manner of death has not been determined, a spokesperson for the coroner’s office told CNN.
Police do not have a reason to believe there are other victims, Tolber said on Tuesday.
The search took days because of the state of the property, its potential collapse and the need to remove debris with heavy equipment, police said.
The Menards’ dog was not found during the search, police said.
Wilkerson, their neighbor, called the Menards “very sweet people” and said “there’s no way” they could have walked away from their car.
“There’s not a mean bone in their body at all, which makes this very confusing,” Wilkerson said.
While authorities have not shared details about a potential motive – other than that it did not appear to be planned – neighbors discussed with reporters an ongoing feud between Sparks and the Menards.
Wilkerson told CNN affiliate KABC she was aware there was tension.
“When I first moved here, he told me how much he hated them, and he hated Dan specifically because Dan would cut the tree … trim the tree down,” she said."
ADZK2PPUHH_4XGECWESJWEJA71,Workers in Japan can’t quit their jobs. They hire resignation experts to help,"By Samra Zulfaqar, Nodoka Katsura and Rinka Tonsho, CNN","6 minute read Published 8:30 PM EDT, Sat August 31, 2024",20240901,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/08/31/business/japan-workers-resignation-agencies-intl-hnk/,"Yuki Watanabe used to spend 12 hours every day toiling away in the office. And that’s considered a short day.
A typical 9-to-9 workday is the bare minimum. “The latest I would leave [the office] would be 11 p.m.,” said the 24-year-old, who used to work for some of Japan’s largest telecoms and e-payment companies.
So intense were the demands that Watanabe - who used an alias to speak to CNN, for fear of jeopardizing future job prospects - began to develop health problems. She had “shaky legs and stomach issues.”
She knew she had to quit, but there was one thing in the way: Japan’s notoriously top-down work culture.
Asking to leave work on time or taking some time off can be tricky enough. Even trickier is tendering a resignation, which can be seen as the ultimate form of disrespect in the world’s fourth-biggest economy, where workers traditionally stick with one employer for decades, if not for a lifetime.
In the most extreme cases, grumpy bosses rip up resignation letters and harass employees to force them to stay.
Watanabe was unhappy at her previous job, saying her former supervisor often ignored her, making her feel bad. But she didn’t dare resign.
“I didn’t want my ex-employer to deny my resignation and keep me working for longer,” she told CNN during a recent interview.
But she found a way to end the impasse. She turned to Momuri, a resignation agency that helps timid employees leave their intimidating bosses.
For the price of a fancy dinner, many Japanese workers hire these proxy firms to help them resign stress-free.
The industry existed before Covid. But its popularity grew after the pandemic, after years of working from home pushed even some of Japan’s most loyal workers to reflect upon their careers, according to human resources experts.
There is no official count on the number of resignation agencies that have sprung up across the country, but those running them can testify to the surge in demand.
Shiori Kawamata, operations manager of Momuri, said that in the past year alone they received up to 11,000 enquiries from clients.
Located in Minato, one of Tokyo’s busiest business districts, the firm launched in 2022 with a name that seeks to resonate with their helpless clientele – “Momuri” means “I can’t do this anymore” in Japanese.
At a cost of 22,000 yen (about $150) – or 12,000 yen for those who work part time – it pledges to help employees tender their resignations, negotiate with their companies and provide recommendations for lawyers if legal disputes arise.
“Some people come to us after having their resignation letter ripped three times and employers not letting them quit even when they kneel down to the ground to bow,” she said, in another illustration of the deferential workplace culture embedded in Japan.
“We sometimes get calls from people crying, asking us if they can quit their job based on XYZ. We tell them that it is okay, and that quitting their job is a labor right,” Kawamata added.
Some workers complain that bosses harass them if they try to resign, she said, including stopping by their apartments to ring their doorbell repeatedly, refusing to leave.
For another quitter, what would have been a straightforward business took a bizarre turn. The person was dragged to a temple in Kyoto by their boss. “[The worker] was told to go to Onmyoji temple because ‘they were cursed,’” she said.
Kawamata said people who reach out often work for small to medium-sized businesses, with those in the food industry most vulnerable, followed by healthcare and welfare.
Japan has long had an overwork culture. Employees across various sectors report punishing hours, high pressure from supervisors and deference to the company. These employers are widely known as “black firms.”
Human resources professor Hiroshi Ono, from Hitotsubashi University Business School in Tokyo, said the situation had become so pressing that the government had begun publishing a list of unethical employers to hamper their ability to hire, and warn job seekers of the dangers of working for them.
“There are some issues with… black firms, where working conditions are so bad, there’s no psychological safety, and some employees might feel threatened,” he said.
More than 370 companies have been blacklisted by labor bureaus across the country since the list was published in 2017.
The stress has proven fatal for decades, as exemplified by a phenomenon called “karoshi,” or “death by overwork.”

According to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, 54 people died from work-induced brain and heart conditions and were granted compensation in 2022, which is actually a major decline from the 160 recorded two decades ago.
But the number of people filing claims over mental stress at work is on the rise, shooting up to 2,683 from 341 over the same period of time.
A 31-year-old political reporter from national broadcaster NHK died in 2017 after suffering heart failure caused by spending long hours on the job. She worked 159 hours of overtime in the month before her death.
Five years later, a 26-year-old doctor from a hospital in Kobe died by suicide after working more than 200 hours of overtime in a single month.
Hisakazu Kato, an economics professor at Meiji University in Tokyo, said the country has labor laws in place to protect workers and make sure they are free to resign.
“But sometimes the atmosphere in the workplace makes it difficult to say so,” he said.
So why did these resignation agents only emerge in recent years? That, experts say, is down to young people’s changing approach to work.
“When one party is unhappy, you could end up in a divorce. But like a divorce, nobody is 100% faultless, right?” Ono, from Hitotsubashi University, said.
As the country grapples with a labor shortage fueled by a rapidly aging population and declining birth rates, young people now have more say in the market than their predecessors.
Many of them no longer subscribe to older generations’ thinking that one should do whatever they are told regardless of the job’s nature, Ono said, adding that when there is a mismatch of expectation, they won’t hesitate to quit.
But that doesn’t mean they want to march into their boss’s office and quit in a blaze of glory – preferring to let a third party handle it.
“I think that younger people these days are more non-confrontational,” the expert said, noting that many have been deprived of social interactions at work due to Covid. As a result, young workers prefer to quit without having direct contact with their bosses.
But Ono suggested that it’s always good to have a discussion and not to burn bridges with employers, so he would recommend against accessing such services.
Kawamata, from Momuri, somewhat agreed.
“We honestly think that our resignation agency service should disappear from society and we hope for that. We think it’s best if people can tell their bosses themselves, but hearing the horror stories of our clients, I don’t think that our business will disappear anytime soon,” she said.
For now, Momuri offers a 50% discount for those who seek their service to resign the second time.

ALQV4AF0TF_VE2NB967WHSL3BX,"All-black outfits, hoodies, Crocs, cell phones and mirrors. Some students are returning to school with new bans in effect","By Alisha Ebrahimji, CNN","6 minute read Published 6:03 AM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240903,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/03/us/back-to-school-bans-cell-phones-hoodies-mirrors/,"It’s a new school year – and with a new school year comes new rules.
Cell phone bans, dress code changes – in some cases banning hoodies and all-black clothing – and even the removal of mirrors from school bathrooms are among the changes schools across America are making in the name of safety and better student engagement.
Officials often cite concerns for students’ physical or mental health as reasons for the new standards. But the rules – and their enforcement – aren’t always cut-and-dried.
As 72% of US high school teachers say cell phone distraction is “a major problem in the classroom,” according to a June report by the Pew Research Center, more schools are enacting rules or tightening enforcement of old ones to keep students off their screens.
But it’s not a one-size-fits-all approach.
About a quarter of states have laws to restrict device use in schools or to recommend or incentivize limiting it, Education Week found.
Meanwhile, more and more school districts and individual campuses are carving out policies aimed at keeping kids away from cell phones, tablets and even smartwatches during the school day.
But while the move seems popular with school administrators – hundreds of principals have asked New York City Public Schools Chancellor David Banks to “take the phones,” he’s said – not everyone is sold, including parents who cite wanting to stay in touch with their children in an emergency.
As some of the nation’s largest schools districts – New York City Public Schools and Los Angeles Unified School District among them – weigh how to handle the issue, many US schools have already dug in on strict regulations and enforcement.
Some have policies banning students’ cell phones from ever entering a school, while others might require cell phones to be stored in lockers, backpacks, the front office or sealed magnetic pouches during classroom instruction. Others still allow for smartphone usage during lunch periods or recess only.
Fort Wayne Community Schools in Indiana offers an example of a more concrete and deliberate approach starting this school year. The district of over 28,000 students has implemented a phone-free policy for all secondary schools using magnetic Yondr pouches, according to the district’s website.
Students bring their pouch – a fabric bag no bigger than the average smartphone – to and from school each day, the district states. When a student enters the building, they drop their smartphone and any other personal electronic device in the Yondr pouch and lock it by pinching the top flaps together. Each student is expected to carry it with them, only opening the pouch at the end of the instructional day by placing it over a large magnet at an unlocking station – typically at the entrances and exits of the building.
The district has a broad definition of personal electronic device that includes: cell phones, smartphones, earphones, headphones, camera phones, camera devices, digital recording devices, scanning devices, personal digital assistants (PDAs), MP3 players, iPods, iPads, tablets, smartwatches, computers, radios, pagers or any device or accessory allowing a user to access the internet.
Beyond devices, some schools this academic year are turning an eye toward kids’ wardrobes in what officials say is an effort to keep them keyed in on class.
Open-toe slide sandals, hooded sweatshirts and even Crocs or foam clogs have been against the rules for years at Bessemer City High School in Alabama, school leaders tell CNN affiliate WBRC. However, if students choose to wear them this school year, it could result in in-school suspension.
Tights, hats, sunglasses, bubble slide shoes, headbands, bonnets or bandannas, mid-rif shorts and shirts, tight-fitting bodycon dresses, shirts and skirts, and jeans with holes above the knees will be prohibited, according to the school, which announced the change in July via Facebook.
“This policy is a dress code to help foster a sense of community and reduce distractions, allowing students to focus on their studies,” the school said, echoing dress code rationale at schools across the country, including a similar hoodie ban in Flint, Michigan, public schools.
Bessemer City High Principal Stoney Pritchett wants parents and students to know administrators don’t want to diminish students’ creativity, rather prepare them for real world scenarios in which some attire may not be appropriate or acceptable, he told WBRC.
CNN reached out to Bessemer City High School administrators to see out how enforcement is going since classes resumed August 8.
Meantime, in El Paso, Texas, students at one middle school are encouraged to pick from lighter parts of the color wheel as they plan their outfits for the school day. Charles Middle School Principal Nick DeSantis informed parents all-black clothing is banned this school year due to it being associated with mental health issues like depression, CNN affiliate KFOX reported in August.
The recommended changes were approved at the campus level, El Paso Independent School District spokesperson Liza M. Rodriguez told CNN on Friday, adding no policy has been finalized for the whole district.
“These changes include substituting color options for students, mandating safe footwear, and eliminating sweatshirts with hoods and pockets to reduce opportunities for hiding, using, and distributing prohibited items,” she said.
The district did “regret … the intent behind the changes,” she added. Some teachers had noted a sudden change in students going from dressing with color to all black when they were depressed or stressed, El Paso Teachers Association President Norma De La Rosa had said, though some parents pushed back against the notion clothing color reflects students’ emotions, KFOX reported.
Students aren’t permitted to wear black clothing from top to bottom but may wear black shorts for physical education classes or on “free dress day,” De La Rosa said.
The school year began on August 5.
Some shared spaces are also getting a makeover this year in at least one US school district where modern distractions seemed to have started clashing with traditional decor.
Administrators in Alabama’s Alamance-Burlington School System had noticed middle school students taking more frequent bathroom breaks and up to 15 students using the restroom at once, district spokesperson Emily-Lynn Adkins told CNN on Friday.
The bathrooms “became a meetup place, and I think that they were seeing that some of the reasons were because they were making videos and things like that, while they were in the bathroom, in front of the mirror,” she said.
So, mirrors have been removed from some girls restrooms, Adkins told CNN, adding boys restrooms have never had mirrors; girls locker rooms and some bathrooms near the cafeteria and nurse’s office still have them.
Since the mirror removal – and the implementation of a digital smart pass, a virtual hall or bathroom pass generated via a student’s school-issued Chromebook computer – there has been a significant reduction in restroom visits throughout the day, Adkins said.
The middle school principal only got one phone call from a parent after the mirrors were removed, asking for more information about the new policy, she added. Otherwise, the students and their parents have been accepting of the change."
AO5DJVZ4YL_P8HB8FUIUC78QGU,Dress Codes: How did plaid become popular for school uniforms?,"By Jacqui Palumbo, CNN","6 minute read Updated 6:01 AM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/05/style/plaid-school-uniforms-dress-codes/,"Editor’s Note: Examining clothes through the ages, Dress Codes is a new series investigating how the rules of fashion have influenced different cultural arenas — and your closet.
As students return to school, one patterned textile now synonymous with uniforms will make its seasonal reappearance on pleated skirts, jumpers and ties: plaid. The design has long been a mainstay in both classrooms and in pop culture, bringing to mind the hilarious Irish teens of “Derry Girls,” the bold ‘90s fashion of “Clueless” or the provocative outfits of the early 2000s pop duo t.A.T.u.
Plaid has become a catch-all term in the US, but includes patterns with distinct histories, including tartan, from Scotland, which is more associated with Catholic school uniforms, and madras, from India, which became a staple of American collegiate prep looks popularized by the likes of Ralph Lauren and Brooks Brothers in the latter half of the 20th century. It’s a family of textiles with broad scholarly appeal, with both religious and secular schools worldwide incorporating plaid into uniforms, from Mexico to Japan to Australia.
But how did a cloth like tartan, once the symbol of Scottish Highlander identity and rebellion, wind up on the fictional American teen Cher Horowitz as the ultimate twist on schoolgirl fashion? The reasons for the wool textile’s success as both a national identity marker and school dress code are one and the same.
“It really communicates a sense of belonging,” said Mhairi Maxwell, co-curator of the exhibition “Tartan,” which showed at the V&A museum in Dundee, Scotland, last year. “Any club, any society, any school, can design their own tartan. You’re part of this larger club, but you’re also your own little clique within it.”
Thousands of variations have been officially added to the Scottish Register of Tartans, making it a pattern that both follows strict rules and allows for “infinite possibilities” in design, Maxwell explained. There’s the highly recognizable red, blue, green, white and yellow weaves of the Royal Stewart (or Stuart) tartan — both the official tartan of the British monarchy and one of the most popular variations adopted by the punk movement — the blues and pinks of Vivienne Westwood’s MacAndreas tartan, worn by Naomi Campbell in the 1990s; and the crimson, white and black pattern made official by the University of Alabama in 2011.
Possibly the earliest existing scrap of tartan known today is a 16th-century piece found in a bog in Glen Affric, Scotland, which the V&A Dundee studied before the exhibition. The Scottish Tartans Authority commissioned dye analysis and radiocarbon testing on the textile, which has now been dated to between 1500 and 1600. It’s known that tartan existed for centuries before, though how long is often contested.
“Tartan’s origins are so elusive — it’s really hard to pinpoint (their) origin story,” Maxwell said in a phone interview, noting that many cultures around the world have grid-patterned textiles in their histories, leading to the differing claims of where and when tartan was first woven. The pattern has specific rules, however, that distinguish it from check or gingham patterns as well as madras.
Tartan’s history within Scotland has been debated as well. Centuries of romanticizing Highlander clanship and identity has likely influenced our contemporary understanding of the textile, Maxwell noted. The popular idea that tartan designs, dyes or techniques were rigid identifiers of a particular community is dubious, she pointed out — the clans weren’t siloed off, but imported and exported their materials.
However, it was the Jacobite military leader Charles Edward Stuart — known as Bonnie Prince Charlie — who made tartan a powerful symbol, leading his tartan-clad forces during an unsuccessful uprising in 1745 to restore his family’s Catholic leadership to the British throne.
“(He) made tartan the plaid of the people, and used it to create a movement to fight for his cause,” Maxwell said. “He was already capitalizing on that idea that it was a cloth of allegiance that bound people together to fight for something they believed in.”

After Stuart’s defeat, tartan was restricted in its use for decades in Scotland through Great Britain’s Dress Act, but it had a fashionable revival in the early 19th century that received royal support, particularly from Queen Victoria. The era saw an “elite appropriation” of Highland craft and lifestyle, Maxwell explained. Previously a formidable sight to encounter on the battlefield, it now represented a different kind of pride in the form of status and wealth, making it an ideal textile to use in schools promoting prestige and heritage.
“I can’t really think of another textile which has all this baggage with it,” Maxwell said. “It’s a traditional cloth, but it’s super rebellious at the same time.” It also became a fabric with imperial implications, as it made its way around the world through the uniforms of Scottish Highland regiments at war, British colonial exports and the transatlantic slave trade.
In the US, tartan was first introduced when the states were still British colonies. But the textile didn’t become a fixture of school uniforms until the 1960s, according to historian and educator Sally Dwyer-McNulty, who authored “Common Threads: A Cultural History of Clothing in American Catholicism” in 2014. That decade saw the textile “explode” in popularity, she explained in a phone interview, brought to market by major Catholic school uniform suppliers at the time, including Bendinger Brothers and Eisenberg and O’Hara (now Flynn O’Hara), who often had contracts with entire networks of diocesan schools.
“It’s like virtuous consumption, where Catholics, like lots of other post-war families, had a little bit more money to spend,” she explained in a phone interview. “The companies that had exclusive contracts wanted to tap into the resources that families had and make the (uniforms) attractive.”
Plaid already had ties to Catholicism, and it also visually stood out, she said. And, like across the pond, it allowed schools to brand themselves through their uniforms with a textile that allowed for a lot of variance without any external adornments.
“It creates this collective identity that’s important. It gives students this kind of embodied pride that they have regarding their school — or they can also express their rejection of that uniformity by letting their socks fall down to their ankles,” she joked. (Dwyer-McNulty herself attended two different Catholic schools in Philadelphia, wearing plaid uniforms through high school).
Uniforms were only associated with parochial and private schools until the late 1980s, but public schools began piloting them as well, allowing plaid’s influence in American classrooms to spread. (President Bill Clinton was a particular proponent of them during his administration the following decade, believing they would help reduce student crime). By the 1990s, the styles were no longer just available by contracted uniform companies, either, Maxwell noted, as stores like Gap and The Children’s Place stocked up on plaid skirts and jumpers.
Globally, plaid has been revived, remixed and deconstructed any number of ways today, as designers, subcultures and television and film continue to play on the trope. For Maxwell, 1995’s “Clueless” remains a favorite interpretation. It’s also one that keeps giving, as the bright yellow plaid skirt-suit set worn by Alicia Silverstone is continually replicated, last year by Kim Kardashian for Halloween, and redesigned by Christian Siriano (and worn by Silverstone) for a Superbowl ad.
“That Valley Girl appropriation of tartan is really cool,” Maxwell said. “It’s playing off that heritage of preppy Ivy League, but flipping it on its head and making quite a feminist statement about what it is to be educated, young and aspirational.”"
AXOGN82XXB_DPCLA9ZXLNKG79A,"Netanyahu derailed a potential Gaza hostage deal in July, Israeli newspaper reports","By Mick Krever, Becky Anderson, Jeremy Diamond and Dana Karni, CNN","7 minute read Updated 6:50 PM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/04/middleeast/netanyahu-derailed-hostage-deal-in-july-intl/,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in July effectively spiked a draft hostage and ceasefire deal by introducing a raft of new, 11th-hour demands, according to a report by the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth citing a document it obtained.
The report lends credence to charges often leveled at the prime minister – most notably by hostage families – of purposefully prolonging the war and torpedoing deals for his political benefit. Far-right members of Netanyahu’s coalition have pledged to bring down the government should he end the war.
Several news outlets, including CNN, have reported on the late July demands made by Netanyahu, but this is the first time the Israeli document has been obtained in full.
Among the 11th-hour demands, according to the newspaper, was that Israel retain control of the Egypt-Gaza border area – a condition Netanyahu has since portrayed as non-negotiable, including at a press conference on Wednesday.
Yedioth Ahronoth also reported that at least three of six hostages found dead in Gaza by the Israel Defense Forces over the weekend were due for release as part of the May draft agreement – Carmel Gat, Aden Yerushalmi, and Hersh Goldberg-Polin.
The Israeli Prime Minister’s Office in August confirmed to CNN the existence of the document but denied that it added “new conditions to the May 27 proposal.” The statement came in response to a report by the same Israeli correspondent who wrote the Yedioth Ahronoth report, Ronen Bergman, this time in The New York Times.

A senior Israeli official on Wednesday said the new report was “misinformed, misleading and hampers the chance of achieving the release of hostages.”
But separately, an Israeli source familiar with the talks said Netanyahu’s demands were to blame for the deaths of the hostages over the weekend.
“Two months ago, when he (Netanyahu) put the obstacles, he said no to the deal,” the source told CNN. “The hostages died because he insisted.”
The Hostages Families Forum said this weekend that “the finding of the bodies yesterday is a direct result of Netanyahu’s thwarting of the deals.”
On July 25, a senior US Administration official told CNN that negotiators were “closer than we’ve ever been” and that it was “up to the Israelis to accept it.”
Yedioth Ahronoth reported that rather than accepting that proposal, the Israeli negotiators submitted new demands, making changes to the proposals they themselves had originally made.
The new demands were nicknamed the “Netanyahu Outline,” the newspaper reported.
Hamas at the time said that Netanyahu had “returned to the strategy of procrastination, evasion, and avoiding reaching an agreement by setting new conditions and demands.”
Bergman, writing in Hebrew, wrote in Tuesday’s report that among the new demands was that Israeli forces continue to occupy the Egypt-Gaza border area, known as the Philadelphi Corridor, and maintain a 1.4-kilometer perimeter in Gaza along the Israeli border. The newspaper posted maps reportedly from the late-July Israeli response. The original May 27 proposal, according to Yedioth Ahronoth, offered an eventual full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.
The Israeli source familiar with the talks who spoke to CNN said: “The moment he (Netanyahu) insisted to stay in Rafah, to stay in the Philadelphi corridor, it was very clear that it was an obstacle.”
At Wednesday’s press conference, at which only foreign media were allowed, Netanyahu doubled down on his argument that control of the corridor is central to Israel’s war aims.
“The first war goal was to destroy Hamas’ military and governing capabilities. The second was to free our hostages, and the third was to ensure that Gaza never again poses a threat to Israel. And all three of those goals – all three of them – go through Israel’s control of the Philadelphi corridor,” Netanyahu said in English.
Israel’s prior lack of control of the corridor had allowed Iran to arm Hamas, the prime minister argued, adding, “It’s clear Gaza must be demilitarized, and it can only be demilitarized if the Philadelphi corridor remains under firm control and is not a supply line for armaments and for terror equipment.”
However, he insisted he was still willing to make a deal, saying, “The real obstacle to making a deal is not Israel, and it’s not me. It’s Hamas.”
In a Telegram post Wednesday, Hamas condemned Netanyahu’s refusal to withdraw from the corridor, saying it was an attempt to “thwart reaching an agreement.”
Frustration at what many see as Netanyahu’s failure to secure a deal has continued to mount in Israel, with demonstrations on Wednesday marking the fourth straight day of protests since the bodies of the six hostages were found.
Large crowds of protesters gathered outside the homes of members of the Knesset (Israel’s parliament) on Wednesday night to demand a deal be reached, according to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.
Videos released by the forum show demonstrations in various cities, including Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.
Protests also took place outside the Israel Defense Force’s (IDF) Kirya headquarters in Tel Aviv.
In a sign of the growing hostility toward Netanyahu, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum demanded Wednesday that he stop wearing the yellow ribbon pin, which has become a symbol of support for the hostages.
However, it was clearly visible on the Israeli prime minister’s lapel during the press conference Wednesday – a meeting where CNN’s Jeremy Diamond pressed him to answer the question of a hostage’s wife who wanted to know if her husband, Israeli-American Keith Siegel, would come back alive or dead.
“I spoke to Aviva Siegel tonight… she told me that she believes that you are sentencing her husband Keith to die by prioritizing the Philadelphi Corridor over a deal, and she has this question for you: is Keith going to come home alive or dead?” Diamond asked.
Netanyahu responded, “I’ll do everything to make sure that Keith and all the other hostages come back” – though he did not reply specifically to the alive or dead part of the question.
“I’m telling you that if we relieve the pressure, if we get out of the Philadelphi Corridor, we’re not going to get the hostages back,” the Israeli prime minister continued. “Certainly, we’re going to condemn a lot of them to stay there.”
He went on to say he could “understand the torment of families,” adding that many of the families also did not believe Israel would be able to get hostages released during November’s temporary truce or previous negotiations. “I believe that our strategy is the best way to achieve both goals – both releasing, freeing the hostages and ensuring that Gaza never poses a threat to Israel again.”
A diplomatic source familiar with the matter told CNN on Wednesday that there would be no ceasefire deal until Israel and Hamas settle the dispute around the deployment of Israeli troops along the Philadelphi corridor.
“Things are very tense. Very much up in the air,” the source said.
David Barnea, the director of Israel’s intelligence agency Mossad, met on Monday with officials from Qatar, which is mediating a deal, but there are “no meetings this week and nothing planned,” the source said.
CNN understands that during his visit to Doha, Barnea insinuated that while troop withdrawal from the Philadelphi corridor in Phase One of a deal is not up for discussion, it may be possible in Phase Two.
In its report on Tuesday, Yedioth said Israeli negotiators in July insisted as part of their new demands on specific guarantees that Palestinian civilians be allowed to return to northern Gaza would not bring weapons with them.
Netanyahu’s team, also for the first time, submitted a list of 40 hostages it wanted released as part of a first phase of a potential agreement, the paper reported. It added that the move was controversial because the Israeli negotiators were themselves determining whom they considered to be “sick,” and thus eligible for release, rather than leaving it vague.
Finally, the newspaper reported that the new Israeli demands said a specific group of long-term Palestinian prisoners to be exchanged for female Israeli soldiers be sent “abroad” after their release, rather than – as the previous agreement reportedly stated – “abroad or into Gaza.”
In its August statement to CNN, the Prime Minister’s Office said that this proposal did “not introduce new terms. To the contrary, it includes essential clarifications to help implement the May 27 proposal.”

AY8OD20KY5_FA91P2F94QVJ765,Man accused of plotting wife’s rape by at least 50 strangers over almost 10 years in French trial,"By Camille Knight, Emmanuel Miculita and Caroline Baum, CNN","4 minute read Updated 4:02 PM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/03/europe/france-man-accused-strangers-rape-wife-intl-latam/,"A man is on trial accused of repeatedly drugging and raping his wife, as well as encouraging dozens of other men to rape her in their home while she was unconscious, court documents show.
The alleged victim, Gisèle, 72, appeared in a courtroom in Avignon, France, on Monday for the opening of the trial, sunglasses on, her daughter and two sons by her side.
For the next four months, she will come face to face with her accused abusers, most of whom are complete strangers to her.
Prosecutors say the defendant, Dominique, 71, would recruit men online to rape his wife, after drugging her with sleeping pills and anti-anxiety medication. CNN is not using the full names of the man and wife to protect the identities of other family members.
He faces nine charges including several counts of rape with aggravating circumstances, the drugging of a victim to commit rape, and the sharing of images related to those assaults.
Prosecutors were able to put together a case because Dominique documented a number of the alleged assaults on camera.
Held in pre-trial detention since 2020, courtroom sketches show the defendant entered the courtroom in a black t-shirt and sat facing his wife.
“He recognizes that he’s done what he has done,” his lawyer, Béatrice Zavarro told journalists in court on Monday. “There was not an ounce of contestation during the whole investigation.”
In the dock, the men accused of taking part in these rapes sat with their heads down.
Police have identified at least 92 sexual assaults committed by 72 men, with ages ranging from 26 to 74, court documents show.
Fifty were identified, and most have been charged with either aggravated or attempted rape and are standing trial alongside Gisèle’s husband.
The ordeal lasted almost ten years, the first alleged assaults dating back to 2011.
The crimes came to light in 2020 when Dominique was caught filming under women’s skirts in a shopping center.
After police seized his phone and computer, they say they found evidence of the rapes. An investigation was opened and the wife was made aware of the abuse she had endured for almost ten years.
Court documents show that Dominique has told investigators that the other men were all aware his wife had been drugged without her knowledge, something a number of the other defendants deny.
Christophe Huguenin-Virchaux, a lawyer for one of the men told CNN affiliate BFMTV on Tuesday that his client “admits that sexual relations did in fact take place” but that they took place as part of a “sexual game between a husband and his wife that he was invited to,” adding that he was “not aware that Gisèle was drugged or under medication.”
Throughout the trial, Gisèle will see and hear what was done to her.
On Tuesday, she sat through a reading of the horrific acts she was subjected to, as well as the arguments from each of the defendants’ lawyers.
“It was very difficult,” one of her lawyers, Stéphane Babonneau told CNN on Tuesday. “It was unbearable for her to hear people say they thought she was pretending to sleep and were convinced it was consensual,” he added.
Last Friday ahead of the trial, another one of her lawyers, Antoine Arebalo-Camus told reporters “she had no idea what had been inflicted on her, so she has no memory of the rapes she suffered for 10 years.”
Gisèle could have requested the trial be held privately, but Babonneau told CNN “she wanted it to be a public trial so that everyone can hear and get an idea of the excuses given by men in such circumstances.”
Gisèle’s daughter says her mother sought medical advice for the memory loss and extreme fatigue she was experiencing as a side effect of the drugs.
Speaking to French media in several interviews, she said that her mother “saw doctors, she saw neurologists,” and that the medical profession failed to detect the problem.
The daughter has now started an awareness campaign called “M’endors Pas,” meaning “Don’t put me to sleep” on drug-facilitated sexual assault.
The trial began on September 2 in the southern French town of Avignon, and a verdict is due on December 20 this year."

Fort Wayne Community Schools in Indiana offers an example of a more concrete and deliberate approach starting this school year. The district of over 28,000 students has implemented a phone-free policy for all secondary schools using magnetic Yondr pouches, according to the district’s website.
Students bring their pouch – a fabric bag no bigger than the average smartphone – to and from school each day, the district states. When a student enters the building, they drop their smartphone and any other personal electronic device in the Yondr pouch and lock it by pinching the top flaps together. Each student is expected to carry it with them, only opening the pouch at the end of the instructional day by placing it over a large magnet at an unlocking station – typically at the entrances and exits of the building.
The district has a broad definition of personal electronic device that includes: cell phones, smartphones, earphones, headphones, camera phones, camera devices, digital recording devices, scanning devices, personal digital assistants (PDAs), MP3 players, iPods, iPads, tablets, smartwatches, computers, radios, pagers or any device or accessory allowing a user to access the internet.
Beyond devices, some schools this academic year are turning an eye toward kids’ wardrobes in what officials say is an effort to keep them keyed in on class.
Open-toe slide sandals, hooded sweatshirts and even Crocs or foam clogs have been against the rules for years at Bessemer City High School in Alabama, school leaders tell CNN affiliate WBRC. However, if students choose to wear them this school year, it could result in in-school suspension.
Tights, hats, sunglasses, bubble slide shoes, headbands, bonnets or bandannas, mid-rif shorts and shirts, tight-fitting bodycon dresses, shirts and skirts, and jeans with holes above the knees will be prohibited, according to the school, which announced the change in July via Facebook.
“This policy is a dress code to help foster a sense of community and reduce distractions, allowing students to focus on their studies,” the school said, echoing dress code rationale at schools across the country, including a similar hoodie ban in Flint, Michigan, public schools.
Bessemer City High Principal Stoney Pritchett wants parents and students to know administrators don’t want to diminish students’ creativity, rather prepare them for real world scenarios in which some attire may not be appropriate or acceptable, he told WBRC.
CNN reached out to Bessemer City High School administrators to see out how enforcement is going since classes resumed August 8.
Meantime, in El Paso, Texas, students at one middle school are encouraged to pick from lighter parts of the color wheel as they plan their outfits for the school day. Charles Middle School Principal Nick DeSantis informed parents all-black clothing is banned this school year due to it being associated with mental health issues like depression, CNN affiliate KFOX reported in August.
The recommended changes were approved at the campus level, El Paso Independent School District spokesperson Liza M. Rodriguez told CNN on Friday, adding no policy has been finalized for the whole district.
“These changes include substituting color options for students, mandating safe footwear, and eliminating sweatshirts with hoods and pockets to reduce opportunities for hiding, using, and distributing prohibited items,” she said.
The district did “regret … the intent behind the changes,” she added. Some teachers had noted a sudden change in students going from dressing with color to all black when they were depressed or stressed, El Paso Teachers Association President Norma De La Rosa had said, though some parents pushed back against the notion clothing color reflects students’ emotions, KFOX reported.
Students aren’t permitted to wear black clothing from top to bottom but may wear black shorts for physical education classes or on “free dress day,” De La Rosa said.
The school year began on August 5.
Some shared spaces are also getting a makeover this year in at least one US school district where modern distractions seemed to have started clashing with traditional decor.
Administrators in Alabama’s Alamance-Burlington School System had noticed middle school students taking more frequent bathroom breaks and up to 15 students using the restroom at once, district spokesperson Emily-Lynn Adkins told CNN on Friday.
The bathrooms “became a meetup place, and I think that they were seeing that some of the reasons were because they were making videos and things like that, while they were in the bathroom, in front of the mirror,” she said.
So, mirrors have been removed from some girls restrooms, Adkins told CNN, adding boys restrooms have never had mirrors; girls locker rooms and some bathrooms near the cafeteria and nurse’s office still have them.
Since the mirror removal – and the implementation of a digital smart pass, a virtual hall or bathroom pass generated via a student’s school-issued Chromebook computer – there has been a significant reduction in restroom visits throughout the day, Adkins said.
The middle school principal only got one phone call from a parent after the mirrors were removed, asking for more information about the new policy, she added. Otherwise, the students and their parents have been accepting of the change."
B1Q5FI2QW7_8H4E1QFYR261CB7,Biden administration announces major actions to tackle Russian efforts to influence 2024 election,"By Sean Lyngaas, Evan Perez, Kylie Atwood, Zachary Cohen and Jennifer Hansler, CNN","5 minute read Updated 8:18 PM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/04/politics/biden-administration-accuse-russia-election-influence-efforts/,"The Biden administration announced a sweeping set of actions to tackle a major Russian government-backed effort to influence the 2024 US presidential election on Wednesday, including unveiling criminal charges against two Russian nationals, sanctions on 10 individuals and entities, and the seizure of 32 internet domains.
At Russian President Vladimir Putin’s direction, three Russian companies used fake profiles to promote false narratives on social media, US Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said in a statement. Internal documents produced by one of those Russian companies show one of the goals of the propaganda effort was to boost the candidacy of Donald Trump or whoever emerged as the Republican nominee for president, according to an FBI affidavit.
Separately, two employees of RT, the Russian state media network, were indicted in a US court for allegedly being part of a scheme that funneled nearly $10 million to set up and direct a Tennessee-based front company to produce online content aimed at sowing divisions among Americans, according to the Justice Department. The scheme targeted millions of American news consumers with what Attorney General Merrick Garland described as “hidden Russian government messaging.”

Taken together, the actions represent the Biden administration’s most significant public response yet to alleged Russian influence operations targeting American voters. After the US accused Iran of trying to hack both the Trump and Biden-Harris campaigns last month, Wednesday’s actions are a reminder that US officials continue to see Russia as a prominent foreign influence threat to November’s election, sources familiar with the matter said.
One of the three Russian companies allegedly behind the internet domains seized by the Justice Department is a company called Social Design Agency (SDA), which the Treasury Department previously sanctioned for allegedly running fake news sites in Europe on behalf of the Russian government.
CNN first reported on the pending US actions earlier Wednesday. The Russian disinformation operation is being laundered through both Americans and non-American voices, four sources told CNN.
A nearly 300-page FBI affidavit released on Wednesday describes the domain seizures and lays out a broad, Kremlin-backed effort to seed fake news stories to attack US politicians supporting Ukraine in the war against Russia and stoke tensions in US society.
Internal SDA documents cited in the affidavit, which appear to date to before Trump officially clinched the Republican nomination, say one of the “goals” of the company’s disinformation efforts was to “secure victory of a U.S. Political Party A candidate (Candidate A or one of his internal party opponents” in the 2024 election.
The documents included in the affidavit do not mention Trump by name, but the US intelligence community has said that Russia’s preferences for the presidential race also haven’t shifted since 2020, when Moscow conducted a range of influence operations in support of Trump and aimed at denigrating Joe Biden.
The SDA documents also propose targeting US voters in six swing states with disinformation, hitting on themes such as the “risk of job loss for white Americans” and the purported threat of crime from “Ukrainian immigrants,” according to the FBI affidavit.
Prosecutors in the indictment of two RT employees also describe an operation intended to fuel pro-Russian narratives, in part, by pushing content and news articles favoring Trump and others who the Kremlin deemed to be friendlier to its interests.
The unnamed Tennessee-based company that the Justice Department alleges was being funded by Russian operatives working as part of the Kremlin-orchestrated influence operation is Tenet Media, which is linked to right-wing commentators with millions of subscribers on YouTube and other social media platforms, according to a US official briefed on the matter.
Formerly known as Russia Today, RT runs television and online platforms around the world that advance the Kremlin’s agenda. The Justice Department forced RT America to register as a foreign agent in 2017 after US intelligence officials concluded that the media outlet contributed to Russian efforts to meddle in the 2016 election.
Wednesday’s announcements mark the second major effort by the Biden administration to blunt RT’s influence in as many months. In July, the Justice Department accused an RT employee of being involved in a scheme that used a network of about 1,000 social media accounts to pose as US residents to spread disinformation about the Ukraine war and other topics. US officials accuse the Kremlin of financing the scheme; a Kremlin spokesperson denied the allegation.
Asked for comment, an RT spokesperson did not respond to the substance of the allegations, and instead emailed mocking comments including, “2016 called and it wants its clichés back.”
CNN was not immediately able to reach Social Design Agency for comment.
A growing number of foreign operatives have attempted to influence US elections since Russia’s 2016 activity, which included hacking the Democratic National Committee and leaking documents aimed at undercutting Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign.
In the 2024 election, Iran’s alleged embrace of a similar hack-and-leak playbook that Russia used in 2016 has US officials on heightened alert. In June, a group of Iranian government-linked hackers successfully targeted the Trump campaign, stole internal campaign documents and shared them with news organizations. The hackers breached the email account of longtime Trump ally Roger Stone to target campaign staff, CNN has reported.
US officials are also keeping a close eye on China, which US officials and private experts say uses a vast set of online accounts to also target US voters. Chinese leader Xi Jinping told US President Joe Biden that China would not interfere in the 2024 US presidential election when the two men met last November, CNN previously reported.
But any foreign or domestic attempts to sow discord during the US election and shape voters’ opinions don’t change the fact that the voting process is very difficult to tamper with and protected by layers of defenses. There is no evidence of successful efforts — foreign or domestic —to swing an American election by changing vote tallies.
An estimated 97% of registered voters in the 2024 US election will cast their ballot in a jurisdiction with a verified paper record — adding to transparency around the vote, Jen Easterly, director of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, told reporters this week.
“Election infrastructure has never been more secure,” Easterly said.

BCC4XLT5FW_W3STDERQ1QH27ZS,Iran summons Australian ambassador over post that ‘promoted homosexuality’,"By Angus Watson, CNN","2 minute read Published 12:56 AM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/04/australia/iran-summons-ambassador-over-social-post-intl-hnk/,"A series of smiling Instagram photos of diplomats wearing purple and enjoying cupcakes has caused a spat between Iran and Australia, with the Australian ambassador summoned to explain the “disrespectful” behavior.
The Australian Embassy in Tehran posted photos on Monday to mark Wear It Purple Day, an annual celebration of LGBTQIA+ youth founded in Australia.
“Today, and every day, we’re dedicated to creating a supportive environment, where everyone, especially LGBTQIA+ youth, can feel proud to be themselves,” the caption read.
The post drew swift condemnation from Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which deemed it “disrespectful and contrary to Iranian and Islamic cultural norms,” according to state news agency IRNA.
Homosexuality is illegal in Iran, which considers same-sex relations a breach of Islamic values, punishable under the country’s Sharia-based law.
“The official Instagram page of the Australian Embassy in Tehran has promoted homosexuality in a derogatory post,” IRNA reported.
Australian ambassador Ian McConville responded by saying the embassy “had no intention of offending the Iranian people,” according to IRNA.
The bi-lingual post on the official Australia In Iran Instagram account has drawn thousands of likes and comments, including from the German Embassy Tehran which responded with three purple heart emojis.
Asked about the diplomatic spat in an interview with Australia’s national broadcaster, the ABC, government minister Murray Watt said he was “concerned” about Iran’s reaction to a message he said was in keeping with his own country’s values.
“We support all Australians, regardless of their sexual orientation, their gender, their race, and I am concerned to see this reaction from the Iranian government to the activities of the Australian embassy,” Watt told the ABC.
“We’re very proud about the fact that our embassies promote Australian values internationally and I’m very concerned to see an overseas government seemingly take action against an Australian embassy that is upholding Australian values,” he said.
According to Amesty International, LGBTQIA+ people suffer “systemic discrimination and violence in Iran,” where the punishment for consensual same-sex relations ranges from flogging to the death penalty.
Iranian authorities have sentenced rights advocates to death over posts on social media.
In 2021 prominent Iranian LGBTQIA+ campaigners Zahra Sedighi-Hamadani and Elham Chobdar were arrested and later sentenced to death for alleged crimes including “corruption on earth” and “promoting homosexuality” over social media, according to the US government and Amnesty International.
Both advocates were released on bail in 2023, and Sedighi-Hamadani fled Iran for an “undisclosed country” the next year. Chobdar was re-arrested in 2024 and remains in detention, according to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom."
BDPDJHHOVQ_1V5IG0Q0XM2644D,Emhoff’s reaction to hostage murders underscores unique way he speaks for Harris,"By Edward-Isaac Dovere, CNN","4 minute read Published 8:31 AM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/05/politics/doug-emhoff-kamala-harris-israeli-hostages/,"The murders of six more Israeli hostages marked a critical new moment for Doug Emhoff, who’s speaking out on his own and Kamala Harris’ behalf, as only a Jewish American and the spouse of a presidential candidate can.
“In light of the retraumatizing of the tragedy of the weekend, speaking here, even though it’s so hard to do – this is a way that I can use this voice,” the second gentleman said Tuesday at a vigil for the hostages in Washington, DC.
For Emhoff, it’s a reflection of historical circumstances: he has spoken often about how he reconnected to his Judaism after seeing the response he received when Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris for the ticket four years ago. Then as second gentleman, he felt compelled first by the rise in antisemitism and then the October 7 Hamas terror attacks to speak up about how much hurt he felt.
Now, with his wife suddenly the Democratic nominee and both of them thrust more into the spotlight — and as the world approaches the anniversary of those attacks and Israel’s ensuing war in Gaza — friends and advisers say they’re seeing a man continuing to search for his own response to an issue that is policy, politics and personal all at once. And advisers and campaign aides are trying to match strategy with a principal whose emotions and determination have struck them in both his private comments and public remarks.
As Donald Trump attacks Jews who vote for Harris as being self-hating, it was Emhoff who sat in the front row of Tuesday night’s vigil – brought together by an array of Washington-area Jewish groups and hosted at the Adas Israel synagogue – wiping tears from his eyes, then struggling to speak through his grief as he stepped to the microphone.
“This is raw,” he said, telling the hundreds assembled he was there “as a fellow congregant, fellow mourner and as a Jew.”
“When Doug talks about how the VP encouraged him to be closer to his Jewish faith and take on antisemitism as an issue, it may be affirming to Jewish voters,” a friend of Emhoff told CNN. “But it also illuminates how they support each other as a couple, the connection to faith they both have, and that is important for all voters to know.”
As Biden has amped up public pressure on Benjamin Netanyahu to accept a ceasefire and hostage release deal, some outside allies have suggested the Israeli prime minister is instead trying to maneuver toward Trump’s benefit. And with voters on all sides of the issue uncertain of where Harris stands, every twist in events could complicate her efforts to win in Michigan, which has a sizable Arab and Jewish populations, but also some other key battlegrounds where the number of Jewish voters is larger than the 2020 margins of victories.
Several people who know Emhoff said that Hersh Goldberg-Polin’s murder hit him particularly hard. He knew the 23-year-old’s parents. He’d just seen them at the Democratic National Convention. The ache of knowing that the hostage only a few years younger than his daughter had been killed just days before his body was found has been overwhelming. It’s left him raw. Going to the vigil, one person who knows him told CNN, was about standing up as a leader — but also about feeling like he needed to be with his community amid the horror and the shock.
“How you all feel right now is how I feel. And how we all feel is something that Kamala hears directly from me almost each and every day,” Emhoff said on Tuesday night. “I share what I’m feeling with Kamala as my partner, as my wife – not just as our vice president. She knows. She gets it. She cares. She’s committed. Hersh’s loss feels so personal to the two of us, just like it feels to all of you.”
Ted Deutch, the former Florida congressman and current CEO of the non-partisan American Jewish Committee, praised the second gentleman while introducing him at the vigil for “reminding the world that an attack on any one of us is an attack on all of us.”
“He understands the unique agony of feeling that our cries for justice have gone unheard and yet he knows that our strength lies in our unity,” he added.
Emhoff has long stressed that he has no policy role in the administration or the campaign, and he continues not to. But the perspective has changed — until six weeks ago, he was married to a leader who was deferential to policy set by Biden. But after being elevated to the Democratic nominee, his wife is being watched closely for any shifts on Israel policy she might make.
Campaign aides say they expect Emhoff to continue to be key as he races around the country campaigning and fundraising, with anxiety already building over how the anniversary of October 7 will play out less than a month before Election Day.
Emhoff says he won’t stop speaking out, linking the need to remind the world repeatedly of what happened to the events of the Holocaust.
“If we don’t tell this story again and again,” he said at the vigil, “we have no hope of ‘Never Again.’”"
BDX8G3PT6L_90HMS7W07JU1A7R,"Boy who accidentally broke 3,500-year-old jar welcomed back to museum",By Associated Press,"3 minute read Published 12:18 AM EDT, Mon September 2, 2024",20240902,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/02/style/israel-haifa-museum-boy-broken-jar-returns-intl-hnk/,"As her 4-year-old son perused the Israeli museum’s ancient artifacts, Anna Geller looked away for just a moment. Then a crash sounded, a rare 3,500-year-old jar was broken on the ground, and her son stood over it, aghast.
“It was just a distraction of a second,” said Geller, a mother of three from the northern Israeli town of Nahariya. “And the next thing I know, it’s a very big boom boom behind me.”
The Bronze Age jar that her son, Ariel Geller, broke last week, has been on display at the Hecht Museum in Haifa for 35 years. It was one of the only containers of its size and from that period still complete when it was discovered. It was likely used to hold wine or oil, and dates back to between 2200 and 1500 B.C.
What could be considered every parent’s worst nightmare became a learning experience Friday, as the Geller family returned to the museum, which is associated with Haifa University in northern Israel. Ariel gifted the museum a clay vase of his own and was met with forgiving staff and curators.
Alex Geller said Ariel — the youngest of his three children — is exceptionally curious, and that the moment he heard the crash last Friday, “please let that not be my child” was the first thought that raced through his head.
“I’m embarrassed,” said Anna Geller, who said she tried desperately to calm her son down after the vase shattered. “He told me he just wanted to see what was inside.”
The jar was one of many artifacts exhibited out in the open, part of the Hecht Museum’s vision of letting visitors explore history without glass barriers, said Inbal Rivlin, the director of the museum.
She said she wanted to use the restoration as an educational opportunity and to make sure the Gellers — who curtailed their initial museum visit soon after Ariel broke the jar last week — felt welcome to return.

Nahariya, where the family lives, is in an area just south of Israel’s border with Lebanon that has come under Hezbollah rocket fire for more than 10 months, in a conflict linked to the war in Gaza. The family has been visiting museums and taking day trips around Israel this summer to escape the tensions, Alex Geller said.
There were a lot of kids at the museum that day, and he said when he heard the crash he prayed that the damage had been caused by someone else. When he turned around and saw it was his son, he was “in complete shock.”
He went over to the security guards to let them know what had happened in hopes that it was a model and not a real artifact. The father even offered to pay for the damage.
“But they called and said it was insured and after they checked the cameras and saw it wasn’t vandalism they invited us back for a make-up visit,” Alex Geller said.
Experts were using 3D technology and high-resolution videos to restore the jar, which could be back on display as soon as next week.
“That’s what’s actually interesting for my older kids, this process of how they’re restoring it, and all the technology they’re using there,” Alex Geller said.

Roee Shafir, a restoration expert at the museum, said the repairs would be fairly simple, as the pieces were from a single, complete jar. Archaeologists often face the more daunting task of sifting through piles of shards from multiple objects and trying to piece them together.
Shafir, who was painstakingly reassembling the jar, said the artifacts should remain accessible to the public, even if accidents happen because touching an artifact can inspire a deeper interest in history and archaeology.
“I like that people touch. Don’t break, but to touch things, it’s important,” he said."
BFWB7E1BNY_V56PBW2WLDRWHZE,Trump allies hope Jack Smith’s revised indictment lets them off the hook,"By Katelyn Polantz, Zachary Cohen and Devan Cole, CNN","5 minute read Published 4:00 AM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/04/politics/jack-smith-revised-indictment-trump-allies/,"While Donald Trump faces a fresh indictment over efforts to overturn the 2020 election, some of his biggest allies are hoping the revised charging document helps them evade professional consequences and criminal prosecution for their roles nearly four years ago.
Special counsel Jack Smith rewrote Trump’s federal indictment after the US Supreme Court ruled this summer that the president can’t be prosecuted for “official acts” taken while president. Smith not only narrowed the allegations against Trump but also removed references to communications between Trump and federal government officials.
Now former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark are trying to use their onetime boss’ winnowed indictment to their advantage.
Trump is the only one charged in the federal case, but several of his allies and members of his administration are facing state-level criminal charges over their meddling after the last election, including Clark and Meadows. Clark and others also are facing professional disciplinary proceedings that could disrupt their ability to practice law.
Meadows, in particular, could stand to benefit from the new Trump indictment handed up in federal court last week. Meadows was cut from much of the document, except for some interactions he had with Trump as the then-president sought to reach the secretary of state in Georgia on the phone to pressure him into aiding his election reversal gambit.
That has led Meadows’ attorneys to argue he should not be prosecuted for actions he took while serving in the White House. He’s been charged in Georgia and Arizona over his efforts to reverse the election results in the battleground states. His main defense so far has been to try to get the cases moved to federal court, which could make it easier for him to make a bid for his own immunity.
“I don’t think that’s Jack Smith’s intent,” an attorney close to the case told CNN about the new indictment bolstering Meadows’ argument. But, the attorney added, “it’s the way chips have fallen.”
Smith’s office declined to comment.
The Supreme Court’s ruling on immunity doesn’t provide protections outside of the president, but some legal experts say the fallout naturally extends beyond Trump – even if the arguments aren’t ultimately successful.
“These are not legal arguments that are, you know, outside the bounds of plausibility or just kind of good legal argumentation,” said Anthony Michael Kreis, a constitutional law professor at Georgia State University.
“But I think that they are weak,” he added.
Meadows has already seized on the changes in the new federal indictment in his Arizona criminal case.
“Mr. Meadows’ case for removal (to federal court) is supported by the superseding indictment filed this week by Special Counsel Jack Smith in United States v. Trump,” Meadows’ attorneys wrote in a court filing two days after the new indictment was unveiled.
The lawyers pointed to language Smith added to the indictment about the Georgia call in an apparent effort to distinguish it from Meadows’ role as chief of staff. The new indictment notes that Meadows “sometimes handled private and Campaign logistics for (Trump).”
Meadows’ attorneys took issue with that in the Arizona case.
“This is not an alleged criminal act by Mr. Meadows; as Chief of Staff, he was carrying out his official duties, even if the President was engaged in ‘unofficial’ activity,” they wrote in the court filing.
A federal judge in Arizona is set to consider Meadow’s arguments for moving his state criminal case to federal court during a hearing Thursday. A grand jury in Arizona handed up an indictment in April against Meadows and 17 other Trump associates over their election reversal efforts. Meadows has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
Two federal courts have already rejected Meadows’ bid to move his Georgia prosecution to federal court. His request for the Supreme Court to review the matter remains pending.
Clark could also stand to benefit from the new Trump indictment.
As an environmental lawyer at the Justice Department, Clark tried to push through a letter to officials in Georgia after the 2020 election, urging the state to interfere with the election results.
Though Clark was previously an unindicted co-conspirator of Trump’s in Smith’s case, the special counsel prosecutors have taken him out of the indictment entirely, because of the Supreme Court decision that his efforts were undertaken as an officer of the president.
Like Meadows’ legal team, Clark’s attorney has wasted no time in trying to invoke the superseding indictment to his client’s advantage. In a filing last week as part of professional disciplinary proceedings, Clarks’ attorney said it “bolsters Mr. Clark’s immunity and evidentiary arguments.”
“The issuance of a new indictment handed down by a new grand jury effectively concedes that Mr. Clark is not just unidicted (sic), but unindictable,” his attorney, Harry MacDougald, wrote.
Clark also is trying to move his Georgia criminal case to federal court. That criminal case is currently on hold while a Georgia appeals court considers an attempt by some of the defendants to disqualify the Atlanta-area prosecutor who brought the charges.
Several former Trump administration officials – including some who were compelled to speak to the grand jury more than a year ago or were described as witnesses in the previous indictment – were relieved to see the new version deleted them as well as the allegations they witnessed, sources familiar with the matter told CNN.
They hope the superseding indictment means they won’t have to testify publicly against the former president, if his case goes to trial, the sources said.
Smith waged secret court fights for months to force advisers like former White House counsel Pat Cipollone to appear before the grand jury in the Trump election subversion investigation. Cipollone, who was described in the original indictment, no longer appears in the superseding indictment.
Some legal experts say the Justice Department could be less likely to push for testimony from White House officials in future criminal investigations if prosecutors aren’t able to use their testimony at trial.
Still, some witnesses like Meadows could appear in court in Trump’s case before a trial. Courts still must determine whether some of Trump’s actions after the 2020 election were presidential – and therefore immune – or part of his campaign, and Trump’s allies could be called to testify."
BN8ESQHYSV_K1JHZ7QLTRNLZHR,US prosecutors charge Hamas leaders in October 7 attack,"By Hannah Rabinowitz, Holmes Lybrand and Evan Perez, CNN","5 minute read Updated 6:06 PM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/03/politics/justice-department-indicts-hamas-leaders/,"The US Department of Justice has charged several senior Hamas leaders over the October 7 terrorist attack, according to a criminal complaint unsealed Tuesday.
The indictment is the first criminal step by the Justice Department to hold people accountable for the attack in Israel.
The six defendants – Ismail Haniyeh, Yahya Sinwar, Mohammad Al-Masri, Marwan Issa, Khaled Meshaal and Ali Baraka – are facing seven charges, including terrorism charges, conspiracy to murder US nationals and conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction resulting in death.
The defendants are high-level Hamas officials, including Sinwar who is the terrorist organization’s leader in Gaza and one of the planners of the October 7 attack.
The complaint, which spans across several decades of alleged terrorist acts from Hamas, focuses in part on the October 7 attack against Israel.
Prosecutors detail how the brutal onslaught unfolded that day and the defendants’ involvement, one of whom is the alleged leader of Hamas’s militia group.
“On October 7, 2023, Hamas committed its most violent, large-scale terrorist attack to date,” the complaint says, detailing how “in the early morning hours … Hamas sent more than 2,000 armed fighters into farms and towns in southern Israel, where they carried out the massacres of over a thousand people and the kidnappings of more than 200 others.”
The complaint continued, saying that “during the October 7 Hamas Massacres, Hamas terrorists weaponized sexual violence against Israeli women, including rape and genital mutilation.”
“As of the date of this Complaint, at least 43 American citizens were among those murdered, and at least ten American citizens were taken hostage or remain unaccounted for,” prosecutors say.
Those senior members of Hamas charged called for mass terrorist attacks and celebrated the October 7 attack, prosecutors say.
The charges were originally filed on February 1, 2024, but kept under seal in case the Justice Department had the opportunity to arrest any of the defendants, a Justice Department official said Tuesday.
“Following Haniyah’s death and recent developments in the region, it was no longer necessary to keep those charges under seal,” the official said.
Three of the Hamas leaders charged are deceased.
Sinwar was named leader following the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July. Sinwar is widely believed to have planned or been the mastermind behind the October 7 Hamas massacre on Israel.
Sinwar was sentenced to four life sentences by Israel in 1989 for the abduction and killing of two Israeli soldiers and four Palestinians he believed were collaborators.
He served 22 years of that sentence.
In 2011, Sinwar was released with 1,026 other Palestinians prisoners in exchange for Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, who was held in Gaza by Palestinian militants from 2006-2011.
Mohammad al-Masri is better known as Mohammed Deif and is the head of the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, which is the military wing of Hamas.
Israel said al-Masri was killed in an Israeli airstrike on July 13, though Hamas has denied that that is the case.
Issa was one of Israel’s top targets and it is believed he was killed when his house in Gaza was targeted by an Israeli airstrike in July.
The announcement comes on the heels of the confirmed death of Israeli-American hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin in Gaza, which prompted President Joe Biden and other top US officials to vow that Hamas leaders would be held accountable.
“We’ll weigh other actions as appropriate,” a senior administration official said, but declined to elaborate.
Biden said over the weekend that Goldberg-Polin’s death was “as tragic as it is reprehensible.”
“Make no mistake, Hamas leaders will pay for these crimes,” Biden said.
In a recorded statement, Attorney General Merrick Garland said that the Justice Department is investigating Goldberg-Polin’s murder.
“We are investigating Hersh’s murder, and each and every one of the brutal murders of Americans, as acts of terrorism.  We will continue to support the whole of government effort to bring the Americans still being held hostage home,” Garland said.
Nearly 1,200 people were killed on October 7, including over 40 Americans. Hundreds of civilians were kidnapped.
The attorney general said that the Hamas leaders, who he said “led” the October 7 attack, are charged for “financing and directing a decades-long campaign to murder American citizens and endanger the security of the United States.”
“As outlined in our complaint, those defendants – armed with weapons, political support, and funding from the Government of Iran, and support from Hizballah – have led Hamas’s efforts to destroy the State of Israel and murder civilians in support of that aim,” Garland said.
The complaint detailed how Hamas and its leaders allegedly financed their terrorist operations through donations, “cryptocurrency, and transfers from the Government of Iran.”
“Hamas leaders, including the defendants, have played significant roles in the terrorist organization’s solicitation of funding contributions in support of Hamas’s violent objectives,” the complaint says, including using the October 7 attack on Israel to call for donations.
According to the complaint, in the wake of the attack Hamas’s armed wing, Al-Qassam, has “continued to solicit cryptocurrency and other financing after the October 7 Hamas Massacres on other social media platforms, specifically suggesting to followers methods to avoid interdiction by Israeli authorities, and has continued to receive contributions through at least one U.S.-based financial technology company.”
Iran, prosecutors say, has played “a critical and active role” in fundraising efforts for the militia, “through traditional cash exchanges, money transmitters … and cryptocurrency transactions.”
All of this, the complaint says, was to further Hamas’s shared goal with Iran “of annihilating Israel.”
In recent years, Iran also increased it’s funding to Hamas for intelligence over Israel’s missiles. This bump, prosecutors say, amounted to “roughly tens of millions of dollars a month.”

BNYY9ROUEP_3RMTRQGCRL35P78,Trial date set for doctor and ‘ketamine queen’ connected to Matthew Perry case,"By Alli Rosenbloom, CNN","4 minute read Updated 4:57 PM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/03/entertainment/matthew-perry-doctor-ketamine-queen/,"A trial date has been set for two of five people charged in connection with the death of beloved “Friends” actor Matthew Perry.
Dr. Salvador Plasencia and alleged drug dealer Jasveen Sangha, who prosecutors have also refer to as the “Ketamine Queen,” will be tried together.
The trial is scheduled to begin on March 4, 2025. A pretrial hearing is scheduled for February 19.
Plasencia and Sangha were arrested on August 15 and indicted on respective charges that include falsifying medical records and conspiracy to distribute, among others, according to the US Attorneys office.
Both Sangha and Plasencia, who prosecutors say are responsible for contributing to Perry’s death by distributing ketamine to the actor during the final weeks of his life, have pleaded not guilty to the charges.
The three other individuals charged in connection with Perry’s death – Dr. Mark Chavez, Perry’s personal assistant Kenneth Iwamasa and an acquaintance to Perry, Erik Fleming – are cooperating with prosecutors and have reached plea agreements. Fleming and Iwamasa have sentencing dates set for October and November, respectively.
Sangha remains in federal custody and Plasencia is free on bond, according to the Department of Justice.
Perry died in October 2023 at age 54 because of “acute effects” of ketamine and subsequent drowning, according to the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner’s Office autopsy report. His body was found floating face down in a hot tub at his Pacific Palisades home.
Plasencia was charged with one count of conspiracy to distribute ketamine, seven counts of distribution of ketamine and two counts of altering and falsifying documents or records related to the federal investigation, according to the US Attorney’s office.
Plasencia allegedly sold vials of ketamine that he obtained from Chavez to Perry and Iwamasa “outside the usual course of professional practice and without a legitimate medical purpose” in the weeks leading up to his death.
He is also accused of teaching Iwamasa how to inject Perry with the drug and personally injecting Perry on one occasion, despite being informed that the actor’s ketamine addiction “was spiraling out of control.”
If convicted, Plasencia faces up to 10 years in federal prison for each ketamine-related count and up to 20 years for each falsification count.
In addition to having legitimate medical uses, ketamine is increasingly popular as a party drug.
“In Hollywood, you have parties you have after parties and people like to feel altered… it’s become popular in that circle,” said Dr. David Mahjoubi, who runs one of the hundreds of ketamine clinics that have proliferated in recent years.
Clinics like Mahjoubi’s use forms of the drug in controlled doses and controlled environments as therapy for mental health conditions like depression, anxiety and PTSD. Doctors are given discretion to use medications for so-called “off-label” uses “as long as it’s within acceptable guidelines” and “not causing harm,” according to Mahjoubi.
“If somebody wanted to get high off ketamine, they’re gonna go buy it from the street,” Mahjoubi added. “It’s gonna be a lot cheaper than coming to see a physician getting an infusion.”
When the Ketamine clinic that was treating Perry declined to increase his dose, prosecutors say, he went first to Plasencia, and then due to the cost, to Sangha.
Sangha, whom authorities call the “Ketamine Queen” of North Hollywood, ran what amounted to “a drug selling emporium” in her home and had sold vials of ketamine to Fleming on Perry’s behalf, according to Fleming’s plea agreement.
Prosecutors also claim that Sangha was “aware of the danger of ketamine” and continued to sell it even after she was made aware that the ketamine she sold to aspiring personal trainer Cody McLaury in August 2019 contributed to his overdose death.
Federal agents and LAPD detectives found over 70 vials of ketamine, among other “fraudulently obtained” and illegal drugs, after executing search warrants at Sangha’s residence, according to a press release from the US attorney’s office.
She is charged with one count of conspiracy to distribute ketamine, one count of maintaining a drug-involved premises, one count of possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine, one count of possession with intent to distribute ketamine, and five counts of distribution of ketamine.
Sangha is facing a maximum sentence of life in prison."
BUVNUWPZFA_8HSPCROYQH2VD5Q,"‘Ferocious violence’ accompanied ‘shocking’ levels of abuse at Ireland’s religious-run schools, report finds","By Kara Fox, CNN","4 minute read Updated 9:09 AM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/04/europe/ireland-child-sex-abuse-schools-report-intl/,"Nearly 2,400 allegations of sexual abuse across hundreds of Ireland’s religious-run schools have been documented in a new report, marking the latest grim revelations to emerge from the country’s historic Church-State entanglement.
The report, released Tuesday, documented 2,395 allegations of historical child sexual abuse, involving 884 alleged abusers in 308 schools across the country.
Most of the allegations were reported from the records of 42 religious orders that currently run or previously ran schools in Ireland. The scope of the allegations ranges from 1927-2013. More than half the men accused – which include teachers and priests – have died, it said.
Ireland’s Minister for Education Norma Foley said Tuesday that the level of abuse detailed in the report was “truly shocking – and so is the number of alleged abusers.”
She called the report a “harrowing document, containing some of the most appalling accounts of sexual abuse.”
More than 140 survivors provided harrowing testimony for the report, describing being molested, stripped naked, raped and drugged in “an atmosphere of terror and silence.”
Their abuse was often “accompanied by ferocious violence,” the 700-page report said.
Most of the survivors interviewed for the report are men now in their 50s, 60s and 70s. Some said it was the first time they‘d spoken about the abuse and its impact on them, with many saying that their childhood “stopped the day the abuse started.”
Some survivors said the abuse was “so pervasive” that it could not have gone unnoticed by senior leadership within the religious orders that were running the schools. They added that they believed some of those leaders not only ignored the abuse but facilitated and participated in it.
Others said that they believed there had been a “cover-up” in the schools or by the religious order, and “collusion” between the State and Church.
“Many participants said that they felt that the power of the Catholic Church permeated their lives in every way and, for the majority, they felt there was no one they could tell, including their parents,” the report said.
The Catholic Church has been deeply entwined with the Irish state for much of its history. Although a referendum in the 1970s drastically reduced the Church’s political sway, it remained pervasive in many aspects of civil society. Today, nearly 90% of schools in Ireland remain Catholic, even though the percentage of the population that identifies as such is much lower.
As adults, survivors detailed a litany of difficulties stemming from the abuse, including failed relationships, mental and physical health problems and addiction issues. Some said that the abuse made them decide not to have children. Others who did said it impacted their parenting.
Many survivors said that they had moved away from family and friends to avoid memories of childhood trauma and described feeling alienated from religious services. Some avoided attending a parent’s funeral or other family event because they said they could not enter a church as a result of the abuse.
A government-mandated investigation into sexual abuse at religious-run boarding and day-schools was first launched after Ireland’s national broadcaster RTÉ aired a documentary in 2022 that highlighted systemic sexual abuse at Blackrock College, a prestigious private school in Dublin.

The report found that the abuse was spread across public and private schools, including 17 special education schools – which recorded 590 allegations involving 190 alleged abusers.
Foley said on Tuesday that the Irish government would begin a process of establishing a commission to further investigate the abuse and that a redress scheme would be established.
She said that religious orders have a “moral obligation” to contribute to any future redress scheme.
Meanwhile, those religious orders have not committed to contribute to the Mother and Baby Homes redress scheme, which opened for applications earlier this year.
The 2021 Mother and Baby Homes report found that 9,000 babies and children died in 18 of Ireland’s mother and baby homes – church-run institutions where unmarried women were sent to deliver their babies in secret, often against their will – over eight decades.
The religious congregations who ran Ireland’s Magdalene Laundries – workhouses where thousands of women and girls lived and worked without pay for years in “harsh and physically demanding” situations – have also declined to contribute to a State redress scheme set up in 2013 to compensate the survivors of those institutions."
BVVGRN60ZU_WYIOOIMLLX8DHRP,Pennsylvania and Georgia may choose America’s next president,"Analysis by Stephen Collinson, CNN","8 minute read Published 7:00 AM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/04/politics/harris-trump-battleground-states-analysis/,"The destiny of the White House may hang on a deadlocked fight between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris for Georgia and Pennsylvania, two battlegrounds that have been decisive in crowning the last two presidents.
The evolving electoral map is revealed in new CNN/SSRS polls out Wednesday of six swing states that captured the transformation in the race since the vice president replaced President Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee.
The surveys show Harris has vastly improved her party’s chances in November and could open several paths to the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win. But they suggest any stalling of her momentum could be disastrous to her hopes.
Trump, despite weeks of failing to find a coherent anti-Harris message, still has a serious chance nine weeks out of pulling off one of the most stunning political comebacks in US history. Strong showings in a few key states could land him back in the Oval Office.
More broadly, the new polls show that Harris has at least made a strong start on her extraordinary task of turning around an election that looked lost within the space of a few months. But they also reflect Trump’s stunning and enduring strength among millions of Americans in his third presidential election — eight years after he won his first.
In Wisconsin, likely voters back Harris by 50% to 44% for Trump. In Michigan, the vice president is up 48% to 43%. In Arizona, the former president is ahead 49% to 44%. There’s no clear leader in Georgia and Nevada, where it’s 48% Harris to 47% Trump or in Pennsylvania, where they are even at 47%.
The polls represent a snapshot of the current moment after a tumultuous political summer and shouldn’t be seen as a prediction of what will happen in November. But they help explain how the fight for the White House could unfold in the next two months, underscore the strategic decisions facing both campaigns and pinpoint the current strengths and weakness of each candidate. For instance, across six states, Harris now trails Trump by only eight points on average on who is most trusted on the economy — a significantly lower deficit on the issue that matters most to voters than the one suffered by Biden in earlier polls.
The picture of a finely balanced contest is also a reminder of the critical nature of next week’s debate between Harris and Trump, one of the few scheduled events in the final months to November that could again turn the race upside down.
The polling data suggests that Harris is two-thirds of the way to consolidating, at least for now, the critical midwestern “Blue Wall” states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania that have long been the most credible route back to the White House for a Democratic nominee. But the tied race at this point in Pennsylvania suggests that Harris still faces a massive task in putting away a state that Biden won by only 1.2% of the vote four years ago.
Many Democrats had privately conceded that Georgia, a longtime conservative bastion that has been competitive since 2020, was probably lost when Biden was the presumptive nominee. But the arrival of Harris has thrust the Peach State back into the decisive sprint to the White House.
Both candidates have already made multiple visits to Pennsylvania and Georgia especially. Harris and Walz took a two-day bus tour through rural, southern parts of Georgia last week. And Harris was in Pittsburgh on Monday and will return to the Steel City for debate prep later this week.
Trump recently took steps to repair his ties to Georgia’s popular Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, whom he faults for not aiding his attempt to overturn Biden’s win in the state in 2020, and last week was in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, for a rally that exemplified his attraction to voters in former industrial powerhouses hurt by the flight of blue-collar jobs overseas.
The centrality of Pennsylvania and Georgia to the race can be seen when various scenarios are played out across the electoral map. There are tantalizing possibilities for Harris. Assuming each candidate holds all states solidly in their columns, Harris could win the presidency by pairing Wisconsin and Michigan with a Pennsylvania victory and one electoral vote from anywhere else.
But Trump also has a simple route-map back to power. If he wins North Carolina, another swing state not included in these surveys that has gone Republican ever since 2012, he could win a second term just by taking Pennsylvania and Georgia. In this case, it wouldn’t matter how he performs in Wisconsin, Michigan, Nevada or Arizona.
Pennsylvania and Georgia have been critical bellwethers in recent years. In 2020, Biden captured each battleground and won the White House. In 2016, Trump beat Democrat Hillary Clinton in each state on the way to his shock election victory.
This year, Harris needs to drive out strong turnout in the cities like Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Atlanta and Augusta, especially among minority voters. She is also targeting a strong performance among voters in the suburbs of these and other cities. The CNN/SSRS polls show the vice president already has double digit leads among female likely voters in both states, no doubt helped by being a stronger messenger on abortion than Biden, which the data also shows.
Trump is always strong among White male, White non-college educated and rural voters. One of the obvious goals of the Harris campaign — as can be seen by her trips with vice presidential nominee Tim Walz to rural areas — is to try to trim some of the Republican nominee’s margins in districts where he runs most strongly.
One of the most interesting questions at this stage of the race — that is also impossible to answer – is whether Harris’ rise still has some way to go and whether she has not just unified the Democratic base but is also making new inroads among moderate Republicans and independent voters. Another development to watch in coming weeks is whether her apparent strength in Wisconsin and Michigan in the new CNN polls is a harbinger of similar strength to come in Pennsylvania.
But if Harris’ ascent has already peaked, these polls underscore just how close Trump may still be to a second term. A narrow loss by Harris in Pennsylvania that hands the ex-president the White House would cause second guessing among Democrats at her decision to pass on the state’s governor – Josh Shapiro, who won it by nearly 15 percentage points in 2022 – as a running mate.
The polls were conducted between August 23-29, following the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, and are being published at the beginning of an intense two-month derby to Election Day. They represent some of the most comprehensive overviews of the race in the swing states that will decide the election that have yet emerged.
And their publication follows a stunning presidential race that saw Biden fold his reelection campaign less than four months before Election Day and his rival, Trump, who is vying to become only the second president to win non-consecutive White House terms, escape an assassination attempt in one of those vital states: Pennsylvania.
The campaign has moved up several notches in intensity even since Labor Day on Monday, and a key focus of both sides in the coming weeks will be identifying and turning out voters who are not yet committed to their choice.
Across the states surveyed by CNN, an average of 15% of likely voters say they have not firmly decided who they will vote for. This means that if either Harris or Trump can close strongly and carve out a significant advantage among this group, they could lock down the race.
There are some warning signs for both the vice president and the former president in the data.
Harris polls at 85% among Black likely voters in Georgia and at 84% in Pennsylvania. These findings may support claims by the Trump campaign that it has made inroads into a constituency that forms a bedrock of the Democratic coalition. According to exit polls in the 2020 election, Biden won 92% of Black voters in Pennsylvania and 88% in Georgia. One key focus of the Harris campaign and grass roots organizing groups will be to try to elevate those numbers in the next eight weeks and to make sure Black voters get to the polls in big numbers. In both states however, Black registered voters express less motivation to vote than White voters do.
Trump, meanwhile, has spent recent days oscillating in his position on reproductive rights and IVF fertility treatments, keenly aware that his most significant domestic political achievement – the construction of a conservative Supreme Court majority that overturned the nationwide constitutional right to an abortion – has turned into a massive electoral liability. The CNN/SSRS polling bears this out. It finds that Harris has increased Biden’s lead on abortion and reproductive rights across the six states surveyed and that it now stands at an average of 27 percentage points among women.
The current messaging from each side underscores this fraught moment in a bitter race.
Trump’s team put out a memo on Tuesday that pulsated with frustration that Harris’ policy reversals and ties to Biden, an unpopular president, were not already decisive in Trump’s favor. His top advisers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita wrote that their candidate had the true momentum. “Do the Democrats and voters realize this? Or does the mainstream media, in its attempt to manage public opinion and continue the ‘Harris Honeymoon,’ report a version of reality that is at odds with the facts?” they said.
The Harris campaign released its own memo over the weekend seeking to temper euphoria that lifted the vice president at her Chicago convention. Democratic leaders, after all, need their voters to fear a close race and see a Trump return as a realistic probability in order to boost turnout.
“Make no mistake: we head into the final stretch of this race as the clear underdogs,” Harris Campaign Manager Jennifer O’Malley Dillon warned."
BXS0G3D2JW_MO1ABEI7RQL6NWC,Members of Turkish national youth organization in custody after assault on US Marines,"By Oren Liebermann, Gul Tuysuz and Avery Schmitz, CNN","3 minute read Updated 10:55 AM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240903,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/02/politics/us-marines-turkey-assault/,"More than a dozen members of a Turkish national youth organization were taken into custody in Turkey after local authorities say they assaulted two US Marines.
The Marines, assigned to the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit, were on liberty in Izmir when the assault occurred Monday afternoon, the US Sixth Fleet said in a statement.
The Marines were assaulted by members of the Turkish Youth Union, according to local authorities, a nationalist anti-American organization that has attacked US service members before.
Video of the assault confirmed by a US official shows several people holding the Marines by force as a speaker on the street screams loudly. One of the Marines shouts “Help!” several times, while the crowd puts a bag over the head of another Marine. The crowd then starts chanting, “Yankee, go home!”
The Marines were able to break away from the crowd with the help of other Marines in the area, the Navy said. They were screened at a local hospital and are not injured. The Marines have returned to the USS Wasp.
The US and Turkey are NATO allies, but relations between the two have often been fraught. Since the start of the war in Gaza, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has vociferously criticized Israel, accusing the country of carrying out a genocide. In April, Erdogan hosted Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Istanbul. Turkey also blocked Sweden’s ascension to NATO, claiming that Sweden harbored Kurdish terror groups. Erdogan relented when the US moved forward with plans to sell Turkey modern American fighter jets.
Local Izmir police and the Naval Criminal Investigative Service are investigating the incident, the Navy said. No Marines were detained, and those involved in the incident are cooperating with investigators.
“We can confirm reports that U.S. service members embarked aboard the USS Wasp were the victims of an assault in Izmir today, and are now safe,” the US Embassy in Turkey said on social media. “We thank Turkish authorities for their rapid response and ongoing investigation.”
Izmir Governorship said in a statement that local police intervened in the incident and that 15 suspects were taken into custody.
It’s not the first time the Turkish Youth Union has attacked US service members. In 2021, authorities in Turkey arrested 17 members of the group for putting a hood over the head of a US Navy civilian employee, Reuters reported at the time. Their actions were in protest of US policy in the Middle East.
In a similar incident in 2014, members of the organization attacked three US sailors on leave from their ship in Istanbul, placing bags over their heads. The assailants chanted “Yankee, go home!” during the attack.
For the Turkish Youth Union, placing bags over the heads of US service members is a reference to an infamous incident in 2003 known as the “hood incident.” Shortly after the invasion of Iraq, US troops captured Turkish soldiers and placed bags over their heads, detaining them for 60 hours.
The 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit is part of the USS Wasp Amphibious Ready Group, which is operating in the eastern Mediterranean Sea amid concerns of a regional escalation. The USS Wasp had pulled into Izmir one day earlier, and the Marines were allowed to leave the ship for a break.

He explained that he had suffered a “health hiccup,” since diagnosed as a “minor stroke,” and went “blue lights flashing” to the hospital when he couldn’t use his arm last week, but he reassured fans that he had since recovered enough to play his guitar.
Although May is most famous as a founding member of Queen and for writing some of the legendary rock band’s biggest hits, including “We Will Rock You” and “Who Wants to Live Forever,” he has also enjoyed a career as an astrophysicist and animal rights activist.
“Good news is that I can play guitar after the events of the last few days,” he said, adding that it “was a little scary” but that he “had the most fantastic care and attention from Frimley Hospital.”

He said he was “okay” and “just doing what I’m told, which is basically nothing,” listing the things he can’t do at the moment like drive, get on a plane or raise his heart rate too high.
As he spoke, a plane flew overhead and he joked that “I’m not allowed to have planes flying over, which will stress me.”
Later in the video, May also spoke about his recently released documentary detailing his decade-long campaign to stop Britain’s controversial badger cull.
The musician has suffered from a series of health issues in recent years.
In May 2020, he had a heart attack, after which he had three stents – short, wire-mesh tubes that act like a scaffold to help keep an artery open – put in to alleviate the danger of blood supply being blocked from the heart.
Afterward, May told the television show “Good Morning Britain” that he nearly died when he suffered a range of complications, including a stomach hemorrhage as a result of the medication he was taking for his heart.
In March last year, he was knighted by King Charles III for his services to music and charity.

Israeli soldiers found the six bodies in tunnels under the enclave, according to the military. The hostages were “brutally murdered by Hamas terrorists, a short while before we reached them,” Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said in a briefing Sunday.
The development has sparked protests across Israel, with fresh public anger directed at Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his cabinet for failing to secure a hostage deal. Israel’s largest trade union has also called for a nationwide strike starting Monday.
Three of the six whose bodies were recovered had been expected to be released during the first phase of an eventual ceasefire agreement, two Israeli officials have told CNN.
Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Eden Yerushalmi and Carmel Gat were slated to be released as part of a “humanitarian category,” based on a framework agreed by Israel and Hamas in early July, the officials said.
“Our prime minister delayed it,” one of the Israeli officials said. “It’s way too late for the six who have been killed, but it’s time to reach an agreement.”
The ordeal of California native Goldberg-Polin, who was taken at gunpoint at the Nova music festival on October 7, led to him becoming one of the faces of the devastating international hostage crisis that has challenged Netanyahu’s leadership and triggered widespread destruction in Gaza.
The parents of 23-year-old Goldberg-Polin have been among the most vocal of the hostage families pushing Netanyahu to seek a deal securing their relatives’ return. Their tireless and high-profile campaigning saw them meet with world leaders, and earlier this month, give an emotional address at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago.

“With broken hearts, the Goldberg-Polin family is devastated to announce the death of their beloved son and brother, Hersh. The family thanks you all for your love and support and asks for privacy at this time,” the family said in a statement Sunday.
The Israeli military named the other three victims as Almog Sarusi, Alex Lobanov and Ori Danino. CNN is reaching out to their families.
In a taped message Sunday, Netanyahu said he had been shocked to the core by what he said was “the terrible cold-blooded murder of six of our hostages.” He also stressed that “those who murder hostages do not want a deal.”
He said Israel would continue to pursue Hamas, and accused it of not wanting to conduct genuine negotiations since December.
“Three months ago, on May 27, Israel agreed to a hostage release deal with the full backing of the United States. Hamas refused. Even after the United States updated the outline of the deal on August 16 – we agreed, and Hamas again refused.”
He added that the Israeli government and he, personally, are “committed to continue working towards a deal that will bring back all our hostages and guarantee our security and existence.”
In response, the Hostages Families Forum, a volunteer-based organization that represents relatives of those held captive, criticized the Prime Minister, calling on him to “stop blaming everyone” and to “take responsibility” for his alleged failures.
“Take responsibility for the thwarting (of a deal). Take responsibility for the neglect. Take responsibility for the hostages who were murdered in captivity,” the Forum demanded in a statement.
The Forum also said Netanyahu had ignored the views of the security establishment in insisting on conditions in the negotiations.
“Hamas is not the only one responsible for the thwarting of the deal. We do not expect the terrorist (Hamas leader Yahya) Sinwar to want to return the hostages, we expect the Prime Minister of Israel to do everything, everything, everything in order to return the hostages home.”
The Forum has called for demonstrations across Israel, while also announcing a vigil honoring the “hostages murdered in Gaza by Hamas” in Tel Aviv at 6 p.m. local time (11 a.m. ET).
US President Joe Biden said the bodies of the hostages were recovered under the city of Rafah in southern Gaza.
“I am devastated and outraged,” Biden said in a statement released by the White House that also paid tribute to Goldberg-Polin’s parents.
“They have been courageous, wise, and steadfast, even as they have endured the unimaginable,” Biden said. “They have been relentless and irrepressible champions of their son and of all the hostages held in unconscionable conditions.”
Goldberg-Polin’s death in particular will reverberate not just in Israel but in US political circles.
His parents Rachel and Jonathan have regularly met top US officials in Washington to press the case of the hostages, and their emotional address to top Democrats at the convention earlier this month inextricably tied the hostages’ fate to US policy over the war in Gaza.
Rachel Goldberg-Polin told CNN in January that she wears a piece of tape marking each day that has passed since her son was kidnapped.
At her convention speech, she described life since October 7 as like living on “another planet.”
“Anyone who is a parent or has had a parent can try to imagine the anguish and misery that Jon and I and all the hostage families are enduring,” she told delegates.
Some of those discovered dead in the tunnels under Gaza this weekend were, like Goldberg-Polin, captured at the Nova music festival. Lobanov, a 32-year-old father of two, and Yerushalmi, 24, were both tending bar at the gathering, according to the Hostages Families Forum. Danino, 25, and Sarusi, 27, were also at the festival.
Gat, 40, was taken from Kibbutz Be’eri. She had been visiting her parents when Hamas militants stormed the community close to Gaza’s border, killing and taking hostages as they went.
News of more hostage deaths piles pressure on Netanyahu as anger inside Israel swells over the failure to strike a ceasefire deal, and as stark disagreements between the prime minister and his military leaders increasingly spill out into the open.
A number of protests sparked across Israel on Sunday, with demonstrators’ anger directed at the government’s handling of the crisis.
Protests have occurred or are ongoing in Tel Aviv, Ra’anana, Rehovot and Be’er Sheva. In several instances, protesters have blocked roads – demanding an immediate agreement to secure the remaining hostages’ release. The banner at one protest read: “Look them in the eyes.”
The chairman of Israel’s General Federation of Labor (Histadrut) Arnon Bar-David has also called for a nationwide general strike to begin on Monday at 6 a.m. local time, after holding a “charged and difficult” meeting with representatives of hostage families in Tel Aviv.
“I will not tolerate the neglect,” Bar-David stated, emphasizing the urgency of the situation of the hostages in Gaza. Histadrut is the country’s biggest labor union.
“We are in a downward spiral, and we don’t stop receiving body bags. Only a strike would shock, and that’s why I’ve decided that starting tomorrow at six in the morning, the entire Israeli economy will shut down,” the labor leader said.
The hostage deaths up the stakes for Biden to push US ally Israel to find a way out of a devastating war in Gaza that has inflamed global public opinion and repeatedly threatened to spiral into an all-out regional conflict.
“Make no mistake, Hamas leaders will pay for these crimes. And we will keep working around the clock for a deal to secure the release of the remaining hostages,” Biden said in his statement on Goldberg-Polin’s death.
Israeli President Isaac Herzog said “the heart of an entire nation is shattered to pieces” by the news of the six dead.
“On behalf of the State of Israel, I embrace their families with all my heart, and apologize for failing to bring them home safely,” Herzog said in a statement.
“We will continue to fight relentlessly against the criminal, terrorist organization Hamas, which has once again proven there is no end to its willingness to commit murder and crimes against humanity.”
Israel launched its war against Hamas in Gaza after the militant group’s October 7 cross-border attacks, in which more than 1,200 Israelis were killed and 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli authorities.
More than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the war began, according to the health ministry in the enclave.
Anger has been growing inside Israel, led by many hostage families who believe Netanyahu and key far-right cabinet colleagues have been stalling on achieving a ceasefire resolution with Hamas that might bring those captured and killed home.
Netanyahu has been adamant that a deal can only be signed when Israel’s safety is assured.
But domestic pressure is building,  with the Hostages Families Forum being among the most critical of the Israeli prime minister.
“The delay in signing the deal has led to their deaths and those of many other hostages,” the forum said in a statement in English on Sunday.
“We call to Netanyahu: Stop hiding. Provide the public with a justification for this ongoing abandonment,” the forum added.
Biden said Saturday evening that his staff has been in touch with Israeli officials. Biden also called for an end to the war, expressing optimism that an agreement could be reached on a ceasefire-for-hostages deal and adding that parties involved in the negotiation have said they “agree on the principles.”
“It’s time this war ended,” Biden added. “I think we’re on the verge of having an agreement. It’s time to end it. It’s time to finish it.”
The US, Qatar and Egypt, who have acted as mediators, this month renewed a push to reach a hostage and ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas.
The mediators have proposed a three-phase approach: a first phase involving a six-week ceasefire; a second phase that would release all hostages and a withdrawal of all IDF presence from Gaza; and a third reconstruction phase.

C9LDR6NLXG_6R8I6M1YWKKOLBV,Members of Turkish national youth organization in custody after assault on US Marines,"By Oren Liebermann, Gul Tuysuz and Avery Schmitz, CNN","3 minute read Updated 10:55 AM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240903,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/02/politics/us-marines-turkey-assault/,"More than a dozen members of a Turkish national youth organization were taken into custody in Turkey after local authorities say they assaulted two US Marines.
The Marines, assigned to the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit, were on liberty in Izmir when the assault occurred Monday afternoon, the US Sixth Fleet said in a statement.
The Marines were assaulted by members of the Turkish Youth Union, according to local authorities, a nationalist anti-American organization that has attacked US service members before.
Video of the assault confirmed by a US official shows several people holding the Marines by force as a speaker on the street screams loudly. One of the Marines shouts “Help!” several times, while the crowd puts a bag over the head of another Marine. The crowd then starts chanting, “Yankee, go home!”
The Marines were able to break away from the crowd with the help of other Marines in the area, the Navy said. They were screened at a local hospital and are not injured. The Marines have returned to the USS Wasp.
The US and Turkey are NATO allies, but relations between the two have often been fraught. Since the start of the war in Gaza, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has vociferously criticized Israel, accusing the country of carrying out a genocide. In April, Erdogan hosted Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Istanbul. Turkey also blocked Sweden’s ascension to NATO, claiming that Sweden harbored Kurdish terror groups. Erdogan relented when the US moved forward with plans to sell Turkey modern American fighter jets.
Local Izmir police and the Naval Criminal Investigative Service are investigating the incident, the Navy said. No Marines were detained, and those involved in the incident are cooperating with investigators.
“We can confirm reports that U.S. service members embarked aboard the USS Wasp were the victims of an assault in Izmir today, and are now safe,” the US Embassy in Turkey said on social media. “We thank Turkish authorities for their rapid response and ongoing investigation.”
Izmir Governorship said in a statement that local police intervened in the incident and that 15 suspects were taken into custody.
It’s not the first time the Turkish Youth Union has attacked US service members. In 2021, authorities in Turkey arrested 17 members of the group for putting a hood over the head of a US Navy civilian employee, Reuters reported at the time. Their actions were in protest of US policy in the Middle East.
In a similar incident in 2014, members of the organization attacked three US sailors on leave from their ship in Istanbul, placing bags over their heads. The assailants chanted “Yankee, go home!” during the attack.
For the Turkish Youth Union, placing bags over the heads of US service members is a reference to an infamous incident in 2003 known as the “hood incident.” Shortly after the invasion of Iraq, US troops captured Turkish soldiers and placed bags over their heads, detaining them for 60 hours.
The 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit is part of the USS Wasp Amphibious Ready Group, which is operating in the eastern Mediterranean Sea amid concerns of a regional escalation. The USS Wasp had pulled into Izmir one day earlier, and the Marines were allowed to leave the ship for a break.

CBI4VL6WHX_HAP2FYB0N0OTUMS,Biden administration announces major actions to tackle Russian efforts to influence 2024 election,"By Sean Lyngaas, Evan Perez, Kylie Atwood, Zachary Cohen and Jennifer Hansler, CNN","5 minute read Updated 8:18 PM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/04/politics/biden-administration-accuse-russia-election-influence-efforts/,"The Biden administration announced a sweeping set of actions to tackle a major Russian government-backed effort to influence the 2024 US presidential election on Wednesday, including unveiling criminal charges against two Russian nationals, sanctions on 10 individuals and entities, and the seizure of 32 internet domains.
At Russian President Vladimir Putin’s direction, three Russian companies used fake profiles to promote false narratives on social media, US Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said in a statement. Internal documents produced by one of those Russian companies show one of the goals of the propaganda effort was to boost the candidacy of Donald Trump or whoever emerged as the Republican nominee for president, according to an FBI affidavit.
Separately, two employees of RT, the Russian state media network, were indicted in a US court for allegedly being part of a scheme that funneled nearly $10 million to set up and direct a Tennessee-based front company to produce online content aimed at sowing divisions among Americans, according to the Justice Department. The scheme targeted millions of American news consumers with what Attorney General Merrick Garland described as “hidden Russian government messaging.”

Taken together, the actions represent the Biden administration’s most significant public response yet to alleged Russian influence operations targeting American voters. After the US accused Iran of trying to hack both the Trump and Biden-Harris campaigns last month, Wednesday’s actions are a reminder that US officials continue to see Russia as a prominent foreign influence threat to November’s election, sources familiar with the matter said.
One of the three Russian companies allegedly behind the internet domains seized by the Justice Department is a company called Social Design Agency (SDA), which the Treasury Department previously sanctioned for allegedly running fake news sites in Europe on behalf of the Russian government.
CNN first reported on the pending US actions earlier Wednesday. The Russian disinformation operation is being laundered through both Americans and non-American voices, four sources told CNN.
A nearly 300-page FBI affidavit released on Wednesday describes the domain seizures and lays out a broad, Kremlin-backed effort to seed fake news stories to attack US politicians supporting Ukraine in the war against Russia and stoke tensions in US society.
Internal SDA documents cited in the affidavit, which appear to date to before Trump officially clinched the Republican nomination, say one of the “goals” of the company’s disinformation efforts was to “secure victory of a U.S. Political Party A candidate (Candidate A or one of his internal party opponents” in the 2024 election.
The documents included in the affidavit do not mention Trump by name, but the US intelligence community has said that Russia’s preferences for the presidential race also haven’t shifted since 2020, when Moscow conducted a range of influence operations in support of Trump and aimed at denigrating Joe Biden.
The SDA documents also propose targeting US voters in six swing states with disinformation, hitting on themes such as the “risk of job loss for white Americans” and the purported threat of crime from “Ukrainian immigrants,” according to the FBI affidavit.
Prosecutors in the indictment of two RT employees also describe an operation intended to fuel pro-Russian narratives, in part, by pushing content and news articles favoring Trump and others who the Kremlin deemed to be friendlier to its interests.
The unnamed Tennessee-based company that the Justice Department alleges was being funded by Russian operatives working as part of the Kremlin-orchestrated influence operation is Tenet Media, which is linked to right-wing commentators with millions of subscribers on YouTube and other social media platforms, according to a US official briefed on the matter.
Formerly known as Russia Today, RT runs television and online platforms around the world that advance the Kremlin’s agenda. The Justice Department forced RT America to register as a foreign agent in 2017 after US intelligence officials concluded that the media outlet contributed to Russian efforts to meddle in the 2016 election.
Wednesday’s announcements mark the second major effort by the Biden administration to blunt RT’s influence in as many months. In July, the Justice Department accused an RT employee of being involved in a scheme that used a network of about 1,000 social media accounts to pose as US residents to spread disinformation about the Ukraine war and other topics. US officials accuse the Kremlin of financing the scheme; a Kremlin spokesperson denied the allegation.
Asked for comment, an RT spokesperson did not respond to the substance of the allegations, and instead emailed mocking comments including, “2016 called and it wants its clichés back.”
CNN was not immediately able to reach Social Design Agency for comment.
A growing number of foreign operatives have attempted to influence US elections since Russia’s 2016 activity, which included hacking the Democratic National Committee and leaking documents aimed at undercutting Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign.
In the 2024 election, Iran’s alleged embrace of a similar hack-and-leak playbook that Russia used in 2016 has US officials on heightened alert. In June, a group of Iranian government-linked hackers successfully targeted the Trump campaign, stole internal campaign documents and shared them with news organizations. The hackers breached the email account of longtime Trump ally Roger Stone to target campaign staff, CNN has reported.
US officials are also keeping a close eye on China, which US officials and private experts say uses a vast set of online accounts to also target US voters. Chinese leader Xi Jinping told US President Joe Biden that China would not interfere in the 2024 US presidential election when the two men met last November, CNN previously reported.
But any foreign or domestic attempts to sow discord during the US election and shape voters’ opinions don’t change the fact that the voting process is very difficult to tamper with and protected by layers of defenses. There is no evidence of successful efforts — foreign or domestic —to swing an American election by changing vote tallies.
An estimated 97% of registered voters in the 2024 US election will cast their ballot in a jurisdiction with a verified paper record — adding to transparency around the vote, Jen Easterly, director of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, told reporters this week.
“Election infrastructure has never been more secure,” Easterly said.

CCPG6J2L5Q_LJ8Y7YSXO0SU2LF,Ukraine carries out one of its biggest-ever drone attacks on Russia,"By Brad Lendon and Isaac Yee, CNN","5 minute read Updated 2:10 PM EDT, Mon September 2, 2024",20240902,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/02/europe/ukraine-big-drone-attack-russia-intl-hnk/,"Ukraine launched one of its biggest-ever drone attacks on Russia over the weekend, hitting a refinery and power station deep inside the country, according to videos posted on social media and geolocated by CNN.
The short videos show plumes of smoke rising from targets in Moscow and the neighboring Tver region.
The Russian Defense Ministry acknowledged the size of the Ukrainian attack, but downplayed its effectiveness, saying Sunday that 158 Ukrainian UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) “were destroyed and intercepted by on-duty air defense” overnight in 15 regions, including over the capital.
Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin said two drones were shot down in the area of the Moscow Oil Refinery. No casualties were reported, but the second downed drone damaged a technical building at the refinery and caused a fire, which the mayor said had been localized and did not affect the plant’s operation.
The Tver region’s governor, Igor Rudenya, said on social media that a fire caused by the drone attack on the Konakovo district has been extinguished and that gas and electricity services to the area were operating normally.
The Ukrainian drone strikes follow others in the past week, including one last Thursday that set fire to oil reservoirs at a refinery in the Rostov region of Russia, according to the Ukrainian Defense Ministry.
Social media video geolocated by CNN showed a large cloud of black smoke billowing from the Atlas oil depot in Rostov following the strike.
The recent wave of Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory began last month, when Kyiv’s troops launched a cross-border incursion into the Kursk region on August 6.
Just on Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin acknowledged that “people are going through tough ordeals, especially in the Kursk region,” as Ukrainian forces attempt to “destabilize the situation along the border.” But the attack has not stifled Russia’s offensive in the eastern Donbas region, added Putin.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky the Kursk offensive is going “according to plan,” but admitted “difficulty” in the eastern Ukrainian cities of Pokrovsk and Toretsk.
Zelensky said the most recent drone assaults deep inside Russia were justified by Moscow’s repeated attacks on his country.
“Just in the past week, Russia has launched over 160 missiles of various types, 780 guided aerial bombs, and 400 strike UAVs of different kinds against our people,” Zelensky said in a post on X.
On Monday, at least three people were wounded by strikes in Kyiv, as well as the eastern Kharkiv and Sumy regions, according to Ukrainian authorities. Those came after 41 people were injured following a Russian attack on civilian infrastructure in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, local authorities said.
“Russia is once again terrorizing Kharkiv, striking civilian infrastructure and the city itself,” Zelensky said on X, calling on allies to “give Ukraine everything it needs to defend itself.”

“It is entirely justified for Ukrainians to respond to Russian terror by any means necessary to stop it,” Zelensky said, reiterating his call for Western countries to lift restrictions on the use of long-range weapons, which have that prevented their use to hit targets inside Russia.
“This includes decisions to carry out long-range strikes on Russia’s missile launch sites, destroy Russian military logistics, and conduct joint efforts to shoot down missiles and drones – everything that will help us resist Russian evil,” Zelensky said.
Russia has repeatedly targeted Ukraine’s energy infrastructure with missile and drone attacks since its invasion.
Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov told CNN last week that he has presented the Biden administration with a list of targets inside Russia that Kyiv wants to hit with US-supplied long-range weapons, including the Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS).
Fired from mobile launchers, ATACMS have a range of up to 300 kilometers (186 miles) and can deploy single high-explosive warheads or up to 900 submunitions, according to the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba also urged allies to “abandon baseless fears” and “lift restrictions on the country’s legitimate right to self-defense.”
“Ukraine is forced to fight with hands tied behind its back,” Kuleba said on Monday.
“We have explained what kind of capabilities we need to protect the citizens against the Russian terror that Russians are causing us, so I hope we were heard,” Umerov said in an interview with CNN’s Alex Marquardt.
But a US official said many of Ukraine’s high-value targets in Russia are outside the range of ATACMS. Russia’s military has pulled its high-value military assets far away from the front lines, including the aircraft launching glide bombs that have wreaked havoc on Ukrainian targets.
Umerov has pushed back on the assessments, saying Ukraine has presented the US a list of targets they would use ATACMS to strike.
An analysis last month from a Washington-based think tank, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), supported Ukrainian claims there are high-value targets inside Russia within range of ATAMCS.
ISW said it had identified 233 Russian targets – “large military bases, communications stations, logistics centers, repair facilities, fuel depots, ammunition warehouses, and permanent headquarters” – in range of ATACMS that are immobile assets, meaning Moscow cannot move them out of harm’s way.
And ISW said Ukraine would only need to use ATACMS to strike some of those targets to have a significant impact on Russia’s ability to fight on the front lines.
While it pushes for the US to lift the ATACMS restrictions, Ukraine has been developing new longer-range indigenous weapons.
Zelensky announced last month that his country has a new jet-powered drone that can strike deep into Russia.
He said the Palianytsia “missile-drone” had been used in combat for the first time and was much faster and more powerful than the country’s existing fleet of drones, according to Ukrainian state media.
The Ukrainian president said he wouldn’t give any more specific details on the Palianytsia. But he hailed the new weapon’s “long-range” capabilities, hinting that it may surpass the up to 1,500-kilometer (932 miles) range of Ukraine’s current drone fleet.

During an episode of the “Happy Sad Confused” podcast, Ryder revealed that she and her former costar still text regularly and “we always say who it is, even though it says it on the text.”
“So like on his birthday I go, ‘Happy birthday, my husband’ and then he’s like, ‘Hey, my wife, I love you KR 57,’” Ryder said. “Like on each birthday he’s like KR 57 or whatever his age is. He’s always done that.”
The pair costarred in the 1992 Francis Ford Coppola directed drama “Bram Stoker’s Dracula” in which their characters had a wedding scene.
In a 2018 interview to promote their rom-com “Destination Wedding,”  Ryder said she believed she and Reeves had actually wed.
“In that scene, Francis [Ford Coppola] used a real Romanian priest,” she explained. “We shot the master and he did the whole thing. So I think we’re married.”
Three years later, Reeves talked about it during a video he shot for Esquire.
“We did a whole take of a marriage ceremony with real priests,” he said. “Winona says we are [married]. Coppola says we are. So I guess we’re married… under the eyes of God.”
During the recent podcast, Ryder raved about working with Reeves. However, the “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice” star demurred on possibly doing a “John Wick” action film because “involves a lot of stunt” and she’s “thinking of my bones.”
“I would literally do anything though with him,” she said about costarring with Reeves. “He is so special.”"

CJTPMJMD4C_SC6Z53H138284TM,Two rescued from yacht after terrifying night at sea amid 20-foot waves,"By Hilary Whiteman, CNN","3 minute read Updated 9:10 PM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240903,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/03/australia/yacht-rescue-off-nsw-coast-intl-hnk/,"Two people have been rescued after a terrifying night at sea as six-meter (20-foot) waves tossed their stricken yacht nearly 200 miles (322 kilometers) off Australia’s eastern coast as they drifted at speed towards New Zealand.
Authorities were first alerted to the crew’s crisis around 1 p.m. on Monday, when they deployed a distress beacon, but it was hours before the first rescue helicopters located the vessel.
The 20-meter yacht, the Spirit of Mateship, had lost power and communications and was being hit by winds of up to 90 kilometers an hour (56 mph) as well as waves up to six meters high.
“(The helicopter’s crew) were able to fly above the yacht, and they could communicate via radio to the yacht, but they were unable to pick them up,” said Ben Flight, duty manager at the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Response Center.
Another rescue attempt was later abandoned due to rough seas, forcing the two people – named by New South Wales police as Brett, 60, and Lisa, 48 – to spend what Flight described as a “horrible” night at sea.
“They weren’t injured, but the vessel had suffered a mechanical issue of some kind, and they couldn’t steer, and they couldn’t make their own way through the water, so they were drifting, and they were taking on water as well. So, they were in quite a serious situation,” said Flight.
“They were sort of just at the mercy of the elements. They would have been moving around quite uncomfortably. It would have been particularly windy, noisy, probably quite wet as well.”
Two Australian Navy ships – HMAS Arunta and HMAS Canberra – answered calls for help, as well as Royal Australian Air Force C-130J Hercules aircraft, according to the Australian Defence Force (ADF).
The ships, along with a nearby merchant vessel, monitored the yacht’s location overnight, and the rescue resumed in the early hours of the morning, when conditions had eased.
NSW Police vessel Nemesis arrived at the yacht about 3 a.m. Tuesday and deployed a smaller boat to rescue the sailors around 7:30 a.m. in choppy seas with swells of four meters to five meters.
The couple returned to shore on the Nemesis on Tuesday evening, telling reporters in Sydney that they were “glad to be back.”
“The boat is more than seaworthy. It’s just mainly we were tired and seasick and couldn’t continue any further,” said Brett.
Flight said the outcome would have been much worse if the crew hadn’t deployed the distress beacon, which issues a satellite alert to advise the rescue coordination center of their location.
The Spirit of Mateship has competed in the prestigious Sydney to Hobart yacht race several times, crewed by wounded veterans and army personnel.
Together they raised money to support army veterans. However, the yacht has changed hands since then, according to Flight."
CN4H1T4M17_NKSTTDFORHW64I3,A former New York official is accused of acting on behalf of the Chinese government. Here’s a timeline of her alleged actions,"By Elizabeth Wolfe, CNN","8 minute read Updated 11:06 AM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/04/us/timeline-linda-sun-kathy-hochul-aide/,"Allegations of money laundering, falsified signatures and surreptitious communications fill the federal indictment brought against Linda Sun, a longtime New York governors’ aide who was charged Tuesday with acting as an agent for the Chinese government.
Sun, a former deputy chief of staff to New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and aide to former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, faces 10 counts, including violating the Foreign Agents Registrations Act, visa fraud, alien smuggling and money laundering conspiracy, according to an unsealed copy of the indictment.
Federal prosecutors allege Sun has been operating for years as an undisclosed agent of the People’s Republic of China, using her high-ranking positions in New York government to fulfill the PRC’s requests and further the interests of the Chinese Communist Party.
In the indictment, prosecutors lay out Sun’s alleged efforts to allow the PRC access to private government communications, influence the governors’ public remarks on China and block the Taiwanese government from communicating with Cuomo and Hochul.
As Sun served in high-ranking positions in New York, her husband, Chris Hu, is accused of orchestrating the transfer of millions of dollars in “kickbacks” from the PRC, which the couple used to purchase expensive properties and luxury cars, prosecutors said. Hu was also charged with money laundering conspiracy and conspiracy to commit bank fraud as well as misusing means of identification.
During a federal court hearing Tuesday, prosecutors alleged the defendants used shell companies, iCloud accounts and WeChat messages – with everything in Mandarin – in their alleged crimes.
These are the ‘gifts’ prosecutors say ex-aide to two New York governors got from the Chinese government
Sun and Hu both pleaded not guilty to all charges Tuesday afternoon. Sun’s bond is set at $1.5 million and her husband’s is set at $500,000. Both will have their travel limited to New York City, Long Island, Maine and New Hampshire.
An attorney for Sun, Jarrod Schaeffer, told CNN the charges “are inflammatory and appear to be the product of an overly aggressive prosecution.”
“We are also troubled by aspects of the government’s investigation. As we said today in court, our client is eager … to defend against these accusations in the proper forum – a court of law,” Schaeffer said.
Here is a timeline of some of the key allegations against Sun as she moved through the New York State government:
August 2012: Sun is hired by then-Gov. Cuomo’s administration as director of Asian American affairs and Queens representative. She left the office in 2015 to be the director of external affairs for Empire State Development, which handles economic development across the state.
June 9, 2016: Sun messaged a PRC official to inform them the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office, which effectively serves as the island’s embassy in the US, had invited then-Lieutenant Gov. Hochul to appear at SelectUSA, an investment summit in Washington, DC, to be held later that month, according to the indictment.
“They sent the invitation to another colleague trying to bypass me. I am working on it right now to resolve the issue,” Sun wrote to the PRC official, according to the indictment. Later, Sun followed up to say, “It’s all been taken care of satisfactorily.”
Prosecutors note that on June 21, 2016, Hochul attended a SelectUSA reception hosted by the PRC Embassy and the China General Chamber of Commerce – USA, instead of an event held by Taiwan.
February 2018: Sun became Cuomo’s deputy chief diversity officer.
March 2018: Prosecutors accuse Sun of committing visa fraud by supplying unauthorized invitation letters on behalf of the governor’s office to a delegation of PRC representatives, which helped the delegation obtain visas to enter the US, according to the indictment.
The letters, which Sun was not authorized to issue or sign, bore falsified handwritten versions of Hochul’s signature, the indictment alleges.
The PRC delegation from the Henan Province arrived in the US in June 2018, where they met with Hochul to discuss economic cooperation between their province and New York, the document said.
January 2019: Sun wrote to a PRC official, “I very much value my relationship with the consulate and have done many things to make the relationship between the state and the consulate flourish during my tenure with (Politician-1),” according to the indictment. Though Politician 1 is unnamed, Sun was serving under Cuomo at the time.
“Certainly I have managed to stop all relationships between the TECO and the state. I have denied all (r)equests from their office,” Sun said, according to the indictment.
The PRC official responded, “I know and do appreciate your help” and referred to Sun as “the most important hub connecting us with (Politician-1) and his team,” the document said.

March 16, 2020: Sun gave an unnamed Chinese official access to a private conference call held by New York State government leaders discussing their response to the Covid-19 pandemic and rising hate crimes against Asian Americans, the indictment alleges.
Sun, who was then acting as deputy chief diversity officer under Cuomo, “surreptitiously added” the PRC official to the call, though the official was not on the invitation list, the indictment alleges.
“At the close of the call, PRC Official-4 commented that the call was ‘(v)ery useful,’” it adds.
Prosecutors listed the call as evidence Sun allegedly violated the Foreign Agents Registration Act.
July 2020: Sun moved to the New York State Department of Financial Services, where she worked as Superintendent for Intergovernmental Affairs and Chief Diversity Officer.
Sometime in 2021: In 2021, Sun and Hu purchased millions of dollars in real estate, which prosecutors said was possible due to hefty financial rewards from their alleged efforts to aid the PRC, according to the indictment.
Sometime that year, the couple purchased a $3.6 million parcel of real estate in Manhasset, New York, and a $1.9 million ocean-view condominium in Honolulu, Hawaii, the indictment said. The couple didn’t take out any mortgage loans to make the purchases, the document notes.
Prosecutors noted the couple’s spending far outpaced the income noted on their federal tax returns that year. But shortly before making the purchases, Hu received more than $2.1 million in wire transfers from a PRC-based account under the name of his business partner, the indictment alleges.
“Sun did not report the real estate acquisitions on her financial disclosure statements, as she was obligated to do,” the indictment reads.
January 2021: Sun worked to remove mention of China’s mass detention of Muslim Uyghurs from Hochul’s public remarks, according to the indictment.
On January 12, after receiving a request from a PRC official, Sun said she would ask Hochul to record a video in honor of Lunar New Year, the document said. She asked the officials, “Can you share with me some talking points of things you want her to mention(?) I can make sure to include it in her remarks.”
A few days later, Sun told the PRC official she had argued with Hochul’s speechwriter, who had insisted the then-lieutenant governor should mention “the ‘Uyghur situation,’” the indictment said. Sun said she would not allow Hochul to mention the Uyghurs, it added.
Ultimately, Hochul did not mention the Uyghurs in her public Lunar New Year message, the indictment said.
That same month, the US officially determined China was committing genocide and crimes against humanity against Uyghur Muslims and ethnic and religious minority groups in the northwestern region of Xinjiang. China strongly denied allegations of human rights abuses.
August 24, 2021: Hochul became governor of New York after Cuomo resigned amid a parade of scandals. The following month, Sun became Deputy Chief of Staff in the governor’s office and served as Hochul’s advisor.
September 2022: Sun transferred to the New York State Department of Labor as its Deputy Commissioner for Strategic Business Development.
January 2023: After receiving a request from PRC government representatives, Sun obtained an unauthorized proclamation from the New York Governor’s Office to be presented at an event celebrating the Lunar New Year, prosecutors said.
“Sun obtained this proclamation from an Office of Correspondence employee outside ordinary channels and did not follow protocol by seeking supervisory authorization to create such a proclamation,” the indictment reads.
The Office of Correspondence employee mailed the proclamation to Sun’s personal address, and Sun sent a gift basket to the home of a relative of the employee, the indictment said.
When questioned by the NYS Office of the Inspector General, Sun initially denied requesting any proclamations since moving to the Department of Labor, but later admitted to requesting the Lunar New Year proclamation for a PRC official, the document said.
March 2, 2023: Sun is terminated from her position with the Department of Labor. However, Sun reportedly continued to attend events held by Asian community members claiming to represent the Department of Labor, the indictment said.
August 10, 2023: Sun received a cease-and-desist letter from the Department of Labor, which said she “allegedly attended public and professional events purporting to represent [her]self as an agency official” after she was terminated, the indictment said.
July 2024: Federal investigators raided a home belonging to Sun and Hu.
Hochul called Sun’s alleged behavior “a betrayal of trust” that left the governor furious, outraged and “absolutely shocked,” she said during an appearance with WNYC radio.
Hochul said her office fired Sun in 2023 “the second we discovered some levels of misconduct” and “alerted the authorities – and hence we ended up with what happened here today.”
The depth of the allegations against Sun was apparent to the governor and her staff only after reading details of the indictment, said Hochul, who emphasized to WNYC that Sun worked less than two years for her administration and was initially hired by the previous one.
Rich Azzopardi, a spokesperson for Cuomo, said in a statement that national security “must be free from foreign influence.”
“While Ms. Sun was promoted to deputy chief of staff in the subsequent administration, during our time she worked in a handful of agencies and was one of many community liaisons who had little to no interaction with the governor,” the statement said.

CR4NUGTISG_NAEHAWORFYMOK2B,Ceasefire talks thrown into tumult after the discovery of six hostages slain in Gaza,"By Alex Marquardt and Lauren Izso, CNN","5 minute read Published 8:14 PM EDT, Sun September 1, 2024",20240902,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/01/politics/israel-hamas-ceasefire-talks-tumult-hostages/,"The Saturday discovery of the deaths of six hostages has thrown negotiations for a ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas into tumult, with the White House national security adviser saying that “the next few days will be critical” in the push to free those still held by Hamas.
National security adviser Jake Sullivan, in a virtual meeting Sunday, told the families of Americans held hostage that the administration will “work around the clock for a deal to secure the release of the remaining hostages,” according to a readout of the discussion released by the families.
American officials said the deaths of the hostages, who were seized by militants during Hamas’ October 7 attacks, would not cause the talks to be derailed. Instead, they described new urgency in coming to an agreement that would end the Israel-Hamas war and bring those remaining in captivity home.
Both the Israeli and American governments have scrambled to react after the Israeli military announced it had recovered the bodies of six slain hostages in Gaza. As protests against the Israeli government sweep across the country, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a statement accusing Hamas of killing the six individuals and saying the group is not serious about a ceasefire deal.
How the discussions will be affected will become apparent in the next day or two, a source with knowledge of the talks told CNN on Sunday.
The “situation is complicated,” the source said. Two weeks of in-person joint negotiations with the various parties in both Egypt and Qatar have ended, but the source said discussions continue through other channels.

In the meeting with hostage families, Sullivan discussed the “ongoing diplomatic push across the highest levels of the US government to drive toward a deal,” according to the White House.
Still, American officials acknowledged the deaths of the six hostages added a layer of complexity to an already difficult and painstaking process.
Hamas’ “seriousness” about a ceasefire deal must now be called into question, said a senior US official, who added that pressure is now also growing on Netanyahu.
US officials have voiced frustrated previously at what they regard as resistance on the part of Netanyahu in reaching a deal, leading to occasionally tense conversations between President Joe Biden and his Israeli counterpart.
Still, in their statements late Saturday, neither Biden nor Vice President Kamala Harris applied pressure — either explicit or implied — on Netanyahu to reach a deal. American officials were acutely aware that pressure would come from inside Israel itself.
Biden and Harris will meet in the Situation Room on Monday with the US team negotiating a deal, according to the White House.
At least three of the hostages killed — including Israeli-American Hersh Goldberg-Polin — had been expected to be released as part of the first part of a ceasefire agreement, Israeli officials and the senior US official told CNN. That means negotiators will now have to renegotiate the list of hostages who will be released in the first phase of the deal.
“US officials had been working on a final package together with Qatar and Egypt. The package included Hersh and a number of the hostages who were just executed. This calls into question Hamas’ seriousness about a deal, even as pressure also builds on Israel and Netanyahu personally,” the senior US official said Sunday.
After the bodies were discovered, Biden still expressed hopes for a ceasefire agreement, saying that negotiators were on the “verge of having an agreement” and that “it’s time this war ended.”
“We think we can close the deal, they’ve all said they agree on the principles,” he added.
But, in the aftermath of the discovery of the hostages, a potential path forward for the long-sought-after ceasefire agreement remains up in the air.
There was no breakthrough during recent in-person talks, the source familiar with the discussions said, but new ideas are going to be presented to Israel and Hamas.

The recent talks included senior-level meetings, as well as lower-level technical negotiations, in both Doha, Qatar, and Cairo, and CIA Director Bill Burns attended the discussions. The leaders of the mediating countries — the US, Qatar and Egypt — issued a joint statement on August 16, saying those talks were intended to “conclude” the following week.
Netanyahu, who faces increasing pressure from the Israeli public, met with the families of the hostages Sunday. He also released a tape message accusing Hamas of the “cold-blooded murder” of the six hostages and saying that “those who murder hostages do not want a deal.”
He added that the Israeli government and that he, personally, are “committed to continue working towards a deal that will bring back all our hostages and guarantee our security and existence.”
The prime minister said Israel would continue to pursue Hamas and accused it of not wanting to conduct genuine negotiations since December.
“Three months ago, on May 27, Israel agreed to a hostage release deal with the full backing of the United States. Hamas refused. Even after the United States updated the outline of the deal on August 16 — we agreed, and Hamas again refused.”
Anger is rising across Israel at Netanyahu specifically, and he is “worried” about the widespread protests sweeping the country, an Israeli official told CNN.
In what organizers later described as an “endless sea of protesters,” an outpouring of anger and grief swelled into mass demonstrations in Tel Aviv and beyond Sunday. While the protesters hold Hamas responsible for the death of hostages taken in the October 7 attacks, they also blame Netanyahu for his handling of the crisis, saying he has not done enough to secure a hostage-ceasefire deal.
The Hostages and Missing Families Forum has called for Israel to be brought to a “halt” over the news of the slain hostages and urged the country to pressure the government to sign a deal to free the remaining hostages before they are killed as well. The country’s largest labor union, meanwhile, has called for a nationwide strike, saying the “entire Israeli economy will shut down” Monday.

CSJZC95WS7_2LISO7BGBJOPF85,"China’s New York envoy ‘performing his duties as usual’ after Chinese agent case, Beijing’s consulate says","By Yong Xiong and Nectar Gan, CNN","6 minute read Updated 2:10 AM EDT, Fri September 6, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/05/us/china-new-york-envoy-intl-hnk/,"China’s consulate in New York has denied reports that its top diplomat was removed in the aftermath of an alleged Chinese agent bust, saying the consul general is “performing his duties as usual.”
“Consul General Huang Ping is performing his duties as usual. We hope the media will refrain from sensationalizing false information,” a spokesperson for the Chinese Consulate General in New York told CNN in a statement Wednesday.
The statement appears to contradict remarks made earlier by New York Gov. Kathy Hochul – whose former aide was charged with acting as an agent for the Chinese government – and the State Department, which claimed the Chinese envoy had left his position.
Hours later, the consulate published a press release on its website with photos showing Huang busy at work on Tuesday. In the photos, Huang was seen visiting the Philadelphia home of a former American pilot who helped China to fight Japan during World War II.
At a fundraising event on Thursday evening, Huang, who has been the consul general since December 2018, indicated that he would be leaving his position soon, citing the length of his term and the retirement age for Chinese government officials.
“I’ve been here six years already. I surpassed my term, which used to be three to four years. I’ve surpassed my (retirement) age. In China, government officials retire at 60,” the 61-year-old told the audience at the China Institute Blue Cloud Gala.
“I think it’s time for me to go home and start a new life,” Huang said.
An official at the Chinese embassy in Washington confirmed to CNN that Huang’s term is coming to an end, but did not offer a specific date for his departure. The official said plans for Huang’s departure had been set in motion long ago and have nothing to do with the recent indictment against Linda Sun.
This latest Chinese explanation, however, while confirming Huang remains in his post for now, does at least partially echo the US State Department’s previous response his term was coming to an end — albeit with a slightly different timeframe.
The envoy’s employment status was first thrown into the spotlight after Sun, a former aide to Hochul and her predecessor Gov. Andrew Cuomo, was charged on Tuesday with secretly acting as an agent of the Chinese government.
Sun was charged with violating and conspiring to violate the Foreign Agents Registration Act, visa fraud, alien smuggling and conspiracy to launder money, according to an unsealed copy of the indictment.
Sun’s husband and co-defendant, Chris Hu, was also charged with money laundering conspiracy and conspiracy to commit bank fraud as well as misusing means of identification, prosecutors said.
Details contained within the indictment appear to match some publicly available information, including an interaction between Sun and Huang, the consul general.
For example, at the request of Chinese government representatives, Sun allegedly obtained an unauthorized proclamation from the New York Governor’s Office – a formal framed document that bears the state seal and the governor’s signature – to present to a Chinese official at an event celebrating the Lunar New Year in January 2023, prosecutors said in the indictment.
A photo posted on the website of China’s Foreign Ministry shows Sun presenting a framed New York State proclamation to Huang at the Lunar New Year reception of the Chinese consulate in New York on January 17, 2023.
US prosecutors say the Chinese government gave Sun lavish, expensive gifts in return for violating internal rules and state government protocols while she served as an aide to the two New York governors in a scheme that enriched her family to the tune of millions of dollars.
Among the gifts she received were at least four deliveries of Nanjing-style salted duck between 2021 and 2022, prepared by the personal chef of the Chinese official to whom she later presented the proclamation, according to the indictment. Other examples of gifts in the indictment included travel reimbursements, hotel rooms and event tickets.
Sun was born in Nanjing, a city in eastern China’s Jiangsu province, and moved to the US with her parents at a young age, according to the overseas Chinese affairs office of the Jiangsu provincial government.
A statement released by the office in 2017 said Sun had led two to three American delegations to visit China every year since 2012, when she started to work for Gov. Cuomo.
Sun has denied the allegations. Defense attorney Seth DuCharme addressed reporters outside court Tuesday, saying “we have a lot of confidence in our case.”
“A lot of the allegations in this indictment are frankly perplexing, overly inflammatory,” he said. “As you heard in court today, we are looking forward to our day in court. The defendants are exercising their right to a speedy trial as soon as they can; we have a lot of confidence in Chris and in Linda.”
An attorney for Sun, Jarrod Schaeffer, told CNN the charges “are inflammatory and appear to be the product of an overly aggressive prosecution.”
“We are also troubled by aspects of the government’s investigation. As we said today in court, our client is eager … to defend against these accusations in the proper forum – a court of law,” Schaeffer said.
The case has threatened to spiral into a diplomatic row between Washington and Beijing, in part because of contradicting statements about the fate of China’s top diplomat in New York.
At a news conference earlier Wednesday, Hochul said she spoke by phone at the request of Secretary of State Antony Blinken to a high-ranking State Department official about Huang’s status.
“I had conveyed my desire to have the consul general from the People’s Republic of China in the New York mission expelled,” she said. “And I’ve been informed that the consul general is no longer in the New York mission.”
State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller later clarified that Huang “was not expelled.”

“Our understanding is that the consul general reached the end of a regular scheduled rotation in August, and so rotated out of the position, but was not expelled,” Miller said.
“But of course, when it comes to the status of particular employees of a foreign mission, I would refer you to the foreign country to speak to it. But there was no expulsion action,” he added.
In a statement Wednesday, China’s embassy in Washington said reports saying Huang was expelled were “completely inconsistent with the facts” and “made malicious speculations.”
Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the embassy, said Chinese diplomats in the US “have never and will not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries.”
“Their normal performance of duties in the US should not be interfered with or disrupted in any way. We firmly oppose relevant parties and the media fabricating and spreading false information,” Liu added.
China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was unaware of the aide accused of working for China.
“I am not aware of the situation you mentioned,” spokesperson Mao Ning said at a regular news briefing Monday, adding, “I will not comment on the domestic cases in the United States, but we oppose malicious associations and slander against China.”"

Kathy Hochul’s comments Wednesday that China’s consul general in New York was removed from his position after her former aide was charged with acting as an agent for the Chinese government, the US State Department said later that “there was no expulsion action.”
The diplomat had reached the end of their regularly scheduled rotation and left at the end of August, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Wednesday at a briefing.
However, a spokesperson for the Chinese Consulate General in New York said diplomat Huang Ping is “performing his duties as usual,” according to a statement to CNN Wednesday, seemingly conflicting with the comments made by Hochul and the State Department.
At a news conference earlier Wednesday, Hochul said she was on the phone with a high-ranking State Department official at the request of Antony Blinken about Huang Ping’s status. Hochul spoke with Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell, Miller said.
Hochul said during the phone call she “conveyed my desire to have the consul general from the People’s Republic of China at the New York Mission expelled, and I’ve been informed that the consul general is no longer in the New York Mission.”
When asked to clarify if the consul general was expelled, Hochul responded, “I know that they’re no longer in their position. That’s all I know.”
Miller said there was no expulsion action: “The consul general was not expelled. Our understanding is that the consul general reached the end of a regularly scheduled rotation in August, and so rotated out of the position, but was not expelled.”
“But, of course, when it comes to the status of particular employees of a foreign mission, I would refer you to the foreign country to speak to it, but there was no expulsion action,” Miller said.
“That said, foreign interference, including attempts to influence through covert activities that should be registered under the Foreign Agents Registration Act and are not registered, are things that we take very seriously, as you saw by the action the Department of Justice took yesterday,” Miller added.
When asked about the consul general’s involvement, Hochul said, “I believe that the Chinese government, with their behavior, in doing this and working with Linda Sun, is not acceptable – it is a statement by us that we’re not tolerating this. Anybody representing that government needs to move on. That was what we made clear.”
Hochul’s comments came after Sun, a former deputy chief of staff to Hochul and an aide to then-Gov. Andrew Cuomo, was charged with violating and conspiring to violate the Foreign Agents Registrations Act, visa fraud, alien smuggling and money laundering conspiracy, according to an unsealed copy of the indictment.

Her husband and co-defendant, Chris Hu, was also charged with money laundering conspiracy and conspiracy to commit bank fraud as well as misusing means of identification, federal prosecutors said Tuesday.
Sun and Hu both pleaded not guilty to all charges in federal court Tuesday afternoon. Sun’s bond is set at $1.5 million and her husband’s is set at $500,000.
Hochul said Wednesday she’s been helping the Department of Justice for months and will continue to work with them.
She called Sun’s actions an “absolute betrayal of the trust of two administrations in state government,” and went as far as “even forging my signature on documents.”
Hochul said the FBI “asked her one question” – to verify whether something was her signature.
Hochul said Sun was a “mid-level aide” and said she didn’t have contact with her “very often” and had “no real role in my policies” as governor.
The governor said she feels “confident in our vetting process right now.”
“We have very high levels of background checks,” Hochul said.
The governor cautioned she wasn’t able to provide detailed information about the investigation into Sun: “There’s an ongoing investigation, there’ll be court proceedings, maybe a trial – all this will be revealed but it’s not information I can divulge at this time,” she said.
Sun acted as “an undisclosed agent of the Chinese government while her husband, Hu, facilitated the transfer of millions of dollars in kickbacks for personal gain,” prosecutors said in a news release.
While working for state government, Sun influenced the messaging of high-level state officials regarding issues of importance to China, blocked Taiwanese government representatives from access to the officials, and obtained official New York State proclamations for Chinese government representatives without authorization, prosecutors alleged in the indictment.
The couple’s arrest comes at a time when US-China relations remain fraught over a host of frictions including Beijing’s aggressions in the South China Sea and toward Taiwan, and US trade controls targeting China.
CNN has reached out to the US State Department and the Chinese Embassy in Washington for comment.

D7UG9T8SG5_FL86UZFMGQ0QW77,"More than 10,000 US hotel workers strike during Labor Day weekend",Chris Isidore,"4 minute read Updated 12:36 PM EDT, Sun September 1, 2024",20230902,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/01/business/thousands-of-us-hotel-workers-strike-as-contract-negotiations-stall/,"More than 10,000 hotel workers at 24 hotels stretching from Boston to the West Coast to Hawaii went on strike early Sunday morning, disrupting travel during a busy Labor Day weekend.
The hotels are reportedly still open but guests will deal with a skeleton staff unable to provide full services. UNITE HERE, the union representing the striking workers, says they are striking not just for better pay but also better working conditions, including the return of automatic daily room cleaning that many hotels dropped during the pandemic.
“We’re on strike because the hotel industry has gotten off track,” Gwen Mills, International President of UNITE HERE, said in a statement Sunday morning. “During Covid, everyone suffered, but now the hotel industry is making record profits while workers and guests are left behind. Too many hotels still haven’t restored standard services that guests deserve. Workers aren’t making enough to support their families. Many can no longer afford to live in the cities that they welcome guests to.”
Aissata Seck, a banquet food server who has worked at Hilton Park Plaza in Boston for 18 years, said her rent has increased from $1,900 to $2,900 in the last five years. “My pay only covers my rent,” she told CNN. She is now working as an Uber driver to make ends meet.
Apple Ratanabunsrithang, a cook at Hilton Union Square in San Francisco, told CNN’s Gloria Pazmino that she “has to work two jobs to survive in the city,” and while wages are important, so is keeping health care benefits. “The majority of people that work and are in the union are long established — they’ve worked 10, 20, 30 years. So their whole life is working at a hotel, which is physical work, so the health care is very important,” she said.
Mills told CNN that the lack of daily room cleaning not only costs jobs for her union’s members — reducing housekeeping employment by nearly 40% — but it also increases a cleaning staff’s workload, since it requires tending to rooms that haven’t been cleaned for a number of days.
The hotel chains facing striking workers include Hilton, Hyatt and Marriott. The hotels have 23,000 rooms between them in the cities of Boston, San Diego, San Francisco, San Jose, Seattle, as well as Honolulu and Kauai in Hawaii, and Greenwich, Connecticut, according to the union.
The union is threatening to possibly expand the strike to as many as 65 hotels in 12 different cities, possibly adding hotels in Baltimore, Oakland, California, as well as Providence, Rhode Island, and New Haven, Connecticut. Spokespeople for Hilton and Hyatt told CNN on Friday they are committed to reaching deals with the union, but they also will continue to serve customers during any work stoppage.
Hyatt said in a statement it is disappointed by the union’s decision to strike. “We look forward to continuing to negotiate fair contracts and recognize the contributions of Hyatt employees,” said Michael D’Angelo, head of labor relations at Hyatt.
Last year, the 15,000 members of the same union went on strike during the Fourth of July holiday weekend at 65 hotels in Los Angeles and Orange counties in Southern California. They returned to work a few days later but staged a series of rolling strikes in the months that followed, sometimes tied to major tourist periods, such as the weekend of Taylor Swift concerts in Los Angeles.
These strikes are set to end after three days, as occurred in Los Angeles’ work stoppage. The union has yet to determine whether or not they will return on a rolling basis as they did in Southern California last year, Mills told CNN on Friday ahead of the strike deadline. A return of rolling strikes has not been ruled out.
The union eventually reached deals for all but three of the hotels they had targeted, but those agreements weren’t reached until earlier this year.
This has been a particularly busy Labor Day weekend for travel with AAA expecting a 9% increase in domestic travel compared to last year and the Transportation Security Administration expecting record passenger screenings at US airports.

D8LLQZV5YJ_9HRTAYLC4UYVAHH,"Harris campaign has agreed to debate rules, including muted mics","By MJ Lee, CNN","4 minute read Updated 10:55 PM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/04/politics/harris-trump-abc-debate-rules-microphones/,"Kamala Harris’ campaign has accepted the terms of next week’s presidential debate with former President Donald Trump, including the fact that the candidates’ microphones will be muted when it is not their turn to speak, according to a person familiar with the debate negotiations.
However, in a letter to ABC News Wednesday afternoon agreeing to the rules, the Harris campaign again laid out their objections to the muted mics condition, insisting that they believe the vice president will be “disadvantaged” by the format.
“Vice President Harris, a former prosecutor, will be fundamentally disadvantaged by this format, which will serve to shield Donald Trump from direct exchanges with the Vice President. We suspect this is the primary reason for his campaign’s insistence on muted microphones,” the letter from the Harris campaign to the network, shared in part with CNN, said.
ABC News officially announced the rules later Wednesday, noting that both candidates had agreed to the format.

The network, according to the source familiar, has offered assurances to the Harris campaign that if there is significant cross talk between Harris and Trump, it may choose to turn on the mics so that the public can understand what is happening, the moderator would discourage either candidate from interrupting constantly and the moderator would also work to explain to viewers what is being said.
Pool reporters, who can report on what they hear both sides saying, will also be in the room, the source added.
“Beyond the debate rules published today, which were mutually agreed upon by two campaigns on May 15th, we have made no other agreements,” an ABC News spokesperson told CNN.
The campaign wrote in its letter that it was accepting the terms so as not to risk Trump pulling out of the debate.
“Notwithstanding our concerns, we understand that Donald Trump is a risk to skip the debate altogether, as he has threatened to do previously, if we do not accede to his preferred format,” the campaign said. “We do not want to jeopardize the debate. For this reason, we accept the full set of rules proposed by ABC, including muted microphones.”
The former president on Wednesday said he was going to “let her talk” when asked about the upcoming debate with Harris.
“You know when I had Biden, you and I had the same discussion, and I let him talk. I’m going to let her talk,” Trump said to Fox News host Sean Hannity during a town hall in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.
“It depends a lot on ABC, will they be fair or not?” Trump said. “I hope they will be fair.”
Trump, according to ABC News, won a virtual coin flip held earlier in the week to determine podium placement and order of closing statements during the debate. Trump chose to offer the last closing statement, and Harris chose the right podium position on screen.
The Trump campaign had previously accepted the rules governing the September 10 matchup.
The former president addressed the issue of microphones during an event in Virginia last week, saying: “We agreed to the same rules, I don’t know, doesn’t matter to me, I’d rather have it probably on, but the agreement was that it would be the same as it was last time.”
But in a post on his Truth Social platform the next day, Trump added, “The Rules will be the same as the last CNN Debate, which seemed to work out well for everyone except, perhaps, Crooked Joe Biden.”
ABC’s rules, first shared with the campaigns last month, largely mirror the format of CNN’s presidential debate in June between Trump and President Joe Biden, during which the candidates’ microphones were muted as their opponent spoke. It was a rule that the Biden campaign had insisted on but something the Harris campaign had sought to change after she became a presidential candidate.
The network’s rules also state that there will be no audience, the candidates will not be permitted to have written notes, no staff can visit them during the two commercial breaks and the candidates cannot ask questions of one another.

DBZJB9Y4HC_3XUX5ONZYQGJ3O6,Republican-led states file new lawsuit to block Biden’s student loan forgiveness plans,"By Katie Lobosco, CNN","3 minute read Updated 2:07 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/03/politics/student-loan-forgiveness-lawsuit-biden/,"A group of seven Republican-led states filed a fresh lawsuit Tuesday, seeking to block new student loan forgiveness plans that the Biden administration expected to start rolling out this fall.
The lawsuit marks yet another legal challenge to President Joe Biden’s student loan policies and could potentially tie up his latest effort to deliver debt relief before the November election.
Currently, Biden’s student loan repayment plan known as SAVE (Saving on a Valuable Education) is blocked while litigation plays out at the 8th US Circuit Court of Appeals. And the president’s sweeping, one-time student loan forgiveness program was knocked down by the Supreme Court last year.
At issue in the latest lawsuit is a set of proposals that the Department of Education started drafting soon after the Supreme Court rejected the Biden administration’s program. The new plans are meant to deliver narrower student loan forgiveness that could withstand legal challenges.
One of the provisions would cancel accumulated interest for people with federal student loan balances bigger than what they originally borrowed. The full amount of interest would be canceled for borrowers whose annual income is $120,000 or less. Others could receive up to $20,000 in debt relief.
About 23 million people would benefit from the interest cancellation under the proposed rule, according to the Department of Education. In an email sent to borrowers in August, the department said it would start delivering this debt relief in the fall.
The cost of the interest cancellation is estimated to total $73 billion.
The set of student loan relief proposals have gone through a lengthy rulemaking process but have yet to be finalized.
The lawsuit claims that the plaintiffs have obtained documents showing the Department of Education intends to provide some of the student debt relief as early as this week – and that this would violate a statute prohibiting the education secretary from implementing a rule sooner than 60 days after its publication.
On Thursday, Judge J. Randal Hall, who is overseeing the case in the US District Court for the Southern District of Georgia, sided with the states and temporarily blocked the Department of Education from using the new rule to cancel student loan debt or interest for 14 days, though he could extend the order. The judge also set an initial hearing on the matter for September 18.
Hall wrote in his order that the states have a “substantial likelihood of success on the merits.”
“This is especially true in light of the recent rulings across the country striking down similar federal student loan forgiveness plans,” he wrote.
“We successfully halted their first two illegal student loan cancellation schemes; I have no doubt we will secure yet another win to block the third one,” Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, who is leading the lawsuit, said in a statement on Tuesday.
The Department of Education declined to comment on pending litigation.
Even though Biden’s sweeping student loan forgiveness got knocked down by the Supreme Court, his administration has still canceled more student loan debt than under any other president – mostly by using existing programs. His administration has made it easier for certain groups of borrowers – such as public-sector workers, including teachers; disabled borrowers; and people who were defrauded by for-profit colleges – to qualify for student loan debt forgiveness.
So far, nearly 4.8 million people have seen their federal student debt canceled under Biden, totaling $169 billion.

DIFHC6JYMN_02TG9HPZMOHI3XY,This airport was once the gateway to Europe. Now no one’s heard of it,"By Will Noble, CNN","11 minute read Updated 9:50 AM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/travel/croydon-airport-london-aerodrome-gateway/,"The words “Croydon” and “destination” are not what you’d call soulmates. “I’m certain that of all the places I’ve visited,” writes Tom Chesshyre in “To Hull and Back,” a travelog that sets out to visit the lesser-appreciated parts of Britain, “I’m least likely to return to Croydon.”
The south London town is widely mocked for its none-too-idyllic high-rise skyline, a direct product of a megalomania of office-building between the late 1950s and early 1970s.
True, there’s a small hotel district in the east of the town, flagged by glowing signs for Leonardo and Hampton by Hilton. But it’s unlikely guests are planning a sightseeing tour of Croydon courtesy of one of the lime green trams snaking through the town. They invariably have an early morning flight to catch from Gatwick Airport, which lies just 16 miles southwest of Croydon. It’s far cheaper to stay here than to get an airport hotel.
Gatwick Airport, though, wasn’t always around. Just over a mile and a half southwest of Croydon’s modern hotels lies a Neoclassical hotel at the side of the busy Purley Way road.
The bar is usually propped up with sapped business people, but it was once populated with pilots with nicknames like “Dizzy” and Scruffy “the Undertaker” Robinson. They swigged beers and swapped stories about dense fog and near-misses, while their own framed caricatures hung behind the bar. This was – indeed, still is –  the Aerodrome Hotel, the first purpose-built airport hotel in the world.
And next to it stood Britain’s first international airport.
“My brother and myself went into my parents’ bedroom with its big brass bedstead and my father took us to the window and we saw this silver Zeppelin, lit up by searchlights, with the bursts of anti-aircraft shells exploding around it.”
This is the recollection of David Lean, who director of “Brief Encounter” and “Lawrence of Arabia,” but who was at the time a frightened young boy living in Croydon.
While the thought of London being bombed conjures up images of a smoke-shrouded St. Paul’s Cathedral in the Blitz, London and its surrounds were already under attack during World War I. Croydon was a target, and following a particularly devastating raid in 1915, a plot of land to the southwest of the town was requisitioned under the Defence of the Realm Act, and turned into Beddington Aerodrome.
From here, Sopwith Camels and Bristol Fighters sortied into the night sky, attempting to bring down the inflatable German “baby killers.”
Soon though, war came to an end, and it looked as though Croydon’s tenure as an airbase would too.
But then something happened. Hounslow Heath Aerodrome – which had technically operated Britain’s first international flights – was requisitioned by the War Office. Beddington joined up with the neighboring airfield at Waddon, which’d briefly been used to test new aircraft. Together they became Croydon Aerodrome.
Croydon 1.0 was hardly in the league of Singapore’s Changi International.
It was essentially a collection of cobbled-together wooden buildings and old army huts. The control tower was another hut, this one on stilts accessed by a ladder. Inside it, one visiting journalist found “magicians playing about with little levers and handles.”
The customs house was a glorified barn with signs tacked up above two doors: “British” and “Non-British.”
Imperial Airways’ first PR man, Robert Brenard, said the whole scene “reminded one forcibly of a Wild West township.”
Sheep had to be shooed off the runway. With no radar to speak of, pilots swooped low over train stations to glimpse the sign on the platform and figure out where they were.
One pilot claimed that when looking to land, he sniffed the air; if his nostrils picked up the ripe aroma of Beddington Sewage Works, he knew he was almost home. It’s unclear if he was joking.
The struggle to attract passengers was real. Flying in the early 1920s was an especially expensive affair, and many were anxious about it too – not surprising given how frequent accidents were.
As a forerunner to the deals offered by airlines today, there were special season tickets to Paris, and Easter holiday discounts. These had little effect.
The British government didn’t exactly help matters. “Civil aviation must fly by itself,” said Winston Churchill, who was secretary of state for air between 1919 and 1921. “The government cannot possibly hold it up in the air.” Churchill didn’t mention that he himself had taken flying lessons at Beddington, crashed and very nearly died.
While countries like France, the Netherlands and Germany enjoyed generous subsidies from their respective governments – and already had nascent versions of Air France, KLM and Lufthansa – the Brits were left to fend for themselves.
This could sometimes lead to some embarrassing situations. In “The Seven Skies: A Study of B.O.A.C. and Its Forerunners Since 1919,” John Pudney mentions an episode in which airline staff were ordered to pretend to be passengers during a flight to Germany. The flight would have otherwise been totally empty, save a renowned American lecturer, who the Brits didn’t want to embarrass themselves in front of.

Gradually, the tide turned and the government realized air travel wasn’t going away. In 1924, Britain’s first national airline, Imperial Airways, was formed. A race was set up between an Argosy airliner, the “City of Glasgow,” and the “Flying Scotsman” steam train, between London and Edinburgh. As it transpired, the “City of Glasgow” only pipped the train by 15 minutes, but there was now little doubt: flying would become the superior mode of transport.
Things gradually grew more sophisticated, destinations more ambitious. Harry Beck, who’d designed the iconic “circuit board” London Underground map, was commissioned to come up with a similar-style map flaunting Imperial Airways’ routes. Instead of Goodge Street, Dollis Hill, Ladbroke Grove and Camden Town, the “lines” led to Gaza, Delhi, Luxor and Cape Town.
Flights, though, were anything but direct. The “Kangaroo” route from Croydon to Charleville in Australia involved 28 stops – plus a train between Paris and Brindisi for good measure. On the plus side, passengers got to see so much more of the world when they traveled.
Slowly but steadily, passenger confidence (and numbers) grew. In 1927, 92-year-old Elizabeth Reeves, dressed, as the “Evening Standard” newspaper described her, in “Victorian period” clothes, took her first flight, becoming surely the oldest person at that time to ascend into the heavens, and come back down again. “I really don’t feel at all afraid,” Reeves smiled as she stepped onto the plane at Croydon, “but I had two small nips of whisky before I left home.”
While the birth of Imperial Airways had been a boon to British air travel, what turned it into a shining beacon was Croydon’s stunning Neoclassical airport complex, opened in January 1928.
Here was the first purpose-built air traffic control tower, departure lounge and airport shops. Walking in through the doors, passengers were greeted by an octagonal clock showing details of flights and departures.
A board on the wall detailed what the weather was doing in different corners of the globe. You could even buy French newspapers.
The Aerodrome Hotel opened next door at the same time, offering French-language menus. All of a sudden, Croydon was the height of sophistication.
Though you could fly from Croydon to almost anywhere, its flagship flight was Imperial Airways’ Silver Wing service, which departed from Croydon to Paris Le Bourget daily at 12.30 p.m., and from 1930 were flown on the majestic Handley Page HP-42s.
As these planes leveled out, white-jacketed stewards offered a choice of four Champagnes and 10 cocktails, and a six-course meal served on blue and white china, with metal cutlery, real glasses and damask tablecloths. The food had been sourced from Croydon’s Surrey Street market that morning.
Some of Croydon’s passengers still preferred to bring their own, as was the case with eccentric millionaire Nubar Gulbenkian, who had his valet prepare dishes of game consommé on board.
Croydon might not have had all the creature comforts of modern-day air travel, but the interwar years were undeniably a golden era.
It’s true that passengers had to go through the ordeal of being individually weighed.
It’s also true that the seats weren’t as comfortable as though on today’s airliners, made as they were from wicker.
The HP-42s pootled along at what we’d consider a snail’s pace (95 miles-per-hour top whack). Then again, from entering the airport, it took as little as 10 minutes to board your flight.
If the cabin got stuffy, you could open a window and feel the breeze in your hair. As planes flew low back then, you often had a scenic view out of the window.
In-flight movies didn’t come as standard of course, although Croydon did screen the first full-length in-flight movie. The year was 1925, and the film was “The Lost World,” based on Arthur Conan Doyle’s sci-fi dinosaur fiction. The pilot thoughtfully steered through dense clouds to darken the cabin.
As for the Aerodrome Hotel, it was a hit, not just with overnight guests, but with day-trippers too.
“It must be particularly emphasized,” reads the hotel’s literature from the time, “that the Aerodrome Hotel is not a mere terminus hotel, but is used frequently as a holiday resort and sightseeing base by tourists and motorists.”
Between 1932 and 1933, almost 70,000 took advantage of the hotel’s bar, restaurant and rooftop viewing platform, from which they could watch planes take off and land.
Others were happy to watch the wealthy female passengers making their way across the airport apron, while commenting on their choice of clothes.
Croydon became not just a destination, but the destination.
Celebrities – including Babe Ruth, Fred Astaire, John F. Kennedy, and Hollywood couple Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks – came.
Charlie Chaplin was familiar with Croydon too. Landing here in 1921, he was “kidnapped” by an overzealous cinema owner, who’d put on a fake mustache, pretended to be Chaplin’s chauffeur, and instead of driving him to the Savoy, had taken him to his picture house in the London district of Clapham.
In 1935, Agatha Christie published the Hercule Poirot novel “Death in the Clouds,” in which a woman is found murdered on a flight as it comes into land at Croydon.
Croydon had become part of popular culture.

Though the 1928 airport complex was a big step up from the original aerodrome, Croydon was still blighted by problems.
It was a distance from central London, and without its own railway station. Worse was the fog – thick and tenacious, thanks to Croydon’s location at the foot of the Surrey North Downs.
December 9, 1936, witnessed the biggest disaster ever to happen at Croydon, when a KLM airliner attempting to take off in the fog crash-landed into a house soon after, killing more than a dozen passengers and crew. Among them was a former prime minister of Sweden, and Juan de la Cierva, inventor of the autogyro.
Tragedies like this certainly didn’t help Croydon’s reputation, but something else would prove the coup de grâce.
Just as World War I had breathed unlikely life into Croydon Airport, World War II more or less took it away. The RAF took over, and civilian flights stopped. The airport was damaged by bombing, and lost many of its personnel in conflict too.
Though Croydon reopened after the war, in 1946, Heathrow took the reins as the country’s premier international airport. Croydon’s incredible story was coming to an end.
While the Aerodrome Hotel remains, so too does a large chunk of the Neoclassical airport, now a business center known as Airport House.
The closest you’ll get to traveling to Pakistan from here today is a chicken karahi from the Imperial Lounge restaurant, nestled in one corner of the ground floor. And yet, thanks to its remarkable preservation, you can still get a real sense of the airport in its heyday – particularly on its monthly open days.
Here, tour guides will lead you on fascinating tours taking in the departure lounge, its original mezzanine and skylight still intact; wicker chairs on which passengers were once whisked to far-flung lands; vintage booklets providing “Hints for Lady Passengers” (”Do not use much powder during the flight, as the temperature varies a good deal’).
It’s quite something to think that nearly two million passengers have bustled through this place.
Out the front of Airport House is a plinth-mounted de Havilland DH.114 Heron – frozen in mid-flight. It’s the same model of plane in which Geoffrey Last (talk about nominative determinism) flew Croydon’s final flight back in 1959. Such was the sense of loss from Croydonians, that as they watched the plane vanish into the skies, they set light to an effigy of the minister of transport and civil aviation. Up in the old control tower – also in fantastically good condition – meanwhile, you will find a framed poem by Ken Steel, “The Lost Airport.” It concludes:
Alas those happy times have passed and gone.
No more the neon beams its welcome light.
Croydon is dead, her halcyon days are done.
No more her klaxon stirs the summer night.
Croydon is dead, but though her sun has set,
In airmen’s hearts her fame is living yet.
Croydon, though, is far from dead. The airport may not be operating anymore, but just as it was back in the 1920s and ‘30s, it remains an attraction in its own right – still bringing in people from near and far, and in doing so, making Croydon the unlikeliest of destinations.
Croydon Airport Visitor Centre opens for public tours on the first Sunday of every month. Book ahead, as they often sell out.

Harris’ comments marked the first time she lent her voice to the dispute over the proposed sale of US Steel to Nippon Steel, Japan’s biggest steelmaker.
“The president mentioned it: US Steel is a historic American company, and it is vital for our nation to maintain strong American steel companies,” Harris said at the Labor Day event after being introduced by Joe Biden. “And I couldn’t agree more with President Biden, US Steel should remain American owned and American operated.”
The White House has previously opposed the controversial deal, with Biden saying it is “important that we maintain strong American steel companies powered by American steel workers.” Biden outlined his position during a March event in Pittsburgh, nicknamed “Steel City,” where he visited the headquarters of the United Steelworkers and called for higher tariffs to protect American manufacturing.
One week prior, when Biden hosted Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida for a state visit, Kishida was asked by a reporter whether he saw US politics influencing the $14 billion takeover bid. Kishida said, “Japan believes that appropriate procedures based on law is being implemented by the US government” to evaluate the deal.
Biden, asked the same question, said simply that he stands with both American workers and American allies overseas, without elaborating on his further involvement.
For the deal to close, it needs approval from both the Justice Department, which enforces antitrust laws, and the normally low-profile but powerful Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which evaluates takeovers on national security grounds. That committee comprises members of Biden’s cabinet, including the secretaries of treasury, commerce, defense, state, homeland security and the attorney general.
It remains unclear to what extent Biden or Harris, in their official capacity, will work to block the deal on national security grounds in the treasury-led review.
Representatives for US Steel and Nippon Steel declined to comment on whether the companies had briefed Harris on the deal.
In August 2023, US Steel rejected a takeover bid by Ohio-based Cleveland Cliffs to buy the company for $7.3 billion. After months evaluating alternate suitors, US Steel agreed to sell to Japan’s largest steelmaker for more than twice what Cleveland Cliffs had proposed paying. US Steel shareholders overwhelmingly voted in support of the Nippon deal.
Under the current terms of the deal, US Steel would retain its name and Pittsburgh headquarters. Nippon has also pledged an additional $1.3 billion to refurbish two outdated mills in Pennsylvania and Indiana.
In a statement to CNN, US Steel’s chief executive officer said those investments go well beyond what the company would be able to do on its own.
“The bottom line is these are investments in the future of American steelmaking and the employees, families, and communities that rely on it,” CEO David Burritt told CNN. “US Steel will be a much stronger company as a result of the transaction and these investments – the entire American steel industry will be stronger and more globally competitive, too.”

The beluga, nicknamed Hvaldimir, rose to fame in 2019 after being spotted wearing a specially-made harness with mounts for a camera, sparking claims that the animal may have been trained by the Russian military.
Two Norwegian animal rights groups alleged on Wednesday that the whale was “shot to death” after Hvaldimir was found dead over the weekend in southern Norway.
OneWhale and NOAH are calling for a criminal investigation “based on compelling evidence that the whale was killed by gunshot wounds,” OneWhale, which describes itself as a “nonprofit committed to protecting Hvaldimir and relocating him to a wild population of belugas,” wrote in an Instagram post.
It added that “several veterinarians, biologists, and ballistics experts have reviewed [the] evidence of Hvaldimir’s injuries, determining that the whale’s death was the result of a criminal act.”
The post included pictures of what appeared to be holes and streaks of blood on the lifeless body of the whale. CNN is unable to independently verify their claim that the whale was shot.
The organizations filed a police report to the Sandnes Police District and the Norwegian National Authority for Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime.
The Southwestern Police District confirmed to CNN on Wednesday that it has received a request to investigate the death of Hvaldimir, though the unit has not yet determined whether it will open a formal inquiry.
“I don’t think we’ve had a case like this before,” said Southwestern Police District Superintendent Victor Fenne-jensen, who declined to comment on whether his department had investigated rumors that the whale was a Russian spy.
He added, Hvaldimir was “kind of a celebrity.”
However, Marine Mind, another non-profit that advocates for protecting marine life, has called the public to “refrain from speculation” until the country’s Veterinary Institute has finished its own investigation.
It was Marine Mind that found Hvaldimir’s body in the bay. “When we found Hvaldimir on Saturday, it was not possible to immediately determine the cause of death, and therefore it is important to refrain from speculation until the institute has completed its work,” Marine Mind posted to its Facebook page on Wednesday.

Before Hvaldimir’s death, OneWhale and NOAH had been collaborating to relocate him to a safer area in northern Norway, and had obtained permits from the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries. CNN has reached out to the Norwegian Ministry of Climate and Environment for comment.
Norwegian public broadcaster NRK reported that his body was found floating at the Risavika Bay in southern Norway Saturday by a father and son who were fishing, according to the Associated Press (AP).
The beluga, named by combining the Norwegian word for whale — hval — and the first name of Russian President Vladimir Putin, was lifted out of the water with a crane and taken to a nearby harbor where experts for experts to examine, AP reported.
Marine biologist Sebastian Strand told NRK Hvaldimir’s cause of death was not immediately clear and that no major external injuries were visible on the animal, the AP reported.
Back in 2019, experts told CNN that Hvaldimir was a trained animal, and evidence suggested that the whale had come from Russia.
Jorgen Ree Wiig, a marine biologist at Norway’s Directorate of Fisheries, told CNN that the Hvaldimir’s harness appeared “specially made” and had “mounts for GoPro cameras on each side of it.”
That the harness clips read “Equipment St. Petersburg” only contributed to the popular theory that he came from Murmansk, Russia, and was trained by the Russian navy."

The Norwegian public broadcaster NRK reported that the whale carcass was found floating at the Risavika Bay in southern Norway Saturday by a father and son who were fishing.
The beluga, named by combining the Norwegian word for whale — hval — and Russian President Putin’s first name Vladimir, was lifted out of the water with a crane and taken to a nearby harbor where experts will examine it.
“Unfortunately, we found Hvaldimir floating in the sea. He has passed away but it’s not immediately clear what the cause of death is,” marine biologist Sebastian Strand told NRK, adding that no major external injuries were visible on the animal.
Strand, who has monitored Hvaldimir’s adventures for the past three years on behalf of the Norway-based Marine Mind non-profit organization, said he was deeply affected by the whale’s sudden death.
“It’s absolutely horrible,” Strand said. “He was apparently in good condition as of (Friday). So we just have to figure out what might have happened here.”
The 4.2-meter (14-foot) long and 1,225-kilogram (2,700-pound) whale was first spotted by fishermen near the northern island of Ingøya, not far from the Arctic city of Hammerfest, in April 2019 wearing a harness and what appeared to be a mount for a small camera and a buckle marked with text “Equipment St. Petersburg.”
That sparked allegations that the beluga was “a spy whale.” Experts said the Russian navy is known to have trained whales for military purposes.
Over the years, the beluga was seen in several Norwegian coastal towns and it quickly became clear that he was very tame and enjoyed playing with people, NRK said.
NGO Marine Mind said on its site that Hvaldimir was very interested in people and responded to hand signals.
“Based on these observations, it appeared as if Hvaldimir arrived in Norway by crossing over from Russian waters, where it is presumed he was held in captivity,” it said.
Norwegian media have speculated whether Hvaldimir could have been used as “a therapy whale” of some sort in Russia."
DP6H5DK2J4_VG5EZ5TM335QQ46,"Italy luxury yacht victims died of ‘dry drowning,’ first autopsies show","By Barbie Latza Nadeau and Radina Gigova, CNN","3 minute read Updated 4:01 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/05/europe/italy-luxury-yacht-victims-autopsies-intl/,"Initial autopsies of four of the seven victims who died when a superyacht sank in a storm in Italy last month show they died of “dry drowning,” according to authorities.
The phenomenon, also known as “atypical drowning,” means they had no water in their lungs, tracheas or stomachs, said a spokesperson for the lawyer of the captain of the Bayesian, which went down off the coast of the Sicilian port of Porticello on August 19.
There is no medically accepted “dry drowning” condition — “dry drowning” or other terms such as secondary drowning or delayed drowning are sometimes used to describe patients whose condition worsened after a drowning rescue or who had very little water in the lungs. However, the American Red Cross and other health organizations have recommended against using the terms; people may experience health impacts after being in water but it’s not the same as drowning, it says.
The cause of death of the first four victims suggests that they had found an air bubble in the cabin in which five of the victims’ bodies were discovered, and had consumed all the oxygen before the air pocket turned toxic due to carbon dioxide, according to local media reports.
The autopsies of American lawyer Chris Morvillo, his wife Neda Morvillo, Morgan Stanley banker Jonathan Bloomer and his wife Anne Elizabeth Judith Bloomer were carried out on Wednesday at the Forensic Medicine Institute of the Palermo Polyclinic hospital, officials said.
Autopsies on British tech titan Mike Lynch and his 18-year-old daughter are expected to be carried out on Friday.
No date has been set yet for the autopsy of Recaldo Thomas, the ship’s onboard chef – due to the difficulty reaching his family in Antigua.
All seven victims were scanned for injuries last Saturday, which found none had suffered broken bones or other physical injuries that might have contributed to their deaths.
The prosecutor investigating the case first suggested earlier in August the idea that the victims had been searching for an air pocket.
The autopsies are part of the criminal investigation into the ship’s captain James Cutfield, the ship’s machine engineer Tim Parker Eaton and sailor Matthew Griffith, who was on watch the night of the accident. None of the men is in Italy.
They are being investigated for “multiple manslaughter” and for causing a shipwreck, but authorities say this doesn’t mean they will be charged with any crimes. They were allowed to leave the country by the prosecutor in charge of the investigation.
The 56-meter yacht sank within 16 minutes of being struck by a downburst or tornado on the early morning of August 19. The ship will have to be raised for the investigation and to ensure that the 18,000 liters of fuel onboard do not leak into the sea around the port of Porticello near Palermo.
Bids have been sent out for the salvage, which will be paid for by the company of Lynch’s wife Angela Bacares, which owns the yacht.
Toxicology results on the seven victims are expected in the coming days. No alcohol or drug tests were carried out on any of the crew members, the prosecutor said in a press conference after all the victims’ bodies had been recovered.
Lynch and his business partner Stephen Chamberlain, who died after being struck by a car the day the Bayesian sank, had been acquitted of fraud charges in a US court in June 2024. The charges were related to the sale of their company Autonomy to Hewlett Packard, which has said it will not drop its civil lawsuit for $4 billion in damages now being heard in a UK court.

The students were waiting to enter the gate of a middle school in Tai’an city in Shandong province when the bus slammed into them after 7 a.m., state news agency Xinhua reported.
The bus, specially customized for transporting students, “lost control” when it drove into an intersection, the public security bureau in Dongping county said in a statement.
Five students and six parents were killed, it said. One of the injured was in critical condition while the others were stable, according to police.
The bus driver has been placed in police custody and the cause of the accident is being investigated, the statement said.
China has faced a spate of car-ramming and stabbing attacks targeting schoolchildren in recent years, as well as deadly road traffic accidents involving school buses.
In March, a car careened into a group of pupils in Dezhou, another city in Shandong, killing two people and leaving six others severely injured, state media reported at the time.
Later in the month, a bus carrying students collided with a dump truck in the city of Nantong in the eastern province of Jiangsu, killing one person and injuring eight others.
Last year, six people were killed and one injured in an early morning stabbing incident outside a kindergarten in southern Guangdong province. And a 2022 stabbing, also at a kindergarten, killed three and injured six in eastern Jiangxi province."
DTP07N920T_LVM0954HP7AA2HN,‘A very serious situation’: Volkswagen could close plants in Germany for the first time in history,"By Hanna Ziady, CNN","2 minute read Updated 2:11 PM EDT, Mon September 2, 2024",20240902,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/02/investing/volkswagen-factory-closure-germany/,"Volkswagen is weighing whether to close factories in Germany for the first time in its 87-year history as it moves to deepen cost cuts amid rising competition from China’s electric vehicle makers.
In a statement Monday, the German automaker, one of the world’s biggest car companies, said that it could not rule out plant closures its home country. Other measures to “future-proof” the company include trying to terminate an employment protection agreement with labor unions, which has been in place since 1994.
“The European automotive industry is in a very demanding and serious situation,” said Volkswagen Group CEO Oliver Blume. “The economic environment became even tougher, and new competitors are entering the European market. Germany in particular as a manufacturing location is falling further behind in terms of competitiveness.
Volkswagen, which embarked on a €10 billion ($11.1 billion) cost-cutting effort late last year, is losing market share in China, its single biggest market. In the first half of the year, deliveries to customers in that country slipped 7% on the same period in 2023. Group operating profit tumbled 11.4% to €10.1 billion ($11.2 billion).
The lackluster performance in China comes as the company loses out to local EV brands, notably BYD, which also pose an increasing threat to its business in Europe.
“Our main area of action is cost cutting,” Blume told analysts on an earnings call last month, citing planned reductions to factory, supply chain and labor expenses. “We have done all the organizational steps needed. And now it is about costs, costs and costs,” he added.

Volkswagen’s cost-cutting plans will face heavy resistance from labor representatives, which hold almost half the seats on the company’s supervisory board, the body that appoints executive managers.
IG Metall, one of Germany’s most powerful unions, on Monday blamed mismanagement for the firm’s shortcomings and vowed to fight to protect jobs.
“Today, the board presented an irresponsible plan that shakes the very foundations of Volkswagen, massively threatening jobs and locations,” IG Metall lead negotiator Thorsten Groeger said in a statement.
“This approach is not only short-sighted but also highly dangerous — it risks destroying the heart of Volkswagen… We will not tolerate plans that the company makes at the expense of the workforce.”
Volkswagen employs almost 683,000 workers worldwide, including some 295,000 in Germany, according to its most recent earnings report.
Thomas Schaefer, the CEO of Volkswagen passenger cars, said the company remains committed to Germany “as a business location.” He added that VW would initiate talks with employee representatives urgently to explore possibilities for “sustainably restructuring the brand.”
“The situation is extremely tense and cannot be resolved through simple cost-cutting measures,” Volkswagen said."

Adetshina, age 23, triumphed at the pageant held in Lagos on Saturday night. She will represent Nigeria in the Miss Universe competition in Mexico in November.
Last month, she quit the Miss South Africa contest after becoming the target of xenophobic online attacks and later accepted an invitation to compete in the Nigerian pageant.
Many South Africans had questioned her eligibility to participate in their country’s contest after reports emerged that she was born to a Nigerian father and a South African mother with Mozambican roots.
Organizers of Miss Universe Nigeria said at the time that Adetshina’s invitation was “an opportunity to represent her father’s native land on an international stage.” They added that her “journey in pageantry is far from over.”

Writing on Instagram after her victory, Adetshina said it was “a dream come true,” describing the crown as “not just a symbol of beauty” but “a call to action” for a united Africa.
“As I accept this honor, I want to share a vision that burns deeply within me, a vision of African unity and peaceful coexistence!” she wrote in a statement on her Instagram page.
“Let’s break down the barriers that divide us. Let’s foster a continent where every African can move freely without prejudice, pursue their dreams, and contribute to the growth and prosperity of our great continent,” the statement added.
South African authorities say they are working to clarify Adetshina’s citizenship status after the country’s Home Affairs department, which oversees immigration, said her mother may have committed identity fraud to obtain South African citizenship in 2001.
The department, however, exonerated Adetshina of any wrongdoing, saying she was just an infant at the time."
E2TSG8EWPR_1ZYJREIBU9O29RC,What we know about the couple killed at a nudist ranch in California,"By Nicole Chavez, CNN","4 minute read Updated 4:57 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/05/us/what-we-know-nudist-ranch-missing-couple/,"A husband and wife who settled at a nudist ranch nestled in a remote California canyon had been missing for days when a 911 call steered police to the house next door.
Their neighbor, Michael Royce Sparks, 62, has been charged with two counts of murder after police said he admitted to killing two people and human remains were found at his home. Authorities have confirmed the victims were the missing couple – Daniel Menard, 79, and his wife, Stephanie Menard, 73.
Since his arrest, Sparks has remained in custody and is expected to appear in court later this week. CNN has been unable to identify an attorney for Sparks or locate family members.
Redlands Police Chief Rachel Tolber said Tuesday she had never seen “this type of case” and it was “certainly concerning.”
As authorities search for a motive, here’s what we know about their deaths and the investigation so far:
The Menards lived in the Olive Dell Ranch resort in Southern California’s San Bernardino County, about 65 miles east of Los Angeles near the cities of Redlands and Colton. The 100-acre property has RVs and mobile homes where residents have lived for years. Others have visited for short-term stays, including during the resort’s annual 5k run.
Irene Engkraf, a neighbor of the Menards, told reporters the couple enjoyed playing poker, gathering with friends for karaoke and attending Bible study and church service on weekends.

“It felt so odd not having Stephanie sitting right next to me (at church) but I know God is with them, he’s with them wherever they are, and I can see them holding each other’s hands,” Engkraf said.
The couple was last seen at the home on August 24. The next day, Engkraf said she became worried when the Menards didn’t attend Sunday church service as usual. Their dog, a white Shih Tzu named Cuddles, was also missing.
She first saw the Menards’ car sitting “abandoned” down the road from their home, and later entered the couple’s home using a spare key but found no signs of them. Stephanie’s purse and both of the Menards’ phones were there and their bed was empty, Engkraf said.
Neighbor Tammie Wilkerson told CNN affiliate KCAL the Menards were a loving couple who took care of each other.
“Stephanie was a bit of a spit fire. She told you what she thought. She didn’t have any problem doing that and she took care of Dan so well,” Wilkerson said.
It wasn’t until several days had passed following the Menards’ disappearance that police received a tip from Sparks’ family, which prompted his arrest and a days-long search for evidence at his home.
A family member called 911 saying Sparks was involved in the Menards’ disappearance, adding he “had admitted to killing two people and was threatening suicide,” Tolber, the police chief, said Tuesday.

“I believe that there may have been other people that were texted, but the initial call that started our focus on him was from the family,” Tolber said.
Officers arrived at Sparks’ mobile home and found him hiding inside a 5-foot-deep concrete space under the home. San Bernardino County District Attorney Jason Anderson described the space as similar to a “homemade basement” underneath the home.
Before police could arrest Spar﻿ks, they had “lengthy negotiations” with him because he was armed and barricaded, Redlands Police Department spokesperson Carl Baker said Friday. Sparks attempted to shoot himself but his weapon misfired, police said.
Engkraf, the neighbor who reported the Menards as missing, described Sparks as a “loner” who “didn’t socialize so much.”
After Sparks’ arrest last week, authorities searched his home and found human remains, police said. The San Bernardino County Sheriff-Coroner Department confirmed Thursday the remains were those of the Menards.
Their cause and manner of death has not been determined, a spokesperson for the coroner’s office told CNN.
Police do not have a reason to believe there are other victims, Tolber said on Tuesday.
The search took days because of the state of the property, its potential collapse and the need to remove debris with heavy equipment, police said.
The Menards’ dog was not found during the search, police said.
Wilkerson, their neighbor, called the Menards “very sweet people” and said “there’s no way” they could have walked away from their car.
“There’s not a mean bone in their body at all, which makes this very confusing,” Wilkerson said.
While authorities have not shared details about a potential motive – other than that it did not appear to be planned – neighbors discussed with reporters an ongoing feud between Sparks and the Menards.
Wilkerson told CNN affiliate KABC she was aware there was tension.
“When I first moved here, he told me how much he hated them, and he hated Dan specifically because Dan would cut the tree … trim the tree down,” she said."
E3VAVIDTA9_JXEEJQRIRCRQPXN,Vladimir Putin trolls US presidential race with ‘endorsement’ of Kamala Harris,"Analysis by Nathan Hodge, CNN","3 minute read Updated 4:09 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/05/europe/vladimir-putin-kamala-harris-endorsement-intl/,"Russian President Vladimir Putin raised eyebrows Thursday when he expressed his support for US Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential bid, flattering the Democratic nominee with some curiously timed remarks.
“Our ‘favorite,’ if you can call it that, was the current president, Mr. [Joe] Biden. But he was removed from the race, and he recommended all his supporters to support Ms. Harris. Well, we will do so – we will support her,” Putin said Thursday at the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok. “She laughs so expressively and infectiously that it means that she is doing well.”
Putin also criticized former president and current Republican nominee Donald Trump for placing “so many restrictions and sanctions against Russia like no other president has ever introduced before him.”
Putin’s comments come on the heels of sweeping sanctions announced by the Biden administration to combat a Russian government-backed disinformation effort to influence the 2024 elections and boost Trump’s candidacy.
And despite the Russian leader’s vocal support of the Democrats, US Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said on Wednesday that three Russian companies – at Putin’s direction – used fake profiles to promote false narratives on social media. Internal documents produced by one of those Russian companies show one of the goals of the propaganda effort was to support Trump’s candidacy or whoever emerged as the Republican nominee for president, according to an FBI affidavit.
So what is Putin trying to accomplish?
If the past is any guide, Putin is simply stirring the pot of US domestic politics. In December 2015, Putin praised Trump, calling him the front-runner months before the businessman secured the Republican nomination.
“He is a bright and talented person without any doubt,” Putin said, calling Trump “an outstanding and talented personality.”
Did Putin know something about the 2016 US presidential elections that the pollsters didn’t? No, but the Kremlin leader did little to conceal his dislike of Hillary Clinton, then the likely Democratic nominee.
And when purloined Democratic National Committee emails were leaked just ahead of the Democratic National Convention, Putin did not hide his glee.
While US officials pointed a firm finger of blame at Russia for the hack, Putin denied the Russian state had anything to do with it. And in remarks at the same forum in September 2016, he praised the leak as a sort of service to the voters, saying, “The important thing is the content that was given to the public.”
That content being the embarrassing revelation in the leaked emails that Democratic officials gave preferential treatment to Clinton.
In other words, the whole DNC hack episode supported the Kremlin’s view that American democracy is a sham: Nothing matters but power, everything is decided in smoke-filled rooms, and hectoring countries like Russia about adherence to democracy and human rights is hypocritical.
Putin’s view of the American political system makes even more sense when we are reminded of an insight from exiled Russian political journalist Mikhail Zygar, the author of “All the Kremlin’s Men.”
Zygar noted that Putin loved “House of Cards” – the darkly cynical television series about Washington politics – and even recommended it to his ministers.
“That’s his American politics textbook,” Zygar said in an interview.
It’s also possible that Putin was simply trolling Harris by winking at a consistent insult from Trump about the way she laughs.
So if Putin’s take on US election politics is seen through the lens of “House of Cards,” then, Putin’s support of Harris is a sort of Frank Underwood move: A kind of endorsement poisonous to its recipient.

E8WRR2V623_LEFRQ429C0WTOX1,"Hunter Biden pleads guilty to federal tax charges, in surprise move on brink of trial","By Marshall Cohen, Emma Tucker, Paula Reid, Evan Perez and Casey Gannon, CNN","6 minute read Updated 8:36 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/05/politics/hunter-biden-case/,"Hunter Biden pleaded guilty Thursday to all nine charges in his federal tax case, in a surprise move on the day that an agonizing weekslong trial was supposed to begin.
District Judge Mark Scarsi accepted the guilty plea after a dramatic and convoluted all-day hearing in Los Angeles that began with the routine jury selection process.
The judge, who is a Trump appointee, set a sentencing date for December 16. President Joe Biden’s son could now face up to 17 years in prison for his crimes, which include tax evasion, filing fraudulent tax returns and failing to pay taxes. The judge also said he could also impose a hefty fine, perhaps as much as $1.3 million.
But looming over the proceedings – as well as Hunter Biden’s convictions in a separate gun trial in June – is the possibility of a presidential pardon, or a commutation of sentence. President Joe Biden has repeatedly ruled this out, and a White House spokesperson reiterated that position on Thursday.
The guilty plea was a unilateral move by Hunter Biden, and was called an “open plea” because it was done without a pre-arranged leniency deal with prosecutors. Leo Wise, the hard-nosed prosecutor who led the case, told the judge, “We were as shocked as everyone else in the courtroom this morning” when Biden’s team tried to change his not guilty plea.
After the hearing, Biden’s lawyer Abbe Lowell told reporters that the president’s son “put his family first today, and it was a grave and loving thing to do,” instead of subjecting them to another public trial about his addiction and family dysfunction.
“After watching prosecutors who exploit his family’s grief during the Delaware trial and realizing they were planning to do it again in California, Hunter decided to enter his plea to protect those he loves from unnecessary hurt and cruel humiliation,” Lowell said. “This plea prevents that kind of show trial that would have not provided all the facts or served any real point in justice.”
This is a victory of sorts for special counsel David Weiss, who is the Trump-appointed US attorney for Delaware, and also successfully prosecuted the gun case. In a Thursday night statement, his team touted that Hunter Biden was “convicted” of the tax crimes – but this outcome means they didn’t get to put on the trial that they’ve been working on since 2018, when they started the investigation.
About 120 prospective jurors waited in a sequestered assembly room throughout the day, while prosecutors and Biden’s lawyers haggled in court over how to move forward.
When the proceedings kicked off Thursday morning, Lowell stunned the courtroom by saying Biden wanted to enter an “Alford plea,” where he would maintain his innocence but acknowledge that prosecutors had enough evidence to convict. Under this maneuver, Biden would have skipped a trial and accepted the judge’s punishment at sentencing.
But Biden’s team backed away from that plan after prosecutors raised forceful objections, and the judge said he’d want to study the matter and reconvene Friday morning.
“I want to make something crystal clear – the United States opposes an Alford plea,” Wise said. He added, “Hunter Biden is not innocent. Hunter Biden is guilty. He is not permitted to plead guilty on special terms.”
After a break in the proceedings, Lowell said Biden was willing to move forward with an “open plea,” to unilaterally plead guilty to the offenses, because “enough is enough.”
Lowell said Biden was willing to proceed with the open plea because the special counsel was trying to “exact a pound of flesh” and a “drop of blood.” Pushing back, Wise said Biden was to blame for the situation.
“We’re not here because of what the government did. … He’s the one that triggered this set of events,” Wise said, calling it “offensive” for Lowell to paint Biden as a “victim” of this prosecution.
During the standard questioning as part of every federal plea, Biden said under oath that nobody made him any promises to convince him to plead guilty. The president’s son also testified that nobody pressured him in any way to plead guilty.
“Do you agree that you committed every element of every crime?” Scarsi asked.
“Yes,” Biden responded.
Prosecutors also read the full 56-page indictment during the plea proceeding, which took nearly 90 minutes, and delved into the salacious details of Biden’s extravagant spending on strippers, escorts, luxury cars and fancy hotels, while not paying his taxes.
Biden’s wife Melissa Cohen left the courtroom soon after the reading began, which meant she missed the most explicit and embarrassing details in the indictment.
A tax trial would’ve have been Biden’s second criminal trial this year, after he was convicted in June on three federal gun charges in Wilmington, Delaware. That sentencing is scheduled for November 13, and he could face as many as 25 years in prison for those offenses.
The tax indictment alleged that Biden failed to pay $1.4 million in federal taxes and evaded taxes by filing tax returns with fraudulent business deductions.
The president’s son eventually paid roughly $2 million in back taxes and penalties after learning of the investigation and getting sober, following a yearslong struggle with drug addiction and alcoholism.
In the weeks before the trial, the judge blocked Biden’s lawyers from telling jurors about the belated tax payment, or about the potential origins of his addiction – dealing a major blow to his defense strategy.
The special counsel himself, Weiss, was sitting front row in the courtroom benches during the hearing, most of the time leaned over his knees and calmly tapping his feet as prosecutors laid bare the culmination of his six-year investigation into Biden’s finances and foreign deals.
Biden’s facial expression was stoic for the majority of the hearing. Just before the judge sat the courtroom after an initial recess, Biden stared blankly ahead of him for several moments. While Wise recited the indictment, Biden followed along closely with his own annotated copy.
Biden’s former business partner Tony Bobulinski attended the hearing, sitting with the public and press in the courtroom. A sharp critic of the Biden family, he testified in the House Republicans impeachment inquiry that also scrutinized many of the same foreign deals that were part of the tax case. Claims from Bobulinski and GOP lawmakers that Joe Biden was intimately involved in Biden’s lucrative foreign business deals, have not been proven.
Lowell’s leading role in the plea hearing was notable. He was the lead defense attorney for Biden’s Delaware gun case, but he was absent from a key pretrial hearing two weeks ago in the California tax case. Instead, celebrity attorney Mark Geragos, who was retained earlier this summer, took the lead at that hearing. Lowell did all the speaking for Biden on Thursday.
Asked by CNN after the hearing if there have been any contacts with President Joe Biden about a pardon, Geragos said, “The question you should be asking is, are you disappointed that you don’t get to try the case?”
The convoluted and drawn-out plea proceedings Thursday in Los Angeles were reminiscent of a similar hearing last summer in Delaware, where the same parties attempted to get a judge’s approval for a plea agreement that would’ve resolved the tax and gun cases in one fell swoop. That agreement stunningly unraveled in open court, with the parties disagreeing on its terms, and the judge eventually withholding her support over constitutional concerns.
”I’ve been through one of these plea hearings before,” Wise quipped, drawing a laugh from the judge as they all tried to figure out the way forward.
“Deja vu,” Scarsi replied.

E9LGOE3XHA_DON32IE7J0QE272,Leader of Afghanistan’s resistance movement says he will defeat the Taliban ‘no matter the odds’,"By Peter Bergen, CNN","14 minute read Published 2:00 AM EDT, Sun September 1, 2024",20240901,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/01/politics/ahmad-massoud-afghanistan-resistance-interview/,"Three years after the departure of the final US troops from Afghanistan, the situation in the country is bleak, with the Taliban tightening its grip as it introduces increasingly oppressive laws that restrict political freedoms and suppress the rights of women.
Most Afghans have had to acquiesce to the Taliban not because they embrace their misogynistic ideology but because they have all the guns. Still, there is a nascent resistance movement. I spoke to its leader, Ahmad Massoud, who said he’s engaged in “a fight for the soul and future of our nation, and we are determined to win, no matter the odds.”
He is the son of Ahmad Shah Massoud, who led the Afghan resistance to the Taliban more than two and half decades ago when the Taliban first seized power in Afghanistan in 1996.
Massoud is now 35, and he leads the National Resistance Front to the Taliban. In our interview, he asserted that his group has carried out 207 military operations around Afghanistan this year and that he has 5,000 soldiers under his control. Verifying this kind of information independently is nearly impossible as there are relatively few international journalists covering Afghanistan, while the Taliban have closed hundreds of Afghan media outlets. The UN put out a report in June that documented a surge of anti-Taliban attacks during the first six months of this year but put the number at 29 operations carried out by the National Resistance Front, while on the group’s X feed, there are claims of far more operations.
Massoud told me that “the Taliban’s true victory wasn’t on the battlefield; it was at the negotiating table,” a withdrawal agreement that was negotiated by then-President Donald Trump’s team and carried out by President Joe Biden.
Massoud lives in an undisclosed location in Central Asia directing military operations in Afghanistan from outside the country. We conducted our interview over email, and it has been edited for clarity.
BERGEN: The Taliban last week banned the sound of women’s voices outside of the home. This seems crazy, but the Taliban can do it with impunity. What does this say about their hold on power?
MASSOUD: This is a blatant display of ignorance and arrogance. The Taliban believe they can punish the people of Afghanistan, especially women, and yet they can also still gain international recognition. [Today, no government officially recognizes the Taliban, though several governments do have diplomatic relations with them.] This impunity is a direct result of the international community’s policy of appeasement of the Taliban over the past three years. If we hope to see a change in the Taliban’s behavior, we must alter our approach towards them. It’s that simple.
Within Afghanistan, our strategy for resistance is clear. The Taliban only respond to power and force. Diplomatic engagement with the Taliban has only emboldened them.
BERGEN: This is the third anniversary of the withdrawal of all US troops from Afghanistan. What are your feelings on this anniversary after two decades of a US military and diplomatic presence in Afghanistan? Was this a betrayal of America’s Afghan allies?
MASSOUD: The hasty US withdrawal in 2021 caused us to lose many achievements that we had gained in the last 20 years. Afghanistan had started experiencing social and political transformations that it never had before. We had rights like freedom of speech, and a new generation, both women and men, was on the rise. Yet we lost all of this when the agreement with the Taliban was signed in 2020 and when the withdrawal abruptly happened in 2021. Now we are the only country fully controlled by terrorists.
BERGEN: What kind of military operations are you carrying out in Afghanistan?
MASSOUD: The National Resistance Front’s military activities started in August 2021 when the Taliban attacked us in the Panjshir Valley [in northern Afghanistan]. Since then, we have been resisting them. We started from two provinces in the north, yet now we have networks and operations in almost 20 provinces after three years of expansion. [There are 34 provinces in Afghanistan.] Our operations at the moment are unconventional and mostly guerrilla operations. Yet, the military wing of the National Resistance Front is based inside Afghanistan, our bases, and our commando units are all in the country, and as every day passes, we are increasing our recruitment and operational capacity.
BERGEN: Can you give us a sense of the strengths of your National Resistance Front?
MASSOUD: The National Resistance Front’s military wing is solely made up of the remnants of Afghanistan’s former armed forces. These forces joined us instead of abandoning the fight for democracy on August 15, 2021 [when the Taliban captured Kabul, the capital]. Today, we have more than 5,000 permanent forces scattered in some 20 provinces. We have been able to increase their capabilities even though we aren’t receiving any external support. To give you a sense of our strength, since January 2024, we have launched 207 operations around the country.
BERGEN: Your soldiers claimed an attack at Kabul Airport last month. Can you describe what happened?
MASSOUD: Operational security prevents me from disclosing specifics, but I can assure you that this operation and many others demonstrate the significant military and intelligence capabilities we’ve developed since 2021. Despite the risks and complexities, our forces, supported by our deep intelligence network within the enemy’s ranks, executed the operation precisely.
Also, I would like to make something clear. All our targets are and will be military targets. We only target where the Taliban and other terror groups reside and avoid civilian casualties.
BERGEN: Tell us about how you became the leader of the anti-Taliban resistance, and are there other resistance groups you work with?
MASSOUD: I started my political efforts back in 2018 by consulting Afghanistan’s people. I went to the furthest villages and valleys of Afghanistan, engaging directly with my people to formulate a strategic response to the imminent US-Taliban deal and withdrawal. On September 5, 2019, I received a clear mandate from our citizens, gathered at my father’s mausoleum, to lead a solution to this coming crisis.  The critical moment arrived on August 15, 2021, when my people and some of the former armed forces of Afghanistan established the National Resistance Front of Afghanistan, entrusting me with its leadership. This was not a choice but a call to duty that I answered without any hesitation.
BERGEN: You attended Sandhurst, the British equivalent of West Point, and studied in the War Studies department of Kings College, London. Was that helpful training for what you are doing now?
MASSOUD: My training at Sandhurst and education at King’s College provided me with a solid foundation. However, the burden of real-world conflict has been my true academy. The lessons I’ve learned leading our resistance these past few years far surpass any classroom instruction.
BERGEN: You won’t recall this, but I met you when you were only around 4 years old when CNN was interviewing your father, Ahmad Shah Massoud, in the Panjshir Valley in Afghanistan in 1993 during the Afghan civil war. I was very impressed by your father, his extraordinary charisma and his intelligence.
It must have been very difficult for you, aged 11 when he was assassinated by al Qaeda assassins two days before 9/11. How has your father’s assassination affected what you are doing today?
MASSOUD: The video of our first encounter, when you met my father during that CNN interview in the Panjshir Valley in 1993, is indeed part of our historical record. While I wish I had been older to fully grasp the gravity of those moments and learn more directly from my father, his legacy has become the cornerstone of my mission. My father’s assassination by al Qaeda, just days before 9/11, was a moment that shaped not just my family but the course of our nation. As I’ve detailed in my memoir “In the Name of My Father,” the impact was profound. However, it also ignited an unshakeable determination within me. At that moment, I vowed to continue his vision for a free and peaceful Afghanistan. His sacrifice wasn’t in vain – it’s the foundation upon which we’re building Afghanistan’s future. [Disclosure: I wrote the foreword to Massoud’s memoir, which I do not benefit from financially in any manner.]
BERGEN: When the Americans left Afghanistan three years ago, they left behind $8.5 billion dollars worth of military equipment, according to an estimate by the UN. That’s more than the defense budget of some European nations. Does this make your task of resisting the Taliban more difficult?
MASSOUD: The $8.5 billion worth of military equipment abandoned by the Americans has of course altered the battlefield dynamics, but it hasn’t dampened our determination and commitment. Yes, the Taliban are now better armed than ever before. However, military history is full of examples where determination and strategy overcame material advantages. The Taliban may have the weapons, but we have the will of the people – and history shows that’s a far more powerful force.
What’s more concerning is the Taliban’s transformation of Afghanistan into a black market for these weapons. We know that they are not just arming themselves; they’re fueling global terror networks. This isn’t just about our resistance; it’s about preventing Afghanistan from becoming a nexus of international terrorism.
BERGEN: When your father, Ahmad Shah Massoud, was fighting the Taliban before 9/11, he controlled some territory inside Afghanistan and could be resupplied from neighboring Tajikistan. You are not in Afghanistan, and it’s hard for you to supply your forces inside Afghanistan as you control no territory in Afghanistan. You do have a political office in Tajikistan, but no other countries support you; how does this lack of support affect your ability to fight the Taliban?
MASSOUD: Our current position differs strategically from my father’s era, but our determination remains unshaken. Since 2021, we’ve not only survived but expanded our influence, despite minimal external support. It is important to emphasize that we are not just fighting the Taliban; we’re engaged in a broader conflict against a coalition of regional and global terror groups. When al Qaeda and the Pakistani Taliban supply fighters to the Taliban, it’s clear that our struggle is an extension of the global war on terror.
However, let me be clear: to defeat these 20 terrorist organizations in Afghanistan threatening global security, we require international backing. It’s unrealistic to expect us to single-handedly neutralize this threat without resources. Our fight isn’t just for Afghanistan; it’s for global security. Any nation that perceives terrorism as a threat must recognize the strategic necessity of supporting our cause and efforts.
BERGEN: What support do you need?
MASSOUD: We need any kind of support that will allow us to defeat this group. We believe we have capable forces who were trained for 20 years to pursue counterterrorism. For this reason, we are asking for resources instead of foreign forces to liberate our country.
BERGEN: What do you say to those who say your resistance movement doesn’t have much of a chance against the well-armed Taliban and without financial and military support from other countries?
MASSOUD: Those who underestimate our resistance fail to grasp the lessons of Afghanistan’s history. Despite our current lack of external support, we’ve consistently grown in strength and numbers. The Taliban may control territory and possess billions in arms, but they lack the most crucial asset – the support of the people of Afghanistan. Our history proves that popular legitimacy, not weaponry, determines ultimate victory. Even the communist regime [which controlled Afghanistan from 1979 to 1992], which was far stronger than today’s Taliban, fell due to lack of popular support. Our resistance is expanding because we represent and embody the will of the people.
BERGEN: Will the Taliban still be in charge in Afghanistan a decade from now? If not, why not?
MASSOUD: The Taliban’s grip on Afghanistan is already slipping. Their lack of discipline, competence, legitimacy, and internal disunity makes their long-term rule ineffective. We don’t just hope for their downfall – we’re working to ensure it.
In Vienna, Austria, this year we initiated a political process, uniting Afghanistan’s diverse political and civil groups. This isn’t only opposition – it’s the foundation of a democratic alternative for Afghanistan’s future. We’re not waiting for the Taliban to fail; we’re building the system that will replace them.
The fractures within the Taliban are widening. Their implosion is not a matter of if, but when. When that moment comes – and it will come sooner than many expect – we’ll be ready. The democratic government we’re preparing will fill the void, representing all citizens and bringing stability to our nation.
A decade from now, Afghanistan won’t just be free of Taliban rule – it will be on the path to becoming a beacon of democracy in the region. That’s not wishful thinking – it’s our objective.
BERGEN: Has the Taliban created an “inclusive” government as they promised?
MASSOUD: The Taliban’s promise of an inclusive government has proven to be nothing but propaganda. The fundamentally reject the core democratic principle that political legitimacy stems from the will of the people and free elections. Their current power structure is a sham, with various factions of their terrorist organization vying for control and systematically marginalizing each other.
The very notion that this group could create an inclusive government is absurd when they can’t even maintain unity within their own ranks. Their internal power struggles and ideological inflexibility make any form of genuine inclusivity impossible. They’ve demonstrated time and again that their only interest is in consolidating power for their extremist vision.
BERGEN: Flawed presidential elections produced flawed Afghan governments. How culpable were Afghanistan’s leaders like President Ashraf Ghani for what transpired in Afghanistan?
MASSOUD: The government of Afghanistan was corrupt and flawed. The flaws in Afghanistan’s previous governments were systemic and deep-rooted. I consistently opposed these administrations precisely because of their corruption and ineffectiveness.
The root of the problem lies in the political system adopted after 2004, which was fundamentally unsuited to Afghanistan’s diverse demographic reality. Afghanistan is a highly diverse country without an ethnic majority. Its constitution concentrated excessive power in Kabul, essentially creating a presidential monarchy. This centralization was a primary factor in the government’s weakness and the marginalization of numerous communities.
The situation worsened dramatically during Ashraf Ghani’s presidency. His further centralization of power, limiting decision-making to only himself and a small circle of advisors, exacerbated the alienation of large segments of our population.
Recognizing this flaw, I advocated for the decentralization of power in a 2020 New York Times article. I firmly believe that Afghanistan’s path to peace and stability lies in the distribution of power. It is a strategic requirement for building a stable, resilient nation that can withstand internal divisions and external threats.
BERGEN: In all the discussions about the mistakes made in Afghanistan, sometimes it’s easy to lose sight of what went right. In addition to the rise of independent media and the provision of education to girls and jobs for women, what else worked? Programs like the National Solidarity Programme, which offered small grants for public works to local communities in consultation with those communities?
MASSOUD: Yes, despite challenges and setbacks in Afghanistan, it’s important to acknowledge the significant progress made during the two decades after 9/11. The rise of independent media was a cornerstone of this progress, giving voice to diverse perspectives and creating a more informed population. The expansion of education for girls and employment opportunities for women were transformative. Programs like the National Solidarity Programme were particularly effective.
BERGEN: What was the effect of the Trump administration’s 2020 Doha peace agreement with the Taliban and President Joe Biden announcing in April 2021 that he was going to go through with the total US withdrawal?
MASSOUD: The Trump administration’s 2020 Doha deal with the Taliban and President Biden’s later announcement of a total US withdrawal in April 2021 had detrimental effects on Afghanistan’s stability. These decisions legitimized the Taliban on the international stage while signaling the end of substantial Western support for the government of Afghanistan at the same time.
The Doha agreement, in particular, undermined the morale of our security forces and government officials. It created a sense of certainty about the Taliban’s return to power. Biden’s withdrawal announcement made it worse. It triggered a rapid loss of confidence in the government’s ability to stand independently. These policy decisions, which sought to end America’s longest war, sacrificed the hard-won progress of two decades and betrayed the trust of millions of our people.
BERGEN: Did the Taliban win at the negotiating table with the United States, what they couldn’t win on the battlefield from them?
MASSOUD: The Taliban’s true victory wasn’t on the battlefield; it was at the negotiating table.  Prior to the negotiations, their territorial control was limited. The negotiation process itself became their launch pad to power. This diplomatic engagement legitimized a terrorist group. It turned them from insurgents to political actors. Had the US simply withdrawn without these negotiations, the Taliban wouldn’t be in power today.
The consequences were devastating – it demoralized Afghanistan’s armed forces, normalized relations with terrorists, facilitated the release of thousands of extremists from our prisons, and paved the way for the fall of our government.
This colossal mistake handed the Taliban a victory they couldn’t achieve through force of arms.
BERGEN: This year, you published a book, “In the Name of My Father: Struggling For Freedom In Afghanistan.” What was the main message of the book?
MASSOUD: My book is more than a memoir – it’s a manifesto for Afghanistan’s future and a testament to our ongoing struggle. I lay out my convictions on democracy, women’s rights and the role of Islam in our society. These are the foundational principles upon which we’re building our resistance.
BERGEN: What is your vision of the future? The Taliban control more of the country than they did before 9/11. They’re better armed. They’ve been fighting for 20 years. So, what’s the end goal here for you?
MASSOUD: Let me be very clear about our vision and end goal. We are fighting for a democratic, decentralized and pluralistic Afghanistan where every citizen, regardless of gender, ethnicity or religious belief, enjoys equal rights. This is our non-negotiable objective.
Yes, the Taliban currently control more territory and are better armed than before 9/11. But control of land and possession of weapons does not mean legitimate governance or popular support.
We’re not just resisting the Taliban; we’re building the foundation for a new Afghanistan. We’re creating a system that’s resilient against extremism and responsive to the diverse needs of all our citizens.
Make no mistake – we are prepared for a long struggle. This isn’t just a fight against the Taliban; it’s a fight for the soul and future of our nation, and we are determined to win, no matter the odds."

Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency Tuesday in the city of Rancho Palos Verdes as severe land shift in the area is threatening the community and disrupting power lines.
Emergency officials will be able to direct state resources toward responding to the threat of the land movement, the governor’s proclamation said.
More than 200 homes in the city, around 30 miles south of Los Angeles, had their power cut Monday as a long-running ground shift close to them is threatening utility lines.
“The city is located on four out of five sub-slides that comprise the Greater Portuguese Landslide Complex,” the governor’s office said. “Land movement at part of the Complex has significantly accelerated following severe storms in 2023 and 2024.”
“This is unprecedented,” Rancho Palos Verdes City Council member Barbara Ferraro said Sunday. “No one knows really, in a way, what to do.”
Southern California Edison cut off electricity Sunday to 140 homes in the Portuguese Bend community, an outage that it says is indefinite because the shifting ground threatens utility poles and raises the risk of fires in the city.
“There was a fire last week,” SoCal Edison spokesperson Kathleen Dunleavy told CNN affiliate KABC. “It was a small fire, but the fire was caused when one of our lines fell because of land movement, and that shows how dangerous this area is.”
An additional 105 customers lost power Monday evening as the company continues to monitor the threat from ground movement.
Rancho Palos Verdes is an oceanfront community in southwestern Los Angeles County, west of Long Beach. It was incorporated as an independent city in 1973.
Officials say the land there has been shifting slowly for decades, but the problem is worse than it used to be. “The movement has accelerated dramatically over the last 12 months, where some areas are moving up to 10 inches a week,” said City Council member David Bradley. “You can almost see the ground move.”

To encourage wary residents to heed evacuation warnings, Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said law enforcement is stepping up patrols in the community and launching drones to look for looting. “You’re going to jail if you come here to steal anything,” Luna said in a news conference on Sunday.
Rancho Palos Verdes has been under a local state of emergency since October 2023, and natural gas service was shut off in the Portuguese Bend neighborhood on July 29.
Fourth District Supervisor Janice Hahn said Sunday that Los Angeles County has set aside an additional $5 million to respond to the disaster.
“Yes, this landslide has been moving for decades, but the acceleration that’s happening currently is beyond what any of us could have foretold, and it demands more response from the state, more response from the federal government,” Hahn said.

EANYXUOS9H_VI5IWD5VSR54PTU,Harris kicks off fall campaign blitz with Labor Day events in key states,"By Alison Main and Arit John, CNN","5 minute read Updated 8:19 PM EDT, Mon September 2, 2024",20240902,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/02/politics/2024-harris-trump-labor-day/,"Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign held a string of Labor Day-themed events in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania on Monday, marking the unofficial launch of the fall campaign sprint in the states that will determine the November election.
The events come as Harris seeks to extend her momentum over the next two months. While the Democratic presidential nominee has sought to expand the map of states where she is competitive, the Labor Day stops point to the importance of winning those three “blue wall” states that propelled President Joe Biden to victory in 2020.
Biden joined Harris for a rally in Pittsburgh on Monday evening, the president’s first joint campaign appearance with the vice president since ending his reelection bid and endorsing her.
“I’ll be on the sidelines, but I’ll do everything I can to help,” Biden said. “Are you ready to make Donald Trump a loser again?”
Harris used the Pennsylvania event to say that US Steel should be owned domestically and that she opposed the company’s purchase by the Japanese-owned Nippon Steel.
“The president mentioned it: US Steel is a historic American company, and it is vital for our nation to maintain strong American steel companies. And I couldn’t agree more with President Biden, US Steel should remain American owned and American operated,” Harris said to a crowd of union members.
In a statement, a Nippon Steel spokesperson defended the deal, arguing that “U. S. Steel and the entire American steel industry will be on much stronger footing” under the acquisition.
Harris’ remarks in Pennsylvania largely echoed an earlier event in Detroit, where she emphasized the “dignity of work” and vowed to strengthen protections for collective bargaining to a crowd of union members and leaders, while drawing sharp contrasts with opponent Donald Trump.
“We celebrate unions because unions helped build America, and unions helped build America’s middle class,” she told a packed high school gymnasium here in Michigan.
Harris was joined onstage by national union leaders, including United Auto Workers president Shawn Fain, American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten and National Education Association president Becky Pringle.
The vice president reiterated her support for the PRO Act, legislation that would ensure workers’ rights to unionize and collectively bargain for workplace changes, and vowed to “end union busting once and for all.”
Monday’s events come 64 days ahead of Election Day and, as Harris noted in her remarks, 24 days before mail-in absentee voting begins in Michigan and 14 days before it begins in Pennsylvania. The vice president echoed previous warnings that the race would be close to the end.
“I’m telling you we know how they play, we know what they do,” she said. “So let’s not pay too much attention to the polls. Let’s know, like labor always does, we are out here running like we are the underdog in this race because we know what we are fighting for.”
Meanwhile, her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, proudly boasted his ties to organized labor at a union event in Milwaukee, celebrating Labor Day by declaring himself in “the pocket” of unions and daring Republicans to “roll the damn dice” if they want to criticize his support for labor.
Walz detailed his union membership as a former public school teacher, his record of backing unions in Congress and as Minnesota’s governor, and highlighted Harris’ support for unions.
Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, had no scheduled events Monday. Trump used his social media site to bash Harris over high gas and grocery costs and tout his work renegotiating America’s trade deal with Mexico and Canada.
“We can’t keep living under this weak and failed ‘Leadership,’” Trump said on Truth Social.
The Harris campaign knocked the former president for not holding any events on the holiday.
“Donald Trump is ditching workers on Labor Day because he is an anti-worker, anti-union extremist who will sell out working families for his billionaire donors if he takes power,” campaign spokesperson Joseph Costello said in a statement.
Ahead of Harris’ Labor Day remarks in Detroit, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer praised the vice president’s record and bashed the Republican ticket as disconnected from the common man.
“Look, if your most famous line is ‘You’re fired,’ you sure as hell don’t understand workers,” Whitmer later said, referencing Trump’s catchphrase on his former reality show “The Apprentice.” “I want our next President to say to workers, whomever she might be, I’ve got your back.”
Whitmer said Harris has been part of “the most pro-labor administration in American history,” and praised Harris’ work as a senator and attorney general to stand with picketing workers and take on big banks and pharmaceutical companies, as well as Walz’s work to bring infrastructure investments to his state and raise minimum wage for delivery drivers.
Trump has been critical of labor leaders, including the United Auto Workers’ Fain, but has sought the support of workers in the same Rust Belt states Harris and Walz campaigned in Monday. The former president has focused his attention on the Biden administration’s efforts to boost the production and purchase of electric vehicles, which Trump has argued will come at the expense of autoworkers.
Michigan Trump allies railed against Harris on the issue of auto manufacturing ahead of the Democratic presidential nominee’s Labor Day visit to Detroit.
“What makes America great, part of it, is our economy, and the Harris administration is coming after autoworkers’ jobs,” Rep. Lisa McClain, a Michigan Republican, told reporters on a call Monday morning. “There will continue to be more layoffs.”
McClain, who represents the northern part of the metro Detroit area, as well as Republican Rep. John James, who represents a neighboring district, both argued that Biden-Harris administration policies meant to increase the producing of electric vehicles in the US are unrealistic.
The Harris campaign has pushed back on previous claims by Trump and Vance, including that the vice president supported a “mandate” for all electric vehicles. The administration’s goal is to have EVs comprise half of all new vehicle sales by 2030.

EARFFAATHQ_KJE61BJBGU92PO9,Analysis: Trump is still telling lies he told eight years ago,"By Daniel Dale, CNN","5 minute read Published 5:00 AM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240903,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/03/politics/trump-fact-checking-analysis/,"In a speech last week to the National Guard Association of the United States, former President Donald Trump claimed that he was the president who “created” the Veterans Choice health care program, and got it “passed in Congress,” after others had wanted to do so “for 57 years.”
In reality, President Barack Obama was the president who signed the program into law in 2014. The law Trump signed in 2018, the VA MISSION Act, expanded the Veterans Choice program but didn’t create it.
I could fact-check this Trump lie half-asleep – because he’s been telling it for more than six years.
Trump’s lying is most exceptional in its relentlessness, a never-ending avalanche of wrongness that can bury even the most devoted fact-checkers. But it’s also notable for its repetitiveness. He has found his hits, and he’ll keep playing them no matter how many times they are debunked.
As Trump enters the post-Labor Day sprint of his 2024 campaign for the presidency, his commentary is filled with many of the same false claims he made as president from 2017 to 2021. He’s even repeating some of the false claims he used during his 2016 presidential campaign.
As a fact-check reporter for CNN, I watch or read the transcript of every public appearance by Trump and his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris. While Harris’ campaign remarks to date have been heavy on thematic rhetoric and light on assertions of fact, with a smattering of false or misleading claims, Trump’s 2024 interviews and speeches are littered with old falsehoods I’ve come to call “the repeats” – assertions I have fact-checked as false over and over for years.
For example, Trump falsely claimed on a podcast last week that people are saying global warming will cause the oceans to rise just “an eighth of an inch in 355 years.” He was saying near-identical nonsense in 2019. (Sea levels are already rising more than an eighth of an inch per year.)
Trump falsely claimed at a rally last month that his tariffs on imported Chinese goods are paid by China, not Americans, and that no previous president had generated even “10 cents” from tariffs on Chinese goods. He was saying the same in 2018. (The tariff payments are made by US importers, not Chinese exporters, and the US government was already generating billions per year from such tariffs before Trump took office.)
Trump falsely claimed in a speech in mid-August that he had warned the US not to invade Iraq. That claim was a key part of his campaign pitch in 2015 and 2016. (Trump expressed tentative support for the 2003 invasion about six months before it occurred, did not express a firm opinion on an invasion about two months before it occurred, and only came out as an opponent of the war post-invasion.)
Trump’s false claims in the podcast interview last week that some NATO members were “delinquent” and “owed … huge amounts of money” before he took office were also staples of his 2016 run. (NATO members didn’t owe anybody money even if they were not meeting the alliance’s voluntary 2%-of-GDP guideline for their own defense spending.)
Trump’s regular false claims of a “rigged” 2020 election echo his language from both his 2016 campaign and 2020 campaign. (The claims were baseless then and are baseless now.)
And less importantly, when Trump declared in June, July and again on Thursday that he had been named “Man of the Year” in Michigan long before he entered politics, it was the third straight presidential election he had told this silly lie he debuted in 2016. (There is no evidence the award even exists, let alone that Trump, who has never lived in Michigan, received it.)
Nobody really knows how much of Trump’s deployment of old lies is strategic and how much is mere force of habit. Regardless, his persistence produces a clear benefit for him.
News outlets tend to focus on new material. While some outlets may be inclined to fact-check a false Trump claim the first, second, third or even 10th time he utters it, they are far less likely to devote precious resources to a claim on the 100th or 150th utterance – especially because he is constantly mixing in dozens of new lies that require time and resources to address. And so, by virtue of shameless perseverance, Trump often manages to outlast most of the media’s willingness to correct any particular falsehood, eventually getting that claim into news coverage and social media clips nearly uncorrected.
That’s not to say his lying is an unmitigated victory.
Numerous polls have found for years that a clear majority of voters do not see Trump as honest; from talking to Americans around the country since 2015, I know there are a lot of people who distrust almost anything he says. I have no doubt that his insistence on continuing to say dozens of things people have already learned are false is part of the reason why.
Still, I try to match Trump’s tirelessness in lying with my own tirelessness in challenging the lies. The separation of fact from fiction is central to journalists’ role in the democratic process, and there are always citizens out there who are hearing even the stalest of deceptions for the first time.
So as long as Trump or any other major political figure keeps reviving their past nonsense, we should keep debunking that nonsense. Even if we already did it eight years ago."
EGJH0JCCRT_GEGDQCE7C5TRUZ0,Independent Russian watchmaker upends race to design world’s thinnest wristwatch,"By Oscar Holland, CNN","4 minute read Updated 12:19 AM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/05/style/konstantin-chaykin-thinking-worlds-thinnest-watch/,"In recent years, the giants of European horology have been locked in a heated battle to design the world’s thinnest mechanical watch.
Luxury brands Bulgari, Piaget and Richard Mille have all, since 2018, held the coveted record, which was most recently broken by Bulgari’s sleek 1.7-millimeter-thick Octo Finissimo Ultra Mark II, in April.
But now, an independent Russian watchmaker and inventor may have trumped them all.
Moscow-based Konstantin Chaykin says his new ThinKing prototype, which he debuted at the Geneva Watch Days fair in Switzerland last week, is just 1.65 millimeters (less than one-fifteenth of an inch) thick. He also believes it to be among the world’s lightest watches, weighing just 13.3 grams (less than 0.47 ounces), without its strap.
In an email to CNN, Chaykin said he has developed various innovations to make his design thinner “without compromising its functionality,” including a winding mechanism that is integrated into the barrel of the watch. The ThinKing also features a “double balance” wheel that allowed Chaykin to reduce the number of layers in the watch movement.
Mechanisms for winding the watch and adjusting its dials are, meanwhile, found in a separate 5.4-millimeter-thick carrier case, freeing up space (though the ThinKing can also be wound with a key). Chaykin said he has filed several patent applications, though none have yet been granted.
The watch is made using stainless steel and tungsten carbide, a light but exceptionally rigid compound. Chaykin, who is the only Russian member of the prestigious Académie Horlogère des Créateurs Indépendants, said he is also considering using sapphires or diamonds in future versions of the watch, according to his brand’s website.
With the hour and minute displays separate from one another, the design resembles a face — a hallmark of the watchmaker’s signature Wristmons collection. The dials are each protected by 0.35-millimeter-thick (0.014-inch) sapphire crystals.
Producing ultra-slim watches that are reliable, accurate and durable enough to wear has posed a major technical challenge to the world’s watchmakers. But the race to design ever-thinner watches appears to have accelerated in recent years.
Swiss brand Piaget debuted its 2-millimeter-thick Altiplano Ultimate Concept, then the world’s slimmest, in 2018, before putting it into production two years later. Luxury giant Bulgari then took the crown with the first iteration of its Octo Finissimo Ultra, which came in at just 1.8 millimeters.

Watchmaker Richard Mille soon went 0.05 millimeters thinner — a difference equivalent to a piece of printer paper — in 2022, with its RM UP-01 Ferrari. Bulgari then reclaimed the title this year with its aforementioned Octo Finissimo Ultra Mark II, a limited-edition model that was widely reported to cost over $500,000.
Whether Chaykin’s ThinKing can now be considered the record-holder, however, may be a matter of debate in horology circles. (Guinness World Records does not currently list an independently adjudicated record for thinnest watch.)
For one, the ThinKing is currently just a prototype — and its functionality and accuracy are yet to be independently assessed. Describing it as “more of a design and engineering study at this point,” James Stacey, lead editor of online watch magazine Hodinkee, wrote last week that he was “sure any sort of record-setting will be with (a) for-production (rather than) than non-production” timepiece.
The design is also so thin that it requires a special strap, featuring titanium supports and elastic inserts, to protect it from the shocks and stresses of everyday wear.
Chaykin nonetheless believes his prototype’s timekeeping accuracy and 32-hour power reserve qualify it as the new record-holder. He welcomed outside assessment, telling CNN that during the five-day Geneva Watch Days fair “hundreds of people” were able to inspect his creation.
“Visitors were able to hold the watch in their hands, check the time and test its functionality,” he said. “It is quite a bold step on our part to show the prototype in this way.  But the watch, to our delight, works perfectly, and to the delight of the visitors, it was possible to touch the watch… However, we are prepared to carry out all the necessary independent tests.”
The watchmaker said he will present a “final” version of his design at the Watches & Wonders trade show, also in Geneva, next April. By that time, the updated design should feature improved accuracy, power reserve and “tightness,” among other things, he told CNN. He added that the watch’s price “is not yet known.”

In a separate statement, Chaykin, who founded his eponymous watchmaking brand in 2003, said he became interested in slim timepieces after encountering an ultra-thin 19th-century Bagnolet pocket watch around 20 years ago.
He was inspired to make one after being challenged by a client to design an ultra-thin watch of his own. “I initially considered many possibilities and dedicated an entire Moleskine (notebook) to finding technical solutions,” he is quoted saying.
Chaykin’s statement also compared the process of configuring the watch’s inner workings to a puzzle. “As with any good puzzle, I had to tinker, look for non-trivial solutions, choose the best options and calculate the energy flows,” he added."
ELUYAPBMXY_JGUVU2FMGBPRQW1,Dress Codes: How did plaid become popular for school uniforms?,"By Jacqui Palumbo, CNN","6 minute read Updated 6:01 AM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/05/style/plaid-school-uniforms-dress-codes/,"Editor’s Note: Examining clothes through the ages, Dress Codes is a new series investigating how the rules of fashion have influenced different cultural arenas — and your closet.
As students return to school, one patterned textile now synonymous with uniforms will make its seasonal reappearance on pleated skirts, jumpers and ties: plaid. The design has long been a mainstay in both classrooms and in pop culture, bringing to mind the hilarious Irish teens of “Derry Girls,” the bold ‘90s fashion of “Clueless” or the provocative outfits of the early 2000s pop duo t.A.T.u.
Plaid has become a catch-all term in the US, but includes patterns with distinct histories, including tartan, from Scotland, which is more associated with Catholic school uniforms, and madras, from India, which became a staple of American collegiate prep looks popularized by the likes of Ralph Lauren and Brooks Brothers in the latter half of the 20th century. It’s a family of textiles with broad scholarly appeal, with both religious and secular schools worldwide incorporating plaid into uniforms, from Mexico to Japan to Australia.
But how did a cloth like tartan, once the symbol of Scottish Highlander identity and rebellion, wind up on the fictional American teen Cher Horowitz as the ultimate twist on schoolgirl fashion? The reasons for the wool textile’s success as both a national identity marker and school dress code are one and the same.
“It really communicates a sense of belonging,” said Mhairi Maxwell, co-curator of the exhibition “Tartan,” which showed at the V&A museum in Dundee, Scotland, last year. “Any club, any society, any school, can design their own tartan. You’re part of this larger club, but you’re also your own little clique within it.”
Thousands of variations have been officially added to the Scottish Register of Tartans, making it a pattern that both follows strict rules and allows for “infinite possibilities” in design, Maxwell explained. There’s the highly recognizable red, blue, green, white and yellow weaves of the Royal Stewart (or Stuart) tartan — both the official tartan of the British monarchy and one of the most popular variations adopted by the punk movement — the blues and pinks of Vivienne Westwood’s MacAndreas tartan, worn by Naomi Campbell in the 1990s; and the crimson, white and black pattern made official by the University of Alabama in 2011.
Possibly the earliest existing scrap of tartan known today is a 16th-century piece found in a bog in Glen Affric, Scotland, which the V&A Dundee studied before the exhibition. The Scottish Tartans Authority commissioned dye analysis and radiocarbon testing on the textile, which has now been dated to between 1500 and 1600. It’s known that tartan existed for centuries before, though how long is often contested.
“Tartan’s origins are so elusive — it’s really hard to pinpoint (their) origin story,” Maxwell said in a phone interview, noting that many cultures around the world have grid-patterned textiles in their histories, leading to the differing claims of where and when tartan was first woven. The pattern has specific rules, however, that distinguish it from check or gingham patterns as well as madras.
Tartan’s history within Scotland has been debated as well. Centuries of romanticizing Highlander clanship and identity has likely influenced our contemporary understanding of the textile, Maxwell noted. The popular idea that tartan designs, dyes or techniques were rigid identifiers of a particular community is dubious, she pointed out — the clans weren’t siloed off, but imported and exported their materials.
However, it was the Jacobite military leader Charles Edward Stuart — known as Bonnie Prince Charlie — who made tartan a powerful symbol, leading his tartan-clad forces during an unsuccessful uprising in 1745 to restore his family’s Catholic leadership to the British throne.
“(He) made tartan the plaid of the people, and used it to create a movement to fight for his cause,” Maxwell said. “He was already capitalizing on that idea that it was a cloth of allegiance that bound people together to fight for something they believed in.”

After Stuart’s defeat, tartan was restricted in its use for decades in Scotland through Great Britain’s Dress Act, but it had a fashionable revival in the early 19th century that received royal support, particularly from Queen Victoria. The era saw an “elite appropriation” of Highland craft and lifestyle, Maxwell explained. Previously a formidable sight to encounter on the battlefield, it now represented a different kind of pride in the form of status and wealth, making it an ideal textile to use in schools promoting prestige and heritage.
“I can’t really think of another textile which has all this baggage with it,” Maxwell said. “It’s a traditional cloth, but it’s super rebellious at the same time.” It also became a fabric with imperial implications, as it made its way around the world through the uniforms of Scottish Highland regiments at war, British colonial exports and the transatlantic slave trade.
In the US, tartan was first introduced when the states were still British colonies. But the textile didn’t become a fixture of school uniforms until the 1960s, according to historian and educator Sally Dwyer-McNulty, who authored “Common Threads: A Cultural History of Clothing in American Catholicism” in 2014. That decade saw the textile “explode” in popularity, she explained in a phone interview, brought to market by major Catholic school uniform suppliers at the time, including Bendinger Brothers and Eisenberg and O’Hara (now Flynn O’Hara), who often had contracts with entire networks of diocesan schools.
“It’s like virtuous consumption, where Catholics, like lots of other post-war families, had a little bit more money to spend,” she explained in a phone interview. “The companies that had exclusive contracts wanted to tap into the resources that families had and make the (uniforms) attractive.”
Plaid already had ties to Catholicism, and it also visually stood out, she said. And, like across the pond, it allowed schools to brand themselves through their uniforms with a textile that allowed for a lot of variance without any external adornments.
“It creates this collective identity that’s important. It gives students this kind of embodied pride that they have regarding their school — or they can also express their rejection of that uniformity by letting their socks fall down to their ankles,” she joked. (Dwyer-McNulty herself attended two different Catholic schools in Philadelphia, wearing plaid uniforms through high school).
Uniforms were only associated with parochial and private schools until the late 1980s, but public schools began piloting them as well, allowing plaid’s influence in American classrooms to spread. (President Bill Clinton was a particular proponent of them during his administration the following decade, believing they would help reduce student crime). By the 1990s, the styles were no longer just available by contracted uniform companies, either, Maxwell noted, as stores like Gap and The Children’s Place stocked up on plaid skirts and jumpers.
Globally, plaid has been revived, remixed and deconstructed any number of ways today, as designers, subcultures and television and film continue to play on the trope. For Maxwell, 1995’s “Clueless” remains a favorite interpretation. It’s also one that keeps giving, as the bright yellow plaid skirt-suit set worn by Alicia Silverstone is continually replicated, last year by Kim Kardashian for Halloween, and redesigned by Christian Siriano (and worn by Silverstone) for a Superbowl ad.
“That Valley Girl appropriation of tartan is really cool,” Maxwell said. “It’s playing off that heritage of preppy Ivy League, but flipping it on its head and making quite a feminist statement about what it is to be educated, young and aspirational.”"

The source said that the writings were discovered in the bedroom of suspect Colt Gray, and included references to the 2018 massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida.

The discovery, which could shed more light on a motive for the shooting, comes amid an emerging portrait of Gray’s tumultuous family life in the years leading up to the deadly attack, revealed in a CNN review of court and law enforcement records, social media posts, and an interview with his grandfather.
As that portrait has emerged, so have details about the investigation and authorities’ pursuit of those they allege bear responsibility in the shooting. Gray told investigators, “I did it” while being questioned, Barrow County Sheriff Jud Smith told CNN on Thursday.
And while Gray faces four counts of felony murder, Gray’s father, Colin, also has been arrested in connection with the shooting, accused of “knowingly allowing his son … to possess a weapon,” Georgia Bureau of Investigation Director Chris Hosey said Thursday. Colin Gray was charged with four counts of involuntary manslaughter; two counts of second degree murder; and eight counts of cruelty to children, the GBI said.
As for Colt Gray’s family situation: His parents went through a bitter separation and custody dispute in recent years. They called law enforcement on each other, the family was evicted from at least one home, and Gray’s mother was arrested on suspicion of keying her husband’s car and drug possession, law enforcement records show.

At the same time, Gray’s mother and maternal grandfather have accused Gray’s father of being verbally abusive toward his family for years.
“He was just a good kid, but he lived in an environment that was hostile,” Charles Polhamus said of Colt Gray, his grandson, in an interview with CNN. “His dad beat up on him, I mean, I’m not talking about physical, but screaming and hollering, and he did the same thing to my daughter.”
The grandfather said he had never seen Colt Gray show any kind of anger problems, but that the turbulent family life had affected the teenager.
Now, investigators seeking to understand the suspect’s motive are looking into his family’s previous contacts with the state’s child protective services agency, the GBI director said Wednesday.
The suspect’s father told investigators this week he had purchased the gun used in the killings as a holiday present for his son in December 2023, according to two law enforcement sources with direct knowledge of the investigation. One source told CNN the AR-15-style rifle was purchased at a local gun store as a Christmas present. The other source described the gift as a holiday present.
Attempts to reach both of the suspect’s parents for comment on Wednesday and Thursday were unsuccessful. CNN was working to determine whether Colt Gray and Colin Gray have legal representation.
Colt Gray’s parents’ relationship started out with promise. In July 2011, shortly after he was born, his parents bought a small farm in Barrow County, Georgia, outside of the college town of Athens. They planned to “create a non-profit, therapeutic riding school for local, under-privileged children,” his mother, Marcee Gray, who worked in industrial engineering, later wrote in a LinkedIn post.
But those plans were derailed in part because her husband, Colin Gray, had at least three “major” back surgeries, she wrote. The couple, who had three children, later sold the farm in 2019, according to property records.
After they moved, the family faced lawsuits from multiple landlords, and were evicted from one home by a county sheriff’s deputy in July 2022 for failing to pay rent, according to court records. As part of the eviction, sheriff’s records show, deputies collected three firearms, including an AR-15, and at least one hunting bow, and kept them for safekeeping. The weapons were later “released to owner,” the documents say.
Later that year, Marcee Gray wrote on social media that she had left her husband.
“Finally separated from my abusive husband of almost 14yrs,” she wrote in one LinkedIn comment on a post from December 2022. “Hardest shit I’ve ever done but we’re in good hands.”
“I packed myself and my babies up and relocated to my hometown in south GA,” Gray added in another post in May 2023. “We are all good and my kids are thriving.”
The same month, however, law enforcement agents were investigating 13-year-old Colt Gray in connection with a school shooting threat. Investigators with the Jackson County Sheriff’s Office interviewed Colt and his father about a threat on the online chat platform Discord to commit a school shooting, documents obtained through a public records request show.
Colt Gray denied making the threat, an investigation report said. A Discord spokesperson told CNN on Wednesday that the platform removed an account “believed to be associated with” Gray in May 2023 for violating Discord’s policy against extremism.
Colin Gray told investigators he had hunting rifles in the house, and that “Colt is allowed to use them when supervised but does not have unfettered access to them,” the report said. The case was later cleared because the tip could not be substantiated.
Transcripts from the interview and a subsequent phone call show that Colin Gray said his son was “getting picked on at school,” with other students “pinching him and touching him… just ridiculed him day after day after day.” He also that that he was “trying to teach him about firearms and safety and how to do it all and get him… interested in the outdoors,” in part to get him away from video games.
“He knows the seriousness of weapons and what they can do and how to use them and not use them,” Colin Gray said.

In his interview, Colin Gray told investigators that he had separated from his wife, who took their two younger children with her. The suspect’s father said that Colt – the oldest of three siblings – had “had some problems” at a middle school in Jackson County but had since moved to another school and “it has gotten a lot better,” one of the investigators wrote.
Gray was only enrolled in the Jackson County school district between February and August 2022, said Edward Hooper, the spokesperson for the district. Jackson County is next to Barrow County, where Colt Gray is accused of killing two fellow students and two teachers at Apalachee High School.
In October 2023, Barrow County Sheriff’s deputies responded to a wellness check on the Gray family after Marcee Gray reported that she hadn’t heard from her husband or their children in two weeks. Colin Gray, who was at their residence, said all of their children were with him, a sheriff’s deputy wrote in a report.
Colin Gray gave the deputy a paper from the Georgia Division of Family and Children Services that showed “a safety plan was put in place for him to have the children with him” and Marcee Gray “could not see them without supervision,” the deputy wrote.
A spokesperson from the Georgia Department of Human Services said Thursday she could not comment on the case due to confidentiality laws. But Georgia Bureau of Investigation Director Chris Hosey said at a press conference Wednesday that the bureau was aware that the division had previously had “some previous contacts” with the Gray family, and “we are pursuing that avenue as well too to see if that has any connection with today’s incident.”
In November 2023, Colin Gray called law enforcement and accused his wife of keying a truck he drove for his work at a construction company, writing “abuse” and “liar” on it, according to a sheriff’s report.
Two days later, police arrested Marcee Gray at a Walmart in Winder due to an active warrant from another county. Police found methamphetamine, fentanyl, pain pills, and a glass pipe in her car, and she and another man who was in the vehicle were arrested, another sheriff’s report said.
After being arrested, Marcee Gray admitted keying her husband’s truck, saying she “lost it” after he refused to let her see her kids, the report said.

Marcee Gray pleaded guilty the following month to criminal damage to property, “criminal trespass - family violence,” and use of a license plate to conceal identity, and was sentenced to a total of five months’ probation after serving more than a month in custody. As part of her guilty plea, she was barred from contacting her husband except through a third party for divorce negotiations and custody discussions.
A friend of Marcee Gray, who asked not to be named for privacy, told CNN that the legal trouble she faced was “not the Marcee we know,” calling her a “sweet, caring, and smart woman” who had changed.
“Something happened in that relationship that went wrong,” the friend said.
According to Polhamus, Marcee Gray’s father, she lost custody of her children after failing a drug test, moved back in with her parents in south Georgia and is going through rehab.
Polhamus said he had never thought his grandson would be capable of such a deadly attack.
“I understand that Colt chose to do what he did, and I understand he has to pay for it,” he said. “But I’m telling you, the environment that he lived in… you put somebody in a situation like that for 10 or 11 years, guess what’s gonna happen? Nothing good.”
The Discord account that the FBI had linked to Colt Gray last year referenced plans for a future mass shooting and shared screenshots of firearms, according to documents obtained by CNN.
“im committing a mass shooting and im waiting a good 2-3 years,” stated the account user, according to screenshots included in an FBI incident report from May 2023 obtained by CNN. “I cant kill myself yet, cause I’m not contributing anything to culture I need to go out knowing I did.”
The account referenced Adam Lanza, the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooter, and in separate posts shared a desire to target an elementary school and expressed frustration that transgender people were being accepted in society.
Above a photograph of two firearms, the account posted, “I’m ready.”
The FBI tip was shared with the Jackson County Sheriff’s Office, which closed the investigation after finding that “the user behind the Discord account that made the threat cannot be substantiated.”
A Discord spokesperson told CNN on Wednesday the platform removed an account “believed to be associated with” Gray in May 2023 for violating Discord’s policy against extremism.

EWVWPC83JC_2BJR0MW43BV8HY7,Scientific discovery that turns mouse skin transparent echoes plot of H.G. Wells’ ‘The Invisible Man’,"By Katie Hunt, CNN","5 minute read Updated 4:32 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/05/science/food-dye-transparent-mice-skin/,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.
In H.G. Wells’ 1897 science fiction novel, “The Invisible Man,” the protagonist invents a serum that makes the cells in his body transparent by controlling how they bend light.
More than 100 years later, scientists have discovered a real-life version of the substance: A commonly used food coloring can make the skin of a mouse temporarily transparent, allowing scientists to see its organs function, according to a new study published Thursday in the journal Science.
The breakthrough could revolutionize biomedical research and, should it be successfully tested in humans, have wide-ranging applications in medicine and health care, such as making veins more visible to draw blood.
Researchers made the skin on the skulls and bellies of live mice transparent by applying a mixture of water and a yellow food coloring called tartrazine. Washing away any remaining solution reversed the process, which did not harm the animals. The mice’s fur was removed before the application of the solution.
“For those who understand the fundamental physics behind this, it makes sense; but if you aren’t familiar with it, it looks like a magic trick,” said the study’s first author, Zihao Ou, assistant professor of physics at the University of Texas at Dallas, in a statement.
The “magic” uses insights from the field of optics. Light-absorbing dye molecules enhance the transmission of light through the skin by suppressing the tissue’s ability to scatter light.
The dye, when mixed with water, modifies the refractive index — a measure of the way a substance bends light — of the aqueous part of the tissue to better match the index of proteins and fats in the tissue. The process is akin to a dissipating cloud of fog.
“We combined the yellow dye, which is a molecule that absorbs most light, especially blue and ultraviolet light, with skin, which is a scattering medium,” said Ou, who conducted the study as a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University in California.

“Individually, these two things block most light from getting through them,” he said. “But when we put them together, we were able to achieve transparency of the mouse skin.”
Once the dye had completely diffused into the skin, the skin became transparent.
“It takes a few minutes for the transparency to appear,” Ou said. “It’s similar to the way a facial cream or mask works: The time needed depends on how fast the molecules diffuse into the skin.”
The team experimented with chicken breasts before conducting work on live animals.
In mice, the researchers were able to observe blood vessels directly in the surface of the brain through the transparent skin of the skull. The mice’s internal organs were visible in the abdomen as well as the muscle contractions that move food through the digestive tract.
The transparent areas take on an orangish color, Ou said, similar to that of the food dye.
The dye used in the solution is commonly known as FD&C Yellow No. 5, certified for use by the US Food and Drug Administration. The synthetic dye is frequently used in orange- or yellow-colored snack chips, candy coating, ice cream and baked goods. However, a 2021 study by the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment linked the coloring with behavioral difficulties and decreased attention among children. A state bill, if signed into law, would ban the use of the food coloring in food served in public schools in California.
Ou said it was important that the dye is biocompatible — safe for living organisms. “In addition, it’s very inexpensive and efficient; we don’t need very much of it to work,” he said.
The researchers have not tested the process on humans, and it’s not clear what dosage of dye or delivery method would be necessary. Human skin is about 10 times thicker than that of a mouse, according to the researchers.
“Looking forward, this technology could make veins more visible, easing … the procedure of drawing blood or administering fluids via a needle — especially for elderly patients with veins that are difficult to locate,” said senior author Guosong Hong, a Stanford assistant professor of materials science, via email.
“Moreover, this innovation could assist in the early detection of skin cancer, improve light penetration for deep tissue treatments like photodynamic and photothermal therapies, and make laser-based tattoo removal more straightforward.”
Christopher Rowlands, a senior lecturer in the department of bioengineering at Imperial College London, said he was “kicking himself” for not coming up with the same insight as the Stanford-led team, which is based on the widely studied and long-standing physics principle called Kramers-Kronig relations: When a material absorbs a lot of light at one color, it will bend light more at other colors.
“It’s blatantly obvious when someone points it out, but no one had thought of it for 100 and something years,” said Rowlands, who wasn’t involved in the study but coauthored a commentary published alongside the research.
Along with Jon Gorecki, an experimental optical physicist at the same institution who also wasn’t involved in the study, Rowlands wrote that the approach offered a new way to visualize the structure and activity of deep tissues and organs in a living animal in a safe, temporary and noninvasive manner.

“It just works. You rub it on a mouse, and you can see what it had for breakfast. It’s that powerful,” he added.
Rowlands and Gorecki said that existing methods to turn tissue transparent use solutions that have side effects such as dehydration and swelling and can alter the structure of the tissue. However, tartrazine was used at a low concentration, and its effects were easily undone, potentially facilitating prolonged study of biological processes in live animals, they wrote.
The duo noted the discovery was an example of life imitating art, with the dye solution echoing the serum imagined in “The Invisible Man.”
“The protagonist (in the story) invents a serum that renders the cells in his body transparent by precisely controlling their refractive index to match that of the surrounding medium, air,” they wrote.
“One hundred twenty-seven years later … biocompatible dyes make living tissues transparent by tuning the refractive index of the surrounding medium to match that of the cells.”

However, Ou and Hong said a totally invisible mouse was a stretch: The current approach cannot render bone transparent.
“So far, we only tested soft tissues, including brain, muscle, and skin. We haven’t done much investigation with hard tissues such as bone, so I am not sure if we would be able to make the mouse completely invisible,” Ou said via email.
“However, a partially transparent (mouse) will already enable numerous research opportunities to answer questions relating to development, regeneration, as well as aging.”"

Founded in 2013, far-right Alternative für Deutschland – or Alternative for Germany (AfD) - is on track to claim victory in state parliamentary elections in the country’s eastern region of Thuringia, initial exit polls by German state broadcaster ZDF show.
AfD is projected to get 33.5% of the vote, well ahead of the conservative party Christian Democrats (CDU) with 24.5%, according to ZDF.
In Saxony, which also held a regional election Sunday, the two parties are neck and neck, according to state broadcaster ZDF.
Newly founded left-wing party, the Sarah Wagenknecht alliance – or BSW – looks to be coming in third in both Thuringia and Saxony, where roughly 1.7 million people and 3.3 million were eligible to vote, respectively.
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s Social Democratic Party (SPD) is projected to get disappointing results in both states.
The local elections results in Thuringia and Saxony are seen by many as a litmus test for Scholz and his coalition partners ahead of next year’s general elections. While the AfD has put immigration front and center of its agenda, the coalition built by Scholz is creaking, with infighting, disagreements about policy and accusations that elected officials no longer represent the values they were initially elected for.
AfD co-chair Alice Weisel called the results in Thuringia a “historic success,” reflecting the people’s “rejection” of Scholz’s coalition government.
“This is an even stronger result than in the last elections and, accordingly, we will of course emerge stronger from the elections,” she said.

“It is a rejection of this coalition and they should ask themselves whether they can continue to govern at all. The question should be raised for new elections. Because it can’t go on like this,” she added.
AfD would very unlikely be able to form a regional government, struggling to find allies in other parties.
Branches of the AfD are classified as suspected right-wing extremist by Germany’s intelligence agency and the party’s top candidate in Thuringia, Björn Höcke has been fined twice for using a Nazi slogan.
Regional elections take place every five years in Germany and each state can have their election at various dates. The German state of Brandenburg is set to head to the polls on September 22."

The Norwegian public broadcaster NRK reported that the whale carcass was found floating at the Risavika Bay in southern Norway Saturday by a father and son who were fishing.
The beluga, named by combining the Norwegian word for whale — hval — and Russian President Putin’s first name Vladimir, was lifted out of the water with a crane and taken to a nearby harbor where experts will examine it.
“Unfortunately, we found Hvaldimir floating in the sea. He has passed away but it’s not immediately clear what the cause of death is,” marine biologist Sebastian Strand told NRK, adding that no major external injuries were visible on the animal.
Strand, who has monitored Hvaldimir’s adventures for the past three years on behalf of the Norway-based Marine Mind non-profit organization, said he was deeply affected by the whale’s sudden death.
“It’s absolutely horrible,” Strand said. “He was apparently in good condition as of (Friday). So we just have to figure out what might have happened here.”
The 4.2-meter (14-foot) long and 1,225-kilogram (2,700-pound) whale was first spotted by fishermen near the northern island of Ingøya, not far from the Arctic city of Hammerfest, in April 2019 wearing a harness and what appeared to be a mount for a small camera and a buckle marked with text “Equipment St. Petersburg.”
That sparked allegations that the beluga was “a spy whale.” Experts said the Russian navy is known to have trained whales for military purposes.
Over the years, the beluga was seen in several Norwegian coastal towns and it quickly became clear that he was very tame and enjoyed playing with people, NRK said.
NGO Marine Mind said on its site that Hvaldimir was very interested in people and responded to hand signals.
“Based on these observations, it appeared as if Hvaldimir arrived in Norway by crossing over from Russian waters, where it is presumed he was held in captivity,” it said.
Norwegian media have speculated whether Hvaldimir could have been used as “a therapy whale” of some sort in Russia."

F6QR2YU2AZ_3BNMD1YKWIN2MLQ,What to know about Hunter Biden’s tax trial,"By Marshall Cohen, CNN","8 minute read Updated 5:20 PM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/04/politics/hunter-bidens-tax-trial-explainer/,"Hunter Biden is set to go on trial Thursday for alleged tax crimes, in a case that was once seen as a potential political liability for President Joe Biden, but is now a sordid closing chapter to his presidency.
Special counsel David Weiss, who has investigated Hunter Biden’s finances and foreign deals since 2018, filed the nine-count indictment in December, accusing the president’s son of failing to pay $1.4 million in federal taxes and executing a tax-evasion scheme.
Hunter Biden, 54, pleaded not guilty and says he belatedly paid all of his tax debts after regaining his sobriety in 2019, amid a lifelong struggle with alcoholism and drug abuse.
Jury selection is scheduled to begin Thursday at the federal courthouse in Los Angeles, the trial could last about one month. The trial will feature salacious details about Hunter Biden’s extravagant partying and spending during the peak of his addiction, including money for strippers, escorts and luxury cars – all while he allegedly didn’t pay taxes.
The stakes are high for Hunter Biden, who was convicted of three gun felonies in June and will be sentenced for those crimes after the election. Most federal cases are resolved with a guilty plea, and it’s always possible Hunter Biden opts for a last-minute deal instead of rolling the dice with another trial.
Joe Biden has unfettered power to pardon his son or wipe away his sentence if he’s convicted in the tax case. The president has repeatedly ruled that out in his public comments, though that was before he dropped out of the 2024 race.
Here’s everything you need to know about the trial.
The investigation began in 2018, when Weiss was the Trump-appointed US attorney for Delaware. Over the years, Weiss scrutinized Hunter Biden’s finances, his lucrative business deals, a gun purchase, potential violations of foreign lobbying laws and more.
Everything appeared to be winding down last summer, when the parties announced a plea deal. Hunter Biden would’ve admitted to two tax misdemeanors, resolved the gun matter and likely avoided jailtime. But the deal imploded under scrutiny from a judge.
At that point, Weiss requested “special counsel” status from Attorney General Merrick Garland, a Biden appointee. The request was approved and Weiss later filed two indictments against Hunter Biden: a gun case in Delaware and a tax case in California.
CNN reported last month that there were plea discussions earlier in the summer between Weiss’ team and Hunter Biden’s lawyers, but that did not lead to an agreement at that time to resolve the tax charges.
In the year since Weiss became a special counsel, he has spent more than $3.7 million of taxpayer dollars on his investigation, according to Justice Department disclosures.
There are nine charges in the tax indictment against Hunter Biden. If convicted on all counts, he could face as much as 17 years in federal prison and up to $750,000 in fines.
The most serious allegations in this case stem from the three felony charges: tax evasion for 2018, filing a false personal tax return for 2018 and filing a false corporate tax return for 2018. Prosecutors say Hunter Biden claimed tax deductions for personal expenses that were disguised as business expenses, significantly lowering his tax bill.
According to the indictment, some of those supposed “business expenses” included $43,693 to stay at the famous Chateau Marmont in West Hollywood, $30,000 for his daughter’s tuition at Columbia Law School, $11,500 for two nights with an escort, $3,947 at a strip club, $1,727 for a Lamborghini rental and $275 for dinner at Nobu.
He is also accused of failing to pay taxes on time for 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019, and failing to file tax returns on time in 2017 and 2018. These six counts are misdemeanors.
Hunter Biden had all this money to spend on “everything but his taxes,” as prosecutors put it, thanks to lucrative deals in China, Ukraine, Romania and elsewhere. He earned more than $7 million between 2016 and 2020, working for foreign clients on energy consulting, lobbying, corporate advising and legal services, according to court filings.
Under last year’s plea deal that fell apart, Hunter Biden planned to plead guilty to two misdemeanors for failing to pay his 2017 and 2018 taxes when they were due. (He owed nearly $1.2 million, according to court filings.) After the deal collapsed, those two charges were included in the nine-count indictment that Hunter Biden is now facing.
Hunter Biden’s defense team is led by Mark Geragos, the high-profile attorney who has represented celebrities including Michael Jackson, Chris Brown and Colin Kaepernick.
At a pretrial hearing last month, Geragos said Hunter Biden’s addiction would be “the centerpiece of the defense.” His team wrote in court filings that Hunter Biden was “severely addicted to alcohol and drugs” when he fell behind on his taxes, but after he got sober, he took concrete steps to get his finances in order and paid all his debts.
Defense attorneys asked for permission to present evidence about Hunter Biden’s belated $2 million payment to the IRS in 2021. But the judge refused, citing binding legal precedents that late tax payments aren’t a viable defense to these alleged crimes.
“Evidence of late payment here is irrelevant to Mr. Biden’s state of mind at the time he allegedly committed the charged crimes,” US District Judge Mark Scarsi wrote.
Julian André, a former federal tax prosecutor who is a partner at the law firm McDermott Will & Emery, said this and other pretrial rulings likely “hamper the defense strategy.”
“If you rob a liquor store, if you go back a year later, after the police started investigating the crime, and return what you stole, that doesn’t change the fact that you robbed a liquor store,” André said. “That’s one of the arguments that the prosecutors made.”
For a conviction, prosecutors must prove Hunter Biden “willfully” broke the law. They need to convince jurors he wasn’t acting in good faith when preparing his allegedly fraudulent 2018 taxes and that he intentionally missed the other tax deadlines. Hunter Biden’s lawyers say his addiction impaired his ability to act with the proper willfulness.
“Willfulness is a step beyond intentional. … It’s hard to argue you have a good-faith belief that you don’t have to pay if there’s an email telling you that you have to pay,” André said, pointing to emails in the indictment between Hunter Biden and his accountants.
Ever since the case landed on his docket, Scarsi has taken a non-nonsense approach.
He has kept things moving, often issuing quick rulings after oral arguments on important matters like Hunter Biden’s unsuccessful bid to dismiss the charges. He has done his homework – demonstrating his fluency with the convoluted history of the investigation.
Former President Donald Trump appointed Scarsi during his final year in office, and Scarsi was confirmed by the Senate in a bipartisan vote in September 2020. Vice President Kamala Harris, who was a US senator from California at the time, did not vote.
Scarsi told senators he was a member of the Republican National Lawyers Association and the conservative Federalist Society. He was born in Syracuse, New York, and got his law degree from Georgetown University. Before becoming a judge, he had a 30-year career at Los Angeles law firms, where he specialized in intellectual property litigation.
The tax trial overlaps significantly with parts of Hunter Biden’s recent gun trial, which featured testimony about his drug addiction from some of his past romantic partners.
Court filings indicate that prosecutors will present testimony from Hallie Biden – the widow of Hunter Biden’s late brother Beau, who subsequently dated Hunter after Beau died in 2015. CNN also previously reported that Lunden Roberts, the mother of one of his children, who witnessed his crack cocaine abuse, has been subpoenaed to testify.
Prosecutors said they have roughly 30 witnesses lined up for trial. This includes a stripper that Hunter Biden allegedly paid, and an employee from a company called Streamray, a pornography website where he allegedly spent approximately $30,000.
Hunter Biden’s former business partners could also testify, including some who were also interviewed in the House Republicans’ impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden. The tax case overlaps significantly with that GOP inquiry, delving into many of the same foreign deals. But prosecutors have never backed up Republicans’ unproven assertions that Joe Biden was in business with his son and abused his office to enrich his family.
The jury pool hails from Los Angeles and six nearby counties. Taken together, these counties supported Joe Biden over Trump in 2020 by a landslide margin, 63% to 35%.
About 120 California residents have been summoned for jury service, the judge said.
They will be peppered with questions about their views on taxation, their participation in political activities, if any of their close family members struggled with addiction, and whether their views on the 2024 election hamper their ability to fairly judge this case.
The goal is to seat a jury of 12, plus four alternates. Their verdicts must be unanimous.
Looming over the entire trial is the possibility that Joe Biden will pardon his son. As president, Joe Biden could do that at any time or reduce his sentence if convicted.
Joe Biden has personally ruled out a pardon or commutation, and so have his White House advisers. But that was before he dropped out of the 2024 presidential race.
Shortly after Hunter Biden’s gun conviction in June, Joe Biden said, “I’m not going to do anything. I said I’d abide by the jury decision. I will do that. And I will not pardon him.”
There aren’t public indications that Joe Biden’s thinking has changed. But he’s famously protective of his son, and presidents have pardoned family members before. Decisions are likely to happen between father and son, as the term wraps up, CNN reported.
“If Hunter Biden is found guilty, I can’t imagine his father will want him in prison,” CNN presidential historian Douglas Brinkley said. “He lost Beau to cancer. His other son going to prison would be a very inglorious way to end his presidency, filled with a lot of sorrow, pain and hurt. Most fathers would lean into the pardon, if they had that power.”"
FCDYZHXM6R_WJ4T4U85GH1E9FM,US prosecutors charge Hamas leaders in October 7 attack,"By Hannah Rabinowitz, Holmes Lybrand and Evan Perez, CNN","5 minute read Updated 6:06 PM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/03/politics/justice-department-indicts-hamas-leaders/,"The US Department of Justice has charged several senior Hamas leaders over the October 7 terrorist attack, according to a criminal complaint unsealed Tuesday.
The indictment is the first criminal step by the Justice Department to hold people accountable for the attack in Israel.
The six defendants – Ismail Haniyeh, Yahya Sinwar, Mohammad Al-Masri, Marwan Issa, Khaled Meshaal and Ali Baraka – are facing seven charges, including terrorism charges, conspiracy to murder US nationals and conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction resulting in death.
The defendants are high-level Hamas officials, including Sinwar who is the terrorist organization’s leader in Gaza and one of the planners of the October 7 attack.
The complaint, which spans across several decades of alleged terrorist acts from Hamas, focuses in part on the October 7 attack against Israel.
Prosecutors detail how the brutal onslaught unfolded that day and the defendants’ involvement, one of whom is the alleged leader of Hamas’s militia group.
“On October 7, 2023, Hamas committed its most violent, large-scale terrorist attack to date,” the complaint says, detailing how “in the early morning hours … Hamas sent more than 2,000 armed fighters into farms and towns in southern Israel, where they carried out the massacres of over a thousand people and the kidnappings of more than 200 others.”
The complaint continued, saying that “during the October 7 Hamas Massacres, Hamas terrorists weaponized sexual violence against Israeli women, including rape and genital mutilation.”
“As of the date of this Complaint, at least 43 American citizens were among those murdered, and at least ten American citizens were taken hostage or remain unaccounted for,” prosecutors say.
Those senior members of Hamas charged called for mass terrorist attacks and celebrated the October 7 attack, prosecutors say.
The charges were originally filed on February 1, 2024, but kept under seal in case the Justice Department had the opportunity to arrest any of the defendants, a Justice Department official said Tuesday.
“Following Haniyah’s death and recent developments in the region, it was no longer necessary to keep those charges under seal,” the official said.
Three of the Hamas leaders charged are deceased.
Sinwar was named leader following the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July. Sinwar is widely believed to have planned or been the mastermind behind the October 7 Hamas massacre on Israel.
Sinwar was sentenced to four life sentences by Israel in 1989 for the abduction and killing of two Israeli soldiers and four Palestinians he believed were collaborators.
He served 22 years of that sentence.
In 2011, Sinwar was released with 1,026 other Palestinians prisoners in exchange for Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, who was held in Gaza by Palestinian militants from 2006-2011.
Mohammad al-Masri is better known as Mohammed Deif and is the head of the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, which is the military wing of Hamas.
Israel said al-Masri was killed in an Israeli airstrike on July 13, though Hamas has denied that that is the case.
Issa was one of Israel’s top targets and it is believed he was killed when his house in Gaza was targeted by an Israeli airstrike in July.
The announcement comes on the heels of the confirmed death of Israeli-American hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin in Gaza, which prompted President Joe Biden and other top US officials to vow that Hamas leaders would be held accountable.
“We’ll weigh other actions as appropriate,” a senior administration official said, but declined to elaborate.
Biden said over the weekend that Goldberg-Polin’s death was “as tragic as it is reprehensible.”
“Make no mistake, Hamas leaders will pay for these crimes,” Biden said.
In a recorded statement, Attorney General Merrick Garland said that the Justice Department is investigating Goldberg-Polin’s murder.
“We are investigating Hersh’s murder, and each and every one of the brutal murders of Americans, as acts of terrorism.  We will continue to support the whole of government effort to bring the Americans still being held hostage home,” Garland said.
Nearly 1,200 people were killed on October 7, including over 40 Americans. Hundreds of civilians were kidnapped.
The attorney general said that the Hamas leaders, who he said “led” the October 7 attack, are charged for “financing and directing a decades-long campaign to murder American citizens and endanger the security of the United States.”
“As outlined in our complaint, those defendants – armed with weapons, political support, and funding from the Government of Iran, and support from Hizballah – have led Hamas’s efforts to destroy the State of Israel and murder civilians in support of that aim,” Garland said.
The complaint detailed how Hamas and its leaders allegedly financed their terrorist operations through donations, “cryptocurrency, and transfers from the Government of Iran.”
“Hamas leaders, including the defendants, have played significant roles in the terrorist organization’s solicitation of funding contributions in support of Hamas’s violent objectives,” the complaint says, including using the October 7 attack on Israel to call for donations.
According to the complaint, in the wake of the attack Hamas’s armed wing, Al-Qassam, has “continued to solicit cryptocurrency and other financing after the October 7 Hamas Massacres on other social media platforms, specifically suggesting to followers methods to avoid interdiction by Israeli authorities, and has continued to receive contributions through at least one U.S.-based financial technology company.”
Iran, prosecutors say, has played “a critical and active role” in fundraising efforts for the militia, “through traditional cash exchanges, money transmitters … and cryptocurrency transactions.”
All of this, the complaint says, was to further Hamas’s shared goal with Iran “of annihilating Israel.”
In recent years, Iran also increased it’s funding to Hamas for intelligence over Israel’s missiles. This bump, prosecutors say, amounted to “roughly tens of millions of dollars a month.”

FOVCVQ4MT0_3ICDLJXFKP60LW1,"US service member detained in Venezuela, officials say","By Stefano Pozzebon, Natasha Bertrand and Haley Britzky, CNN","3 minute read Updated 2:59 PM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/04/politics/us-service-member-detained-venezuela/,"A US service member has been detained in Venezuela, according to four US officials familiar with the matter.
The service member, a US Navy sailor, is a US citizen and was detained on August 30 in Caracas, according to the officials. One of the officials said he is being held by the Venezuelan intelligence agency SEBIN.
A defense official told CNN, “we are aware of reports that a US Navy Sailor was detained on or about August 30, 2024, by Venezuelan law enforcement authorities while on personal travel to Venezuela. The US Navy is looking into this and working closely with the State Department. We refer you to the State Department for additional questions.”
Another official said the service member was not on official travel or approved leave when he traveled to the country. It is not clear why he traveled there.
“We are aware of reports of the detention of an individual in Venezuela,” a State Department spokesperson said.
“We have no further information to share at this time,” the spokesperson said.
The White House said Wednesday that they are “in touch” with Venezuelan authorities to get more information about the situation, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said.
“We’re obviously in touch, as appropriate as you think we would be with Venezuela authorities to try to get more knowledge and information about this,” Kirby said in Wednesday’s White House press briefing.
The State Department advises Americans against traveling to Venezuela, warning that “there is a high risk of wrongful detention of U.S. nationals.”
“Security forces have detained U.S. citizens for up to five years,” the travel advisory for Venezuela says. “The U.S. government is not generally notified of the detention of U.S. citizens in Venezuela or granted access to U.S. citizen prisoners there.”
CNN has asked the Venezuelan government for comment.
The detention of a US citizen comes during a period of serious unrest within Venezuela, after opposition and multiple Latin American leaders refused to recognize the reelection of the country’s authoritarian leader, Nicolas Maduro, in July. Protests erupted in Venezuela over the election, which reportedly killed at least 11 people and resulted in the detention of hundreds of others.
Just this week, the US seized Maduro’s airplane in the Dominican Republic. CNN first reported the seizure, which was a significant development in an already tense relationship between the US and Venezuela. One US official told CNN the seizure “sends a message all the way to the top.”
“Seizing the foreign head of state’s plane is unheard-of for criminal matters. We’re sending a clear message here that no one is above the law, no one is above the reach of US sanctions,” the official said.
The latest detention of a US service member comes roughly two years after nine Americans — including the “Citgo 6” — were brought home from Venezuela by the Biden administration in 2022. after five years of detention in the country. In December 2023, the US secured the release of six wrongfully detained Americans and four other Americans held in Venezuela.

FP73LTF5EW_MOESXRIOIG4CM3D,"Federal investigators seized phones at the homes of several top aides to NYC Mayor Eric Adams, according to sources","By John Miller, Mark Morales, Gloria Pazmino and Gregory Krieg, CNN","5 minute read Updated 3:28 PM EDT, Fri September 6, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/05/politics/investigators-seized-phones-top-nyc-officials-homes/,"Federal investigators on Wednesday seized electronic devices from the homes of several top officials in New York City Mayor Eric Adams’ administration, including the powerful police commissioner and two deputy mayors, according to multiple sources familiar with the probe.
Sources said investigators from the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York seized electronic devices, including phones, from New York Police Department Commissioner Edward Caban, First Deputy Mayor Sheena Wright, and Deputy Mayor for Public Safety Philip Banks III. Chancellor of New York City schools David Banks was also subpoenaed for his devices, according to a source familiar with the matter.
Investigators also served a subpoena to Adams’ special adviser Timothy Pearson, a former police inspector, for his phone, according to people familiar with the investigation.
The US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York and the FBI declined to comment on the recent law enforcement action, but three sources briefed on the investigations indicated that the probe into police officials by the US attorney is not connected to the bureau’s long-running investigation into Adams’s campaign fundraising.
Sources briefed on the investigation say subpoenas were also issued for the phones of three lower ranking police officials.

“The Department is aware of an investigation by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York involving members of service,” a spokesperson for the NYPD said in a statement. “The Department is fully cooperating in the investigation. Any questions regarding the investigation should be directed to the U.S. Attorney’s Office.”
Speaking to reporters Thursday, Adams refused to shed any light on the new probe.
“I have been clear that my message throughout my public life is to follow the law, and that’s what we’re doing and we’re going to comply with whatever inquiry, with whatever we ha﻿ve to submit while this review takes place,” he said.
Adams, who is up for reelection next year, is already facing a series of challengers in the Democratic primary. He will now campaign in the shadow of another secretive federal investigation, which rivals quickly zeroed-in on after word began to spread about the early morning seizures. First elected mayor in 2021, Adams, a former police captain, pledged to crack down on post-pandemic crime. Though some of the ugliest statistics have fallen, Adams’ tactics – including a spike in unlawful stops, according to a report by a federal monitor– along with the initial, slow-moving investigation have cut into his popularity.
Some of Adams’ likely 2025 primary opponents, including former city comptroller Scott Stringer, state Sen. Zellnor Myrie and Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani, hammered Adams in the hours after the news broke – mocking the mayor’s familiar pledge to “stay focused,” allow “no distractions and grind.”
“If he’s not distracted by all this, he’s delusional,” Stringer said, “and if this is what his focus looks like, he needs new lenses.”
Myrie, who is still exploring a run, posted his op-ed about the beginning of the school year, “Here’s what I’m focused on today,” he said, “creating a safe space for kids after school, so parents can get some relief. That’s what leadership looks like.”
Progressive groups, who opposed Adams as a candidate and have been critical of his running of the city, also pounced.
“Under Adams, the people of New York are sandwiched between a constant stream of budget cuts and FBI raids,” New York Working Families Party Co-Directors Jasmine Gripper and Ana María Archila said in a statement. “Today’s news is the latest example of the Eric Adams administration’s questionable morals and values. We deserve better. We can do better.”
The latest federal searches were notable not only because of how close those involved are to Adams, both personally and in government, but because of their immense power and prestige.
Caban, among those targeted on Wednesday, leads the NYPD, which has a nearly $6 billion annual budget and spends much more than that. The force is, by far, the largest and most costly in the country.
Wright is the longtime partner of David Banks, the city schools chancellor; the couple share the home that was visited by the FBI on Wednesday. David Banks is also the brother of Philip Banks, and the three are some of Adams’ closest advisers and have been in his orbit for years prior to his election.
“I am confirming that I am cooperating with a federal inquiry,” David Banks said in a statement. “At this time, I cannot comment any further on that matter.”
Since last November, multiple officials from the mayor’s office have had their homes searched, their phones seized and their records subpoenaed. Last November, Adams was stopped by FBI agents in the street who served him with a court order and took his phones.

Adams has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and neither he nor anyone in his administration has been charged with a crime
In November 2023, the FBI raided the home of Adams’ chief fundraiser Brianna Suggs. Earlier this year, the homes of a top aide, Winnie Greco, was also raided by the FBI as part of a separate inquiry by the US attorney for the Eastern District of New York.
In a statement, Chief Counsel for City Hall Lisa Zornberg said, “Investigators have not indicated to us the mayor or his staff are targets of any investigation.”
“As a former member of law enforcement, the mayor has repeatedly made clear that all members of the team need to follow the law,” Zornberg said.
These latest efforts, which took city officials by surprise, appear to mark an expansion in the number of separate probes by federal investigators and prosecutors into New York City officials.
The full scope of these investigations remain unclear, but CNN has previously reported that in one probe, federal investigators are focused on whether the campaign worked with Turkish government officials in New York to direct donations into Adams campaign coffers.

FQNL74AJA6_B1AOGKM27WLFGOY,What to know about Hunter Biden’s tax trial,"By Marshall Cohen, CNN","8 minute read Updated 5:20 PM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/04/politics/hunter-bidens-tax-trial-explainer/,"Hunter Biden is set to go on trial Thursday for alleged tax crimes, in a case that was once seen as a potential political liability for President Joe Biden, but is now a sordid closing chapter to his presidency.
Special counsel David Weiss, who has investigated Hunter Biden’s finances and foreign deals since 2018, filed the nine-count indictment in December, accusing the president’s son of failing to pay $1.4 million in federal taxes and executing a tax-evasion scheme.
Hunter Biden, 54, pleaded not guilty and says he belatedly paid all of his tax debts after regaining his sobriety in 2019, amid a lifelong struggle with alcoholism and drug abuse.
Jury selection is scheduled to begin Thursday at the federal courthouse in Los Angeles, the trial could last about one month. The trial will feature salacious details about Hunter Biden’s extravagant partying and spending during the peak of his addiction, including money for strippers, escorts and luxury cars – all while he allegedly didn’t pay taxes.
The stakes are high for Hunter Biden, who was convicted of three gun felonies in June and will be sentenced for those crimes after the election. Most federal cases are resolved with a guilty plea, and it’s always possible Hunter Biden opts for a last-minute deal instead of rolling the dice with another trial.
Joe Biden has unfettered power to pardon his son or wipe away his sentence if he’s convicted in the tax case. The president has repeatedly ruled that out in his public comments, though that was before he dropped out of the 2024 race.
Here’s everything you need to know about the trial.
The investigation began in 2018, when Weiss was the Trump-appointed US attorney for Delaware. Over the years, Weiss scrutinized Hunter Biden’s finances, his lucrative business deals, a gun purchase, potential violations of foreign lobbying laws and more.
Everything appeared to be winding down last summer, when the parties announced a plea deal. Hunter Biden would’ve admitted to two tax misdemeanors, resolved the gun matter and likely avoided jailtime. But the deal imploded under scrutiny from a judge.
At that point, Weiss requested “special counsel” status from Attorney General Merrick Garland, a Biden appointee. The request was approved and Weiss later filed two indictments against Hunter Biden: a gun case in Delaware and a tax case in California.
CNN reported last month that there were plea discussions earlier in the summer between Weiss’ team and Hunter Biden’s lawyers, but that did not lead to an agreement at that time to resolve the tax charges.
In the year since Weiss became a special counsel, he has spent more than $3.7 million of taxpayer dollars on his investigation, according to Justice Department disclosures.
There are nine charges in the tax indictment against Hunter Biden. If convicted on all counts, he could face as much as 17 years in federal prison and up to $750,000 in fines.
The most serious allegations in this case stem from the three felony charges: tax evasion for 2018, filing a false personal tax return for 2018 and filing a false corporate tax return for 2018. Prosecutors say Hunter Biden claimed tax deductions for personal expenses that were disguised as business expenses, significantly lowering his tax bill.
According to the indictment, some of those supposed “business expenses” included $43,693 to stay at the famous Chateau Marmont in West Hollywood, $30,000 for his daughter’s tuition at Columbia Law School, $11,500 for two nights with an escort, $3,947 at a strip club, $1,727 for a Lamborghini rental and $275 for dinner at Nobu.
He is also accused of failing to pay taxes on time for 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019, and failing to file tax returns on time in 2017 and 2018. These six counts are misdemeanors.
Hunter Biden had all this money to spend on “everything but his taxes,” as prosecutors put it, thanks to lucrative deals in China, Ukraine, Romania and elsewhere. He earned more than $7 million between 2016 and 2020, working for foreign clients on energy consulting, lobbying, corporate advising and legal services, according to court filings.
Under last year’s plea deal that fell apart, Hunter Biden planned to plead guilty to two misdemeanors for failing to pay his 2017 and 2018 taxes when they were due. (He owed nearly $1.2 million, according to court filings.) After the deal collapsed, those two charges were included in the nine-count indictment that Hunter Biden is now facing.
Hunter Biden’s defense team is led by Mark Geragos, the high-profile attorney who has represented celebrities including Michael Jackson, Chris Brown and Colin Kaepernick.
At a pretrial hearing last month, Geragos said Hunter Biden’s addiction would be “the centerpiece of the defense.” His team wrote in court filings that Hunter Biden was “severely addicted to alcohol and drugs” when he fell behind on his taxes, but after he got sober, he took concrete steps to get his finances in order and paid all his debts.
Defense attorneys asked for permission to present evidence about Hunter Biden’s belated $2 million payment to the IRS in 2021. But the judge refused, citing binding legal precedents that late tax payments aren’t a viable defense to these alleged crimes.
“Evidence of late payment here is irrelevant to Mr. Biden’s state of mind at the time he allegedly committed the charged crimes,” US District Judge Mark Scarsi wrote.
Julian André, a former federal tax prosecutor who is a partner at the law firm McDermott Will & Emery, said this and other pretrial rulings likely “hamper the defense strategy.”
“If you rob a liquor store, if you go back a year later, after the police started investigating the crime, and return what you stole, that doesn’t change the fact that you robbed a liquor store,” André said. “That’s one of the arguments that the prosecutors made.”
For a conviction, prosecutors must prove Hunter Biden “willfully” broke the law. They need to convince jurors he wasn’t acting in good faith when preparing his allegedly fraudulent 2018 taxes and that he intentionally missed the other tax deadlines. Hunter Biden’s lawyers say his addiction impaired his ability to act with the proper willfulness.
“Willfulness is a step beyond intentional. … It’s hard to argue you have a good-faith belief that you don’t have to pay if there’s an email telling you that you have to pay,” André said, pointing to emails in the indictment between Hunter Biden and his accountants.
Ever since the case landed on his docket, Scarsi has taken a non-nonsense approach.
He has kept things moving, often issuing quick rulings after oral arguments on important matters like Hunter Biden’s unsuccessful bid to dismiss the charges. He has done his homework – demonstrating his fluency with the convoluted history of the investigation.
Former President Donald Trump appointed Scarsi during his final year in office, and Scarsi was confirmed by the Senate in a bipartisan vote in September 2020. Vice President Kamala Harris, who was a US senator from California at the time, did not vote.

FSY7ALC31B_F99LESVEXOHCADI,Trump’s hardline new quest to destroy Harris’ momentum,"Analysis by Stephen Collinson, CNN","7 minute read Updated 9:57 AM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240903,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/03/politics/trump-quest-destroy-harris-momentum/,"Donald Trump is trying to crush Democratic nominee Kamala Harris’ persona as a force of change and to destroy her personal credibility as a potential president as their still-fresh competition careens into the final nine weeks before Election Day.
In recent days, the ex-president has unveiled a broad assault using the insult-driven politics with which he won power in 2016, even as his advisers have been pleading with him to focus his attention on top voter concerns including high prices and immigration.
He is seizing on foreign tragedies to accuse the vice president of responsibility for the deaths of US troops in Afghanistan and claiming she’s complicit in killings of hostages in Gaza. He and his running mate, JD Vance, implied her mixed race — heritage that millions of Americans share — is evidence of a sinister “chameleon”-like character that also explains policy reversals on energy and immigration. In an ugly moment, he amplified a sexually themed social media slander against her. And his dark campaign ads allege she will slash Social Security benefits by welcoming millions of undocumented migrants to the country.
And in a reprise of past GOP campaigns branding Democratic nominees as extreme liberals, Trump and his supporters are trying to frame Harris as a communist and a “Bolshevik.” South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem blasted Harris’ running mate, Tim Walz, as a “security risk” because he once taught in China. And Trump has also started to imply the coming election might not be “free and fair” and said in an interview that aired Sunday that it was ridiculous to indict him for “interfering” in the 2020 election. This and other recent comments raised the specter of another national nightmare if he loses in November and refuses to accept defeat.
Trump’s desperation to find traction has also seen him perform his own policy gyrations on reproductive rights as he seeks to narrow a huge gender gap in polling. But his credibility may already be shattered after he built the conservative Supreme Court majority that overturned the nationwide constitutional right to an abortion. Vance also seems to have a knack for alienating female voters — like when he compared Harris to a nerve-struck Miss Teen USA contestant.
Trump is not simply being true to his ill-disciplined self. He’s illustrating his struggle to respond to Harris’ transformation of the race. Increasingly brazen attempts to puncture Harris’ bubble of hope also betray frustration in the Trump camp that she’s managing to distinguish herself from her boss and is presenting a fresher option than her 78-year-old GOP rival. And Trump is showing that there’s almost nothing he won’t do to win.
Trump’s invective amounts to some of the most hardline political rhetoric in years, even by his own standards, and means the next two months are likely to be brutal.
The question is whether this barrage of negative attacks is merely successful in stoking feelings of existential anger Trump uses to drive his base the polls, or whether it begins to tarnish Harris at the margins in battleground states.
It may make some sense for Trump to throw everything he can think of at Harris. In two presidential elections, the ex-president has never risen above 49% of the vote in the so-called blue wall states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin or in the national popular count. So his chances in November may depend more on destroying the current feel-good factor around Harris and depressing her prospects among small groups of persuadable voters in swing states than on holding out hope of winning over new voters himself.
But Trump’s behavior brings its own risks. His antics last week, including a grinning, thumbs-up gravesite campaign photo-op in Arlington National Cemetery that may have broken the law, could bolster Harris’ warnings that Americans are pining for a chance to leave the bitterness and chaos of the Trump era behind.
Even though Harris has restored the contest to a neck-and-neck race, her campaign recognizes the still potent threat from Trump. “Make no mistake: the next 65 days will be very hard,” Harris campaign manager Jennifer O’Malley Dillion wrote in a weekend memo despite arguing the vice president has multiple paths to the White House. “This race will remain incredibly close, and the voters who will decide this election will require an extraordinary amount of work to win over.”
Harris campaigned in Detroit and with Biden in Pittsburgh to mark Labor Day on Monday, reflecting the importance of union members. Blue-collar workers traditionally voted Democrat, but Trump’s cultural transformation of the GOP now appeals to many workers, especially in rural areas. And Harris’ appearance with Biden in the Steel City previewed how the lame-duck president could help her campaign in a state and among a voting demographic where he remains popular.
The campaign swing comes a week before the critical meeting between Harris and Trump on a debate stage slated for September 10 in Philadelphia — one of the final foreseeable turning points of this campaign, with mail-in voting starting later this week.
Trump’s feral political offensive is a warning for Harris about what may lay ahead and underscores how hard it will be to prolong the smooth rollout of her sudden candidacy, her pick of Walz and her successful convention. But the ex-president’s intensity is also a sign — which is reflected in favorable public polling nationally and in swing states — that his early efforts to negatively define her have not worked.
Harris is being criticized by Republicans for a lack of policy specificity and reversing previous positions on fracking and immigration. But her adoption of centrist positions also appears to be squeezing Trump and frustrating his efforts to land a decisive political attack. Her decision to take on high grocery prices with a vow to clamp down on supermarket giants might explain how she’s narrowed the gap with Trump on who is most trusted on the economy.
The flap over Trump’s visit to Arlington National Cemetery last week also showed how the ex-president’s hardball tactics could hurt him as much as her.
Trump’s honoring of 13 US service members killed in a suicide bombing amid the chaotic US evacuation of Afghanistan in 2021 highlights one of the worst moments of the Biden-Harris administration. And while the vice president joined Situation Room meetings on the crisis, it’s not clear yet whether Trump can saddle her with personal responsibility for the deaths in the minds of voters since Biden was commander in chief at the time.
Harris took steps to counter Trump’s Afghan gambit when she wrote on social media that he had “disrespected sacred ground all for the sake of a political stunt” in filming campaign videos at gravesites and that this was part of a pattern of disparaging the sacrifices of American warriors. Trump responded by posting videos of some of the relatives of the fallen soldiers accusing Harris and Biden of complicity in the murder of their loved ones and supporting Trump.
The harrowing episode showed how Trump is willing to cross lines that more conventional politicians would consider off-limits. While some voters might consider he’s honoring slain troops, others might agree with Harris that he is seizing on the deaths of Americans in foreign wars for political gain.
On other issues, Harris is refusing to be drawn into gutter for political fights with Trump that might tarnish her image. For instance, the vice president was asked by CNN’s Dana Bash in an exclusive interview last week about Trump’s claim that she “happened to turn Black” for political reasons. “Same old tired playbook. Next question, please,” Harris said.
The Harris campaign did, however, jump on Trump’s argument that he did nothing wrong in 2020. The ex-president said in a Fox News interview that aired Sunday: “Whoever heard you get indicted for interfering with a presidential election, where you have every right to do it?”
Harris-Walz spokesperson Sarafina Chitika folded his comment into the campaign’s wider argument that it’s time to consign Trump’s dictatorial instincts to the past. “The American people are ready for a new way forward. They know Vice President Harris is the tough-as-nails prosecutor we need to turn the page on chaos, fear, and division, and uphold the rule of law,” Chitika said.
The exchange encapsulated the bets at the center of the campaign’s bitter endgame: Trump is putting his faith in a searing attempt to do anything it takes to bring Harris down; the vice president is wagering that his extreme attempts to do so will convince enough voters he’s unfit to return to the Oval Office."
FWAEZZZUM4_2M1JXYAE9E6FZGA,Want job security in this uncertain market? A surprising trend is paying off,"By Elisabeth Buchwald, CNN","4 minute read Published 9:11 AM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/03/economy/college-jobs-blue-collar-workers/,"Going to college in the United States has long been considered the ticket to a higher-paying job. But the growing share of high school graduates who are enrolling in vocational schools instead of four-year programs may not be missing out on as much earnings potential as you might think.
From 2019 to 2024, hiring rates fell for workers in their 20s for roles that tend to require a bachelor’s degree, while hiring rates rose for roles requiring a vocational or associate’s degree, according to data from national payroll processing company ADP. And during that five-year span, enrollment in bachelor’s degree programs fell by 4%, while enrollment in vocational schools grew by 5%, according to data from the National Student Clearinghouse.
“The promise of quicker entry into the workforce, lower educational costs and the ability to earn higher wages earlier in their careers are compelling reasons for this trend,” said Bart Taylor, a professor at Texas A&M University, who teaches curriculum development for career and technical education programs.

That means that while the overall labor market shows signs of cooling, hiring for workers without a college education can still be a source of strength for the economy.
Earnings growth rates for workers with vocational or associate’s degrees are on par with those of bachelor’s degree recipients, according to the Atlanta Federal Reserve’s Wage Growth Tracker.
That said, bachelor’s degree recipients earned a median weekly salary of $1,493 last year compared to the $1,058 associate’s degree recipients earned, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The data for associate’s degree recipients includes people who graduated from academic and vocational programs.
But some industries that skew toward workers without a degree even notch higher wage growth than industries that favor degree holders. For example, pay for construction workers rose by 4.3% on average over the 12 months ended in July; in the professional services industry, wages climbed by 3.9%, according to the BLS.
Part of the shift toward trade and vocational school enrollment stems from a reevaluation of blue-collar work that happened during the pandemic, said Taylor, who is also the vice president of the trade and industrial education division at the Association for Career and Technical Education. “This has driven employers to offer more competitive wages and benefits to attract and retain workers.”
The practical, hands-on experience required for many blue-collar jobs couldn’t be taught virtually during the pandemic, he added. For instance, “although welding concepts could be taught online, students were deprived of the crucial practice time needed with real equipment.”
Now that many of those programs are operating normally again, more Americans are building trade skills to take jobs where there’s still a shortage of skilled labor, such as electricians, carpenters and plumbers.
Another factor behind the shift toward enrollment in vocational and trade schools is the advancement of artificial intelligence, said Ben Hanowell, director of people analytics research at ADP’s Research Institute.
Across all major working-age groups, Americans between the ages of 18 and 24 are the most concerned about AI replacing some or most of their existing jobs, according to a recent survey conducted by ADP.
This could help explain why the share of 20- to 24-year-olds working in blue-collar roles rose faster in recent years and remains higher compared to people 25 to 39, according to an August report Hanowell authored. Generally, blue-collar roles, which require more manual labor, tend to be thought of as less vulnerable to being replaced by AI, he said.
“This relative job security can contribute to the ongoing demand for these roles,” he told CNN. “Moreover, as AI and technology evolve, the demand for workers who can maintain, operate and work alongside these technologies may further enhance the value of trade skills.”
It’s unclear how the blue-collar workforce will hold up relative to the white-collar workforce should the overall labor market cool more significantly.
In any event, Taylor said he’s confident that the “appreciation for skilled trades is likely to persist.”
“However, a severe economic downturn could hamper the pace of wage growth and possibly lead to more job volatility,” he added."
FWKUJXKTAZ_LQ398RVJZT8XVYS,"4 people were killed on a transit train near Chicago, apparently while sleeping, police say","By Cheri Mossburg and Bill Kirkos, CNN","4 minute read Updated 12:07 PM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240902,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/02/us/4-people-killed-on-train-near-chicago/,"Four people who appeared to be sleeping on a Chicago transit train were fatally shot Monday morning, and a suspect has been taken into custody, police said.
“The victims, they were all passengers on the train early this morning,” said Forest Park Deputy Chief Chris Chin. “The train was in motion on the way into Forest Park.”
The victims may have been homeless, Chin told CNN. Investigators are working with the Chicago Transit Authority to review surveillance footage of the shooting, which police said happened in two train cars: three in one car and the fourth in another.
“We don’t know for sure what (the victims’) social status is. Looking at the videos, they were asleep on the train,” Chin said.
A suspect was taken into custody about an hour an a half after the shooting, which investigators believe to be an isolated incident and a random attack, police said. Surveillance video was instrumental in identifying the suspect, police said.
“The CTA has great cameras. Their surveillance cameras are excellent,” Chin said.
Three agencies — Forest Park police, Chicago police and the CTA — worked together to track and capture the suspect, Chin said.
Chin told CNN the suspect likely exited the train at the Harlem stop on CTA’s Blue Line. He eventually got on the Pink Line, where he was apprehended by police. Law enforcement also recovered a firearm.
“I was able to watch some of the videos and it seems like they were able to track, locate and then identify or at least be able to pinpoint … OK, this is who Forest Park is looking for. And Chicago was able to nab him and we were able to swoop in and take him into custody.”
“Although this was an isolated incident, this heinous and egregious act of violence should never have occurred, none the less on a public transit train,” the transit authority said in a statement.
As investigators continue to comb through the evidence, prosecutors will have 48 hours from the time of his arrest to announce any charges against the suspect.
“This obviously is shocking, you know, it is uncommon to have a mass shooting like this,” said Chin. “This is an isolated incident, so it can happen anywhere. Obviously, there’s a little bit more concern because it is on a mass transit system,” he added. “For people to feel unsafe, it’s justified.”
CTA’s Blue Line spans 27 miles between O’Hare International Airport to Forest Park, passing through or near dozens of neighborhoods and downtown Chicago.

Forest Park Mayor Rory Hoskins said during a news conference the police and fire departments respond to the same area of Forest Park “probably more than any other location in our jurisdiction,” appealing to state leadership for additional public safety resources and law enforcement personnel.
He said he has traveled to Springfield in the past to call for more resources to deal with mental health and opioid addiction.
The mayor described this shooting an “outlier,” saying the city hasn’t really experienced this kind of shooting before.
Monday’s shooting is among 381 mass shootings in the United States so far this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which, like CNN, defines a mass shooting as one with four or more victims, not including the shooter. There have been an average of 1.5 mass shootings per day in the US in 2024.
Hours after the shooting, another passenger was seriously injured in a stabbing on the Red Line, Chicago police said in a statement. The incident began as a verbal altercation between a 37-year-old victim and an unknown man, who at some point took out a “sharp object” and repeatedly stabbed the victim, police said.
“The victim fled from the train at the Wilson Red Line station, and relocated, on foot, to the 4700 block of N. Broadway. The victim was then transported to Illinois Masonic Hospital initially listed in critical condition,” police told CNN.
A suspect in the stabbing has yet to be found and detectives are investigating.

FXBLHV925X_8HZX6O5G67SPK26,Hamas’ brutal new tactics signal new phase in war and hostage crisis,"By Christian Edwards, CNN","7 minute read Updated 9:06 AM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240903,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/03/middleeast/hamas-israel-hostage-deal-raise-stakes-intl/,"Editor’s Note: A version of this story appears in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here.
With its announcement that militants guarding Israeli hostages in the buildings and tunnels of Gaza had “new instructions” to kill them if Israeli troops closed in, Hamas signaled the opening of a chilling new chapter in an already brutal war.
Seizing on a spasm of public outrage in Israel at Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s inability to bring home the remaining hostages, Hamas released a comic book-style image of a kneeling figure threatened with a gun﻿, followed by a video of Eden Yerushalmi, 24, a bartender at the Nova music festival and one of six hostages who Israel says were shot at close range in Hamas captivity last week before Israeli forces could reach them.
In a cruel twist of timing – the funerals of the slain hostages had taken place on Sunday and Monday – Hamas said it would drip-feed footage of what it described as the “final messages” of the remaining five. It released a second video on Tuesday, featuring Ori Danino, a 25-year-old who was abducted from the Nova music festival on October 7. Danino had helped other festival-goers escape the horror. It was not clear when any of the footage was filmed – nor whether it was intended that the videos would be used in this way.
Hamas’ new tactics – which Yerushalmi’s family say amount to “psychological terror” – will further fan the fury in Israeli society. For the past three days, crowds have swelled in multiple Israeli cities, with protesters blaming Netanyahu for, in their view, sacrificing Israeli citizens to stay in power, as right-wing members of his coalition have threatened to bring down the government should he end the war.
After a general strike that brought the country to a near halt on Monday, thousands of protesters took to the streets again on Tuesday, with demonstrations in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Hod HaSharon, Haifa, Herzliya and Ra’anana. In Tel Aviv, some of the largest crowds gathered outside the Begin Gate of the Kirya – the military headquarters – where a site had been set aside for demonstrators including families of hostages to gather. Video footage showed fires on the street, police attempting to extinguish the flames and protesters waving flags and demanding the release of the hostages held in Gaza. Police said later they had arrested three people suspected of rioting.
Yet, it remains far from clear whether such public demonstrations of anger will compel Netanyahu to change Israel’s approach to the war in Gaza.
Some analysts say that unlike earlier in the war, Hamas may no longer believe that keeping hostages gives it leverage over Israel.

“Hamas has taken the hostage issue out of the equation. It knows that this current Israeli administration is not interested in any kind of hostage release deal,” Tahani Mustafa, a senior Palestine analyst at Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank, told CNN. “I don’t think they consider them as substantial playing cards any longer.”
In a statement Monday evening, Hamas spokesperson Abu Obaida said the new instructions had come into place after an “incident” in Nuseirat, seeming to refer to an Israel Defense Forces operation in June that rescued four Israeli hostages from a refugee camp in central Gaza.
The raid, which killed 274 Palestinians, occurred mid-morning when the streets were teeming with people shopping at a nearby market. Some of the captors were killed, and the IDF successfully retrieved the hostages unharmed, further weakening Hamas’ leverage in negotiations with Israel.
Since then, the IDF has rescued one more hostage – Farhan Al-Qadi, 52, a Bedouin Israeli citizen who was retrieved from a tunnel in Gaza last week.
When Hamas took some 250 people hostage from southern Israel on October 7, “they thought they could try to leverage them for a prisoner exchange deal,” Mustafa said. Although an exchange deal was struck as early as November, no further agreement has been reached 10 months later.
The successful rescues may have helped Netanyahu to argue that Israel’s twin war aims of destroying Hamas and returning the hostages can be pursued simultaneously, making the cries for a ceasefire-for-hostages deal less urgent.
But, after the murder of the six hostages under Hamas’ new directive, hundreds of thousands of Israelis took to the streets on Monday to demand Netanyahu’s government strike a deal to free the hostages, in one of the largest demonstrations since the war began. Many wondered if the nationwide outrage might be enough to force his hand.
Instead, a defiant and bellicose Netanyahu used his first public comments since the discovery of the bodies to double down on his strategy in the strip. He said Israel will retaliate strongly against Hamas for the killing of the six hostages, hinting that the response would be akin to the strike against Hezbollah in July that killed the Iran-backed group’s top commander Fu’ad Shukr.
He stressed again his commitment to fighting until Hamas is defeated and repeated his refusal to withdraw soldiers from the border between Gaza and Egypt – a new sticking point threatening once again to derail talks to reach a deal.
Although Netanyahu has refused to cede ground under growing pressure, analysts say the killing of the six hostages by Hamas has been a turning point, leading many in the country to ask whether Israel is reaching the limits of what its military power can achieve, and whether its offensive may be endangering the more than 100 hostages from the country still being held in Gaza.
“The penny that dropped for a lot of Israelis is that going after Hamas is not complementing the return of the hostages. It is hindering and hampering the return of the hostages,” Ori Goldberg, an Israeli political analyst and lecturer at Reichman University in Tel Aviv, told CNN.
“It became very clear that the presence of the IDF played a direct part in the decision of their Hamas keepers to kill them,” he said. “The sense that the Netanyahu government is incompetent, that Netanyahu is doing all of this for his own reasons, is now much more powerful for a lot of people. So I think it is a watershed moment.”
Nimrod Novik, a fellow at the Israel Policy Forum and former senior adviser to the late Prime Minister Shimon Peres, said many Israelis have felt two waves of grief over the past three days: first, for the death of the six hostages, and then, following Netanyahu’s speech, “the realization that Netanyahu is determined to pursue an open-ended occupation of Gaza.”
The death of the six hostages also caused the latest spat between Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. According to reports in Israeli media, the two men argued furiously over whether, as part of any ceasefire deal, the Israeli military should leave the Philadelphi Corridor – a 14-kilometer (8.7-mile) stretch of land running along the border between Gaza and Egypt.
Although Netanyahu has recently begun to strongly insist that Israel maintain a military presence in the corridor for security reasons, Hamas has long been clear that the proposal is a non-starter. Gallant reportedly told Netanyahu that insisting on this condition means “there won’t be an agreement and there won’t be any hostages released.”
Regardless, the cabinet proceeded to vote on the plans Netanyahu presented, approving them by eight to one, with Gallant the only dissenter.
Novik, the former adviser to Peres, said the newfound focus on the Philadelphi Corridor is merely symbolic.
His “discovery” of the corridor and the effective elevation of its status to a holy site “has no security merit,” Novik said.
If anything, an occupation of the corridor – which runs alongside densely populated towns and cities – risks endangering Israeli troops, as Israel’s previous occupation of the territory that ended in 2005 showed, Novik warned.
“They’re sitting ducks,” he said. “And if Hamas managed to kill our troops in 2004 before it had the kind of munitions and equipment that they have today, the results are going to be even more devastating.”
Since the issue of the corridor was raised last month, Hamas has said it will not agree to Netanyahu’s red line.
“At this point, they cannot accept anything short of the demands they are now calling for: A complete cessation of hostilities and the full withdrawal of Israeli troops,” Mustafa said. “If they were to accept anything short of what they’re demanding, that would be political suicide for the movement.”
Netanyahu’s defiant speech on Monday may have extinguished hopes that the killing of the six hostages could lead to a change in course. Former IDF spokesperson Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, who has become more critical of the government since leaving his post earlier this year, said about the remaining hostages after Netanyahu’s speech: “He sealed their fate.”
The insistence on maintaining troops along the corridor may also spell further tension between Israel and the United States, which has throughout the months-long negotiations insisted that Israel must fully withdraw from Gaza after the war.
When asked Monday whether Netanyahu was doing enough to reach an agreement, President Joe Biden said simply: “No.”

G251002DX9_1QB3ML8JSPE25K0,China-Africa ties ‘best in history’ claims Xi as Beijing pushes back on Western debt trap criticism,"By Simone McCarthy, CNN","6 minute read Updated 8:28 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/05/china/china-africa-forum-xi-speech-aid-pledge-intl-hnk/,"Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.
China is enjoying its “best in history” ties with African nations, leader Xi Jinping said on Thursday, as he pledged $50 billion in financial support for the continent in addition to military aid.
China and Africa should rally their populations together to become a “powerful force” and write a “new chapter in peace, prosperity and progress,” Xi said in a sweeping speech to delegates from more than 50 African nations as he sought to bolster relationships seen as key to Beijing’s position as a rising global power.
Flanked by African dignitaries seated on stage in the cavernous Great Hall of the People in Beijing, Xi said “China-Africa relations are at their best in history,” and vowed to elevate China’s bilateral relations with all African countries with which it has formal ties to the level of “strategic relations.”
Xi separately pledged another $280 million in aid to African countries, split evenly between military and food assistance. The announcements are a sign Beijing wants to demonstrate its commitment to the continent, despite a recent slowdown in its overseas development lending and as Africa struggles with its foreign debt, including those owed to China.
The pledge of $140 million in military aid is the largest amount that China has earmarked for this purpose at the three-yearly Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, signaling the increasing importance of security in the relationship between Beijing and its partners in Africa. In 2018, China said it would provide $100 million to support the African Standby Force and African Capacity for Immediate Response to Crisis.
Leaders including South Africa’s Cyril Ramaphosa, Kenya’s William Ruto and Nigeria’s Bola Tinubu assembled in the Chinese capital this week for the three-day forum that Beijing has hailed as its largest diplomatic gathering in years.
This year’s event comes amid questions about the direction of those relations as Beijing, long the driving foreign economic power in Africa, has been recalibrating its extensive economic ties to the continent, while other major powers are ramping up their own efforts to engage Africa.
China has been pulling back on big-ticket spending under Xi’s signature Belt and Road Initiative. That infrastructure drive saw it fund projects like railways, roads and power plants and expand its influence on the continent. However, it also faced criticism that unsustainable lending contributed to heavy international debt loads now shouldered by many African countries.
Xi did not mention these debt challenges in his address but did make broad pledges for China to deepen cooperation with Africa in industry, agriculture, infrastructure, trade and investment.
Xi’s pledge of $50 billion to the continent over the next three years — a mix of credit funds, assistance and private investment from Chinese firms — outstrips a previous pledge made three years ago of around $30 billion during a prior iteration of the forum in Dakar, Senegal.
While lower than the $60 billion pledged in 2015 and 2018 respectively, it appears to be aimed at sending a strong signal to visiting leaders about China’s commitment to the continent.
In his 10-minute speech, Xi outlined 10 action areas for cooperation over the coming three years, including infrastructure connectivity, trade, security and green development – an area where Beijing is widely seen as pushing to enhance its exports of green technology.
He also pledged to create at least 1 million jobs for Africa.
It’s unclear how Xi’s pledges would align in practice with the expectations from visiting African leaders, analysts say. Fulfillment of past pledges has also been difficult to track, they say.

Leaders in Beijing are seeking investment, trade, and support to industrialize and create jobs. That includes a push for China to import more processed goods from Africa, rather than simply exporting and processing raw materials – like Africa’s highly sought after critical minerals.
Following Xi’s speech, African leaders also gave remarks, with South Africa’s Ramaphosa praising China’s “solidarity” with the continent. He pointed to global challenges including conflict, climate change and a “global contestation for critical minerals” that is fueling geopolitical rivalry.
“These challenges affect all nations but are more often severely felt on the African continent, yet amid these challenges there is hope and opportunity,” he said.
Speaking later on the sidelines of the summit, Senegal’s Foreign Minister Yassine Fall told reporters that there would always be global competition but observers should look to evidence of the “quality of partnership between Africa and China.”
“You see how Africans today are saying that China is on our side,” Fall said.
This year’s gathering comes as China’s longstanding relations with Africa appear even more critical for Beijing amid rising frictions with Washington.
The US and Europe have also been ramping up their own efforts to engage Africa and access its critical minerals, widely seen as a bid to counter inroads that China has made both politically and in the continent’s resources sector.
In his address, Xi played up what Beijing hopes is a kindred political stance with the continent, hailing a joint vision for “shared future,” a key buzzword he uses to denote alignment with China’s vision for a world order that provides an alternative to the one championed by the US.
He also pointed to what he described as the “great suffering” of developing countries under the West’s historical process of modernization.
Observers say Beijing is even more keen to use this year’s gathering to signal its ongoing commitment, given concerns about its role in high levels of debt among African nations.
China is not seen by analysts to be the main cause of African debt distress in most cases, as countries also owe huge sums to multilateral banks and private lenders. But its hefty loans have upped debt burdens and Beijing has been criticized for not moving quickly enough or being flexible in helping distressed or at-risk countries.
“With the intensification of this great power competition with the United States, China is coming to the realization that it has to rely on the Global South as the foundation for its diplomacy,” said Yun Sun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center think tank in Washington.
“The choice of African countries in this great power competition is becoming more important than ever, because Africa is such a big block in the Global South,” she said.
In a press conference later Thursday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi acknowledged other countries were turning their attention toward Africa.
“As Africa’s good friend, China is happy for that, we also welcome more countries for their support and assistance to Africa,” he said, adding that any “condescending approach” must be rejected.
Xi’s push to bolster security is also a sign of how Beijing is looking to expand its strategic partnership with a region that has emerged as a key node in China’s military ambitions.
The People’s Liberation Army opened its first and only overseas military base in Djibouti in 2017, and its navy has made regular port calls in different African countries amid concern in Washington that Beijing could seek to open an Atlantic base.
In addition to the $140 million in military assistance announced Thursday, Xi pledged to train 6,000 military personnel and 1,000 law enforcement officers and establish a “partnership with Africa to implement the Global Security Initiative,” referring to his broader vision to reshape global security architecture away from the US alliance-based security system.
Security cooperation also has a pragmatic angle for Beijing, whose companies’ mining operations in Africa have been subject to criminal attacks.
Xi alluded to this in his comments, calling for China and Africa to “jointly maintain the safety of personnel and projects.”
However, analysts note that while China plays a substantial role in United Nations peacekeeping efforts, it’s seen as less likely to want to get involved directly in regional conflicts, even as it continues to push for other collaborations in the security realm.
China “is very proactive in understanding the mindset of the region,” said Ovigwe Eguegu, a Nigeria-based policy analyst at the consultancy Development Reimagined, and now it sees “there is a lot of dissatisfaction with the current global security order.”

The raid, which killed 274 Palestinians, occurred mid-morning when the streets were teeming with people shopping at a nearby market. Some of the captors were killed, and the IDF successfully retrieved the hostages unharmed, further weakening Hamas’ leverage in negotiations with Israel.
Since then, the IDF has rescued one more hostage – Farhan Al-Qadi, 52, a Bedouin Israeli citizen who was retrieved from a tunnel in Gaza last week.
When Hamas took some 250 people hostage from southern Israel on October 7, “they thought they could try to leverage them for a prisoner exchange deal,” Mustafa said. Although an exchange deal was struck as early as November, no further agreement has been reached 10 months later.
The successful rescues may have helped Netanyahu to argue that Israel’s twin war aims of destroying Hamas and returning the hostages can be pursued simultaneously, making the cries for a ceasefire-for-hostages deal less urgent.
But, after the murder of the six hostages under Hamas’ new directive, hundreds of thousands of Israelis took to the streets on Monday to demand Netanyahu’s government strike a deal to free the hostages, in one of the largest demonstrations since the war began. Many wondered if the nationwide outrage might be enough to force his hand.
Instead, a defiant and bellicose Netanyahu used his first public comments since the discovery of the bodies to double down on his strategy in the strip. He said Israel will retaliate strongly against Hamas for the killing of the six hostages, hinting that the response would be akin to the strike against Hezbollah in July that killed the Iran-backed group’s top commander Fu’ad Shukr.
He stressed again his commitment to fighting until Hamas is defeated and repeated his refusal to withdraw soldiers from the border between Gaza and Egypt – a new sticking point threatening once again to derail talks to reach a deal.
Although Netanyahu has refused to cede ground under growing pressure, analysts say the killing of the six hostages by Hamas has been a turning point, leading many in the country to ask whether Israel is reaching the limits of what its military power can achieve, and whether its offensive may be endangering the more than 100 hostages from the country still being held in Gaza.
“The penny that dropped for a lot of Israelis is that going after Hamas is not complementing the return of the hostages. It is hindering and hampering the return of the hostages,” Ori Goldberg, an Israeli political analyst and lecturer at Reichman University in Tel Aviv, told CNN.
“It became very clear that the presence of the IDF played a direct part in the decision of their Hamas keepers to kill them,” he said. “The sense that the Netanyahu government is incompetent, that Netanyahu is doing all of this for his own reasons, is now much more powerful for a lot of people. So I think it is a watershed moment.”
Nimrod Novik, a fellow at the Israel Policy Forum and former senior adviser to the late Prime Minister Shimon Peres, said many Israelis have felt two waves of grief over the past three days: first, for the death of the six hostages, and then, following Netanyahu’s speech, “the realization that Netanyahu is determined to pursue an open-ended occupation of Gaza.”
The death of the six hostages also caused the latest spat between Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. According to reports in Israeli media, the two men argued furiously over whether, as part of any ceasefire deal, the Israeli military should leave the Philadelphi Corridor – a 14-kilometer (8.7-mile) stretch of land running along the border between Gaza and Egypt.
Although Netanyahu has recently begun to strongly insist that Israel maintain a military presence in the corridor for security reasons, Hamas has long been clear that the proposal is a non-starter. Gallant reportedly told Netanyahu that insisting on this condition means “there won’t be an agreement and there won’t be any hostages released.”
Regardless, the cabinet proceeded to vote on the plans Netanyahu presented, approving them by eight to one, with Gallant the only dissenter.
Novik, the former adviser to Peres, said the newfound focus on the Philadelphi Corridor is merely symbolic.
His “discovery” of the corridor and the effective elevation of its status to a holy site “has no security merit,” Novik said.
If anything, an occupation of the corridor – which runs alongside densely populated towns and cities – risks endangering Israeli troops, as Israel’s previous occupation of the territory that ended in 2005 showed, Novik warned.
“They’re sitting ducks,” he said. “And if Hamas managed to kill our troops in 2004 before it had the kind of munitions and equipment that they have today, the results are going to be even more devastating.”
Since the issue of the corridor was raised last month, Hamas has said it will not agree to Netanyahu’s red line.
“At this point, they cannot accept anything short of the demands they are now calling for: A complete cessation of hostilities and the full withdrawal of Israeli troops,” Mustafa said. “If they were to accept anything short of what they’re demanding, that would be political suicide for the movement.”
Netanyahu’s defiant speech on Monday may have extinguished hopes that the killing of the six hostages could lead to a change in course. Former IDF spokesperson Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, who has become more critical of the government since leaving his post earlier this year, said about the remaining hostages after Netanyahu’s speech: “He sealed their fate.”
The insistence on maintaining troops along the corridor may also spell further tension between Israel and the United States, which has throughout the months-long negotiations insisted that Israel must fully withdraw from Gaza after the war.
When asked Monday whether Netanyahu was doing enough to reach an agreement, President Joe Biden said simply: “No.”

G3K09SIVBV_LEJHZUJEJP6Q5RM,Analysis: Trump is still telling lies he told eight years ago,"By Daniel Dale, CNN","5 minute read Published 5:00 AM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240903,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/03/politics/trump-fact-checking-analysis/,"In a speech last week to the National Guard Association of the United States, former President Donald Trump claimed that he was the president who “created” the Veterans Choice health care program, and got it “passed in Congress,” after others had wanted to do so “for 57 years.”
In reality, President Barack Obama was the president who signed the program into law in 2014. The law Trump signed in 2018, the VA MISSION Act, expanded the Veterans Choice program but didn’t create it.
I could fact-check this Trump lie half-asleep – because he’s been telling it for more than six years.
Trump’s lying is most exceptional in its relentlessness, a never-ending avalanche of wrongness that can bury even the most devoted fact-checkers. But it’s also notable for its repetitiveness. He has found his hits, and he’ll keep playing them no matter how many times they are debunked.
As Trump enters the post-Labor Day sprint of his 2024 campaign for the presidency, his commentary is filled with many of the same false claims he made as president from 2017 to 2021. He’s even repeating some of the false claims he used during his 2016 presidential campaign.
As a fact-check reporter for CNN, I watch or read the transcript of every public appearance by Trump and his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris. While Harris’ campaign remarks to date have been heavy on thematic rhetoric and light on assertions of fact, with a smattering of false or misleading claims, Trump’s 2024 interviews and speeches are littered with old falsehoods I’ve come to call “the repeats” – assertions I have fact-checked as false over and over for years.
For example, Trump falsely claimed on a podcast last week that people are saying global warming will cause the oceans to rise just “an eighth of an inch in 355 years.” He was saying near-identical nonsense in 2019. (Sea levels are already rising more than an eighth of an inch per year.)
Trump falsely claimed at a rally last month that his tariffs on imported Chinese goods are paid by China, not Americans, and that no previous president had generated even “10 cents” from tariffs on Chinese goods. He was saying the same in 2018. (The tariff payments are made by US importers, not Chinese exporters, and the US government was already generating billions per year from such tariffs before Trump took office.)
Trump falsely claimed in a speech in mid-August that he had warned the US not to invade Iraq. That claim was a key part of his campaign pitch in 2015 and 2016. (Trump expressed tentative support for the 2003 invasion about six months before it occurred, did not express a firm opinion on an invasion about two months before it occurred, and only came out as an opponent of the war post-invasion.)
Trump’s false claims in the podcast interview last week that some NATO members were “delinquent” and “owed … huge amounts of money” before he took office were also staples of his 2016 run. (NATO members didn’t owe anybody money even if they were not meeting the alliance’s voluntary 2%-of-GDP guideline for their own defense spending.)
Trump’s regular false claims of a “rigged” 2020 election echo his language from both his 2016 campaign and 2020 campaign. (The claims were baseless then and are baseless now.)
And less importantly, when Trump declared in June, July and again on Thursday that he had been named “Man of the Year” in Michigan long before he entered politics, it was the third straight presidential election he had told this silly lie he debuted in 2016. (There is no evidence the award even exists, let alone that Trump, who has never lived in Michigan, received it.)
Nobody really knows how much of Trump’s deployment of old lies is strategic and how much is mere force of habit. Regardless, his persistence produces a clear benefit for him.
News outlets tend to focus on new material. While some outlets may be inclined to fact-check a false Trump claim the first, second, third or even 10th time he utters it, they are far less likely to devote precious resources to a claim on the 100th or 150th utterance – especially because he is constantly mixing in dozens of new lies that require time and resources to address. And so, by virtue of shameless perseverance, Trump often manages to outlast most of the media’s willingness to correct any particular falsehood, eventually getting that claim into news coverage and social media clips nearly uncorrected.
That’s not to say his lying is an unmitigated victory.
Numerous polls have found for years that a clear majority of voters do not see Trump as honest; from talking to Americans around the country since 2015, I know there are a lot of people who distrust almost anything he says. I have no doubt that his insistence on continuing to say dozens of things people have already learned are false is part of the reason why.
Still, I try to match Trump’s tirelessness in lying with my own tirelessness in challenging the lies. The separation of fact from fiction is central to journalists’ role in the democratic process, and there are always citizens out there who are hearing even the stalest of deceptions for the first time.
So as long as Trump or any other major political figure keeps reviving their past nonsense, we should keep debunking that nonsense. Even if we already did it eight years ago."
G9HU1GEAK0_XNEMAAP7GC9W9HE,"US captures ISIS leader who helped terror group escapees, military says","By Oren Liebermann, CNN","2 minute read Published 4:58 PM EDT, Mon September 2, 2024",20240903,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/02/politics/us-captures-isis-leader/,"The US captured an ISIS leader who helped escapees of the terror group after they fled a detention facility in Syria, according to US Central Command.
Working with the Syrian Democratic Forces, the US captured Khaled Ahmed al-Dandal early Sunday morning. Al-Dandal helped ISIS fighters who had escaped from detention facilities in Syria, including recently escaped fighters, CENTCOM said.
Last week, five ISIS detainees escaped from the Raqqa detention facility in Syria. The Syrian Democratic Forces recaptured two of the escapees, but the other three remain at large, CENTCOM said.
More than 9,000 ISIS detainees are held in over 20 detention facilities in Syria. The US is working to repatriate as many of the detainees as possible, but the process is incredibly slow. The large number of ISIS detainees held in the facility has made them a target for ISIS attacks as the group tries to free the prisoners.
“If a large number of these ISIS fighters escaped, it would pose an extreme danger to the region and beyond,” said Gen. Erik Kurilla, the commander of US Central Command. “We will continue to work with  the international community to repatriate these ISIS fighters to their countries of origin for final adjudication.”
The capture of al-Dandal comes just days after a separate raid against ISIS in Iraq in which seven US service members were wounded. Conducted with the Iraqi Security Forces, the operation killed 15 ISIS militants, US officials said, as the militaries targeted the hideouts of several ISIS leaders.
All of the injured service members are stable, according to three defense officials, and one of the injured was evacuated out of the region for additional care."
G9PJ3YR88R_4L8ACJ0VI7VTWMG,Man accused of plotting wife’s rape by at least 50 strangers over almost 10 years in French trial,"By Camille Knight, Emmanuel Miculita and Caroline Baum, CNN","4 minute read Updated 4:02 PM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240903,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/03/europe/france-rape-trial-intl-latam/,"A man is on trial accused of repeatedly drugging and raping his wife, as well as encouraging dozens of other men to rape her in their home while she was unconscious, court documents show.
The alleged victim, Gisèle, 72, appeared in a courtroom in Avignon, France, on Monday for the opening of the trial, sunglasses on, her daughter and two sons by her side.
For the next four months, she will come face to face with her accused abusers, most of whom are complete strangers to her.
Prosecutors say the defendant, Dominique, 71, would recruit men online to rape his wife, after drugging her with sleeping pills and anti-anxiety medication. CNN is not using the full names of the man and wife to protect the identities of other family members.
He faces nine charges including several counts of rape with aggravating circumstances, the drugging of a victim to commit rape, and the sharing of images related to those assaults.
Prosecutors were able to put together a case because Dominique documented a number of the alleged assaults on camera.
Held in pre-trial detention since 2020, courtroom sketches show the defendant entered the courtroom in a black t-shirt and sat facing his wife.
“He recognizes that he’s done what he has done,” his lawyer, Béatrice Zavarro told journalists in court on Monday. “There was not an ounce of contestation during the whole investigation.”
In the dock, the men accused of taking part in these rapes sat with their heads down.
Police have identified at least 92 sexual assaults committed by 72 men, with ages ranging from 26 to 74, court documents show.
Fifty were identified, and most have been charged with either aggravated or attempted rape and are standing trial alongside Gisèle’s husband.
The ordeal lasted almost ten years, the first alleged assaults dating back to 2011.
The crimes came to light in 2020 when Dominique was caught filming under women’s skirts in a shopping center.
After police seized his phone and computer, they say they found evidence of the rapes. An investigation was opened and the wife was made aware of the abuse she had endured for almost ten years.
Court documents show that Dominique has told investigators that the other men were all aware his wife had been drugged without her knowledge, something a number of the other defendants deny.
Christophe Huguenin-Virchaux, a lawyer for one of the men told CNN affiliate BFMTV on Tuesday that his client “admits that sexual relations did in fact take place” but that they took place as part of a “sexual game between a husband and his wife that he was invited to,” adding that he was “not aware that Gisèle was drugged or under medication.”
Throughout the trial, Gisèle will see and hear what was done to her.
On Tuesday, she sat through a reading of the horrific acts she was subjected to, as well as the arguments from each of the defendants’ lawyers.
“It was very difficult,” one of her lawyers, Stéphane Babonneau told CNN on Tuesday. “It was unbearable for her to hear people say they thought she was pretending to sleep and were convinced it was consensual,” he added.
Last Friday ahead of the trial, another one of her lawyers, Antoine Arebalo-Camus told reporters “she had no idea what had been inflicted on her, so she has no memory of the rapes she suffered for 10 years.”
Gisèle could have requested the trial be held privately, but Babonneau told CNN “she wanted it to be a public trial so that everyone can hear and get an idea of the excuses given by men in such circumstances.”
Gisèle’s daughter says her mother sought medical advice for the memory loss and extreme fatigue she was experiencing as a side effect of the drugs.
Speaking to French media in several interviews, she said that her mother “saw doctors, she saw neurologists,” and that the medical profession failed to detect the problem.
The daughter has now started an awareness campaign called “M’endors Pas,” meaning “Don’t put me to sleep” on drug-facilitated sexual assault.
The trial began on September 2 in the southern French town of Avignon, and a verdict is due on December 20 this year."
G9S1OE2KSC_K892OYQAKE144M4,Michigan judge denies RFK Jr. request to be removed from ballot,"By Aaron Pellish, CNN","2 minute read Published 6:57 PM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/03/politics/rfk-jr-michigan-ballot-removal-request-denied/,"A Michigan judge ruled Tuesday that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. must remain on the ballot in the battleground state after he filed a lawsuit asking the court to remove him, inhibiting his plan to withdraw from key states to ease former President Donald Trump’s path to victory after endorsing him last month.
Michigan Court of Claims Judge Christopher Yates dismissed Kennedy’s request to be removed after he qualified for the ballot through a minor party earlier this year. Kennedy had initially requested the Michigan secretary of state’s office remove him from the ballot, but that request was denied.
“Elections are not just games, and the Secretary of State … is not obligated to honor the whims of candidates for public office,” Yates wrote in the ruling Tuesday.
The judge added that Kennedy’s request to withdraw as the Natural Law Party’s presidential nominee “at this late date is just a self-serving act that would cause harm to the party that nominated him by leaving the party with no candidate at the top of the ticket.”
The ruling undermines the strategy Kennedy is pursuing to withdraw his name from competitive states’ ballots in order to boost Trump’s chances of winning in those states. Kennedy is also continuing to push for ballot access in states where his name won’t likely have an impact on the outcome of November’s election.
Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said in a social media post Tuesday that candidates who accept the nomination of a minor party in Michigan “shall not be permitted to withdraw.” Her statement came in response to a post from Trump ally Rudy Giuliani, who claimed the decision to keep Kennedy on the ballot in Michigan is “election interference.”
While Kennedy has been able to remove his name from the ballot in several key states, he has encountered obstacles in other states besides Michigan. Wisconsin’s elections office ruled last week Kennedy will appear on the ballot despite his request to withdraw. And Kennedy filed a lawsuit last week against North Carolina’s elections board challenging their decision to keep him on the ballot.

GBVZZH7NJK_SC0SLOM6UN7TSE7,US prosecutors charge Russian-American political pundit of violating sanctions,"By Hannah Rabinowitz and Holmes Lybrand, CNN","3 minute read Updated 3:21 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/05/politics/dimitri-simes-criminal-charges-russia/,"The Justice Department unsealed criminal charges against Russian-American political pundit Dimitri Simes on Thursday, alleging he was paid more than $1 million from a Russian news outlet in violation of US sanctions.
According to the indictment, Simes coordinated and communicated with the Russian government, including President Vladimir Putin, while hosting a show for RT, the Russian state media network.
Simes would work with the Russian government over what the show would cover and how, the indictment says, highlighting coverage over the war with Ukraine that was favorable to Russia.
Simes was a prominent part of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into election interference in the 2016 presidential election.
Mueller’s team found that Simes had contacts with several members of Trump’s campaign, including Jared Kushner, over the campaign’s positions on Russia.
The special counsel did not uncover any evidence that Simes passed any information from Russia to the Trump campaign and, when Simes brought up Russian contacts to Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law told him it would be “bad optics for the Campaign to develop hidden Russian contacts,” according to the report.
Simes is charged alongside his wife, Anastasia Simes. The two are facing three charges for money laundering and violating both the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the Emergency Economic Powers Act.
Simes left the United States in 2022 after obtaining Russian citizenship and has not returned, according to court documents. It was not immediately clear if Simes has an attorney.
The FBI searched Simes’ home last month. The bureau also searched the homes of other Americans who have worked with Russia’s state television networks.
The charges come just one day after the Biden administration launched a broad campaign to combat Russian efforts to interfere with the upcoming presidential election in the United States.
That multipronged strategy included charges against two employees of RT accused of participating in a scheme that funneled nearly $10 million to set up and direct a Tennessee-based front company to produce online content aimed at sowing divisions among Americans.
The indictment against Simes, which did not mention the upcoming US election, details his salary and other perks he received while hosting a show for the sanctioned RT media outlet.
“Simes received funds and services from Channel One Russia after it was sanctioned,” the indictment says, “including monthly salary payments totaling over $1 million; a personal car and driver; a stipend for an apartment in Moscow, Russia; health insurance; business-class plane tickets between Washington, D.C., and Moscow, Russia; a team of ten employees, including an assistant; and efforts by Channel One Russia to promote his ‘positive image’ in mass media.”
For his work, according to court documents, in late 2023 the Russian government honored Simes with an award for his show.

GO0HEEAFL4_G7TLKM98U8RFFY1,"An artist made scathing sculptures of Mao over a decade ago. Now, he’s detained for slandering China’s heroes, family says","By Nectar Gan, CNN","7 minute read Published 8:34 PM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/03/style/china-detains-artist-gao-brothers-mao-intl-hnk/,"A prominent Chinese artist known for his scathing political critiques of Mao Zedong and the Cultural Revolution has been detained in China, according to his brother and artistic partner.
Gao Zhen, 68, was detained last week in a police raid on his art studio on the outskirts of Beijing on suspicion of slandering China’s “heroes and martyrs,” his younger brother Gao Qiang told CNN Sunday in an email from New York. The criminal offense, introduced in 2021, is punishable by up to three years in prison.
The public security bureau that Gao Qiang said had detained his brother, in Hebei province’s Sanhe city, declined to comment.
At the height of their careers, the Gao Brothers created provocative sculptures of Mao in a country notoriously sensitive about its former ruler’s legacy. But that was well over a decade ago — during a relatively liberal era for artistic expression before China took an authoritarian turn under leader Xi Jinping.
Now, some of those older works have been seized by police as evidence against Gao Zhen, his brother said.
They include “Mao’s Guilt,” a life-size bronze cast created in 2009 that depicts the former Chinese Communist Party leader kneeling, hand on heart, in repentance; “The Execution of Christ,” created that same year, which features a firing squad of life-sized Chairman Maos pointing their bayoneted rifles at Jesus; and a collection of busts named “Miss Mao,” which come in various sizes and colors, sporting a Pinocchio-like nose and large, naked breasts.
The avant-garde artists’ latest works had not been as politically sensitive or explicitly critical of Chinese leaders, their friends say. Gao Zhen had lived a quiet life in China and spent most days in his studio prior to moving to the US, Du Yinghong, a fellow artist who has known the brothers for nearly two decades, told CNN in a phone call.
Due to the “deteriorating environment” in China, Gao Zhen relocated to New York two years ago when his son, an American citizen born in the US, reached school age, Gao Qiang said.
The artist returned to China in June with his wife and son to visit family. “Before he set off, his friends and family — myself included — had all reminded him to consider whether it was safe to go,” Gao Qiang said. “He himself also thought he might encounter problems, but still, as if driven by fate, he went back.”

At first, everything seemed fine. Gao Zhen kept in touch during his trip and regularly posted on the Chinese social messaging app WeChat. In July, he organized a birthday party for his son who had turned 6 years old.
But on August 26, just over a week before the family was scheduled to fly back to the US, about 30 police raided the Gao Brothers’ studio in Yanjiao, a town on the border of Beijing and neighboring Hebei province, to “search for evidence,” Gao Qiang said.
Police demanded the artist hand over his phone. Gao Zhen refused and was forcibly handcuffed and taken away, according to his brother.
Gao Zhen’s wife received his detention notice the following day from the public security bureau in Sanhe, Gao Qiang said, adding that she had been warned by police not to speak to the media about her husband’s detention.
The police returned to the studio on August 27 to search for more evidence, according to Gao Qiang.
“A few days before his arrest, Gao Zhen told me that he was organizing his Yanjiao studio and had destroyed some unfinished sculptures in stock, including those of ‘Miss Mao,’” Gao Qiang said in an email.
“He is nearly 70 years old and naturally prone to melancholy. I am very concerned about his physical and mental health.”
Under Xi, the ruling Communist Party has vowed to eradicate “historical nihilism” — or any views that question or challenge its official version of history, including glorified images of sanctified national heroes.
China passed a law in 2018 banning any insult or slander of national “heroes and martyrs,” including military personnel. The offense was added to the country’s criminal code three years later.
Since then, the law has been used to jail a popular blogger who doubted the official death toll of Chinese soldiers in a border clash with India, and a former investigative journalist who questioned China’s role in the Korean War, as depicted in a patriotic movie.
And last year, a stand-up comedian was investigated by police for the same offense after making a joke that referenced a military slogan at a show in Beijing. It cost him his job and his employer more than $2 million in fines, though police later dropped the case and did not press charges.
Around that time, another Chinese contemporary artist, Yue Minjun, faced the wrath of online nationalists for “uglifying” and “insulting” China’s military with his iconic grinning self-portraits, but the authorities did not act on those accusations.
That makes Gao Zhen the first Chinese artist known to be detained under the law.

His brother and friends wonder why authorities appear to be targeting the Gaos’ works retroactively, as they were created many years before the law came into force.
“The artworks collected as evidence by the police were all created more than a decade ago as part of an artistic reflection on Mao’s Cultural Revolution,” Gao Qiang said. “Imposing retroactive punishment for actions taken before the new law took effect goes against the widely accepted legal principle of non-retroactivity.”
The Gaos hail from a generation of Chinese artists who pushed the boundaries of creative expression by offering an unflinching glimpse into the dark chapters of their country’s past.
The upheaval of the Cultural Revolution, which roiled China in the 1960s and 1970s, inflicted indelible pain on the Gao family.
The brothers were just 6 and 12 years old when their father, a factory worker, was labeled a class enemy and thrown into detention at the height of the decade-long turmoil. Twenty-five days later, the family of six brothers was told that their father committed suicide “out of guilt for being a counter-revolutionary,” but they believed he was persecuted and killed.
“Our father’s death was a devastating disaster for our family.” Gao Zhen told the Southern People Weekly, a once-outspoken news outlet, in 2010. “We constantly worried that our mother would take her own life, but she raised us with an extraordinary resilience that few could compare to.” After the Cultural Revolution ended, Gao Zhen took the train to Beijing to petition his father’s death. The family was eventually given about 3,000 yuan (then equivalent to about $2,000) in compensation, the Gao brothers wrote in an article in 2004.
Friends who know the Gao Brothers say they used art to express their grief, with Mao being a recurring feature of their work in the late 1990s and 2000s.
“It was really an artistic phase; it’s not all their work. But this is why people remember them, because it was a very political, very direct critique,” said a friend who has known the brothers for over two decades.
In recent years, the brothers created works featuring world leaders including Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, as well as pieces showing support for Ukraine, according to the friend, who requested anonymity over safety concerns.
“There’s no logic to arrest (Gao Zhen) now,” she said. “They were not the only ones; many Chinese artists of that generation made very critical art back then… I guess they will be afraid now.”
Even during China’s more liberal years, however, the brothers had several run-ins with authorities over their controversial artworks. Police shut down their exhibitions, confiscated their politically sensitive works, and even intimidated visitors by stationing guards outside their old studio in Beijing’s 798 art district.
“But after we promised that our studio would not be open for public display, we hadn’t run into major problems,” Gao Qiang said.

The duo went on to attract international acclaim. They held exhibitions in Paris, New York, Moscow and Berlin, with some of their works collected by prestigious museums, from the Centre Pompidou in Paris to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.
The two brothers obtained permanent residency in the US in 2011 and traveled frequently between Beijing and New York. Gao Qiang moved to the US a few years before his brother and has not returned to China since.
Two years ago, their Beijing studio was forced to shut down, and Gao Zhen moved his studio to Yanjiao, about 40 kilometers (about 25 miles) away, his brother said.
Gao Zhen’s detention shows that freedom of expression in China has shrunk significantly compared to a decade ago, Gao Qiang said.
“A healthy society should move towards the broadening of thoughts and actions, instead of the other way around,” he added."
GOGS2AO5PS_BTX9WRCX9VG8SSK,Exclusive: US seizes Venezuela President Nicolas Maduro’s airplane in the Dominican Republic,"By Priscilla Alvarez and Abel Alvarado, CNN","6 minute read Updated 12:34 AM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240902,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/02/politics/us-seizes-venezuela-president-maduros-airplane/,"The United States has seized Venezuela President Nicolas Maduro’s airplane after determining that its acquisition was in violation of US sanctions, among other criminal issues. The US flew the aircraft to Florida on Monday, according to two US officials.
It’s the latest development in what has long been a frosty relationship between the US and Venezuela, and its seizure in the Dominican Republic marks an escalation as the US continues to investigate what it regards as corrupt practices by Venezuela’s government.
“This sends a message all the way up to the top,” one of the US officials told CNN. “Seizing the foreign head of state’s plane is unheard-of for criminal matters. We’re sending a clear message here that no one is above the law, no one is above the reach of US sanctions.”
The plane has been described by officials as Venezuela’s equivalent to Air Force One and it  has been pictured in previous state visits by Maduro around the world.
The Dominican Republic’s President Luis Abinader said the plane seized by the US on Monday was not registered under the name of the Venezuelan government, but rather under “the name of an individual.”
Foreign Minister of the Dominican Republic Roberto Álvarez said the country’s Attorney General’s Office received an order last May from a national court to “immobilize” the plane. The US had requested it be immobilized so they could search it for “evidence and objects linked to fraud activities, smuggling of goods for illicit activities and money laundering,” he said.
In a statement, US Attorney General Merrick Garland said that “the Justice Department seized an aircraft we allege was illegally purchased for $13 million through a shell company and smuggled out of the United States for use by Nicolás Maduro and his cronies.”
The plane, a Dassault Falcon 900EX, was purchased from a company in Florida, the Justice Department said, and was illegally exported in April 2023 from the United States to Venezuela through the Caribbean. It was used for Maduro’s international travels, and flew “almost exclusively to and from a military base in Venezuela,” according to the Justice Department.
Records show that the plane’s last registered flight was in March, flying from Caracas to the Dominican capital of Santo Domingo.
A second plane linked to Maduro’s regime is under 24-hour surveillance by authorities in the Dominican Republic, a source with knowledge of the matter told CNN.
The source did not specify details about the plane’s model, make or whether the aircraft had been requested to be immobilized.
The Venezuelan government described the Falcon’s seizure as “piracy” in a statement on Monday, and accused Washington of escalating “aggression” toward Maduro’s government following a contested presidential election this July.
“Once again, the authorities of the USA, in a recurring criminal practice that could not be labeled anything but piracy, have illegally seized an aircraft that has been used by the president of the Republic, justifying its action in coercive measures that, illegally and unilaterally, they impose around the world,” it said.
“The United States has already demonstrated that it uses its economic and military power to intimidate and pressure states such as the Dominican Republic to serve as accomplices in its criminal acts. This is an example of the supposed ‘rules-based order’, which, disregarding international law, seeks to establish the law of the strongest,” it said.
For years, US officials have sought to disrupt the flow of billions of dollars to the regime. Homeland Security Investigations — the second largest investigative agency in the federal government — has seized dozens of luxury vehicles, among other assets, heading to Venezuela.
“The plane was seized in violation of US sanctions with Venezuela and other criminal matters that we’re still looking at regarding this aircraft,” Anthony Salisbury,Special Agent in Charge, Homeland Security Investigations told CNN.
A high-ranking official from the Dominican Republic told CNN that Maduro’s aircraft had been in Dominican territory undergoing maintenance at the time it was seized by US authorities. The source added that the government had no record that Maduro’s private plane was in the country until it was seized.
US officials worked closely with the Dominican Republic, which notified Venezuela of the seizure, according to one of the US officials.

Multiple federal agencies were involved in the seizure, including Homeland Security Investigations; Commerce agents, the Bureau of Industry and Security; and the Justice Department.
The Dominican Republic’s Foreign Minister said the government did not participate in the US’ investigation and only “international legal cooperation” was required under the two countries’ bilateral agreements.
One of the next steps, upon arriving to the US, will be pursuing forfeiture, meaning the Venezuelan government has a chance to petition for it, and collecting evidence from the aircraft.
The US recently placed pressure on the Venezuelan government to “immediately” release specific data regarding its presidential election, citing concerns about the credibility of Maduro’s claimed victory.
Venezuela’s opposition has published more than 80% of tallies printed and collected from voting machines across the country. Though partial, the documentation appears to show that the opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia actually won the vote, several experts told CNN.
The situation in Venezuela has had implications for US politics as millions flee the country, many of whom have chosen to migrate to the US-Mexico border.
Earlier this year, the US reimposed sanctions on Venezuela’s oil and gas sector in response to the Maduro government’s failure to allow “an inclusive and competitive election” to take place.
After the controversial reelection of Maduro on July 28, Venezuela suspended commercial flights to and from the Dominican Republic.
Federal agencies, including HSI, have long been going after the Venezuelan government over corruption concerns. Over recent years, HSI has disrupted $2 billion worth of the Venezuelan government’s illicit proceeds or resources, including judgements, seizures, liquidation of bank accounts, according to one of the US officials.
In March 2020, the US Department of Justice charged Maduro, together with 14 current and former Venezuelan officials, with narco-terrorism, drug trafficking and corruption.
“For more than 20 years, Maduro and a number of high-ranking colleagues allegedly conspired with (Colombian left-wing guerrilla group) the FARC, causing tons of cocaine to enter and devastate American communities.,” then-Attorney General William Barr said at the time.
The State Department’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs has offered a reward of up to $15 million for information leading to Maduro’s arrest or conviction.
In 2017, two nephews of Maduro’s wife Cilia Flores were sentenced to 18 years in prison by a federal court in New York City for trying to smuggle up to 800 kilograms of cocaine into the United States on a private jet; the two were later released by the United States in a prisoners’ exchange in 2022.
“We see these officials and the Maduro regime basically fleecing the Venezuelan people for their own gain,” the US official said. “You have people who can’t even afford a loaf of bread there and then you have the president of Venezuela jetting around in a high-class private jet.”
Poor economic conditions, food shortages and limited access to health care have pushed more than 7.7 million people to flee Venezuela, marking the largest displacement in the Western Hemisphere.

GR4DLUPNXW_C86JUTTFVG1ZI8Z,Andrew Cuomo agrees to testify publicly next week about his Covid-era nursing home advisory,"By Jake Tapper, CNN","3 minute read Updated 10:44 AM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/02/politics/andrew-cuomo-testify-covid-hearing/,"Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo will testify publicly before Congress next week about his controversial nursing home advisory from the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, informed sources and a House subcommittee say.
As CNN reported earlier, Cuomo, who testified in June behind closed doors before members of the House Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic, will testify in front of the same panel on September 10.
“Andrew Cuomo owes answers to the 15,000 families who lost loved ones in New York’s nursing homes during the COVID-19 pandemic. On September 10, Americans will have the opportunity to hear directly from the former governor about New York’s potentially fatal nursing home policies,” Rep. Brad Wenstrup, an Ohio Republican who chairs the subcommittee, said in a statement Tuesday morning.
A spokesperson for Cuomo confirmed Monday night that the former governor will testify.
“The one question that needs to be answered is still being ignored: ‘Why did more people die from COVID in the United States than any other country and how do we make sure it never happens again?’ It is Governor Cuomo’s pleasure to join the committee once again to try to get an answer,” said Rich Azzopardi, Cuomo’s spokesperson.
In a series of tweets Tuesday morning, the committee detailed takeaways from Cuomo’s June interview. The panel said he was “shockingly callous when discussing New York’s nursing home mortality rate” and that he “repeatedly deflected responsibility for issuing the nursing home directive.”
The committee said it also conducted interviews with nine high-ranking former Cuomo administration officials. It said transcripts from all interviews, including Cuomo’s, would be released ahead of the hearing next week.
A 2021 investigation by New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, found that the New York State Department of Health undercounted Covid-19 deaths among residents of nursing homes by approximately 50%, essentially by leaving out deaths of residents who had been transferred to hospitals. A 2022 audit by State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli concluded that Cuomo’s health department failed to report roughly 4,100 deaths between April 2020 and February 2021.
Cuomo has insisted that advisory was consistent with guidance from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Wenstrup said on “The Lead” in April that lawmakers wanted to ask the Democratic former governor about the March 2020 advisory, which barred nursing homes from rejecting patients solely on the basis of a Covid-19 diagnosis.
“I’m trying to learn why he would do something like this,” Wenstrup said. “As a doctor who has treated infections, it goes against all medical common sense to take someone who was highly contagious and put them amongst the most vulnerable.”
Cuomo was first elected governor in 2010 and served nearly three full terms before he resigned in August 2021 following the release of a report by James’ office that found he had sexually harassed 11 women. Cuomo has denied the allegations.

GRY029ZEQY_R74TOTGDWZ5LR5I,At least 12 dead after boat carrying migrants sinks in the English Channel,"By Emmanuel Miculita and Chris Liakos, CNN","3 minute read Updated 2:37 PM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240903,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/03/europe/english-channel-migrant-boat-deaths-intl/,"At least 12 people died, most of them women and children, when a migrant boat capsized off the coast of northern France on Tuesday, according to French authorities.
Nearly 70 people were on board the vessel, according to Boulogne-sur-Mer mayor, Frédéric Cuvillier. The exact number is unclear.
Emergency crews rescued 53 people and recovered the bodies of the dead, the maritime prefecture said. Several of those saved were in critical condition and required urgent medical care.
Three helicopters, two fishing vessels and two boats have been deployed in the search and rescue operation.
The incident is the latest in a number of tragedies on the English Channel, where small boat crossings of migrants attempting to reach Britain has soared in recent years.
“This maritime sector is one of the busiest areas in the world, with more than 600 merchant ships passing through it every day and the weather conditions are often difficult, so it is a particularly dangerous sector, even when the sea seems calm,” the prefecture said.
Most of the migrants on board appeared to be from Eritrea, the Boulogne-sur-Mer prosecutor, Guirec Le Bras, said Tuesday. He added that 10 of the 12 who died were women and some were minors.
Le Bras said it appears that the boat sank about 5 kilometers (3 miles) off the coast of Cap Gris-Nez, on the northern coast of France.
French interior minister Gerald Darmanin told reporters in Boulogne-sur-Mer on Tuesday that “less than eight people had a life jacket” on board the boat, as he pointed the finger at smugglers for the unsafe conditions.
“Obviously, it is a tragedy. As soon as a person loses their life on our territory, I would obviously like to have a compassionate thought for their families,” Darmanin added. “They were undoubtedly looking for a better world in Great Britain.”
Nearly 30,000 people reached Britain by crossing the Channel in a small boat last year, according to Home Office figures, with dinghies and other small vessels frequently being used to take large groups of people on the dangerous journey in the hope of seeking asylum in the United Kingdom.
Deadly incidents like Tuesday’s have occurred on a number of occasions during that time. Last August, six people died when a boat carrying dozens of migrants capsized.
The issue became a major political obstacle for the previous Conservative government, which was criticized by migrant rights groups for its hardline rhetoric against asylum seekers, and for the new Labour administration.
The head of the French mission for Médecins Sans Frontières, Xavier Crombé, on Tuesday blamed the policies of the French and British governments for the latest deaths.
“We are shocked and angry after this new tragedy in the English Channel,” Crombé said. “These deaths are not inevitable, but the tragic consequence of inhumane and absurd migration policies.”
Crombé said that current policies prioritize border control rather than human lives, making migrant journeys “more precarious and dangerous.”

GUT3AOWPJT_4VHCEDNUMYZ5EZD,Trump seeks stay of sentencing for hush money conviction,"By Kara Scannell, CNN","2 minute read Updated 3:52 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/04/politics/trump-seek-sentencing-delay-hush-money/,"Lawyers for Donald Trump asked a federal appeals court on Wednesday to stop his sentencing until the judges can hear the former president’s legal argument to move the hush money case into federal court.
The last-ditch request comes after a federal judge rejected Trump’s motion to move the state case into federal court and delay the sentencing currently scheduled for September 18.
Trump’s lawyers said, “absent the requested stay, the New York County proceedings are scheduled to proceed to sentencing and ‘judgment of conviction’ on September 18, 2024 … which could result in the immediate incarceration of President Trump and irreparable harm to the impeding election before this Court has an opportunity to address the federal interests implicated by this appeal.”
Specifically, Trump’s lawyers are asking the appeals court to pause the federal judge’s ruling so the case is not sent back to the state court where Trump will be sentenced.
Trump filed a motion to appeal the decision denying the move into federal court Wednesday morning. That evening his lawyers filed motions with the federal judge and the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals to stay the federal judge’s ruling until the appeals court can hear an argument on the merits of moving the case to federal court. The one-two effort is Trump’s latest attempt to delay his sentencing.
Trump’s lawyers have argued the case should be moved into federal court following the Supreme Court’s decision this summer that granted immunity for some of Trump’s conduct that fell within his official powers.
Prosecutors with the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office have opposed the challenge to move the case into federal court and in a filing Thursday urged the federal appeals court to reject Trump’s effort to hold up his sentencing, saying that there is no basis for an appeal.
“As an initial matter, defendant mischaracterizes the nature of this appeal,” prosecutors wrote.
Prosecutors added that even if the appeals court would consider the request, they urge the judges to wait until Judge Juan Merchan, who presided over the trial, rules on Trump’s effort to postpone his sentencing until after the election.
Merchan could issue a decision as soon as this week.

GUTIRJLMKM_XUA5QKKQ6NR58C1,DOJ alleges Russia funded US media company linked to right-wing social media stars,"By Zachary Cohen, Donie O'Sullivan, Evan Perez, Sean Lyngaas and Majlie de Puy Kamp, CNN","6 minute read Updated 11:08 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/04/politics/doj-alleges-russia-funded-company-linked-social-media-stars/,"The unnamed Tennessee-based company that the Justice Department alleges was being funded by Russian operatives working as part of a Kremlin-orchestrated influence operation targeting the 2024 US election is Tenet Media, which is linked to right-wing commentators with millions of subscribers on YouTube and other social media platforms, according to a US official briefed on the matter.
The indictment unsealed in New York’s Southern District accused two employees of RT, the Kremlin’s media arm, of funneling nearly $10 million to an unidentified company, described only as “Company 1” in court documents.
CNN has independently confirmed that “Company 1” is Tenet Media, which is a platform for independent content creators. It is self-described as a “network of heterodox commentators that focus on Western political and cultural issues,” according to its website, which matches language contained in the newly unsealed indictment.
The alleged Russian operation tapped two people to set up the company in their names to add to its legitimacy and the two founders were aware Russian money backed the operation, according to the indictment.
The goal of the operation, according to prosecutors, was to fuel pro-Russian narratives, in part, by pushing content and news articles favoring Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and others who the Kremlin deemed to be friendlier to its interests.
Among the commentators listed on Tenet Media’s website are right-wing personalities Benny Johnson, Tim Pool and Dave Rubin. All have released statements saying they were victims of the alleged Russian scheme and they maintained editorial control of the content they created.
Each has a loyal fanbase online, with a combined roughly 6 million followers on YouTube alone. Pool interviewed Trump on his podcast in May.
Wednesday’s indictment outlined how the American social media stars were hired by Tenet Media. Some of the creators were told the project was being bankrolled by a man named Eduard Grigoriann. “In truth and fact,” the indictment reads, “Grigoriann was a fictional persona.”
The indictment outlines how one of the social media stars was approached by Tenet Media’s founder with an offer of $2 million a year to make videos for the company. One of the founders later wrote, “It would need to be closer to 5 million yearly for him to be interested,” according to the indictment.
The social media star expressed some skepticism about who was funding the deal and asked for more information about Grigoriann.
Eventually the social media star agreed on a contract of a $400,000 monthly fee to create “four weekly videos,” along with a $100,000 signing bonus.
Tenet Media’s US-based founders are not named in the indictment, but business records filed in Tennessee reveal two people connected to the company: Lauren Chen and Liam Donovan. A Twitter account for Donovan identifies him as the president of Tenet Media and his Instagram account describes Donovan as Chen’s husband.
A private message between the two in May 2021 read, “So we’re billing the Russians from the corporation, right?” Two weeks later, another message said, “Also, the Russians paid. So we’re good to bill them for the next month I guess,” the legal filing details.
Chen, is a rightwing online influencer in her own right. She has appeared in some of Tenet Media’s videos and has more than 500,000 subscribers on YouTube.
The Russian state-controlled media RT lists Chen as a contributor for several articles in 2021 and 2022. She is also linked to the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA. As of Thursday afternoon Turning Point US had deleted webpages featuring Chen.
A YouTube video referenced in the indictment further describes Tenet Media as “a project of Lauren Chen and her husband Liam.”
Blaze Media on Thursday said it had fired Chen.
BlazeTV, a subset of the Glenn Beck-founded conservative outlet, has since taken down a page that previously promoted content Chen produced for the outlet, including her show “Pseudo-Intellectual.”
“Lauren Chen was an independent contractor, whose contract has been terminated,” Tyler Cardon, the chief executive of Blaze Media, said in a statement to CNN. The news was first reported by Semafor.
YouTube has removed Tenet Media’s channel and others associated with Chen, a YouTube spokesperson said in a statement Thursday.
“Following an indictment from the US Department of Justice and after careful review, we are terminating the Tenet Media channel and four channels operated by its owner Lauren Chen as part of our ongoing efforts to combat coordinated influence operations,” the statement said.
The company’s investigation into the matter is ongoing, according to YouTube.
Neither Chen nor Donovan responded to CNN’s request for comment.
Others ensnared in the alleged Russian plot, however, insist they are the victims.
“We are disturbed by the allegations in today’s indictment, which make clear that myself and other influencers were victims in this alleged scheme,” Johnson wrote in a post on X after the indictment was unsealed on Wednesday.
“Should these allegations prove true, I as well as the other personalities and commentators were deceived and are victims,” Pool said on X. “The show is produced in its entirety by our local team without input from anyone external to the company,” he added.
In a statement also posted to X, Rubin wrote, “These allegations clearly show that I and other commentators were the victims of this scheme. I knew absolutely nothing about any of this fraudulent activity. Period.”
Adding, “The DoJ has never contacted me regarding this matter and I have no intention to comment further.”
The DOJ’s revealing of the alleged Russian plot was part of a wider set of actions the Biden administration announced Wednesday it was taking to tackle a major Russian government-backed effort to influence the 2024 US presidential election including sanctions on 10 individuals and entities, and the seizure of 32 internet domains.
At Russian President Vladimir Putin’s direction, three Russian companies used fake profiles to promote false narratives on social media, US Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said in a statement. Internal documents produced by one of those Russian companies show one of the goals of the propaganda effort was to boost the candidacy of Trump or whoever emerged as the Republican nominee for president, according to an FBI affidavit.
Taken together with the indictment of the RT employees, the actions represent the Biden administration’s most significant public response yet to alleged Russian influence operations targeting American voters. After the US accused Iran of trying to hack both the Trump and Biden-Harris campaigns last month, Wednesday’s actions are a reminder that US officials continue to see Russia as a prominent foreign influence threat to November’s election, sources familiar with the matter told CNN ahead of the announcements.

GXYCJGHY9B_VMPDZC9PMQJ5FM7,"An artist made scathing sculptures of Mao over a decade ago. Now, he’s detained for slandering China’s heroes, family says","By Nectar Gan, CNN","7 minute read Published 8:34 PM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/03/style/china-detains-artist-gao-brothers-mao-intl-hnk/,"A prominent Chinese artist known for his scathing political critiques of Mao Zedong and the Cultural Revolution has been detained in China, according to his brother and artistic partner.
Gao Zhen, 68, was detained last week in a police raid on his art studio on the outskirts of Beijing on suspicion of slandering China’s “heroes and martyrs,” his younger brother Gao Qiang told CNN Sunday in an email from New York. The criminal offense, introduced in 2021, is punishable by up to three years in prison.
The public security bureau that Gao Qiang said had detained his brother, in Hebei province’s Sanhe city, declined to comment.
At the height of their careers, the Gao Brothers created provocative sculptures of Mao in a country notoriously sensitive about its former ruler’s legacy. But that was well over a decade ago — during a relatively liberal era for artistic expression before China took an authoritarian turn under leader Xi Jinping.
Now, some of those older works have been seized by police as evidence against Gao Zhen, his brother said.
They include “Mao’s Guilt,” a life-size bronze cast created in 2009 that depicts the former Chinese Communist Party leader kneeling, hand on heart, in repentance; “The Execution of Christ,” created that same year, which features a firing squad of life-sized Chairman Maos pointing their bayoneted rifles at Jesus; and a collection of busts named “Miss Mao,” which come in various sizes and colors, sporting a Pinocchio-like nose and large, naked breasts.
The avant-garde artists’ latest works had not been as politically sensitive or explicitly critical of Chinese leaders, their friends say. Gao Zhen had lived a quiet life in China and spent most days in his studio prior to moving to the US, Du Yinghong, a fellow artist who has known the brothers for nearly two decades, told CNN in a phone call.
Due to the “deteriorating environment” in China, Gao Zhen relocated to New York two years ago when his son, an American citizen born in the US, reached school age, Gao Qiang said.
The artist returned to China in June with his wife and son to visit family. “Before he set off, his friends and family — myself included — had all reminded him to consider whether it was safe to go,” Gao Qiang said. “He himself also thought he might encounter problems, but still, as if driven by fate, he went back.”

At first, everything seemed fine. Gao Zhen kept in touch during his trip and regularly posted on the Chinese social messaging app WeChat. In July, he organized a birthday party for his son who had turned 6 years old.
But on August 26, just over a week before the family was scheduled to fly back to the US, about 30 police raided the Gao Brothers’ studio in Yanjiao, a town on the border of Beijing and neighboring Hebei province, to “search for evidence,” Gao Qiang said.
Police demanded the artist hand over his phone. Gao Zhen refused and was forcibly handcuffed and taken away, according to his brother.
Gao Zhen’s wife received his detention notice the following day from the public security bureau in Sanhe, Gao Qiang said, adding that she had been warned by police not to speak to the media about her husband’s detention.
The police returned to the studio on August 27 to search for more evidence, according to Gao Qiang.
“A few days before his arrest, Gao Zhen told me that he was organizing his Yanjiao studio and had destroyed some unfinished sculptures in stock, including those of ‘Miss Mao,’” Gao Qiang said in an email.
“He is nearly 70 years old and naturally prone to melancholy. I am very concerned about his physical and mental health.”
Under Xi, the ruling Communist Party has vowed to eradicate “historical nihilism” — or any views that question or challenge its official version of history, including glorified images of sanctified national heroes.
China passed a law in 2018 banning any insult or slander of national “heroes and martyrs,” including military personnel. The offense was added to the country’s criminal code three years later.
Since then, the law has been used to jail a popular blogger who doubted the official death toll of Chinese soldiers in a border clash with India, and a former investigative journalist who questioned China’s role in the Korean War, as depicted in a patriotic movie.
And last year, a stand-up comedian was investigated by police for the same offense after making a joke that referenced a military slogan at a show in Beijing. It cost him his job and his employer more than $2 million in fines, though police later dropped the case and did not press charges.
Around that time, another Chinese contemporary artist, Yue Minjun, faced the wrath of online nationalists for “uglifying” and “insulting” China’s military with his iconic grinning self-portraits, but the authorities did not act on those accusations.
That makes Gao Zhen the first Chinese artist known to be detained under the law.

His brother and friends wonder why authorities appear to be targeting the Gaos’ works retroactively, as they were created many years before the law came into force.
“The artworks collected as evidence by the police were all created more than a decade ago as part of an artistic reflection on Mao’s Cultural Revolution,” Gao Qiang said. “Imposing retroactive punishment for actions taken before the new law took effect goes against the widely accepted legal principle of non-retroactivity.”
The Gaos hail from a generation of Chinese artists who pushed the boundaries of creative expression by offering an unflinching glimpse into the dark chapters of their country’s past.
The upheaval of the Cultural Revolution, which roiled China in the 1960s and 1970s, inflicted indelible pain on the Gao family.
The brothers were just 6 and 12 years old when their father, a factory worker, was labeled a class enemy and thrown into detention at the height of the decade-long turmoil. Twenty-five days later, the family of six brothers was told that their father committed suicide “out of guilt for being a counter-revolutionary,” but they believed he was persecuted and killed.
“Our father’s death was a devastating disaster for our family.” Gao Zhen told the Southern People Weekly, a once-outspoken news outlet, in 2010. “We constantly worried that our mother would take her own life, but she raised us with an extraordinary resilience that few could compare to.” After the Cultural Revolution ended, Gao Zhen took the train to Beijing to petition his father’s death. The family was eventually given about 3,000 yuan (then equivalent to about $2,000) in compensation, the Gao brothers wrote in an article in 2004.
Friends who know the Gao Brothers say they used art to express their grief, with Mao being a recurring feature of their work in the late 1990s and 2000s.
“It was really an artistic phase; it’s not all their work. But this is why people remember them, because it was a very political, very direct critique,” said a friend who has known the brothers for over two decades.
In recent years, the brothers created works featuring world leaders including Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, as well as pieces showing support for Ukraine, according to the friend, who requested anonymity over safety concerns.
“There’s no logic to arrest (Gao Zhen) now,” she said. “They were not the only ones; many Chinese artists of that generation made very critical art back then… I guess they will be afraid now.”
Even during China’s more liberal years, however, the brothers had several run-ins with authorities over their controversial artworks. Police shut down their exhibitions, confiscated their politically sensitive works, and even intimidated visitors by stationing guards outside their old studio in Beijing’s 798 art district.
“But after we promised that our studio would not be open for public display, we hadn’t run into major problems,” Gao Qiang said.

The duo went on to attract international acclaim. They held exhibitions in Paris, New York, Moscow and Berlin, with some of their works collected by prestigious museums, from the Centre Pompidou in Paris to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.
The two brothers obtained permanent residency in the US in 2011 and traveled frequently between Beijing and New York. Gao Qiang moved to the US a few years before his brother and has not returned to China since.
Two years ago, their Beijing studio was forced to shut down, and Gao Zhen moved his studio to Yanjiao, about 40 kilometers (about 25 miles) away, his brother said.
Gao Zhen’s detention shows that freedom of expression in China has shrunk significantly compared to a decade ago, Gao Qiang said.
“A healthy society should move towards the broadening of thoughts and actions, instead of the other way around,” he added."
H3HD7JJAAG_TFW3VU7LVLNTEIV,"Grief and fury on Israel’s streets, as hostage killings pile pressure on Netanyahu to secure ceasefire deal","By Lauren Izso, Tamar Michaelis, Tara John, Michael Rios and Eugenia Yosef, CNN","6 minute read Updated 2:39 AM EDT, Mon September 2, 2024",20240902,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/01/middleeast/israel-hostage-protests-strike-netanyahu-intl-latam/,"From bustling Tel Aviv to the southern Israeli city of Eilat, tens of thousands of Israelis took to the streets in one of the biggest nationwide protests since the outbreak of Israel’s war on Hamas as they called on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to secure a ceasefire-for-hostages deal.
Anger at Netanyahu – who has been accused of stalling efforts for a deal by some hostage families and their supporters – reached a boiling point Sunday as protesters responded in fury to the news that another six captives had been found killed in Gaza. Israel’s largest labor union called for a general strike on Monday and threatened to shut down the “entire Israeli economy.”
The extent of the strike early Monday was not yet clear but supporters have vowed a national response.
Three of the six hostages found dead, including Israeli-American Hersh Goldberg-Polin, had been expected to be released in an eventual ceasefire, Israeli officials told CNN. Autopsies showed they were shot at short range on Thursday or Friday morning; Israeli forces announced the recovery of their bodies from an underground tunnel in Rafah on Saturday.
The details of their deaths fueled anger that was palpable across the country as protesters blocked highways, waved Israeli flags, and chanted, “we won’t abandon them” in reference to the more than 100 hostages, including 35 believed to be dead, being held in Gaza, according to data from Israeli Prime Minister’s Office. The vast majority of those hostages were taken during Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel, when some 1,200 people were killed and more than 200 taken captive.
In Tel Aviv, a group of protesters stood behind a mock cemetery while holding signs saying “named after Benjamin Netanyahu,” as they cast blame on the prime minister for the  deaths of the hostages.
Later in the evening, police threw stun grenades at protesters blocking the Ayalon highway in the city, according to video verified by CNN. Naama Lazimi, a member of Israel’s parliament who was present at the demonstration, said on X that stun grenades “were thrown toward both sides where the demonstrators were standing in complete surprise and without any advance warning.”
Israeli police also fired foam from a water cannon at protesters on the highway – prompting demonstrators to chant, “Officer, who are you keeping safe?”
Police arrested 29 people in the city, accusing them of vandalism, disorderly conduct and attacking officers.
The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said at least 700,000 people took part in protests across Israel, with an estimated 550,000 of them in Tel Aviv. CNN cannot independently verify the figures and has asked Israeli police to provide an estimation of the crowd size.
In Tel Aviv, crowds were visibly emotional; many shouted “sorry” as the names of the six hostages were recited on a loudspeaker during the protest, which organizers said was the biggest since the start of the war.
One protester told CNN said she was there to show support for her cousin, whose body was repatriated by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) overnight. “I’m here every week, I wanted to show her father and other parents that we are here for them,” she said. “And on the other side, we’re incredibly angry at the government. What they’ve been doing is unforgivable.”
In Jerusalem, protesters called for Netanyahu to resign as the government held a cabinet meeting. Eden Kramer, who attended the rally with a toddler in a stroller, said she was also demonstrating for the child’s future. “We hope everyone will come out today to bring a message to the government: We can’t keep up like this anymore,” she said.
The discovery of the six hostage bodies has thrown negotiations for a deal into question.
Skepticism has mounted over Netanyahu’s willingness to strike one given fierce opposition from far-right ministers in his coalition. The Israeli prime minister’s political future largely depends on his far-right coalition partners – several of whom have already threatened to leave the government and cause its collapse if he agrees to the deal.
During a cabinet meeting on Sunday, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant lambasted the Israeli government for what he said was prioritizing control of a key border area known as the Philadelphi corridor over a deal to free hostages, calling it a “moral disgrace.”
The Philadelphi corridor, a 14-kilometer (8.7 mile) stretch that runs along the border between Gaza and Egypt, is currently controlled by the IDF. The deployment of Israeli troops along the corridor during the first phase of a ceasefire agreement has been a major point of contention between Israel and Hamas, with Hamas saying Israeli troops must withdraw from the border zone. Netanyahu says control of the corridor is needed to prevent Hamas from resuming arms smuggling through tunnels underneath it.
Gallant, who has increasingly found himself isolated within Netanyahu’s cabinet on the issue of a hostage deal, warned his colleagues Sunday that “if we continue on this path, we won’t manage to achieve the goals that we set for ourselves.”
He added, “If we want the hostages alive, we don’t have time.”
A senior US official said the killings of the hostages called into question how serious Hamas is about reaching a deal as three of them were set to be released as part of the ceasefire agreement.
“US officials had been working on a final package together with Qatar and Egypt. The package included Hersh (Goldberg-Polin) and a number of the hostages who were just executed,” the senior US official said Sunday.
“This calls into question Hamas’ seriousness about a deal, even as pressure also builds on Israel and Netanyahu personally.”
A source familiar with the ceasefire talks told CNN it wasn’t clear how the killings would affect the discussions, adding that the impact will likely be seen in the next day or two.
The “situation is complicated,” the source said. There are currently no in-person joint negotiations with the parties, but the source said discussions continue through the regular channels.
US President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris will meet in the Situation Room on Monday with the US team negotiating a deal, according to the White House.
Israel’s far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has asked the country’s attorney general to request urgent injunctions to prevent the planned nationwide strike on Monday.
In a letter addressed to Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara, Smotrich argued that a strike would hurt the economy during wartime and set a dangerous precedent. The attorney general’s office has not yet commented on the request.
He had earlier instructed the finance ministry’s salary department to pass on a directive that anyone who joins the strike on Monday will not be paid.
The chairman of Israel’s largest trade union, known as Histadrut, warned on Sunday that the country was “in a downward spiral, and we don’t stop receiving body bags.”
Arnon Bar-David, who called for the strike, told a press conference that “only a strike would shock, and that’s why I’ve decided that starting tomorrow at six in the morning, the entire Israeli economy will shut down.”
He added that the strike would include the shutdown of Ben-Gurion Airport. In a statement, Ben-Gurion Airport said it would be “open for flights and landings on Monday, September 2.”
The Hebrew University of Jerusalem said it would join the strike, which it described as a “response to the tragic news of the murder of our student Carmel Gat, along with five other Israeli hostages.”
Gat, a 40-year-old occupational therapist, was taken by Hamas from her parents’ home in the border kibbutz of Be’eri in southern Israel on October 7.
A spokesperson for the university said the shutdown would be more extensive than previous measures taken since the beginning of the war, such as a partial strike in June.

On Monday, Musk posted an AI-generated image on his social media platform that depicted Harris as a communist, wearing a red uniform complete with hammer and sickle emblazoned hat.
Musk, who has endorsed former President Donald Trump for president and poured millions into a super PAC supporting the Republican, captioned the image with the false assertion, “Kamala vows to be a communist dictator on day one. Can you believe she wears that outfit!?”
The image, which appeared to violate X’s policy on manipulated content, resembled an AI-generated image posted by Trump last month during the Democratic National Convention, envisioning Harris addressing a crowd under communist symbols.
Musk’s post came a day after he shared another post with a screenshot suggesting that only “high status males” should be able to participate in government because women (and men with “low testosterone”) are not capable of critical thought. Musk posted it to his 196 million followers with the comment, “interesting observation.”
The sexist screed appears to have originated on 4Chan, the notorious hate-filled website that has been linked to mass-shootings.
By choosing to amplify disinformation and misogynist views, Musk, a South African billionaire who is both the owner of X and the most-followed account on the platform, is promoting radical content to the masses that might otherwise languish in the darkest corners of the internet.
By Tuesday afternoon, less than 24 hours after Musk shared the fake image and false statement depicting Harris as a communist, the post had been viewed nearly 60 million times, according to data from X. Musk’s post suggesting women shouldn’t take part in democracy had been viewed more than 19 million times.
X did not respond to a CNN request for comment.
The posts come after Brazilian authorities blocked access to X in the country in a battle over the spread of misinformation and hate speech on the platform aimed at undermining the nation’s democracy.
Since taking over the platform, Musk has touted X’s “community notes” feature as a way of transparently allowing crowd-sourced fact-checking misinformation on his platform.
Related article ‘White Dudes for Harris’ said their account was targeted by X for the second time
Yet neither post was fact-checked through the community notes feature. Musk’s defenders, of which there are many who are vocal on X, have attempted to argue that some posts like these are satirical or are not meant to be taken seriously.
But Musk is taken seriously. He is one of the world’s most powerful people who controls one of the world’s most important online platforms on the precipice of an historic American presidential election where he is actively campaigning for a candidate.
When Musk took over Twitter in 2022 in a $44 billion acquisition, he claimed that the platform would remain impartial to avoid the perception of tilting the scales for a political party.
“For Twitter to deserve public trust, it must be politically neutral, which effectively means upsetting the far right and the far left equally,” he wrote.
But Musk’s posts, and the lack of scrutiny they receive from his company’s own fact-checking system, lay bare how Musk has turned X into a pro-Trump machine."
HBAVV03Y6R_7J21O4DU5IQZEDX,"‘From the River to the Sea’ is not hate speech, Meta’s Oversight Board rules","By Ramishah Maruf, CNN","3 minute read Published 1:54 PM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/04/tech/from-the-river-to-the-sea-meta-oversight-board/,"Meta’s Oversight Board has found that the phrase “From the River to the Sea,” used to express Palestinian support, did not break the company’s hate speech policies.
Critics of the phrase, which refers to the land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, say that it calls for the abolishment of the Israeli state. The Anti-Defamation League accused the slogan of being antisemitic and a “rallying cry (that) has long been used by anti-Israel voices, including supporters of terrorist organizations such as Hamas.”
But the chant is also frequently used at pro-Palestinian demonstrations by protesters who say it is to call for equal rights and an independent state for Palestinians. It can refer to Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza who are restricted in their movements and from visiting Jerusalem.
The Board said it reviewed three cases involving the use of “From the River to the Sea” on Facebook and said that all appeals to remove the content were closed without human review. Those users then appealed to the Board, which exists for users to challenge Meta’s appeals process on Facebook, Instagram or Threads.
“Specifically, the three pieces of content contain contextual signs of solidarity with Palestinians – but no language calling for violence or exclusion. They also do not glorify or even refer to Hamas, an organization designated as dangerous by Meta,” the decision said. The posts and comments also didn’t contain threats of violence or physical harm.
Though the majority of the Board agreed the phrase has multiple meanings, the decision noted that a minority believed it glorifies Hamas because it appeared in the group’s 2017 charter.
“The phrase’s use by this terrorist group with explicit violent eliminationist intent and actions, does not make the phrase inherently hateful or violent – considering the variety of people using the phrase in different ways,” the Board said.
The Board said the decision underscores tensions in protecting free expression and political speech.
In June, a Palestinian-American engineer sued Meta, accusing his former employer of discriminating against pro-Palestinian speech and wrongfully firing him when he investigated those issues.
“The employee was dismissed for violating Meta’s data access policies, which we make clear to employees will result in immediate termination,” Meta spokesperson Andy Stone said in a statement to CNN at the time.
The company said it is expanding on its hate speech policies. In July, Meta said it would remove posts that have the term “Zionist” when used in conjunction with antisemitic tropes or dehumanizing rhetoric.
“These cases have again underscored the importance of data access to effectively assess Meta’s content moderation during conflicts, as well as the need for a method to track the amount of content attacking people based on a protected characteristic,” the decision said.
The chant had been contentious even before the Israel and Hamas war, which has killed more than 40,000 Palestinians after Hamas’ October 7th attack that killed more than 1,200 Israelis and took 250 hostage. For example, in 2018 CNN said it severed ties with a liberal pundit after he called for a “free Palestine from the river to the sea.”
But new attention has been drawn to the chant as protesters call for an end to the war, and the phrase is frequently used at protests ranging from college campuses to large cities. In Germany, using the slogan “From the river to the sea” is now a criminal offense. In December, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) filed a discrimination complaint on behalf of a Black Muslim Arab American teacher in Maryland after she was placed on administrative leave for her email signature, which contained the slogan. US Congress member Rashida Tlaib was censured for using the phrase.
The slogan used in the cases had wide reach through Meta’s platforms. In one case, a likely AI-generated image of floating watermelon slices that formed the slogan was viewed about eight million times and reported by 937 users.

Demonstrations could be seen in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Caesarea and other sites across the country, fueled by the killing in Gaza of six hostages, whose bodies were retrieved by Israeli soldiers this weekend.
Several gatherings targeted the homes of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, with protesters lighting fires and chanting: “You are the leader - you are guilty!” near one of Netanyahu’s private residences in Caesarea. In Tel Aviv, protesters outside the US Embassy chanted “Shame!” late into the evening, video showed.
Related article Biden and Netanyahu at odds again after US president says Israeli PM not doing enough in ceasefire-hostage release talks
Netanyahu has been accused of stalling efforts for a deal by some hostage families and their supporters. More than 100 hostages, including 35 believed to be dead, are still being held in Gaza – the vast majority of them taken during Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel, when some 1,200 people were killed and more than 200 taken captive
The scenes outside the Israeli leader’s homes culminated a day of anger that brought much of the country to a halt, following a call by the country’s largest labor union, known as Histadrut, to shut down the “entire” economy. Flights in and out of Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion International Airport were also stopped for two hours.
But in a press conference Monday evening, the Israeli leader struck a note of defiance, batting away criticisms – including from US President Joe Biden – that he is not doing enough to secure a deal. He asked for “forgiveness” from the families of the six hostages for failing to bring them back alive, but insisted it should be Hamas that “has to make the concessions.”
He also vowed to retaliate and extract a “heavy price” from the militant group that controls Gaza, for the killing of the six hostages, whose autopsies showed they were shot at short range on Thursday or Friday morning.
Hamas meanwhile escalated its own threats on Monday, with a public warning that more hostages held in Gaza would return “inside coffins” if Israel attempts to free them militarily.
A statement released by the militant group said that its fighters guarding prisoners held in the Palestinian enclave had received “new instructions” on how to deal with hostages if Israeli forces get close, and released an illustrated poster apparently showing hostages threatened with a gun.
Monday saw the largest general strike to have taken place in Israel since March 2023, when there was a similar mass walkout over Netanyahu’s controversial attempts to overhaul the country’s judiciary.
According to union Histadrut, hundreds of thousands of Israelis joined the protests Monday, just a day after half a million took to the streets on Sunday for what protest organizers said was one of the biggest nationwide protests since the outbreak of Israel’s war on Hamas. Israeli police said they had seven demonstrators in Tel Aviv for “violating public order and disrupting traffic.”
Netanyahu’s defiant stance following the discovery of the six hostage bodies has thrown further doubt on the negotiations for a ceasefire-for-hostages deal.
Even before the killing of the six hostages, the talks had become bogged down, with one key disagreement centering on control of a border area known as the Philadelphi corridor.
Netanyahu says control of the 14-kilometer (8.7-mile) strip of land along Gaza’s border with Egypt is needed to prevent Hamas from resuming arms smuggling through tunnels underneath it. However, the deployment of Israeli troops along the corridor has been a major point of contention between Israel and Hamas in the ceasefire talks, with Hamas saying Israeli troops must withdraw from the border zone.
“Hamas doesn’t want us to be there and that’s why I insist on being there,” the Israeli leader said on Monday.
During a cabinet meeting over the weekend, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant had lambasted the Israeli government for what he said was prioritizing control of the corridor over a deal to free hostages, calling it a “moral disgrace.”
The relative of one of the hostages who was shot dead in southern Gaza also blamed Netanyahu and his stance on the corridor for their deaths. Gil Dickmann, the cousin of Carmel Gat, told CNN that the Israeli government “cold-bloodedly” crossed a “red line” by prioritizing the corridor over the lives of the hostages.
“We know that Hamas has agreed to a deal at some point, and Israel was the one putting on more and more terms and actually postponing the deal,” Dickmann said on Monday. “Right now, we know the decisions that our Prime Minister Netanyahu has made it impossible for Carmel and other hostages to return and put their lives in great danger, and that’s what killed them.”
But on Monday, even as he acknowledged dissent within his cabinet, Netanyahu doubled down.
“We’re not going to withdraw from the Philadelphi corridor,” Netanyahu told a press conference on Monday evening. “The axis of evil needs the Philadelphi corridor. We need to have it under our control,” he said.
Disagreements over the corridor are only one of the splits within the cabinet over the conduct of the war that have become increasingly public and rancorous in recent months, reflecting deep divisions at the top of Israel’s government.
Just on Monday, Israel’s far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said he was using his power to prevent a “reckless deal” and ensure “that there will be no negotiations at all.”
He was speaking to members of Gvura, a right-wing organization representing the families of Israeli soldiers killed in Gaza.
But American officials described new urgency in reaching a ceasefire-for-hostages deal. US national security adviser Jake Sullivan said while meeting the families of Americans held hostage that “the next few days will be critical” in the push to free those still held by Hamas.
Alongside the strikes, the funeral of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, one of the six hostages found dead, was held in Jerusalem on Monday. Speaking at the ceremony, Jon Goldberg-Polin said he hoped his son’s death would be “the fuel that will bring home the remaining 101 hostages.”
“Hersh, we failed you. We all failed you. You would not have failed you. You would have pushed harder for justice,” he said. “You would have worked to understand the other, to bridge differences.”
“The 23 years of life that we had with you were a blessing. We now will work to make your legacy a similar blessing,” Goldberg-Polin said. “You were a really great guy. I love you.”
As well as an impact on flights, some Israeli municipalities said they joined the strike, including Tel Aviv and Haifa, according to a list from the Histadrut outlining who joined the action as well as statements from some of the cities.
The list also includes government ministries that impact a wide range of public services, the document shows, including parts of the Prime Minister’s Office, the Interior Ministry, and others. CNN has reached out to the Prime Minister’s Office for comment.
Hospitals and healthcare facilities worked on a weekend schedule and on an emergency basis, according to the statement.
The country’s teachers’ union said it would not join the strike, according to a statement from the union, though support staff at schools did.
However, Israel’s biggest universities joined the strike, including the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv University.

HGFA7CVB5P_OVD7CLKQKR8EMDC,Your children’s smartphones aren’t making them smarter,"Analysis by Kara Alaimo, CNN","5 minute read Updated 7:44 AM EDT, Mon September 2, 2024",20240902,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/02/health/phones-allowed-school-children-wellness/,"Get inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple. Sign up for CNN’s Life, But Better newsletter for information and tools designed to improve your well-being
As kids head back to school, many schools aren’t allowing them to bring their phones to class. Legislation to ban phones in schools has been proposed or passed in many cities and states. Most schools already have policies prohibiting them for nonacademic use, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.
Parents often question these policies because they want to be able to reach their kids in an emergency such as a school shooting.
Yet research suggests it’s not just a good idea for kids to put their phones away while in class — they shouldn’t bring them to school at all.
Related article More than a third of teens say they spend too much time on their phones, new study finds
Some 97% of 11- to 17-year-olds use their phones during school time, for an average of 43 minutes, according to a 2023 Common Sense Media study. If they’re checking their phones between classes or at lunch and recess, they’re likely preoccupied with what they’re seeing on their screens and therefore spending less time talking, playing or even just hanging out with their friends.
Such preoccupation is not healthy because, as social psychologist Jonathan Haidt wrote in “The Anxious Generation: How the Great Rewiring of Childhood is Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness,” one of the most important things young people should be doing is playing with peers.
In doing so, they learn to navigate social dynamics and build skills by figuring out how to do different activities. It teaches them they can handle other challenges they’ll face in the future, which Haidt said can help protect them from anxiety.
But phones aren’t just intruding on kids’ time outside class. In a June Pew Research Center survey, 72% of public high school teachers said cell phone distractions are a major problem in their classrooms. If children are sneaking peeks at their phones, they can’t possibly be paying attention to what they’re supposed to be learning. A wide body of evidence tells us the human brain can’t multitask — we can only do one thing at a time.
One indicator that students aren’t learning as much at school as they did in the pre-phone era is scores on the ACT — a standardized test that measures whether they have the English, reading, math and science skills needed for first-year college courses. Last year, ACT scores dropped to the lowest level in more than 30 years, according to the organization that administers the test.
As a professor who has taught at five universities since 2010, I’ve witnessed this trend myself. When I first started teaching, before smartphones became ubiquitous, many of my students arrived better able to concentrate and work through long reading passages than they are now.

Of course, it’s easy to imagine how kids will respond if we ask them to leave their phones home: They’ll promise not to check them during the school day. Unfortunately, it’s unreasonable to expect them to fight the urge to look at products that are designed to be addictive, with features such as bottomless scrolling and continuous notifications. The average teen gets 237 phone notifications a day on their phones, according to the Common Sense Media study — with a quarter coming in during the school day.
Sending kids to school sans smartphones forces them to concentrate on what’s happening in front of them rather than on their screens. That’s another important skill to learn.
“The phone-based life makes it difficult for people to be fully present with others when they are with others, and to sit silently with themselves when they are alone,” Haidt warned.
What’s more, the idea that having a phone with them makes kids safer is often a myth.
Phones can be dangerously distracting to teens. At one of my recent talks at a private school, the school psychologist told parents she regularly sees their children walk out of school looking at their screens while crossing the streets of Manhattan. So, phones may cause emergencies in the first place.
Of course, if children have a crisis on the way home from school, in most places in the United States, there will be businesses and people around with phones who will be willing to let them call their parents.
Similarly, while many parents wish they could reach their children in the unthinkable event of a school shooting, kids will be safer if they remain quiet and focused on the instructions they receive from school administrators or law enforcement.

In addition, children often have extraordinarily dangerous experiences on their phones. In August, a report by Thorn, a nonprofit that combats child sex abuse, revealed that the great majority — 59% — of youth said they’ve had online experiences that have been potentially harmful. One in 3 minors and 1 in 5 preteens said they’d had online sexual experiences with someone they thought was an adult, according to the report.
It’s true that letting kids bring phones to school can make coordinating things like pickups after extracurricular activities easier. If children truly need a phone to communicate with their parents — perhaps because they have a medical condition and need to be able to reach someone in an emergency or because their pickup arrangements are so complicated that a time and location can’t be set in advance — one option Haidt recommended is an old-fashioned flip phone. Having one lets them text or call but not log on to social media apps.
Related article Parents are not OK right now. Here’s what they can do
Sending kids to school with smartphones is unlikely to make them smarter or safer. It’s more likely to distract them and make them unable to focus on learning.
Without a phone, kids can focus on interacting with peers, learning and being fully present in their surroundings — rather than having these things compete for their attention with influencers and internet memes.

Harris’ comments marked the first time she lent her voice to the dispute over the proposed sale of US Steel to Nippon Steel, Japan’s biggest steelmaker.
“The president mentioned it: US Steel is a historic American company, and it is vital for our nation to maintain strong American steel companies,” Harris said at the Labor Day event after being introduced by Joe Biden. “And I couldn’t agree more with President Biden, US Steel should remain American owned and American operated.”
The White House has previously opposed the controversial deal, with Biden saying it is “important that we maintain strong American steel companies powered by American steel workers.” Biden outlined his position during a March event in Pittsburgh, nicknamed “Steel City,” where he visited the headquarters of the United Steelworkers and called for higher tariffs to protect American manufacturing.
One week prior, when Biden hosted Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida for a state visit, Kishida was asked by a reporter whether he saw US politics influencing the $14 billion takeover bid. Kishida said, “Japan believes that appropriate procedures based on law is being implemented by the US government” to evaluate the deal.
Biden, asked the same question, said simply that he stands with both American workers and American allies overseas, without elaborating on his further involvement.
For the deal to close, it needs approval from both the Justice Department, which enforces antitrust laws, and the normally low-profile but powerful Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which evaluates takeovers on national security grounds. That committee comprises members of Biden’s cabinet, including the secretaries of treasury, commerce, defense, state, homeland security and the attorney general.
It remains unclear to what extent Biden or Harris, in their official capacity, will work to block the deal on national security grounds in the treasury-led review.
Representatives for US Steel and Nippon Steel declined to comment on whether the companies had briefed Harris on the deal.
In August 2023, US Steel rejected a takeover bid by Ohio-based Cleveland Cliffs to buy the company for $7.3 billion. After months evaluating alternate suitors, US Steel agreed to sell to Japan’s largest steelmaker for more than twice what Cleveland Cliffs had proposed paying. US Steel shareholders overwhelmingly voted in support of the Nippon deal.
Under the current terms of the deal, US Steel would retain its name and Pittsburgh headquarters. Nippon has also pledged an additional $1.3 billion to refurbish two outdated mills in Pennsylvania and Indiana.
In a statement to CNN, US Steel’s chief executive officer said those investments go well beyond what the company would be able to do on its own.
“The bottom line is these are investments in the future of American steelmaking and the employees, families, and communities that rely on it,” CEO David Burritt told CNN. “US Steel will be a much stronger company as a result of the transaction and these investments – the entire American steel industry will be stronger and more globally competitive, too.”

HSZBU0PFU4_NCW1FQYHO90P5FW,Dozens killed in Russian strike on military educational facility in central Ukraine,"By Ivana Kottasová, Svitlana Vlasova and Kosta Gak, CNN","3 minute read Updated 12:02 AM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240903,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/03/europe/ukraine-poltava-russia-attack-intl/,"A Russian strike against a military educational facility in central Ukraine killed 51 people and injured more than 200 others, according to Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office, in one of the deadliest single attacks since the start of Moscow’s full-scale invasion in February 2022.
President Volodymyr Zelensky said preliminary information indicated two ballistic missiles hit the facility in the city of Poltava and a nearby hospital on Tuesday morning.
“We say again and again to everyone in the world who has the power to stop this terror: air defense systems and missiles are needed in Ukraine, not somewhere in a warehouse,” Zelensky said in a statement.
The head of the Poltava region military administration, Filip Pronin, announced the latest death toll on Telegram, adding that that rescue crews continue to clear and search through the debris at the site. Pronin said authorities believe up to 18 more people may be under the rubble.
At least 10 residential buildings were also damaged in Poltava, he said.
Moscow has not commented on the attack, but a well-known Russian military blogger Vladimir Rogov reported earlier on Tuesday that Russia struck a military school in Poltava.
Speaking about the attack, President Zelensky repeated his call on Ukraine’s Western allies to supply Kyiv with more air defenses and lift restrictions on his country’s military using their weapons to strike inside Russia.
“Long-range strikes that can protect against Russian terror are needed now, not later. Every day of delay is, unfortunately, the death of people,” he added.
Speaking to CNN’s Christiane Amanpour in Kyiv, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the missile reached the target in a very short period of time. People were struck down as they were trying to get into the bomb shelter, officials said.
“The only way to intercept them was to have the Patriot system or a SAMP/T air defense system because they are the only one capable of intercepting ballistic missiles,” said Kuleba, who added that he originally came from the Poltava region.
Ukraine has received a handful of Patriot air defense systems from the United States and Germany, although Kyiv has consistently said the number was insufficient to allow it to effectively defend itself.
The Biden administration said in June it was prioritizing critical air defense capabilities for Ukraine over other countries to “ensure Ukraine’s survival.” But Kuleba made it clear on Tuesday that new weapons cannot come soon enough.
“I don’t know how many more tragedies like this have to occur for all promises to be fulfilled and for all new commitments to be made,” Kuleba added, reiterating Zelensky’s calls for more defense systems to be sent to Ukraine.
Local authorities said Tuesday was a “terrible day for Poltava” and declared three days of mourning. No more details would be released about the strike due to “security issues,” they said.
Ukrainian first lady, Olena Zelenska, described the attack as a “terrible tragedy for the whole of Ukraine,” as Western allies condemned the scale and force of the Russian strike.
“My deepest condolences to the families of those killed and injured in the Russian missile attack on Poltava,” Zelenska said. “Russia is taking away our most valuable asset – our lives. We will never forget this.”
British Foreign Secretary David Lammy paid tribute to those killed, in a post on X. “Russia’s strikes on Poltava are the latest sickening act of aggression in Putin’s abhorrent and illegal war in Ukraine,” he said on Tuesday. “We stand with Ukraine.”

The hotels are reportedly still open but guests will deal with a skeleton staff unable to provide full services. UNITE HERE, the union representing the striking workers, says they are striking not just for better pay but also better working conditions, including the return of automatic daily room cleaning that many hotels dropped during the pandemic.
“We’re on strike because the hotel industry has gotten off track,” Gwen Mills, International President of UNITE HERE, said in a statement Sunday morning. “During Covid, everyone suffered, but now the hotel industry is making record profits while workers and guests are left behind. Too many hotels still haven’t restored standard services that guests deserve. Workers aren’t making enough to support their families. Many can no longer afford to live in the cities that they welcome guests to.”
Aissata Seck, a banquet food server who has worked at Hilton Park Plaza in Boston for 18 years, said her rent has increased from $1,900 to $2,900 in the last five years. “My pay only covers my rent,” she told CNN. She is now working as an Uber driver to make ends meet.
Apple Ratanabunsrithang, a cook at Hilton Union Square in San Francisco, told CNN’s Gloria Pazmino that she “has to work two jobs to survive in the city,” and while wages are important, so is keeping health care benefits. “The majority of people that work and are in the union are long established — they’ve worked 10, 20, 30 years. So their whole life is working at a hotel, which is physical work, so the health care is very important,” she said.
Mills told CNN that the lack of daily room cleaning not only costs jobs for her union’s members — reducing housekeeping employment by nearly 40% — but it also increases a cleaning staff’s workload, since it requires tending to rooms that haven’t been cleaned for a number of days.
The hotel chains facing striking workers include Hilton, Hyatt and Marriott. The hotels have 23,000 rooms between them in the cities of Boston, San Diego, San Francisco, San Jose, Seattle, as well as Honolulu and Kauai in Hawaii, and Greenwich, Connecticut, according to the union.
The union is threatening to possibly expand the strike to as many as 65 hotels in 12 different cities, possibly adding hotels in Baltimore, Oakland, California, as well as Providence, Rhode Island, and New Haven, Connecticut. Spokespeople for Hilton and Hyatt told CNN on Friday they are committed to reaching deals with the union, but they also will continue to serve customers during any work stoppage.
Hyatt said in a statement it is disappointed by the union’s decision to strike. “We look forward to continuing to negotiate fair contracts and recognize the contributions of Hyatt employees,” said Michael D’Angelo, head of labor relations at Hyatt.
Last year, the 15,000 members of the same union went on strike during the Fourth of July holiday weekend at 65 hotels in Los Angeles and Orange counties in Southern California. They returned to work a few days later but staged a series of rolling strikes in the months that followed, sometimes tied to major tourist periods, such as the weekend of Taylor Swift concerts in Los Angeles.
These strikes are set to end after three days, as occurred in Los Angeles’ work stoppage. The union has yet to determine whether or not they will return on a rolling basis as they did in Southern California last year, Mills told CNN on Friday ahead of the strike deadline. A return of rolling strikes has not been ruled out.
The union eventually reached deals for all but three of the hotels they had targeted, but those agreements weren’t reached until earlier this year.
This has been a particularly busy Labor Day weekend for travel with AAA expecting a 9% increase in domestic travel compared to last year and the Transportation Security Administration expecting record passenger screenings at US airports.

I6XZBBTIG2_WP63G43D1GFBZ9Z,Federal judge denies Trump’s request to move hush money case to federal court,"By Kara Scannell, CNN","3 minute read Updated 6:18 PM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/03/politics/trump-hush-money-request-federal-court/,"A federal judge Tuesday denied Donald Trump’s request to move the New York hush money case to federal court, finding there is nothing in the Supreme Court’s presidential immunity ruling that alters his view of the fact that the payments were “private, unofficial acts.”
Last week, the former president’s attorneys sought to move the state case to federal court, an effort they previously lost, citing the Supreme Court’s decision this summer that granted immunity for some of Trump’s conduct that fell within his official powers. They also urged the judge to postpone Trump’s sentencing, currently set for September 18.
Judge Alvin Hellerstein rejected the long shot bid, saying no facts have changed since he rejected Trump’s attempt to move the case last year. At the time, the judge found that Trump’s reimbursement to Michael Cohen, who facilitated hush money payments to adult film actress Stormy Daniels, were not official acts he took as president.
“Nothing in the Supreme Court’s opinion affects my previous conclusion that the hush money payments were private, unofficial acts, outside the bounds of executive authority,” Hellerstein wrote in his decision Tuesday.
“Private schemes with private actors, unconnected to any statutory or constitutional authority or function of the executive, are considered unofficial acts,” he wrote.
Trump also claimed the case should be moved to federal court because he alleged Judge Juan Merchan, who presided over the trial, is biased against him.
Hellerstein said it was not his place to evaluate the New York trial.
“District Courts may not reverse or modify state judgments, even those containing constitutional infirmities because ‘to do so would be an exercise of appellate jurisdiction,’” Hellerstein wrote. He said the proper vehicle would be for Trump to appeal the conviction through the state courts. Trump has said he will appeal the decision, which in New York occurs after sentencing.
“It would be highly improper for this Court to evaluate the issues of bias, unfairness or error in the state trial,” Hellerstein wrote. The judge said for the same reasons, it would be improper for him to postpone Trump’s sentencing later this month.
Trump has separately asked Merchan to delay the sentencing until after the election. Prosecutors haven’t opposed that request, and the judge could issue a decision as soon as this week.
Trump has also argued in a motion to Merchan that his conviction should be overturned in light of the Supreme Court decision, which in part found that evidence of official acts can’t be used at trial. His attorneys said the jury should not have been allowed to hear the testimony of former White House aide Hope Hicks or see social media posts Trump made while in office.
Merchan said he will rule on that motion on September 16.
Trump could face as much as four years in prison when he is sentenced. He was convicted earlier this year of 34 counts of falsifying business records.

I7L0JW345J_UNM9HJZ46FNH1RX,Trump allies hope Jack Smith’s revised indictment lets them off the hook,"By Katelyn Polantz, Zachary Cohen and Devan Cole, CNN","5 minute read Published 4:00 AM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/04/politics/jack-smith-revised-indictment-trump-allies/,"While Donald Trump faces a fresh indictment over efforts to overturn the 2020 election, some of his biggest allies are hoping the revised charging document helps them evade professional consequences and criminal prosecution for their roles nearly four years ago.
Special counsel Jack Smith rewrote Trump’s federal indictment after the US Supreme Court ruled this summer that the president can’t be prosecuted for “official acts” taken while president. Smith not only narrowed the allegations against Trump but also removed references to communications between Trump and federal government officials.
Now former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark are trying to use their onetime boss’ winnowed indictment to their advantage.
Trump is the only one charged in the federal case, but several of his allies and members of his administration are facing state-level criminal charges over their meddling after the last election, including Clark and Meadows. Clark and others also are facing professional disciplinary proceedings that could disrupt their ability to practice law.
Meadows, in particular, could stand to benefit from the new Trump indictment handed up in federal court last week. Meadows was cut from much of the document, except for some interactions he had with Trump as the then-president sought to reach the secretary of state in Georgia on the phone to pressure him into aiding his election reversal gambit.
That has led Meadows’ attorneys to argue he should not be prosecuted for actions he took while serving in the White House. He’s been charged in Georgia and Arizona over his efforts to reverse the election results in the battleground states. His main defense so far has been to try to get the cases moved to federal court, which could make it easier for him to make a bid for his own immunity.
“I don’t think that’s Jack Smith’s intent,” an attorney close to the case told CNN about the new indictment bolstering Meadows’ argument. But, the attorney added, “it’s the way chips have fallen.”
Smith’s office declined to comment.
The Supreme Court’s ruling on immunity doesn’t provide protections outside of the president, but some legal experts say the fallout naturally extends beyond Trump – even if the arguments aren’t ultimately successful.
“These are not legal arguments that are, you know, outside the bounds of plausibility or just kind of good legal argumentation,” said Anthony Michael Kreis, a constitutional law professor at Georgia State University.
“But I think that they are weak,” he added.
Meadows has already seized on the changes in the new federal indictment in his Arizona criminal case.
“Mr. Meadows’ case for removal (to federal court) is supported by the superseding indictment filed this week by Special Counsel Jack Smith in United States v. Trump,” Meadows’ attorneys wrote in a court filing two days after the new indictment was unveiled.
The lawyers pointed to language Smith added to the indictment about the Georgia call in an apparent effort to distinguish it from Meadows’ role as chief of staff. The new indictment notes that Meadows “sometimes handled private and Campaign logistics for (Trump).”
Meadows’ attorneys took issue with that in the Arizona case.
“This is not an alleged criminal act by Mr. Meadows; as Chief of Staff, he was carrying out his official duties, even if the President was engaged in ‘unofficial’ activity,” they wrote in the court filing.
A federal judge in Arizona is set to consider Meadow’s arguments for moving his state criminal case to federal court during a hearing Thursday. A grand jury in Arizona handed up an indictment in April against Meadows and 17 other Trump associates over their election reversal efforts. Meadows has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
Two federal courts have already rejected Meadows’ bid to move his Georgia prosecution to federal court. His request for the Supreme Court to review the matter remains pending.
Clark could also stand to benefit from the new Trump indictment.
As an environmental lawyer at the Justice Department, Clark tried to push through a letter to officials in Georgia after the 2020 election, urging the state to interfere with the election results.
Though Clark was previously an unindicted co-conspirator of Trump’s in Smith’s case, the special counsel prosecutors have taken him out of the indictment entirely, because of the Supreme Court decision that his efforts were undertaken as an officer of the president.
Like Meadows’ legal team, Clark’s attorney has wasted no time in trying to invoke the superseding indictment to his client’s advantage. In a filing last week as part of professional disciplinary proceedings, Clarks’ attorney said it “bolsters Mr. Clark’s immunity and evidentiary arguments.”
“The issuance of a new indictment handed down by a new grand jury effectively concedes that Mr. Clark is not just unidicted (sic), but unindictable,” his attorney, Harry MacDougald, wrote.
Clark also is trying to move his Georgia criminal case to federal court. That criminal case is currently on hold while a Georgia appeals court considers an attempt by some of the defendants to disqualify the Atlanta-area prosecutor who brought the charges.
Several former Trump administration officials – including some who were compelled to speak to the grand jury more than a year ago or were described as witnesses in the previous indictment – were relieved to see the new version deleted them as well as the allegations they witnessed, sources familiar with the matter told CNN.
They hope the superseding indictment means they won’t have to testify publicly against the former president, if his case goes to trial, the sources said.
Smith waged secret court fights for months to force advisers like former White House counsel Pat Cipollone to appear before the grand jury in the Trump election subversion investigation. Cipollone, who was described in the original indictment, no longer appears in the superseding indictment.
Some legal experts say the Justice Department could be less likely to push for testimony from White House officials in future criminal investigations if prosecutors aren’t able to use their testimony at trial.
Still, some witnesses like Meadows could appear in court in Trump’s case before a trial. Courts still must determine whether some of Trump’s actions after the 2020 election were presidential – and therefore immune – or part of his campaign, and Trump’s allies could be called to testify."

Israeli soldiers found the six bodies in tunnels under the enclave, according to the military. The hostages were “brutally murdered by Hamas terrorists, a short while before we reached them,” Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said in a briefing Sunday.
The development has sparked protests across Israel, with fresh public anger directed at Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his cabinet for failing to secure a hostage deal. Israel’s largest trade union has also called for a nationwide strike starting Monday.
Three of the six whose bodies were recovered had been expected to be released during the first phase of an eventual ceasefire agreement, two Israeli officials have told CNN.
Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Eden Yerushalmi and Carmel Gat were slated to be released as part of a “humanitarian category,” based on a framework agreed by Israel and Hamas in early July, the officials said.
“Our prime minister delayed it,” one of the Israeli officials said. “It’s way too late for the six who have been killed, but it’s time to reach an agreement.”
The ordeal of California native Goldberg-Polin, who was taken at gunpoint at the Nova music festival on October 7, led to him becoming one of the faces of the devastating international hostage crisis that has challenged Netanyahu’s leadership and triggered widespread destruction in Gaza.
The parents of 23-year-old Goldberg-Polin have been among the most vocal of the hostage families pushing Netanyahu to seek a deal securing their relatives’ return. Their tireless and high-profile campaigning saw them meet with world leaders, and earlier this month, give an emotional address at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago.

“With broken hearts, the Goldberg-Polin family is devastated to announce the death of their beloved son and brother, Hersh. The family thanks you all for your love and support and asks for privacy at this time,” the family said in a statement Sunday.
The Israeli military named the other three victims as Almog Sarusi, Alex Lobanov and Ori Danino. CNN is reaching out to their families.
In a taped message Sunday, Netanyahu said he had been shocked to the core by what he said was “the terrible cold-blooded murder of six of our hostages.” He also stressed that “those who murder hostages do not want a deal.”
He said Israel would continue to pursue Hamas, and accused it of not wanting to conduct genuine negotiations since December.
“Three months ago, on May 27, Israel agreed to a hostage release deal with the full backing of the United States. Hamas refused. Even after the United States updated the outline of the deal on August 16 – we agreed, and Hamas again refused.”
He added that the Israeli government and he, personally, are “committed to continue working towards a deal that will bring back all our hostages and guarantee our security and existence.”
In response, the Hostages Families Forum, a volunteer-based organization that represents relatives of those held captive, criticized the Prime Minister, calling on him to “stop blaming everyone” and to “take responsibility” for his alleged failures.
“Take responsibility for the thwarting (of a deal). Take responsibility for the neglect. Take responsibility for the hostages who were murdered in captivity,” the Forum demanded in a statement.
The Forum also said Netanyahu had ignored the views of the security establishment in insisting on conditions in the negotiations.
“Hamas is not the only one responsible for the thwarting of the deal. We do not expect the terrorist (Hamas leader Yahya) Sinwar to want to return the hostages, we expect the Prime Minister of Israel to do everything, everything, everything in order to return the hostages home.”
The Forum has called for demonstrations across Israel, while also announcing a vigil honoring the “hostages murdered in Gaza by Hamas” in Tel Aviv at 6 p.m. local time (11 a.m. ET).
US President Joe Biden said the bodies of the hostages were recovered under the city of Rafah in southern Gaza.
“I am devastated and outraged,” Biden said in a statement released by the White House that also paid tribute to Goldberg-Polin’s parents.
“They have been courageous, wise, and steadfast, even as they have endured the unimaginable,” Biden said. “They have been relentless and irrepressible champions of their son and of all the hostages held in unconscionable conditions.”
Goldberg-Polin’s death in particular will reverberate not just in Israel but in US political circles.
His parents Rachel and Jonathan have regularly met top US officials in Washington to press the case of the hostages, and their emotional address to top Democrats at the convention earlier this month inextricably tied the hostages’ fate to US policy over the war in Gaza.
Rachel Goldberg-Polin told CNN in January that she wears a piece of tape marking each day that has passed since her son was kidnapped.
At her convention speech, she described life since October 7 as like living on “another planet.”
“Anyone who is a parent or has had a parent can try to imagine the anguish and misery that Jon and I and all the hostage families are enduring,” she told delegates.
Some of those discovered dead in the tunnels under Gaza this weekend were, like Goldberg-Polin, captured at the Nova music festival. Lobanov, a 32-year-old father of two, and Yerushalmi, 24, were both tending bar at the gathering, according to the Hostages Families Forum. Danino, 25, and Sarusi, 27, were also at the festival.
Gat, 40, was taken from Kibbutz Be’eri. She had been visiting her parents when Hamas militants stormed the community close to Gaza’s border, killing and taking hostages as they went.
News of more hostage deaths piles pressure on Netanyahu as anger inside Israel swells over the failure to strike a ceasefire deal, and as stark disagreements between the prime minister and his military leaders increasingly spill out into the open.
A number of protests sparked across Israel on Sunday, with demonstrators’ anger directed at the government’s handling of the crisis.
Protests have occurred or are ongoing in Tel Aviv, Ra’anana, Rehovot and Be’er Sheva. In several instances, protesters have blocked roads – demanding an immediate agreement to secure the remaining hostages’ release. The banner at one protest read: “Look them in the eyes.”
The chairman of Israel’s General Federation of Labor (Histadrut) Arnon Bar-David has also called for a nationwide general strike to begin on Monday at 6 a.m. local time, after holding a “charged and difficult” meeting with representatives of hostage families in Tel Aviv.
“I will not tolerate the neglect,” Bar-David stated, emphasizing the urgency of the situation of the hostages in Gaza. Histadrut is the country’s biggest labor union.
“We are in a downward spiral, and we don’t stop receiving body bags. Only a strike would shock, and that’s why I’ve decided that starting tomorrow at six in the morning, the entire Israeli economy will shut down,” the labor leader said.
The hostage deaths up the stakes for Biden to push US ally Israel to find a way out of a devastating war in Gaza that has inflamed global public opinion and repeatedly threatened to spiral into an all-out regional conflict.
“Make no mistake, Hamas leaders will pay for these crimes. And we will keep working around the clock for a deal to secure the release of the remaining hostages,” Biden said in his statement on Goldberg-Polin’s death.
Israeli President Isaac Herzog said “the heart of an entire nation is shattered to pieces” by the news of the six dead.
“On behalf of the State of Israel, I embrace their families with all my heart, and apologize for failing to bring them home safely,” Herzog said in a statement.
“We will continue to fight relentlessly against the criminal, terrorist organization Hamas, which has once again proven there is no end to its willingness to commit murder and crimes against humanity.”
Israel launched its war against Hamas in Gaza after the militant group’s October 7 cross-border attacks, in which more than 1,200 Israelis were killed and 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli authorities.
More than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the war began, according to the health ministry in the enclave.
Anger has been growing inside Israel, led by many hostage families who believe Netanyahu and key far-right cabinet colleagues have been stalling on achieving a ceasefire resolution with Hamas that might bring those captured and killed home.
Netanyahu has been adamant that a deal can only be signed when Israel’s safety is assured.
But domestic pressure is building,  with the Hostages Families Forum being among the most critical of the Israeli prime minister.
“The delay in signing the deal has led to their deaths and those of many other hostages,” the forum said in a statement in English on Sunday.
“We call to Netanyahu: Stop hiding. Provide the public with a justification for this ongoing abandonment,” the forum added.
Biden said Saturday evening that his staff has been in touch with Israeli officials. Biden also called for an end to the war, expressing optimism that an agreement could be reached on a ceasefire-for-hostages deal and adding that parties involved in the negotiation have said they “agree on the principles.”
“It’s time this war ended,” Biden added. “I think we’re on the verge of having an agreement. It’s time to end it. It’s time to finish it.”
The US, Qatar and Egypt, who have acted as mediators, this month renewed a push to reach a hostage and ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas.
The mediators have proposed a three-phase approach: a first phase involving a six-week ceasefire; a second phase that would release all hostages and a withdrawal of all IDF presence from Gaza; and a third reconstruction phase.

“The Committee is holding this hearing because the Department of State was central to the Afghanistan withdrawal and served as the senior authority during the August non-combatant evacuation operation (NEO),” Republican Chairman Michael McCaul wrote of the hearing set for September 19.
In his letter, McCaul said Blinken had refused previous requests to appear before the committee.
The State Department said in a statement Wednesday that Blinken is unavailable to testify “on the dates proposed by the committee” and that they have proposed alternatives.
“It is disappointing that instead of continuing to engage with the department in good faith, the committee instead has issued yet another unnecessary subpoena,” Matthew Miller, a spokesman for the State Department, said in a statement.
McCaul has repeatedly called for accountability from the Biden administration on how the withdrawal from Afghanistan played out. He has slammed the administration for the Abbey Gate bombing that killed 13 US service members in the final chaotic days of the withdrawal.
McCaul is set to release on September 9 his committee’s report detailing the findings of its three-year investigation into the withdrawal from Afghanistan.
McCaul, in a statement, said the report “will serve as an indictment on the administration’s reckless refusal to properly prepare for the withdrawal, their cold indifference to the safety and security of U.S. personnel on the ground before and during the emergency evacuation, and their culpability in the deaths of 13 U.S. servicemembers who perished in the terrorist attack at Abbey Gate.”
Last year, the US State Department publicly released its Afghanistan After Action Review report, which found that the decisions to pull all US troops from Afghanistan had detrimental consequences.
“The decisions of both President (Donald) Trump and President (Joe) Biden to end the U.S. military mission in Afghanistan had serious consequences for the viability of the Afghan government and its security,” the unclassified report said.
“Those decisions are beyond the scope of this review, but the AAR (After Action Review) team found that during both administrations there was insufficient senior-level consideration of worst-case scenarios and how quickly those might follow,” it said.
The committee has conducted more than a dozen interviews as part of the investigation into the 2021 evacuation.
Former White House press secretary Jen Psaki sat for a transcribed interview before the committee in late July.
And three top State Department officials provided hours of closed-door testimony to the committee, providing more on the “unprecedented” situation in the final days of the US presence in Afghanistan.
Those officials – John Bass, Jim DeHart and Jayne Howell – rushed to Kabul in the days surrounding the Taliban’s seizure of the capital city, and dove into creating systems on the fly alongside the US military and with constantly changing input on the ground and coming from DC, as CNN has reported.

A suspect in the shooting later led authorities on a chase that ended about 60 miles away in the waters off Galveston, where the man tried swimming away to evade arrest before being captured with the help of a marine unit, according to the Port of Galveston Police Department.
The deputy was identified as Maher Husseini, who had worked as a Harris County constable since 2021. Investigators were still trying to determine a motive for the shooting and whether the deputy had been targeted, Houston Police Chief J. Noe Diaz said.
Police were investigating whether it might have been an instance of road rage, he said.
“It’s an awful thing for the community, for someone to lose their life, someone that’s dedicated their life to public service,” Diaz said. “It is absolutely tragic.”
According to preliminary information, Husseini was not in uniform when he was shot, Diaz said. Bullet holes could be seen through the passenger side window of an SUV at the scene.
Husseini was taken to a Houston hospital where he was pronounced dead, Harris County Precinct 4 Constable Mark Herman said.
Authorities did not immediately release the name of the suspect in custody Tuesday evening. In a statement, Port of Galveston police said the man had led police on a pursuit that ended in a crash, followed by him swimming away.
Officers later found the suspect in the water and took him into custody. He was taken to a hospital for evaluation, police said.
“The dangerous criminal who ambushed and murdered Deputy Constable Husseini will have the full weight of the law brought down upon him,” Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said in a statement."
IFAWNU7JEA_FPDAGHSUU81HE3L,Costco’s first membership price hike in 7 years just went into effect,"By Jordan Valinsky, CNN","2 minute read Published 11:15 AM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240903,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/03/business/costco-membership-fee-price-increase/,"Costco customers are now paying more for their annual memberships for the first time since 2017.
The retailer announced in July that membership fees would increase by $5 to $65 a year in the US and Canada for three of its plans: “Gold Star,” “Business” and “Business Add-On.” The changes started for new members signing up on or after September 1 and renewals occurring after that date.
The price of Costco’s premium “Executive Membership” also went up, by $10 to $130 a year. However, those members will soon be able to earn a maximum of $1,250 in rewards annually versus $1,000 currently.
The company estimated that 52 million memberships will be impacted, a little over half of which are Executive members, Costco previously said.
Annual fees have been one of the biggest profit-generating areas for Costco, helping it offset expenses to keep its prices down. Last year, Costco earned $4.6 billion in revenue from membership fees, an 8% increase from 2022.
The fee hikes come as Costco, like streaming companies, has been taking more measures to ensure fewer non-subscribers are hitching a ride on other customers’ memberships.
Costco (COST) is cracking down on membership moochers by implementing stricter policies and requiring shoppers to scan their membership cards to enter stores.

“Over the coming months, membership scanning devices will be used at the entrance door of your local warehouse,” Costco said in a previous statement. “Once deployed, prior to entering, all members must scan their physical or digital membership card by placing the barcode or QR Code against the scanner.”
For members with cards that don’t have a photo, Costco says to come prepared with a valid photo ID but encourages shoppers to visit the membership counter and have their photo taken.
Costco’s new rule also requires all guests to be accompanied by a valid cardholder to enter its stores, making it more difficult for non-members to sneak in using cards that don’t belong to them.

IFH99WYLUM_IW9DRA1QGURBVEY,Mystery of ‘Pinnacle Man’ found frozen in a cave solved after nearly five decades,"By Graham Hurley, CNN","2 minute read Published 9:07 AM EDT, Sun September 1, 2024",20240902,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/01/us/pinnacle-man-identified-five-decades/,"A man found frozen in a Pennsylvania cave in 1977 has finally been identified, closing the book on a nearly 50-year-long mystery.
The Berks County Coroner’s Office identified the remains of the missing man as Nicholas Paul Grubb, 27, from Fort Washington, Pennsylvania.
Surprisingly, advanced technology played no role in identifying the “Pinnacle Man,” a moniker inspired by the peak in the Appalachian Mountains near where Grubb was found.
Instead, Berks County Coroner John Fielding told reporters at a Tuesday news conference that a Pennsylvania State Police detective discovered the missing link to the cold case the old-fashioned way, by digging through files.
On January 16, 1977, hikers found a man’s frozen body in a cave just below the Pinnacle, in Albany Township, the Berks County Coroner said at the news conference.

During the autopsy he was unable to be identified based on his appearance, clothing or belongings, according to George Holmes, chief deputy coroner of Berks County. The cause of death, according to Holmes, was determined to be a drug-induced overdose. There were no signs of trauma to Grubb’s body suggesting foul play, the coroner’s office said.
Dental records and fingerprints were collected from the man’s body during his autopsy, according to Holmes, who added that the fingerprints were misplaced.
More than 42 years passed before authorities revisited the cold case, according to CNN affiliate WFMZ, which reported Grubb’s body was exhumed in 2019 after dental records linked him to two missing person cases in Florida and Illinois.
Berks County forensic experts performed an exam in 2019, and DNA samples were taken to update his record in the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System, or NamUs. But they did not match the two missing person cases, the coroner’s office said.

Fast-forward to early August, when there was a major break in the cold case. Ian Keck of the Pennsylvania State Police found the lost fingerprint card from Grubb’s 1977 autopsy.
Keck submitted the fingerprint card to NamUs on August 12, according to Holmes, and within an hour an FBI fingerprint expert matched the Pinnacle Man’s fingerprints to Grubb’s.
One of Grubb’s family members was notified by the Berks County Coroner’s Office, who confirmed Grubb’s identity. The family member asked the office to place his remains in the family plot.
“This identification brings a long awaited resolution to his family, who have been notified and expressed their deep appreciation for the collective efforts that made it possible. It is moments like these that remind us of the importance of our work to provide answers, to bring closure and to give the unidentified a name and a story,” Fielding said."
IFSQYGLMSC_CEP6FOYI7087CL6,Why your next trip to the gyno might be different: There’s an alternative to Pap smears,"By Jacqueline Howard, CNN","7 minute read Updated 8:50 AM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/05/health/cervical-cancer-screening-self-collection-kits/,"The first shipments of some self-collection HPV tests for cervical cancer screening are currently on their way to doctors’ offices across the United States.
In May, the US Food and Drug Administration gave the greenlight for patients to have the option to collect their own vaginal samples for cervical cancer screenings instead of undergoing traditional HPV tests or Pap smears, which involve a speculum to screen for the disease. Similar to how they may collect their own urine samples, patients can now collect their own vaginal samples in a health-care setting, such as a doctor’s office, urgent care or pharmacy clinic.

So far, two health care businesses – biotechnology company Roche and medical technology firm BD – already have HPV tests that can be used with self-collected samples. Most cervical cancer screenings involve testing for human papillomavirus or HPV, as most cervical cancers are caused by the virus.
Shipments of the BD self-collection HPV tests began Thursday, according to the company. And Roche anticipates that its HPV self-collection screening solution will be shipped sometime this fall.
The hope is that providing a self-collection method will make screening more accessible for patients, leading to more women being screened, said Dr. Jeff Andrews, board-certified gynecologist and vice president of Global Medical Affairs for Diagnostic Solutions at BD.
Each year in the United States, more than 11,000 new cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed and about 4,000 women die of the disease, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It’s estimated that about half of invasive cervical cancer cases are diagnosed in people who have never been screened and about 10% of diagnoses are in people who had not been screened in the five years prior.
“In other countries in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, we know that adding the option of self-collection has reached some of those women who were previously under screened. So that’s the main goal, is to develop a methodology that would appeal to persons with a cervix who would otherwise not be screened,” Andrews said.
“In the United States in particular, almost 30% of women are unscreened or under screened,” he said. “Those women are the ones most likely to have cervical cancer. About two-thirds of cervical cancers occur in women who are not screened within the interval,” as in the recommended time interval for which women are recommended to screen.
The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for cervical cancer with cervical cytology– also known as a Pap test or Pap smear –every three years for women ages 21 to 29. For women ages 30 to 65, the USPSTF recommends screening every three years with cervical cytology alone, every five years with high-risk HPV testing alone, or every five years with high-risk HPV testing in combination with cytology.
Typically, gynecologists collect samples for HPV testing, a cervical cytology or both – and any of those screening methods, in which samples are collected, can feel uncomfortable for some patients when they involve a speculum.
Cervical cytology involves examining cervical cells for changes to find precancerous or cancerous cells. The HPV test checks cells for infection with the high-risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer. An HPV and Pap co-test uses both tests together to check for both high-risk HPV and cervical cell changes.

It’s estimated that about 80% of people will get an HPV infection in their lifetime. HPV, a group of more than 150 viruses, is spread primarily through sexual contact and includes low-risk strains, which most often cause warts, and high-risk strains, which have been associated with an increased risk of certain cancers, such as cervical, anal, penile and oropharyngeal cancers. In most cases, HPV clears on its own within two years, but when the infection does not go away, health problems like cancer may occur.
“Almost all cervical cancers are caused by persistent infection with certain types of HPV,” Dr. Karen E. Knudsen, CEO of the American Cancer Society, said in a news release in May when the FDA approved HPV self-collection testing for cervical cancer screening. “Self-collection can expand access to screening and reduces barriers, which will give more people the opportunity to detect, treat, and ultimately survive cancer.”
For some patients, having a provider collect a vaginal sample for cervical cancer screening or HPV testing can be painful or awkward. The screening process involves a patient spreading their legs, with their feet held in stirrups, as their doctor vaginally inserts a cold, metal speculum so that they can then scrape cells from their cervix.
Many patients may skip recommended Pap exams to screen for cervical cancer because the process of a traditional Pap smear screening can be painful.

Research suggests that having the perception that a Pap test will be painful significantly reduces the likelihood of women setting the goal to schedule their first-ever Pap exam. But minimizing pain during a Pap test will likely increase acceptability of and adherence to cervical cancer screenings.
“If we can increase screening, we can reduce the incidence of this cancer. Having another modality or choice to make screening more accessible and available is important especially for our underinsured and underserved populations. Self-screening offers this extra choice for women,” Dr. John Vullo, chairman of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Catholic Health’s Good Samaritan University Hospital on Long Island and associate chair of Catholic Health Women’s Health Services, said in an email.
“Although I believe this new choice is important to offer our patients, I am glad the current recommendations are for it to be used under the supervision of a provider so that the patient can truly get and understand the benefits and limitations of this new testing,” Vullo said in part. “This will allow us to offer them another modality to screen for cervical cancer while still giving them the benefit of speaking with a provider to discuss other health issues that are part of the annual well woman exam.”
For the self-collection screening test, a clinician would have to order the test for a patient, and “that is to be sure that the person doing the test will get the results explained to them, so the person now would be in contact with their provider,” Andrews said.
That order would be directed to a lab. The lab would then create a self-collection kit, which would include instructions, a six-inch swab and the screening test itself. The kit would be shipped to the doctor’s office for the patient. The patient would use the swab to self-collect a vaginal sample, by inserting it three inches into the vagina – this could be done in the bathroom at the doctor’s office – and then the doctor’s office would ship the sample to the lab for processing. If a sample tests positive, the doctor would likely recommend further testing.
While the self-collection method is now available in health-care settings, companies are hoping the self-collection kits could eventually be cleared for use at home, too.
BD has been working closely with the FDA to provide data supporting the use of its self-collection tests within the home, Andrews said.
Another company, Teal Health, has developed an at-home cervical cancer screening device called the Teal Wand that was granted “breakthrough device” status in May by the FDA, which would allow the agency to review the device on a faster timeline.
“FDA’s recognition of the Teal Wand as a Breakthrough device acknowledges the important public health benefit that self-collection for cervical cancer screening can have on those who are rarely screened or who do not participate in clinician-based screening for cervical cancer,” Trena Depel, vice president of clinical and regulatory at Teal Health, said in a news release at the time.
Regardless of where it takes place, screening for cervical cancer remains important because early cases often may not have signs or symptoms. Advanced cases may cause abnormal vaginal bleeding or unusual discharge. Cervical cancer is treated in many ways, including surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy.
Some of the most important steps women can take to help prevent cervical cancer, according to the CDC, are to get vaccinated against HPV, not smoke, use condoms during sex, have regular screening tests and go back to see the doctor if screening test results are not normal."
IJPSK17QK2_CD2MI1K1WK8PC39,CNN polls across six battlegrounds find Georgia and Pennsylvania are key toss-ups,"By Jennifer Agiesta, Ariel Edwards-Levy and Edward Wu, CNN","11 minute read Updated 8:42 AM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/04/politics/cnn-polls-battleground-states/,"The 2024 presidential campaign’s home stretch kicks off with a mixed outlook across six key battlegrounds, according to new CNN polls conducted by SSRS in each state. Vice President Kamala Harris holds an advantage over former President Donald Trump among likely voters in Wisconsin and Michigan, while Trump has the edge in Arizona. The two split likely voters almost evenly in Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania, the state with the largest electoral vote prize that’s widely seen as up for grabs.
Across each of them, an average of 15% of likely voters say they have not yet firmly decided their choice, suggesting a sizable share of voters could shift their views on the race as attention to the campaign rises and campaign activity, especially in these states, hits a fever pitch in the final nine weeks before Election Day.
Likely voters in Wisconsin break 50% for Harris to 44% for Trump, and in Michigan, it’s 48% Harris to 43% Trump. In Arizona, Trump lands at 49% to Harris’ 44%. In Georgia and Nevada, 48% back Harris to 47% for Trump, and in Pennsylvania, the candidates are tied at 47%.
The polls, conducted after the Democratic National Convention in August, reflect results among likely voters determined through a combination of past vote behavior and current intention to vote.

The findings suggest an Electoral College landscape where Pennsylvania and Georgia are central to each candidate’s path to the White House. President Joe Biden carried all six of these states in 2020, winning Georgia by just under 12,000 votes and Arizona by a little over 10,000 votes. Were Harris to hold Biden’s 2020 wins outside of these six states and carry Wisconsin and Michigan, a win in Pennsylvania plus a single electoral vote from anywhere else would give her the presidency. Should Trump hold North Carolina – a state he carried in 2020 and that is widely considered a battleground in this year’s contest – wins in Georgia and Pennsylvania would put him over the top regardless of what happens in Wisconsin, Michigan or Nevada. In that scenario, even Arizona, where he currently holds a narrow lead, would not be necessary for Trump to win another term as president.
Harris’ emergence as the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee, replacing Biden atop the party’s ticket this summer, has altered some dynamics in the race but left others intact. Economic issues, which posed a notable weak point for Biden, remain the topic most often chosen by voters when asked what matters to their choice for president; an average of 39% of likely voters across states choose the economy as their top issue, with protecting democracy next at an average of 25%. But Harris now trails Trump on trust to handle the economy by relatively smaller margins than Biden did; across the current polls, Trump is more trusted than Harris on the economy by 8 points on average. (In New York Times/Siena College polls of the same six states this spring, the same calculation yielded a 20-point Trump advantage over Biden.) Trump maintains a broad advantage as more trusted to handle immigration, while Harris has built on Biden’s lead as more trusted to handle abortion and reproductive rights, with women across these six states preferring her by an average of 27 percentage points on the issue.
Across nearly all of these states, likely voters are more apt to describe Trump than Harris as having clear policy plans to solve the country’s problems (voters split about evenly on this question in Wisconsin and Michigan), but voters in these swing states largely describe Harris’ views and policies as mainstream and Trump’s as too extreme. About half in each state (between 46% and 51%) say Trump’s views and policies are so extreme that they pose a threat to the country, while around 4 in 10 (between 37% and 42%) say the same about Harris’ positions.
Harris tops Trump across these states in being seen by voters as more apt to care about “people like you” – narrowly so in Arizona and Pennsylvania – and as someone they would be proud to have as president. Voters’ views on who would bring the kind of change the country needs vary state-to-state and are generally closely divided.
Independent voters, whose preferences in the presidential race vary widely state-to-state, are notably likely to say that they could change their minds about the race; roughly a quarter of independent likely voters or more feel that way across states. And they also are more likely than other respondents to say they think neither Harris nor Trump will unite the country rather than divide it (33% on average across states say so), that neither has clear policy plans to solve the country’s problems (31% on average) and that neither cares about people like them (26% on average).
As the sitting vice president, Harris is tied to an unpopular White House: Biden’s approval rating stands in negative territory with likely voters across all six states, with approval around 40% in all but Wisconsin, where it stands at 44%.
Still, Harris currently holds an average of 16% support among likely voters who disapprove of Biden’s job as president. The last time a sitting vice president ran for the White House, in 2000, Al Gore captured just 9% of those who disapproved of President Bill Clinton’s job performance nationwide, according to exit polls.
Both Georgia and Pennsylvania remain thoroughly up for grabs, according to the polls, with tight margins overall and double-digit shares of likely voters – 12% in Georgia and 16% in Pennsylvania – saying they haven’t yet decided on a candidate, or that they might change their minds.
Black voters are a key bloc in both states, particularly in Georgia, and according to these polls, Harris stands at 85% among Black likely voters in Georgia and at 84% in Pennsylvania. In both states, though, Black registered voters express less motivation to vote in this year’s election than White voters do. In Georgia, 61% of Black registered voters say they are extremely motivated to vote compared with 70% among White voters, and in Pennsylvania, just 56% of Black voters say they are deeply motivated to vote compared with 72% of White voters.
Both states see significant gender gaps in presidential preference, with Harris ahead by double-digits among female likely voters in both states while Trump has similarly large leads among male likely voters. Harris widens her margin slightly in both states among suburban women, topping Trump by 16 points with that group in Georgia and 18 points in Pennsylvania.
Harris carries a majority of likely voters younger than 35 in both states, leading 59% to 36% in Pennsylvania, and 54% to 41% in Georgia.
White likely voters without college degrees in both states break broadly for Trump, particularly in Georgia, where roughly 7 in 10 support him. White likely voters who do have four-year college degrees, though, split in opposite directions across the two states. In Pennsylvania, they broadly favor Harris, 59% to 37%, while in Georgia, they are solidly in Trump’s camp, 65% to 32%. That dynamic is similar to the divide seen in 2020 exit polling.
Harris’ narrow leads in Wisconsin and Michigan are largely driven by consolidation of the Democratic base, as well as increased motivation among Democratic and Democratic-leaning likely voters, who are broadly aligned behind Harris now (96% in Michigan and 95% in Wisconsin support her).
CNN’s March 2024 poll in Michigan, fielded after Trump and Biden had secured enough delegates to win their parties’ nominations, found only 75% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning registered voters expressed support for Biden.
In both states, Harris’ support among some key demographics of the Democratic Party’s base resembles that of Biden’s 2020 win. Harris leads Trump among female likely voters (55% to 38% in Wisconsin, 54% to 38% in Michigan), White voters with college degrees (62% to 31% in Wisconsin, 52% to 41% in Michigan), and by 86% to 11% among Black likely voters in Michigan (the sample size for Black likely voters is not large enough to report in Wisconsin).
Younger voters here are less broadly in Harris’ camp than in Georgia, Pennsylvania or Nevada. In Michigan, voters younger than 35 split 43% for Harris and 42% for Trump. In Wisconsin, they break 49% Harris and 42% Trump. Both states were central to the uncommitted movement’s efforts to log protest votes against Biden during the Democratic presidential primary, an effort focused at least in part on younger voters.
The polls suggest enthusiasm among the Democratic base may be a factor in both states. In Michigan, 72% of Democratic-aligned registered voters say they are extremely motivated to vote, up from 58% in March, while the numbers among GOP-aligned voters remained effectively unchanged at about 7 in 10. And among registered voters in Wisconsin, 81% of Democratic-aligned voters and 70% of Republican-aligned voters say they are extremely motivated to vote.
Arizona, where Trump holds a narrow lead overall, stands out in these polls as the one state where Harris appears not to have restored support among several key Democratic groups, notably Latino voters, younger voters and White voters with college degrees. The contrast with Nevada demonstrates the difference.
In Nevada, Latino likely voters break broadly toward Harris, 57% to 37%, while they are more evenly divided in Arizona, 49% Harris to 43% Trump. White voters in both states break toward Trump by double-digit margins (56% to 39% in Arizona, 55% to 41% in Nevada). Harris carries White voters with college degrees in Nevada, 56% to 41%, while that group splits evenly, 47% each, in Arizona.
Younger voters in Arizona break narrowly in Trump’s favor: 48% of likely voters younger than 35 say they support Trump, compared with 42% behind Harris, a result within the margin of sampling error for that subset. In Nevada, though, likely voters in that age group divide 54% to Harris to 39% Trump.
And the gender gap in Arizona appears smaller than in other states, with women splitting 48% Harris to 45% Trump while men divide 55% Trump to 41% Harris. In Nevada, Harris holds a 16-point lead among female likely voters. (Among male likely voters in Nevada, Trump has an 18-point lead, 57% to 39%)
These results – a narrow Trump edge in Arizona and an even race in Nevada – come even as downballot races in the two states suggest a more favorable climate for Democrats. Arizona’s closely contested Senate race stands at 47% for Democrat Ruben Gallego with Republican Kari Lake at 44%, and a ballot measure designed to create a fundamental right to abortion in the state’s constitution holds overwhelming support – 62% say they’d vote in favor of it while 35% say they would oppose it. And in Nevada, incumbent Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen stands at 50% support to Republican Sam Brown’s 40%.
The findings suggest Trump may hold broader appeal in these states than elsewhere in the battlegrounds. He racks up some of his largest advantages as more trusted on handling the economy (up 16 points over Harris in Nevada and 15 points in Arizona, compared with an average 5 point lead across the other four states), immigration (up 17 points in Arizona and 12 points in Nevada, up by an average of 9 points in other states) and crime and safety (up 10 points in Nevada and 9 in Arizona, up by an average of 3 points in other states) in these two states, and is narrowly more likely to be seen as having generally mainstream views and policies here than elsewhere (50% in Arizona and 47% in Nevada see him that way, compared with 45% or less in the other four states).
The surveys show slim support for third-party and independent candidates, but in a close race, even small levels of support for such candidates can be meaningful. Voters were asked to choose among the candidates who were most likely to be included in each state’s ballot at the time the poll began based on candidate filings and existing rulings for who would be named on each ballot.
Independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was included in Michigan where there was no clear path for his name to be removed from the ballot even after he suspended his campaign, and received 4% support among likely voters, but he was not listed in the other states. The Wisconsin Elections Commission rejected a request from Kennedy to remove his name from the ballot while the poll was in the field.
Green Party candidate Jill Stein received 2% support in Arizona, but 1% or less elsewhere, and Libertarian Chase Oliver held 2% support in Wisconsin, but 1% or less in all other states. Independent Cornel West held 1% support in Georgia, but less than that in Wisconsin and was not included in the poll for other states.
Results on Senate races across the five states that have them here show a more favorable climate for Democrats downballot in some key states, but suggest little ticket splitting in others, with the surveys finding some closer contests than other recent public polling. Democrats currently hold the Senate seats up for election this year in Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and retiring independent incumbent Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona caucuses with the Democratic Party.
Democratic incumbents lead in Nevada (Rosen 50% to Brown 40%) and Wisconsin (Sen. Tammy Baldwin at 51% to Republican Eric Hovde’s 45%), and in the open Michigan Senate race, Democrat Elissa Slotkin tops Republican Mike Rogers 47% to 41% in the poll. But the survey finds closer races with no clear leader in Arizona (Gallego 47% to Lake 44%) and Pennsylvania (Sen. Bob Casey and Republican David McCormick each at 46%).
Interviews conducted August 23-29, 2024, online and by telephone with registered voters, including 682 voters in Arizona, 617 in Georgia, 708 in Michigan, 626 in Nevada, 789 in Pennsylvania, and 976 in Wisconsin. Likely voters include all registered voters in the poll weighted for their predicted likelihood of voting in this year’s election."
IKZENTN0JT_83WGS54TZCCVH85,Dozens killed in Russian strike on military educational facility in central Ukraine,"By Ivana Kottasová, Svitlana Vlasova and Kosta Gak, CNN","3 minute read Updated 12:02 AM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240903,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/03/europe/ukraine-poltava-russia-attack-intl/,"A Russian strike against a military educational facility in central Ukraine killed 51 people and injured more than 200 others, according to Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office, in one of the deadliest single attacks since the start of Moscow’s full-scale invasion in February 2022.
President Volodymyr Zelensky said preliminary information indicated two ballistic missiles hit the facility in the city of Poltava and a nearby hospital on Tuesday morning.
“We say again and again to everyone in the world who has the power to stop this terror: air defense systems and missiles are needed in Ukraine, not somewhere in a warehouse,” Zelensky said in a statement.
The head of the Poltava region military administration, Filip Pronin, announced the latest death toll on Telegram, adding that that rescue crews continue to clear and search through the debris at the site. Pronin said authorities believe up to 18 more people may be under the rubble.
At least 10 residential buildings were also damaged in Poltava, he said.
Moscow has not commented on the attack, but a well-known Russian military blogger Vladimir Rogov reported earlier on Tuesday that Russia struck a military school in Poltava.
Speaking about the attack, President Zelensky repeated his call on Ukraine’s Western allies to supply Kyiv with more air defenses and lift restrictions on his country’s military using their weapons to strike inside Russia.
“Long-range strikes that can protect against Russian terror are needed now, not later. Every day of delay is, unfortunately, the death of people,” he added.
Speaking to CNN’s Christiane Amanpour in Kyiv, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the missile reached the target in a very short period of time. People were struck down as they were trying to get into the bomb shelter, officials said.
“The only way to intercept them was to have the Patriot system or a SAMP/T air defense system because they are the only one capable of intercepting ballistic missiles,” said Kuleba, who added that he originally came from the Poltava region.
Ukraine has received a handful of Patriot air defense systems from the United States and Germany, although Kyiv has consistently said the number was insufficient to allow it to effectively defend itself.
The Biden administration said in June it was prioritizing critical air defense capabilities for Ukraine over other countries to “ensure Ukraine’s survival.” But Kuleba made it clear on Tuesday that new weapons cannot come soon enough.
“I don’t know how many more tragedies like this have to occur for all promises to be fulfilled and for all new commitments to be made,” Kuleba added, reiterating Zelensky’s calls for more defense systems to be sent to Ukraine.
Local authorities said Tuesday was a “terrible day for Poltava” and declared three days of mourning. No more details would be released about the strike due to “security issues,” they said.
Ukrainian first lady, Olena Zelenska, described the attack as a “terrible tragedy for the whole of Ukraine,” as Western allies condemned the scale and force of the Russian strike.
“My deepest condolences to the families of those killed and injured in the Russian missile attack on Poltava,” Zelenska said. “Russia is taking away our most valuable asset – our lives. We will never forget this.”
British Foreign Secretary David Lammy paid tribute to those killed, in a post on X. “Russia’s strikes on Poltava are the latest sickening act of aggression in Putin’s abhorrent and illegal war in Ukraine,” he said on Tuesday. “We stand with Ukraine.”

ILA42RKOQH_Q17Q327D0ZNO6PW,Scientific discovery that turns mouse skin transparent echoes plot of H.G. Wells’ ‘The Invisible Man’,"By Katie Hunt, CNN","5 minute read Updated 4:32 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/05/science/food-dye-transparent-mice-skin/,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.
In H.G. Wells’ 1897 science fiction novel, “The Invisible Man,” the protagonist invents a serum that makes the cells in his body transparent by controlling how they bend light.
More than 100 years later, scientists have discovered a real-life version of the substance: A commonly used food coloring can make the skin of a mouse temporarily transparent, allowing scientists to see its organs function, according to a new study published Thursday in the journal Science.
The breakthrough could revolutionize biomedical research and, should it be successfully tested in humans, have wide-ranging applications in medicine and health care, such as making veins more visible to draw blood.
Researchers made the skin on the skulls and bellies of live mice transparent by applying a mixture of water and a yellow food coloring called tartrazine. Washing away any remaining solution reversed the process, which did not harm the animals. The mice’s fur was removed before the application of the solution.
“For those who understand the fundamental physics behind this, it makes sense; but if you aren’t familiar with it, it looks like a magic trick,” said the study’s first author, Zihao Ou, assistant professor of physics at the University of Texas at Dallas, in a statement.
The “magic” uses insights from the field of optics. Light-absorbing dye molecules enhance the transmission of light through the skin by suppressing the tissue’s ability to scatter light.
The dye, when mixed with water, modifies the refractive index — a measure of the way a substance bends light — of the aqueous part of the tissue to better match the index of proteins and fats in the tissue. The process is akin to a dissipating cloud of fog.
“We combined the yellow dye, which is a molecule that absorbs most light, especially blue and ultraviolet light, with skin, which is a scattering medium,” said Ou, who conducted the study as a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University in California.

“Individually, these two things block most light from getting through them,” he said. “But when we put them together, we were able to achieve transparency of the mouse skin.”
Once the dye had completely diffused into the skin, the skin became transparent.
“It takes a few minutes for the transparency to appear,” Ou said. “It’s similar to the way a facial cream or mask works: The time needed depends on how fast the molecules diffuse into the skin.”
The team experimented with chicken breasts before conducting work on live animals.
In mice, the researchers were able to observe blood vessels directly in the surface of the brain through the transparent skin of the skull. The mice’s internal organs were visible in the abdomen as well as the muscle contractions that move food through the digestive tract.
The transparent areas take on an orangish color, Ou said, similar to that of the food dye.
The dye used in the solution is commonly known as FD&C Yellow No. 5, certified for use by the US Food and Drug Administration. The synthetic dye is frequently used in orange- or yellow-colored snack chips, candy coating, ice cream and baked goods. However, a 2021 study by the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment linked the coloring with behavioral difficulties and decreased attention among children. A state bill, if signed into law, would ban the use of the food coloring in food served in public schools in California.
Ou said it was important that the dye is biocompatible — safe for living organisms. “In addition, it’s very inexpensive and efficient; we don’t need very much of it to work,” he said.
The researchers have not tested the process on humans, and it’s not clear what dosage of dye or delivery method would be necessary. Human skin is about 10 times thicker than that of a mouse, according to the researchers.
“Looking forward, this technology could make veins more visible, easing … the procedure of drawing blood or administering fluids via a needle — especially for elderly patients with veins that are difficult to locate,” said senior author Guosong Hong, a Stanford assistant professor of materials science, via email.
“Moreover, this innovation could assist in the early detection of skin cancer, improve light penetration for deep tissue treatments like photodynamic and photothermal therapies, and make laser-based tattoo removal more straightforward.”
Christopher Rowlands, a senior lecturer in the department of bioengineering at Imperial College London, said he was “kicking himself” for not coming up with the same insight as the Stanford-led team, which is based on the widely studied and long-standing physics principle called Kramers-Kronig relations: When a material absorbs a lot of light at one color, it will bend light more at other colors.
“It’s blatantly obvious when someone points it out, but no one had thought of it for 100 and something years,” said Rowlands, who wasn’t involved in the study but coauthored a commentary published alongside the research.
Along with Jon Gorecki, an experimental optical physicist at the same institution who also wasn’t involved in the study, Rowlands wrote that the approach offered a new way to visualize the structure and activity of deep tissues and organs in a living animal in a safe, temporary and noninvasive manner.

“It just works. You rub it on a mouse, and you can see what it had for breakfast. It’s that powerful,” he added.
Rowlands and Gorecki said that existing methods to turn tissue transparent use solutions that have side effects such as dehydration and swelling and can alter the structure of the tissue. However, tartrazine was used at a low concentration, and its effects were easily undone, potentially facilitating prolonged study of biological processes in live animals, they wrote.
The duo noted the discovery was an example of life imitating art, with the dye solution echoing the serum imagined in “The Invisible Man.”
“The protagonist (in the story) invents a serum that renders the cells in his body transparent by precisely controlling their refractive index to match that of the surrounding medium, air,” they wrote.
“One hundred twenty-seven years later … biocompatible dyes make living tissues transparent by tuning the refractive index of the surrounding medium to match that of the cells.”

However, Ou and Hong said a totally invisible mouse was a stretch: The current approach cannot render bone transparent.
“So far, we only tested soft tissues, including brain, muscle, and skin. We haven’t done much investigation with hard tissues such as bone, so I am not sure if we would be able to make the mouse completely invisible,” Ou said via email.
“However, a partially transparent (mouse) will already enable numerous research opportunities to answer questions relating to development, regeneration, as well as aging.”"

The NUP said in a post on social media that Wine was shot in the leg in an attempt on his life, just outside the capital Kampala. Local police said however that the injury was caused when the popstar-turned-politician “stumbled while getting into a vehicle.”
Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, was the main opposition frontrunner in the presidential elections in January 2021 and lost to President Yoweri Museveni. Museveni claimed at the time that he had been re-elected for a sixth term despite widespread allegations of fraud and intimidation.
The NUP said in a post on ‘X’ that Wine was in Bulindo to meet a lawyer when “the police and military … surrounded our vehicles and started firing live bullets, teargas canisters and other projectiles.”
According to the NUP, Wine “was clearly targeted” and shot in the leg.
“Security operatives have made an attempt on the life of President Bobi Wine,” the NUP claimed on ‘X’.

Images posted on his own ‘X’ account show Wine bleeding and lying in a hospital bed, with a bleeding injury on his shin. A statement on his account said he is being treated by doctors after the shooting.
Local police told CNN in a statement that they intervened after Wine’s group blocked the road without permission. Despite being warned not to organize an event in the road, Wine “insisted on proceeding and closing the road, leading to police intervention to prevent the procession,” the police statement said.
“During the ensuing altercation, it is alleged that he sustained injuries. Police officers on site claim he stumbled while getting into his vehicle, causing the injury, whereas Hon. Kyagulanyi and his team assert that he was shot,” the police statement said, adding that an investigation is being conducted.
Wine has faced multiple arrests by Ugandan security forces over the years, particularly in the lead-up to Uganda’s controversial elections. He told CNN in a 2021 interview that he felt his life was in danger."
IP9EQSB81F_SHT73ULWUVWWGHQ,Suspect arrested after attack on Jewish University of Pittsburgh students,"By Jay Croft, CNN","2 minute read Published 6:07 PM EDT, Sat August 31, 2024",20240901,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/31/us/pittsburgh-jewish-students-attack-arrest/,"University of Pittsburgh police arrested a person suspected of attacking a group of Jewish students with a bottle Friday night, the school announced on its website.
The incident occurred near the Cathedral of Learning on campus. Two students were treated at the scene. The suspect, who has no known affiliation with the school, was immediately arrested and was in custody, the university said.
“Upon learning about this incident, Pitt leadership contacted Hillel University Center to offer support to our students and also connected with our partners at the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh,” the university said. “We are grateful to our Pitt Police officers for their swift action, and our Student Affairs team for their ongoing student support.”
There was no ongoing threat to the public, the school said.
It said, “To be clear: Neither acts of violence nor antisemitism will be tolerated. Local and federal partners are supporting Pitt Police in this ongoing investigation.”
The fall semester began Monday.
“The safety of our Jewish students remains a priority, and we will continue to be a home away from home for them, providing them with care, support and community,” Hillel University Center said in a statement.
University police said the incident was not connected to an earlier shooting at the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, across the street from the Cathedral of Learning. Pittsburgh Public Safety shared on X a man had been shot in the leg around 5:30 p.m. and was in stable condition.
CNN has reached out to university police requesting additional information about the incident but has not received a response.
On October 27, 2018, a man burst into the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh and shot people with an AR-15-style rifle. Eleven people were killed and six others, including four responding police officers, were wounded. It was the deadliest ever attack on Jews in the United States.
A federal jury sentenced him to death last year after prosecutors said the attack was motivated by the man’s hatred toward Jews, immigrants and particularly the non-profit organization Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society."

Working with the Syrian Democratic Forces, the US captured Khaled Ahmed al-Dandal early Sunday morning. Al-Dandal helped ISIS fighters who had escaped from detention facilities in Syria, including recently escaped fighters, CENTCOM said.
Last week, five ISIS detainees escaped from the Raqqa detention facility in Syria. The Syrian Democratic Forces recaptured two of the escapees, but the other three remain at large, CENTCOM said.
More than 9,000 ISIS detainees are held in over 20 detention facilities in Syria. The US is working to repatriate as many of the detainees as possible, but the process is incredibly slow. The large number of ISIS detainees held in the facility has made them a target for ISIS attacks as the group tries to free the prisoners.
“If a large number of these ISIS fighters escaped, it would pose an extreme danger to the region and beyond,” said Gen. Erik Kurilla, the commander of US Central Command. “We will continue to work with  the international community to repatriate these ISIS fighters to their countries of origin for final adjudication.”
The capture of al-Dandal comes just days after a separate raid against ISIS in Iraq in which seven US service members were wounded. Conducted with the Iraqi Security Forces, the operation killed 15 ISIS militants, US officials said, as the militaries targeted the hideouts of several ISIS leaders.
All of the injured service members are stable, according to three defense officials, and one of the injured was evacuated out of the region for additional care."

A “remarkable” Pictish ring with “an intricate setting” was discovered in Scotland by an amateur archaeologist after being buried for more than 1,000 years.
The “kite-shaped ring with a garnet or red glass center” was unearthed by a volunteer at the site of a fort in Burghead, in northeast Scotland, according to the University of Aberdeen, which led the dig.
John Ralph, a former engineer and graduate of the university, signed up as a volunteer for the Burghead digs after retiring.
Ralph, whom the university said describes himself as an “enthusiastic amateur,” had many moments over the two-week excavation when experts told him “he had a knack for finding ‘shiny pebbles.’” It was his third dig at the site.
“So when, on the last day of the final dig, he found something that looked interesting, he didn’t hold out much hope. It was only when he showed it to a fellow volunteer and his eyes lit up that he realized he might ‘have something,’” the university said in a statement Wednesday.
The Professor of Archaeology who led the excavation, Gordon Noble, said what Ralph presented to him was “truly remarkable.”
“John was digging and then came over and said ‘look what I’ve found,’” Noble said, according to the statement. “Even before the conservation work we could see it was something really exciting as despite more than a thousand years in the ground we could see glints of the possible garnet setting.”
The Picts were an ancient people who lived in what is now eastern and northeastern Scotland. Little is known about them, and “only limited and contentious documentary sources survive to evidence their six centuries of life,” according to the University of Aberdeen’s website. All traces of the Picts disappeared from the written records in the 9th century CE, it said.
Noble explained that there are “very few Pictish rings which have ever been discovered and those we do know about usually come from hoards which were placed in the ground deliberately for safekeeping in some way.”

“We certainly weren’t expecting to find something like this lying around the floor of what was once a house but that had appeared of low significance so, in typical fashion, we had left work on it until the final day of the dig,” Noble said.
The ring is undergoing analysis at the National Museum of Scotland’s Post-excavation Service, the university said.
Ralph, who grew up in Burghead, said he was thrilled to have helped understand the region’s Pictish past. “It is a real thrill to dig up an artefact in the knowledge that you are probably the first person to see it for 1,000-1,500 years,” he said. “It becomes a real guessing game of who owned it, what did they use it for and how was it lost.”
Susan O’Connor, Head of Grants at Historic Environment Scotland, said Ralph “played such a pivotal role in bringing it to light - literally!”
While the materials used to make the rink “are not particularly valuable in today’s monetary sense, this find is hugely significant for what it tells us about Pictish lives and society,” O’Connor said. “We’re excited to find out more once our colleagues in the National Museum have finished their investigations.”"
IY93SRP0OB_ID574N8AFMI6OGH,DOJ alleges Russia funded US media company linked to right-wing social media stars,"By Zachary Cohen, Donie O'Sullivan, Evan Perez, Sean Lyngaas and Majlie de Puy Kamp, CNN","6 minute read Updated 11:08 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/04/politics/doj-alleges-russia-funded-company-linked-social-media-stars/,"The unnamed Tennessee-based company that the Justice Department alleges was being funded by Russian operatives working as part of a Kremlin-orchestrated influence operation targeting the 2024 US election is Tenet Media, which is linked to right-wing commentators with millions of subscribers on YouTube and other social media platforms, according to a US official briefed on the matter.
The indictment unsealed in New York’s Southern District accused two employees of RT, the Kremlin’s media arm, of funneling nearly $10 million to an unidentified company, described only as “Company 1” in court documents.
CNN has independently confirmed that “Company 1” is Tenet Media, which is a platform for independent content creators. It is self-described as a “network of heterodox commentators that focus on Western political and cultural issues,” according to its website, which matches language contained in the newly unsealed indictment.
The alleged Russian operation tapped two people to set up the company in their names to add to its legitimacy and the two founders were aware Russian money backed the operation, according to the indictment.
The goal of the operation, according to prosecutors, was to fuel pro-Russian narratives, in part, by pushing content and news articles favoring Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and others who the Kremlin deemed to be friendlier to its interests.
Among the commentators listed on Tenet Media’s website are right-wing personalities Benny Johnson, Tim Pool and Dave Rubin. All have released statements saying they were victims of the alleged Russian scheme and they maintained editorial control of the content they created.
Each has a loyal fanbase online, with a combined roughly 6 million followers on YouTube alone. Pool interviewed Trump on his podcast in May.
Wednesday’s indictment outlined how the American social media stars were hired by Tenet Media. Some of the creators were told the project was being bankrolled by a man named Eduard Grigoriann. “In truth and fact,” the indictment reads, “Grigoriann was a fictional persona.”
The indictment outlines how one of the social media stars was approached by Tenet Media’s founder with an offer of $2 million a year to make videos for the company. One of the founders later wrote, “It would need to be closer to 5 million yearly for him to be interested,” according to the indictment.
The social media star expressed some skepticism about who was funding the deal and asked for more information about Grigoriann.
Eventually the social media star agreed on a contract of a $400,000 monthly fee to create “four weekly videos,” along with a $100,000 signing bonus.
Tenet Media’s US-based founders are not named in the indictment, but business records filed in Tennessee reveal two people connected to the company: Lauren Chen and Liam Donovan. A Twitter account for Donovan identifies him as the president of Tenet Media and his Instagram account describes Donovan as Chen’s husband.
A private message between the two in May 2021 read, “So we’re billing the Russians from the corporation, right?” Two weeks later, another message said, “Also, the Russians paid. So we’re good to bill them for the next month I guess,” the legal filing details.
Chen, is a rightwing online influencer in her own right. She has appeared in some of Tenet Media’s videos and has more than 500,000 subscribers on YouTube.
The Russian state-controlled media RT lists Chen as a contributor for several articles in 2021 and 2022. She is also linked to the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA. As of Thursday afternoon Turning Point US had deleted webpages featuring Chen.
A YouTube video referenced in the indictment further describes Tenet Media as “a project of Lauren Chen and her husband Liam.”
Blaze Media on Thursday said it had fired Chen.
BlazeTV, a subset of the Glenn Beck-founded conservative outlet, has since taken down a page that previously promoted content Chen produced for the outlet, including her show “Pseudo-Intellectual.”
“Lauren Chen was an independent contractor, whose contract has been terminated,” Tyler Cardon, the chief executive of Blaze Media, said in a statement to CNN. The news was first reported by Semafor.
YouTube has removed Tenet Media’s channel and others associated with Chen, a YouTube spokesperson said in a statement Thursday.
“Following an indictment from the US Department of Justice and after careful review, we are terminating the Tenet Media channel and four channels operated by its owner Lauren Chen as part of our ongoing efforts to combat coordinated influence operations,” the statement said.
The company’s investigation into the matter is ongoing, according to YouTube.
Neither Chen nor Donovan responded to CNN’s request for comment.
Others ensnared in the alleged Russian plot, however, insist they are the victims.
“We are disturbed by the allegations in today’s indictment, which make clear that myself and other influencers were victims in this alleged scheme,” Johnson wrote in a post on X after the indictment was unsealed on Wednesday.
“Should these allegations prove true, I as well as the other personalities and commentators were deceived and are victims,” Pool said on X. “The show is produced in its entirety by our local team without input from anyone external to the company,” he added.
In a statement also posted to X, Rubin wrote, “These allegations clearly show that I and other commentators were the victims of this scheme. I knew absolutely nothing about any of this fraudulent activity. Period.”
Adding, “The DoJ has never contacted me regarding this matter and I have no intention to comment further.”
The DOJ’s revealing of the alleged Russian plot was part of a wider set of actions the Biden administration announced Wednesday it was taking to tackle a major Russian government-backed effort to influence the 2024 US presidential election including sanctions on 10 individuals and entities, and the seizure of 32 internet domains.
At Russian President Vladimir Putin’s direction, three Russian companies used fake profiles to promote false narratives on social media, US Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said in a statement. Internal documents produced by one of those Russian companies show one of the goals of the propaganda effort was to boost the candidacy of Trump or whoever emerged as the Republican nominee for president, according to an FBI affidavit.
Taken together with the indictment of the RT employees, the actions represent the Biden administration’s most significant public response yet to alleged Russian influence operations targeting American voters. After the US accused Iran of trying to hack both the Trump and Biden-Harris campaigns last month, Wednesday’s actions are a reminder that US officials continue to see Russia as a prominent foreign influence threat to November’s election, sources familiar with the matter told CNN ahead of the announcements.

The phenomenon, also known as “atypical drowning,” means they had no water in their lungs, tracheas or stomachs, said a spokesperson for the lawyer of the captain of the Bayesian, which went down off the coast of the Sicilian port of Porticello on August 19.
There is no medically accepted “dry drowning” condition — “dry drowning” or other terms such as secondary drowning or delayed drowning are sometimes used to describe patients whose condition worsened after a drowning rescue or who had very little water in the lungs. However, the American Red Cross and other health organizations have recommended against using the terms; people may experience health impacts after being in water but it’s not the same as drowning, it says.
The cause of death of the first four victims suggests that they had found an air bubble in the cabin in which five of the victims’ bodies were discovered, and had consumed all the oxygen before the air pocket turned toxic due to carbon dioxide, according to local media reports.
The autopsies of American lawyer Chris Morvillo, his wife Neda Morvillo, Morgan Stanley banker Jonathan Bloomer and his wife Anne Elizabeth Judith Bloomer were carried out on Wednesday at the Forensic Medicine Institute of the Palermo Polyclinic hospital, officials said.
Autopsies on British tech titan Mike Lynch and his 18-year-old daughter are expected to be carried out on Friday.
No date has been set yet for the autopsy of Recaldo Thomas, the ship’s onboard chef – due to the difficulty reaching his family in Antigua.
All seven victims were scanned for injuries last Saturday, which found none had suffered broken bones or other physical injuries that might have contributed to their deaths.
The prosecutor investigating the case first suggested earlier in August the idea that the victims had been searching for an air pocket.
The autopsies are part of the criminal investigation into the ship’s captain James Cutfield, the ship’s machine engineer Tim Parker Eaton and sailor Matthew Griffith, who was on watch the night of the accident. None of the men is in Italy.
They are being investigated for “multiple manslaughter” and for causing a shipwreck, but authorities say this doesn’t mean they will be charged with any crimes. They were allowed to leave the country by the prosecutor in charge of the investigation.
The 56-meter yacht sank within 16 minutes of being struck by a downburst or tornado on the early morning of August 19. The ship will have to be raised for the investigation and to ensure that the 18,000 liters of fuel onboard do not leak into the sea around the port of Porticello near Palermo.
Bids have been sent out for the salvage, which will be paid for by the company of Lynch’s wife Angela Bacares, which owns the yacht.
Toxicology results on the seven victims are expected in the coming days. No alcohol or drug tests were carried out on any of the crew members, the prosecutor said in a press conference after all the victims’ bodies had been recovered.
Lynch and his business partner Stephen Chamberlain, who died after being struck by a car the day the Bayesian sank, had been acquitted of fraud charges in a US court in June 2024. The charges were related to the sale of their company Autonomy to Hewlett Packard, which has said it will not drop its civil lawsuit for $4 billion in damages now being heard in a UK court.

Recent TV ads highlight her time as a “border state prosecutor” who aggressively targeted criminal cartels and drug smugglers, as well as her support for “the toughest border security bill in decades.”
That bill, which failed in the Senate in February and again in May, included $650 million for new border wall construction. Images of the border wall built during the Trump administration are featured in the Harris ads, yet Harris repeatedly criticized the wall over the years, describing it as an affront to both hers and America’s values.
In her 2019 book, “The Truths We Hold,” Harris called the wall “useless” and said it was “nothing more than a symbol, a monument standing in opposition to not just everything I value, but to the fundamental values upon which this country was built.”
A CNN KFile review of Harris’ social media posts found that she criticized the border wall more than 50 times during the Trump administration, calling it, among other things, “stupid,” “useless,” and a “medieval vanity project.”
As she tries to strengthen her image on the border, Harris will have to reckon with her years of opposing some of the very policies she now embraces. That includes building more border wall and also making it harder for migrants to come to the US seeking asylum.
Harris has tacked to the middle on other key issues, such as no longer banning fracking or supporting Medicare for All — positions she once supported before being picked as Joe Biden’s vice presidential nominee.
In an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash last Thursday, Harris said, despite her policy shifts, “my values have not changed.”
Immigration and the border remain significant vulnerabilities for Harris and the Democratic party, according to some national polls, although recent polling suggests Harris has managed to narrow the gap.
Not all border work stopped during the Biden administration.
In 2021 and 2022, the administration continued work near the border wall to prevent flooding, complete prior construction of access roads and close “small gaps that remain open from prior construction activities and remediating incomplete gates.”
In October 2023, the Biden administration allowed the additional building of border wall in Texas, with Biden saying he had to use money appropriated for the wall in 2019 and could not redirect it.
“I tried to get them to reappropriate it, to redirect that money. They didn’t, they wouldn’t. And in the meantime, there’s nothing under the law other than they have to use the money for what it was appropriated. I can’t stop that,” Biden told reporters in the Oval Office at the time.
In response to questions from CNN, a Harris campaign aide said in referencing the recent campaign ad that it was “inaccurate to imply a few images” are “somehow representative of the VP’s overall policy position on a complex issue when the entirety of the ad, the VP’s remarks as the nominee, and the governance of this Administration have been clear where she stands on border security - supporting the bipartisan border agreement.”
Along with extending funding for more border barriers and hiring more federal immigration authorities, the border security bill that Harris has vowed to sign as president would also largely bar migrants from seeking asylum if they crossed the border unlawfully. Many of the people who encounter Border Patrol agents at the southern border are migrants seeking asylum and claim to be fleeing conflict or persecution in their home country.
A CNN KFile review of Harris’ comments from 2017 through August 2020, before Biden picked her as his running mate, found that she repeatedly pledged to “honor the process” of asylum established decades ago and slammed policies that restricted asylum seekers.
Harris was one of seven US senators who signed onto an amicus brief in late 2018 supporting a lawsuit filed by asylum seekers challenging a Trump administration rule that effectively barred all asylum claims outside ports of entry.
“United States law is crystal clear that men, women, and children who arrive at any point on our borders may seek asylum,” read the brief. “In our democratic system, laws may not be overturned by Executive fiat.”
A judge struck down that rule in August 2019 and the Trump administration lost its appeals.
While running for president in 2019, Harris pledged to respect asylum law and called restricting asylum a “stain on our moral conscience.”
“Under a Harris administration, issues like asylum, for example, we are gonna honor the process and not try to circumvent the process and expedite the process for the sake of some political goal as opposed to the sake of justice and fairness,” Harris said on the “Pod Save America” podcast in 2019.
She reiterated the pledge in several tweets at that time, writing in July 2019, “As president, I will immediately put in place a meaningful process to review asylum cases. I will release children from cages. I will get rid of the private detention centers. It’s time we had a president whose actions reflected the values of our country.”
During a June 2019 interview with CBS News, she vowed that a Harris administration would honor established asylum procedures, stating, “If they are deserving of protection, we will give it to ‘em.”
A year later, in June 2020, Harris was one of 34 senators to sign a congressional letter criticizing the Covid-era Title 42 authority, which allowed the government to bar migrants from entering the country because of the public health crisis. The letter equated Trump’s asylum policies to the denial of safe passage to Jewish refugees fleeing the Holocaust.
Shortly after Biden and Harris took office in 2021, the mass influx of asylum seekers at the US-Mexico border significantly strained US immigration resources. The Biden-Harris administration initially kept Title 42 in place. In 2022, Republicans sued to keep the administration from ending Title 42, which it finally did in May 2023 when it announced the end of national Covid-era emergency restrictions.
As vice president, Harris was tasked with overseeing diplomatic efforts to address the root causes of migration.
Despite this role, Harris’ current stance on asylum marks a notable departure from her earlier promises to uphold the asylum process and protect vulnerable migrants.
After Senate Republicans abandoned the border bill at the behest of Trump, the Biden administration took executive actions to restrict asylum. In June, Biden signed an executive order largely barring migrants who cross the border illegally from seeking asylum once a daily threshold is reached, a departure from longstanding US asylum policy.
While Harris has yet to publicly comment on her plans for asylum, her campaign manager has signaled Harris would continue implementing Biden’s executive orders curbing asylum.
Throughout the Trump administration, Harris was a consistent critic of the border wall.
In April 2018, Harris signed onto a letter that urged the appropriations committee to reduce funding for the border wall and to halt hiring new Border Patrol agents.
CNN identified one of the border walls in her new campaign ads as constructed during Trump’s presidency in Sasabe, Arizona, in an area where there had not previously been border wall. The other walls feature signs that they were Trump-era walls, such as so-called anti-climbing plates that were built during the Trump years.
“It’s the president’s vanity project,” Harris said in June 2019 at an event promoting her book. “Let’s just point to the facts and the evidence and the data. And the fact is that we are not facing a crisis.”
“This president rode a wave into office of vilifying, a whole population of people,” she said at another event in 2019. “His multi-billion dollar vanity project called a wall is nothing more than a distraction from the fact that he actually hasn’t focused on working people in America. So instead of focusing on the needs of working families in America, he creates a scapegoat, a boogeyman.”

J67RKZ3JZT_3RE9J0QZKA852PO,‘He was hunting’: Witness describes Colorado man accused of killing 10 at King Soopers in 2021 mass shooting,"By Ray Sanchez and Andi Babineau, CNN","9 minute read Updated 7:05 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/05/us/king-soopers-mass-shooting-trial/,"A retired emergency room physician on Thursday described the “calm expression” on the face of a shooter “hunting” down shoppers at a Boulder, Colorado, grocery store more than three years ago when 10 people were gunned down.
The testimony came after jurors heard a prosecutor describe the final moments of the victims during opening statements in the long-delayed trial of Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa.
Alissa is facing 10 counts of murder, 38 counts of attempted murder and numerous other charges after a judge ruled last year that he was fit to stand trial in the mass shooting at King Soopers on March 22, 2021. He pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity last November.
Days before the massacre Alissa was able to purchase a Ruger AR-556, which he used in the killings, after passing a background check, according to court records and the owner of a gun shop in Arvada, Colorado.
The mass shooting occurred in a state familiar with such tragedies, including the 1999 Columbine High School massacre in which 12 students and a teacher were killed and the 2012 Aurora movie theater shooting that claimed 12 lives.
One witness, Dr. Alison Sheets, a retired emergency room physician, told jurors Thursday that an afternoon of grocery shopping was interrupted by “loud noises.” She initially crouched behind a cardboard display before sliding sideways into a shelf of potato chips. Her yellow ski jacket blended with the yellow bags of chips, providing her cover, she said. She recalled gunshots and screaming.
At one point, Sheets testified, she could see the shooter walking by the aisle where she was hiding.
“He was hunting … as he walked by,” she said.
She added, “I did see his eyes. He was looking down the aisle… I sort of remember the stare looking down that aisle. It was not something I wanted to lock eyes with. So I turned away pretty quickly.”
She described a “calm expression” on the shooter’s face.
In the next aisle, Sheets testified, she heard a familiar sound from her work in emergency medicine.
“I heard someone die – just a little breath of exhalation of someone collapsing and dying. And I smelled blood after that,” she said, adding that she’s had “the unfortunate experience of seeing and being around multiple people who have passed.”
“I heard no other sounds from that spot for the remainder of the day,” Sheets said calmly.
Several jurors appeared visibly upset; some family members of the victims sniffled in the gallery. The defense did not cross-examine the seven witnesses who testified Thursday.
In its opening statements, the defense said it was “not contesting that the person that killed 10 innocent people and brought fear to so many others and grief and suffering to countless” was the defendant sitting in court.
Public defender Sam Dunn said Alissa has a “severe … treatment-resistant form of schizophrenia” and was “in the throes of a psychotic episode” the day of the shooting. The defendant told a psychologist during an evaluation that he heard “consistent voices … Just the consistent voices.”

On that March afternoon three years ago, prosecutor Michael Dougherty told jurors in his opening statements, the gunman picked “the perfect place for a mass shooting,” a bustling supermarket where people were stocking up for the week, stopping in for coffee, or picking up lunch.
“King Soopers is more than just a supermarket. It’s their place. It’s a community spot,” Dougherty said. “It’s the place they go over and over and over again. And on this day, it’s a place people will go and die.”
As Dougherty addressed the jury, Alissa – in a white button-down shirt with stripes and dark gray slacks and wearing dark-framed glasses – frequently looked around the courtroom and into gallery, mostly at victims’ families. He seemed to pay close attention.
The slaughter commenced at 2:25 p.m., and for 10 victims “their time on earth is about to come to an end,” the prosecutor told the jury.
“Each one of them, each one of the 10, had lives and families and loved ones and careers and dreams. They had gone there thinking about what they were going to make for dinner, who they were going to have dinner with, a loved one they would never see again.”
Dougherty then recalled the horrifying final moments of the 10 people who died that day, starting with Neven Stanisic, 23, who had fixed the espresso machine at the Starbucks and was on the phone with a co-worker in the minutes before he was killed in the parking lot. Kevin Mahoney, 61, described as a “loving husband, father and grandfather” and a Soopers regular, also was gunned down outside the grocery store. The prosecutor said his body was nearly run over by a woman he had just exchanged a smile with when she sped out of the parking lot in fear moments later.
The victims included Teri Leiker, 51, a longtime Sooper employee and fixture in the community who was fatally shot while bagging groceries with a smile on her face, according to Dougherty. And Jody Waters, 65, who lived the final seconds of her life hiding under a checkout counter. The shooter killed the first eight victims in 68 seconds.
At one point, the defendant spared the life of a 90-year-old man who the prosecutor said showed “no fear” or panic as he came face to face with the gunman.
“What does this tell you? This will tell you that the defendant was intentionally targeting people who were in fear and who were running, who he had power over, who he was scaring and who he could chase and kill,” Dougherty said.
He reminded jurors what they will need to decide, noting the shooter hunted down and executed his victims over and over and “finished them off.”

“Was the defendant so diseased or defective in mind that he was incapable of distinguishing right from wrong with respect to the murder of 10 individuals and the attempt to murder 25 more or suffering from a condition of mind caused by mental disease or defect, as the statute reads, that prevented him from forming a culpable mental state?” the prosecutor said.
“And in this case, it’s going to be intent. That’s what this case is going to come down to… The central issue is going to be his claim of not guilty by reason of insanity. Mental illness does not mean someone’s insane. Mental illness does not mean someone is insane when someone kills someone, or two people, or three people, or 10 people.”
In the end, realizing he was surrounded and outgunned, the defendant tried to ambush nearly a dozen officers moving in on him in the rear of the supermarket. He fatally wounded an officer before Alissa himself was wounded in the leg, the prosecutor said.
“At this moment, he’s done his ability to instill fear in others, that’s over. And the killing is over,” Dougherty said.
The defendant hears police announce: “The store is surrounded. Surrender now.”
“When you ask yourself in deliberations, did the defendant know the difference between wrong and right, you’ll ask yourself this question, ‘What did he do when they demanded that he surrender?’” Dougherty said, noting the shooter immediately put down his gun and ammo and removed all his clothes except for his underwear.
“I surrender. I give up,” the prosecutor said witnesses reported hearing the defendant yell.
“That’s how you’re going to answer the question of, ‘Did you know the difference between wrong and right?’ He stripped down to his underwear because he knew that if he presented any armed threat to law enforcement, they would likely shoot him again and kill him. And he wanted to live.”
But Dunn stressed that Alissa is far along the schizophrenic spectrum and being treated with Clozaril, which he called “the anti-psychotic of often last resort.”
Under Colorado law, Dunn told jurors, “You can understand what you’re doing is illegal, and you can be insane.”
For someone like Alissa suffering from delusional, paranoid thinking, the public defender added, “Your reality is not the reality of the world, it’s the reality of the illness in your mind.”
Alissa’s “disorganized thinking led to nonsensical, illogical behaviors,” Dunn told the jury.
The defendant’s family emigrated from Syria when Alissa was very young. His disorder went untreated because in Syrian culture mental illness is sometimes confused with demonic possession, Dunn said. That’s what Alissa’s father thought was ailing his son.
A district court judge in 2021 initially ruled Alissa incompetent to stand trial after he was evaluated by a defense expert, two doctors from a state hospital and a doctor selected by the prosecutors, according to court documents filed by the Boulder County District Attorney’s Office. Doctors determined Alissa’s condition got worse while at the Boulder County Jail. He was later sent to the state hospital for treatment.
Last October, however, the judge found him competent, noting that although Alissa was diagnosed with schizophrenia, evaluations did not show he suffered delusions that would interfere with his ability to stand trial.
Colorado District Court Chief Judge Ingrid Bakke at the time “strongly urged” the Colorado Mental Health Institute in Pueblo to retain him due to the “gravity of this case.” The state hospital granted the request. Alissa had been in the hospital for more than a year before his condition began to improve when he resumed taking his antipsychotic medication, according to Bakke’s order.
On July 30, Bakke granted a defense motion asking that Alissa be returned to the Boulder County jail. His lawyers argued that keeping him in Pueblo would deprive “his ability to understand the nature and object of these proceedings.”
Noting Alissa’s right to “consult with counsel” and “meaningfully participate” in his defense, his attorneys wrote: “The magnitude of this case is plain and obvious.”
Families of the victims have grown frustrated with delays in the case, a prosecutor told the court last summer. And more than three years after the bloodshed, a clear motive continues to elude authorities.
The afternoon of the shooting, Boulder police 911 received multiple calls, according to a court affidavit. One caller told dispatchers the shooter shot out the window of a car and chased a man toward the street. Others said the shooter wore “an armored vest.”
Multiple callers said they were hiding in the grocery store. Employees told dispatchers they “observed the suspect shoot an elderly man in the parking lot. The suspect then walked up to the elderly man, stood over him and shot him multiple additional times,” the affidavit said.

Among the people killed was 51-year-old Boulder police Officer Eric Talley, who was one of the first to respond, former Boulder Police Chief Maris Herold said at the time. Witnesses told dispatchers the shooter fired at police, the affidavit said. Officers had exchanged gunfire with Alissa at the store, according to Herold.
The other victims included store manager Rikki Olds, 25; store employee Denny Stong, 20; Tralona “Lonna” Bartkowiak, 49; Suzanne Fountain, 59;  and Lynn Murray, 62.
Witnesses described the confusion and fight for survival in the grocery aisles. Some shoppers fled through rear doors to the employee area, where workers helped them navigate the unfamiliar space to safety. Others hid in storerooms. One man waiting for a Covid vaccine grabbed his two young daughters and hid in a coat closet. A pharmacy technician took cover under a desk and called her family to say she loved them.
Alissa, by the time he was arrested less than hour after the first 911 calls, had “removed all his clothing and was dressed only in shorts,” according to the affidavit. He sustained a gunshot wound to his upper right thigh.
Alissa’s family emigrated from Syria, his 34-year-old brother, Ali Aliwi Alissa, told CNN at the time. The brother said Alissa was paranoid and often believed he was being followed. The suspect lived most of his life in the United States."
J9EZP08G09_6RG59EMO8PVI948,At least 129 killed during mass prison break attempt in DR Congo,"By Niamh Kennedy and Nimi Princewill, CNN","3 minute read Updated 2:52 PM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240903,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/03/africa/dr-congo-prison-break-intl/,"More than 120 people have been killed in an attempted mass breakout from the largest prison in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the latest in a series of violent attacks on jails in the central African nation.
Prisoners tried to break out en masse from the Makala Central Prison in the capital, Kinshasa, at around 2 a.m. local time (9 p.m. ET) on Monday, Interior Minister Jacquemain Shabani Lukoo Bihango told reporters.
“The provisional human toll stands at 129 dead including 24 by gunshot after warning. The others died by jostling, suffocation and some women were raped,” Bihango said. He added that 59 people were receiving medical care.
One Kinshasa resident, Daddi Soso, told Agence France-Presse that gunfire rang out for several hours during the incident and that he later saw security vehicles removing bodies from the scene.
A series of graphic videos circulating on social media - not verified by CNN - showed dozens of bloodied corpses on the ground.

Extensive damage to several prison buildings was also seen in interior ministry video. A large hole is shown in one exterior wall, where bricks appear to have been removed, while the walls of other buildings are black and burnt out.
Video filmed inside the prison showed several ransacked rooms with debris, burnt office furniture and papers strewn across the floor.
Several prison buildings including offices, the registry, the infirmary and food depots were destroyed by fires during the attempted prison break, the minister told the press conference.
Interior minister Bihango convened a crisis meeting of the country’s defense and security services on Tuesday after receiving instructions from the country’s “senior hierarchy.”
The government is relieved “by the restored calm,” he said, adding that investigations into the incident are ongoing.
More than 12,000 inmates, mostly pretrial detainees, were held in the Makala prison before the attempted jailbreak even though the facility could only contain 1,500 people, according to a recent report by Amnesty International which highlighted the “appalling” detention conditions at the facility.
In a statement on social media Monday, Justice Minister Constant Mutamba condemned the prison break attempt as a “pre-meditated act of sabotage.”
Mutamba barred public prosecutors from transferring any inmates to Makala prison “until further notice” as part of a series of measures he announced to tackle overcrowding at the country’s prisons.
In a statement on X, the European Union called for “an independent and rapid investigation to shed light on these tragic events and establish responsibilities.”
Prison breaks are common in the DRC, with several attacks being launched on correctional facilities in recent years.
More than 50 inmates, including the leader of a religious sect, broke free from the Makala prison in 2017 following an invasion by the group.
And in 2020, a rebel group linked to ISIS claimed responsibility for a jailbreak that freed nearly 1,000 inmates from a prison in Beni, in northeastern DRC. At least 11 people, including security personnel, were killed in that attack.
Another prison break was recorded the following year at Matadi, one of the country’s oldest prisons, which saw the escape of 189 prisoners. More than 200 other detainees escaped from the same prison in 2022 after seizing weapons from the facility’s armory.

JI0OK5VNVR_LY3QHO96KVWXB08,Costco’s first membership price hike in 7 years just went into effect,"By Jordan Valinsky, CNN","2 minute read Published 11:15 AM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240903,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/03/business/costco-membership-fee-price-increase/,"Costco customers are now paying more for their annual memberships for the first time since 2017.
The retailer announced in July that membership fees would increase by $5 to $65 a year in the US and Canada for three of its plans: “Gold Star,” “Business” and “Business Add-On.” The changes started for new members signing up on or after September 1 and renewals occurring after that date.
The price of Costco’s premium “Executive Membership” also went up, by $10 to $130 a year. However, those members will soon be able to earn a maximum of $1,250 in rewards annually versus $1,000 currently.
The company estimated that 52 million memberships will be impacted, a little over half of which are Executive members, Costco previously said.
Annual fees have been one of the biggest profit-generating areas for Costco, helping it offset expenses to keep its prices down. Last year, Costco earned $4.6 billion in revenue from membership fees, an 8% increase from 2022.
The fee hikes come as Costco, like streaming companies, has been taking more measures to ensure fewer non-subscribers are hitching a ride on other customers’ memberships.
Costco (COST) is cracking down on membership moochers by implementing stricter policies and requiring shoppers to scan their membership cards to enter stores.

“Over the coming months, membership scanning devices will be used at the entrance door of your local warehouse,” Costco said in a previous statement. “Once deployed, prior to entering, all members must scan their physical or digital membership card by placing the barcode or QR Code against the scanner.”
For members with cards that don’t have a photo, Costco says to come prepared with a valid photo ID but encourages shoppers to visit the membership counter and have their photo taken.
Costco’s new rule also requires all guests to be accompanied by a valid cardholder to enter its stores, making it more difficult for non-members to sneak in using cards that don’t belong to them.

JKSWHUCYUI_I1PJ3XT1UMQ89OW,2024 race hits critical stretch as debate approaches and first ballots are set to go out,"By Eric Bradner, CNN","9 minute read Updated 9:51 AM EDT, Sun September 1, 2024",20240901,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/01/politics/2024-debate-ballots-harris-trump/,"The 2024 presidential race is entering a critical stretch, with Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump set to debate and the first swing state ballots hitting mailboxes shortly after the Labor Day holiday weekend.
As the calendar turns to September, both campaigns are focusing on on key battleground states — with Harris eyeing an expanded map and Trump digging in across the Upper Midwestern states that delivered him the presidency in 2016 and ousted him from office in 2020.
Meanwhile, voting will begin this week. The first ballots of the 2024 election will go out Friday in North Carolina, one of a handful of potentially critical Sun Belt states. Then, two weeks later, early in-person voting starts in Minnesota, South Dakota and Virginia.
Harris last week focused on the Sun Belt, with a bus tour in Georgia and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, also visiting North Carolina.
“I think we know: Very difficult for a Republican presidential candidate to win the White House if they can’t win North Carolina,” Walz said Thursday during a stop at a campaign field office in Raleigh.
Harris’ campaign is pouring money into advertising in the Savannah media market as it seeks to broaden its appeal outside Atlanta. According to AdImpact data, Harris’ campaign has spent a total of about $1.7 million in advertising there over the last three weeks.
Harris’ top campaign adviser said in a memo Sunday the vice president remains the “clear underdog” in the race, setting expectations and looking to guard against complacency as the fall campaign season begins.
Jen O’Malley Dillon, the Harris campaign chair, wrote that Trump retains a “motivated base of support,” and predicted a close contest.
Pointing to the September 10 debate and an increased pace of travel, O’Malley Dillon said the weeks ahead will be critical in defining the Democratic ticket.
Trump, meanwhile, has turned his attention to the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, holding events in all three states late in the week and promising an economic revival.
“I’m here today with a simple message for the American autoworker and for the American worker: Your long economic nightmare will very soon be over,” the former president said at the start of his remarks at a steel distribution company in Potterville, Michigan.
The candidates are interspersing their campaigning with preparation for their September 10 debate, hosted by ABC. That debate — the first between Harris and Trump, and the only one both campaigns have agreed to so far — could prove the most pivotal moment in the 2024 race.
Trump has enlisted the help of former Hawaii Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, whose failed 2020 presidential bid featured several notable clashes on debate stages with Harris over foreign policy and Harris’ record on criminal justice. Harris, meanwhile, is working closely with Philippe Reines, a longtime aide to Hillary Clinton, who is reprising his role playing Trump at the request of the Harris campaign.
Polls show a tight race nationwide and in critical swing states. A Wall Street Journal survey released Thursday found no clear leader, with Harris at 48% to Trump’s 47% among registered voters. A Quinnipiac University poll out the same day similarly found Harris at 49% and Trump at 47% among likely voters.
Sun Belt states that once appeared to have slipped out of Democratic reach have reemerged on the battleground map since Harris became the party’s nominee. Fox News polls released Wednesday found no clear leader among registered voters in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and South Carolina. The polls found Harris at 50% to Trump’s 49% in Arizona; those numbers flipped, with Trump at 50% and Harris at 49%, in North Carolina. In both Georgia and Nevada, Harris was at 50% to Trump’s 48%.
More than a month after the Democratic change at the top of the ticket, with President Joe Biden dropping his reelection bid and Harris stepping in, Democrats believe they still have momentum.
Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz said in an interview that the race has shifted from one where Democrats were on track to lose and in need of a fundamental shake-up, to one where Republicans are “hoping that there’s some catastrophic moment” in which Harris blows it.
“They’re clearly taken aback by a change in the candidate. But it’s the candidacy that I think is throwing them off. They’ve never run with against someone with such an orientation towards the future,” Schatz said.
“It was always about how you felt about Donald Trump – you were either for Donald Trump or not for Donald Trump or ambivalent. And I think what’s happening is after more than eight years a lot of people would just like not to talk about that man anymore,” he said. “Lots of politicians have attempted to be the leader that could help us to turn the page as a nation and Kamala Harris is evidently the only one that is capable of doing that.”
Republicans, meanwhile, are arguing that Harris’ economic proposals, and her promises of a new era in American politics, are hollow, since she has been vice president for three and a half years and bears at least partial ownership of Biden’s record.
“If she wants to tackle the affordability crisis or close down the southern border, she should be doing it now,” Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance said Friday on “CNN News Central.” “And I think it takes a lot of shame — shamelessness, I should say — to be able to stare at the American people’s eyes and say, I’m going to fix your problems now, when I’ve already been in power for three and a half years.”
Polls have shown Trump with an advantage among men who are likely to vote, but Harris with a huge edge with women. That split is common in presidential elections, but Trump is attempting to chip away at Harris’ advantage with women in part through a focus on reproductive rights.
It’s a topic that has been a huge Democratic advantage since the Supreme Court, with a conservative majority that includes three members appointed by Trump, in 2022 overturned Roe v. Wade’s nationwide abortion rights protections — opening the door to a new patchwork of state-level restrictions.
Trump last week infuriated conservatives with his answer to a question about how he plans to vote on a referendum that will decide the future of abortion access in his home state of Florida.
Under current Florida law, abortion is illegal in most cases after six weeks. Voters this fall will decide on a ballot measure that would make abortion legal in the state up to the point of viability, which many experts believe is around 23 or 24 weeks of a pregnancy.
Trump had repeatedly declined to weigh in on the referendum, but on Thursday, he told NBC that Florida’s six-week ban was “too short” and said he would be “voting that we need more than six weeks.”
A day later, he said he was going to vote “no” on the referendum and, in explaining why he was doing so, repeated a false claim that Democratic states are passing laws that allow people to execute babies after birth.
Also on Thursday, while campaigning in Michigan and Wisconsin, he offered a new proposal aimed at women, pledging universal coverage of in vitro fertilization.
“Under the Trump administration, your government will pay for – or your insurance company will be mandated to pay for – all costs associated with IVF treatment,” Trump said during a campaign event in Michigan. “Because we want more babies, to put it nicely.”
However, senators in his own party, including his running mate, Vance, defeated a bill with a similar provision earlier this summer.
On a Harris campaign call with reporters on Friday, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren said Trump’s promise to have fertility treatments paid for is “just smoke and mirrors” without a commitment to protect the treatments from legal threats.
She pointed to the Alabama Supreme Court ruling earlier this year that deemed that frozen embryos are children, jeopardizing the legality of IVF treatments before Alabama’s Republican governor signed a law protecting IVF access in the state after Trump said he supports the treatment.
She also cited a Senate bill to codify access to IVF nationwide that was blocked by Republicans in June and a House GOP bill that seeks to legally define life as beginning at the moment of conception or fertilization to draw the contrast on protections for reproductive health care.
“Making vague promises about insurance coverage does not stop a single extremist judge or state legislature from banning IVF. Making vague promises about insurance coverage does not stop a single one of the 131 Republicans in Congress from advancing their fetal personhood bill that would ban IVF. Despite what Trump seems to think, American women are smart and we aren’t falling for his gaslighting,” Warren said.
Harris’ campaign on Friday also countered Trump by announcing a new bus tour aimed at advocating for women’s reproductive rights. The “Fighting for Reproductive Freedom” bus tour will kick off Tuesday in Palm Beach, Florida – Trump’s hometown – with Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Harris-Walz campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez, CNN senior political commentator Ana Navarro and reproductive rights storyteller Anya Cook.
It wasn’t just Trump’s pledge of universal coverage of IVF that lacked details.
Both Harris and Trump have discussed policy through the lens of details and aspirations, rather than addressing the difficult questions about the exact contours of their proposals, how they’d win approval on Capitol Hill and how they’d be funded — all of which would confront them in the Oval Office.
Harris has said she would aim to help the middle class by targeting price-gouging, making housing more affordable through $25,000 in down-payment support for first-time homebuyers, offering a child tax credit, lowering drug prices and creating new jobs.
Trump, meanwhile, has pledged the largest deportation effort in US history, and has said it would involve the National Guard and perhaps the military. But he has not addressed how he would solve the constitutional, logistical and manpower issues that such an undertaking would involve.
He has also ducked specific questions about abortion rights, claiming he could bring about a national consensus policy on an issue that has been a wedge in American politics for more than 50 years.
In fact, the most detailed policy blueprint in the 2024 race — “Project 2025,” a 920-page document organized by The Heritage Foundation think tank and developed in significant part by people who served in Trump’s administration — is one Harris’ campaign has used to attack Trump, while the former president distanced himself from it.
The missing details could be fleshed out when Harris and Trump meet for their first debate on September 10. Another key moment will come on October 1, when CBS hosts the vice presidential debate between Harris’ running mate, Walz, and Trump’s No. 2, Vance.

JMADA6N8SQ_MB8G5E09744NA8X,Start of early voting in North Carolina could be delayed after ruling in RFK Jr. ballot challenge,"By Ethan Cohen, CNN","2 minute read Updated 6:13 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/05/politics/early-voting-north-carolina-kennedy/,"The first ballots in the nation are scheduled to start going out Friday in North Carolina, but that could be delayed after a judge ordered a temporary pause on ballot distribution.
The ruling came in response to a request from former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to remove his name from the ballot.
North Carolina’s Democratic-controlled State Board of Elections voted along party lines last week to reject Kennedy’s request, saying that it wouldn’t be practical to reprint ballots and delay the start of voting.
Kennedy, who dropped out of the race last month and endorsed former President Donald Trump, then challenged that decision in court.
Wake County Superior Court Judge Rebecca Holt denied the former candidate’s request Thursday but also ordered a pause to allow Kennedy to appeal.
In her written order, the judge ordered the state not to proceed with mailing absentee ballots before noon Friday.
Holt found that rejecting Kennedy’s request would lead to “minimal” harm to him but that removing his name would be a significant burden for elections officials.
“The court can find no practical, personal or pecuniary harm to the plaintiff should his name remain on the ballot,” Holt said from the bench “The defendant, however, would have to reprint the ballots at considerable cost and effort and will likely find themselves in violation of the state mandated deadline for distributing absentee ballots.”
After the hearing, Paul Cox, the general counsel for the state elections board, instructed counties to not send ballots out Friday morning.
However, Cox said ballots would need to be go out Friday afternoon, unless an appeals court ordered a further delay.
As CNN previously reported, since endorsing Trump, Kennedy has sought to withdraw his name from the ballot in competitive states in order to boost the former president’s chances of winning there. But he has encountered obstacles to those attempts beyond North Carolina.
On Tuesday, a Michigan judge ruled that he must remain on the ballot in the battleground state after Kennedy filed a lawsuit asking the court to remove him. The elections commission in Wisconsin – another Midwestern battleground also ruled last week that Kennedy will appear on the ballot despite a similar request to withdraw.

As kids head back to school, many schools aren’t allowing them to bring their phones to class. Legislation to ban phones in schools has been proposed or passed in many cities and states. Most schools already have policies prohibiting them for nonacademic use, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.
Parents often question these policies because they want to be able to reach their kids in an emergency such as a school shooting.
Yet research suggests it’s not just a good idea for kids to put their phones away while in class — they shouldn’t bring them to school at all.
Related article More than a third of teens say they spend too much time on their phones, new study finds
Some 97% of 11- to 17-year-olds use their phones during school time, for an average of 43 minutes, according to a 2023 Common Sense Media study. If they’re checking their phones between classes or at lunch and recess, they’re likely preoccupied with what they’re seeing on their screens and therefore spending less time talking, playing or even just hanging out with their friends.
Such preoccupation is not healthy because, as social psychologist Jonathan Haidt wrote in “The Anxious Generation: How the Great Rewiring of Childhood is Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness,” one of the most important things young people should be doing is playing with peers.
In doing so, they learn to navigate social dynamics and build skills by figuring out how to do different activities. It teaches them they can handle other challenges they’ll face in the future, which Haidt said can help protect them from anxiety.
But phones aren’t just intruding on kids’ time outside class. In a June Pew Research Center survey, 72% of public high school teachers said cell phone distractions are a major problem in their classrooms. If children are sneaking peeks at their phones, they can’t possibly be paying attention to what they’re supposed to be learning. A wide body of evidence tells us the human brain can’t multitask — we can only do one thing at a time.
One indicator that students aren’t learning as much at school as they did in the pre-phone era is scores on the ACT — a standardized test that measures whether they have the English, reading, math and science skills needed for first-year college courses. Last year, ACT scores dropped to the lowest level in more than 30 years, according to the organization that administers the test.
As a professor who has taught at five universities since 2010, I’ve witnessed this trend myself. When I first started teaching, before smartphones became ubiquitous, many of my students arrived better able to concentrate and work through long reading passages than they are now.

Of course, it’s easy to imagine how kids will respond if we ask them to leave their phones home: They’ll promise not to check them during the school day. Unfortunately, it’s unreasonable to expect them to fight the urge to look at products that are designed to be addictive, with features such as bottomless scrolling and continuous notifications. The average teen gets 237 phone notifications a day on their phones, according to the Common Sense Media study — with a quarter coming in during the school day.
Sending kids to school sans smartphones forces them to concentrate on what’s happening in front of them rather than on their screens. That’s another important skill to learn.
“The phone-based life makes it difficult for people to be fully present with others when they are with others, and to sit silently with themselves when they are alone,” Haidt warned.
What’s more, the idea that having a phone with them makes kids safer is often a myth.
Phones can be dangerously distracting to teens. At one of my recent talks at a private school, the school psychologist told parents she regularly sees their children walk out of school looking at their screens while crossing the streets of Manhattan. So, phones may cause emergencies in the first place.
Of course, if children have a crisis on the way home from school, in most places in the United States, there will be businesses and people around with phones who will be willing to let them call their parents.
Similarly, while many parents wish they could reach their children in the unthinkable event of a school shooting, kids will be safer if they remain quiet and focused on the instructions they receive from school administrators or law enforcement.

In addition, children often have extraordinarily dangerous experiences on their phones. In August, a report by Thorn, a nonprofit that combats child sex abuse, revealed that the great majority — 59% — of youth said they’ve had online experiences that have been potentially harmful. One in 3 minors and 1 in 5 preteens said they’d had online sexual experiences with someone they thought was an adult, according to the report.
It’s true that letting kids bring phones to school can make coordinating things like pickups after extracurricular activities easier. If children truly need a phone to communicate with their parents — perhaps because they have a medical condition and need to be able to reach someone in an emergency or because their pickup arrangements are so complicated that a time and location can’t be set in advance — one option Haidt recommended is an old-fashioned flip phone. Having one lets them text or call but not log on to social media apps.
Related article Parents are not OK right now. Here’s what they can do
Sending kids to school with smartphones is unlikely to make them smarter or safer. It’s more likely to distract them and make them unable to focus on learning.
Without a phone, kids can focus on interacting with peers, learning and being fully present in their surroundings — rather than having these things compete for their attention with influencers and internet memes.

The couple were caught having sex on August 22 while in the grounds of a shrine in Kesennuma –- a small coastal town about 500 kilometers (310 miles) north of Tokyo –- and faced charges of disrespecting a place of worship.
Police told CNN that they arrested the man, fearing he could be a flight risk, but did not arrest the woman after concluding there was no risk of her fleeing.

The man has since been released from custody, but the police said they could not disclose details of his punishment and did not clarify whether he was a tourist or a resident. These cases don’t always end in forced repatriation, the police added, and can result in a fine.
Although such a case is rare, there have been other instances of people being arrested for disrespecting Japanese shrines.
Last year, a 17-year-old Canadian was brought in for questioning for allegedly scratching the name “Julian” with his nail into a wooden pillar at a UNESCO-listed temple in the historic city of Nara, local police told CNN at the time.
“The boy admitted his act and says it was done not with the intent of harming Japanese culture,” a police official said.  “He is now with his parents, who were with him when the incident occurred.”
Meanwhile in 2010, famed photographer Kishin Shinoyama was charged with public indecency and disrespect for a religious site when he allegedly took nude photos at a public cemetery.

JYDDN3V73K_0B7DME22M99HBUX,Student leaders reveal prison ‘nightmare’ after Gen Z revolution sets them free,"By Rebecca Wright, Anna Coren, Salman Saeed and Mark Phillips, CNN","7 minute read Updated 11:54 PM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/03/asia/bangladesh-house-mirrors-detention-center-intl-hnk-dst/,"The banging on the door started just after sunrise, when law student Iftekhar Alam was still sleeping in his fifth-floor apartment.
Around half a dozen armed police officers pushed inside, shouting obscenities and telling him he had wronged the nation of Bangladesh.
“Where is your phone? Where is your laptop?” the officers shouted as they pointed their guns at him and searched his apartment, Alam said. “They were like crazy, really crazy.”
“They put me in the black glass car, and right away, they handcuffed me. They blindfolded me,” he said.
Alam believes he was taken to Aynaghor, known in Bangladesh as the “House of Mirrors” – a notorious detention center at the headquarters of the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI) in the capital Dhaka.
Human rights groups say hundreds of people were tortured there during the 15-year rule of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who resigned in August after weeks of protest.
After Hasina fled the country by helicopter, some of the political prisoners detained in Bangladesh’s shadowy prison system have been freed and have started to reveal what took place there.
Alam, 23, had been part of anti-government protests since they began in early July, and was close friends with one of the main protest leaders.
The protests started as student-led demonstrations against government job quotas, then later exploded into a nationwide movement to expel Hasina after she ordered a deadly crackdown, killing hundreds of people in Bangladesh’s worst political violence in decades.
During the interrogations, Alam said he was pressured to reveal the locations of the protest leaders. His captors threatened to “vanish” and kill him if he didn’t.
In detention, he says security personnel tortured him for hours – they beat him all over his body with metal pipes until they broke bones in his foot, then forced him to walk around in circles over and over, making him vomit from the pain.
They also extinguished cigarettes on his hands and feet, screaming at him that he would be punished further if he cried out in pain – calling it a “game,” he said.
Alam said his interrogators told him that the next phase was electric shocks and waterboarding – and gave him a “sample” of the electric shock on the back of his neck as a warning.
“There is no escaping from this, and my life will end here, and no one will know,” he said, reflecting on his mindset during those hours.
Rights groups say he’s far from the only victim.
During Hasina’s rule, detainees were subjected to torture at a network of other secret centres across the country, run by the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) and the Detective Branch of the police, according to Odhikar, a Bangladeshi human rights organization.
The RAB – a joint taskforce composed of the police, military and border guards – was sanctioned by the United States in 2021 for its alleged involvement in “serious human rights abuse.”
Odhikar estimates that 709 people were forcibly disappeared under Hasina’s rule. Some were later released, sentenced or found dead – 155 are still missing.
“Bangladeshi law enforcement agencies and security forces systematically committed enforced disappearances” mostly targeting “academics, journalists, dissenting voices, and political activists” which created a “climate of fear in the country,” Okhikar said in a statement on August 29.
International rights groups like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have also published multiple reports documenting disappearances and torture by police and other security forces during Hasina’s rule.
CNN can’t independently verify the testimonies of torture and has reached out to the new interim government in Bangladesh for comment on the allegations of abuses at Aynaghor and the number of people still missing.
Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Mohammed Yunus – who is leading the new interim government – has announced the creation of a commission to investigate the “disappeared” people, and has invited a UN fact-finding team to Bangladesh to independently probe alleged atrocities committed during the recent protests.
“The issue of enforced disappearances has a long and painful history in Bangladesh,” said Ravina Shamdasani, spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.
“The UN Human Rights Office looks forward to supporting the Interim Government and people of Bangladesh at this pivotal moment to revitalise democracy, seek accountability and reconciliation, and advance human rights for all the people in Bangladesh.”
Hours after Hasina fled and her government collapsed – and within 24 hours of his capture – Alam said he was released.
His captors dropped him on a quiet road before dawn, threatening to shoot him if he opened his eyes as they drove away.
Nearly one month after his release, Alam has had the plaster cast on his foot removed, and he is now moving around on crutches.
But he says the mental scars will take much longer to heal.
“It was like (a) nightmare,” he said.
Nusrat Tabassum – one of the most senior women coordinating the protest – was also pursued by the authorities.
“(It was a) very traumatic time for me,” Tabassum said. “They broke three doors. They took me with them, and oh my god, the physical torture, that was miserable.”
Tabassum says she was badly beaten during five days in detention from July 28 to August 1. She re-joined the protests the day after her release.
The 23-year-old political science student attends the prestigious Dhaka University, which became a central gathering point for the protests in July and early August.
On the university’s manicured campus sits Curzon Hall, a British colonial-era building surrounded by palm trees that offers an oasis away from the chaotic streets of the capital.
As Tabassum walks through the building’s historic arches, it’s clear that her bravery has turned her into a poster child for the movement.
Fellow female students occasionally stop her to take selfies and ask about her time in detention.
“Our reunion will be at Aynaghor,” one shouts at her as she walks past – a sign of how many of the students spent time at detention centers. “Aynaghor” or “House of Mirrors” has morphed into a catch-all term for the various places political prisoners were held.
Tabassum says she was beaten for more than four hours, covering her in bruises, filling her mouth with cuts, and bursting her ear drum.
“Without (a) hearing aid, I can’t listen in my right ear,” Tabassum said. “Two teeth (became) loose because of the beating.”
During her detention, she was forced to make a joint confession with five other student leaders which was broadcast on television.
“They forced us to make a video statement that we stopped our protest, and there will be no more movement,” she said.
Making that video was “more traumatic” than the beatings, she said, because she feared the people of Bangladesh would feel betrayed.
“That was the most sad thing,” she said.
Tabassum said that when word spread that Hasina had resigned her post, ending her authoritarian grip on the country, protesters felt their sacrifice had been worth it.
“I cried a lot after I heard the news,” she said. “It was like I lived for that moment my whole life.”
As she continues her recovery, Tabassum says she’s struggling with memory loss, and has trouble recalling events that occurred even before the beating.
But she is determined to help shape the new country – or “Bangladesh 2.0”, as people here call it.
Protest art and murals now line the streets of Dhaka with striking pop art-style designs and slogans such as “long live resistance,” “let your dreams fly,” and “this is new Bangladesh, made by Gen Z.”
The streets are alive with renewed optimism and civic pride – with micro-protests popping up across Bangladeshi cities, as interest groups try to make their voices heard during the reform process.
In late August, CNN witnessed half a dozen small peaceful protests in the capital Dhaka and south-eastern city of Cox’s Bazar – on niche issues such as doctors trying to prevent paramedics from gaining medical licenses, and rickshaw drivers campaigning against electric rickshaws.
Previously, many people were too afraid to protest on the streets for fear of arrest or being “disappeared” under the time of Hasina.
But now even families are on the street, campaigning for the release of victims caught in Bangladesh’s shadowy detention system.
There’s cautious optimism that the country will change under new leadership, but some remain wary, as instability pervades every sector of society.
Yunus, the interim leader, has asked the public for patience as his team tries to address “mountain-like challenges” after “15 years of fascist rule.”
The students who brought him to power believe that he will uphold the country’s best interests.
Yunus has “guardian vibes,” Tabassum said.
“He cares about us, he cares about my country,” she said. “We like to keep our trust in him.”
But she acknowledges that “post revolution reformation is very hard.”
“My country is sick,” she said. “But our people, we (will) stand together.”"
JZLG1H9E02_0W0K1BVL85QXA4W,US prosecutors charge Russian-American political pundit of violating sanctions,"By Hannah Rabinowitz and Holmes Lybrand, CNN","3 minute read Updated 3:21 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/05/politics/dimitri-simes-criminal-charges-russia/,"The Justice Department unsealed criminal charges against Russian-American political pundit Dimitri Simes on Thursday, alleging he was paid more than $1 million from a Russian news outlet in violation of US sanctions.
According to the indictment, Simes coordinated and communicated with the Russian government, including President Vladimir Putin, while hosting a show for RT, the Russian state media network.
Simes would work with the Russian government over what the show would cover and how, the indictment says, highlighting coverage over the war with Ukraine that was favorable to Russia.
Simes was a prominent part of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into election interference in the 2016 presidential election.
Mueller’s team found that Simes had contacts with several members of Trump’s campaign, including Jared Kushner, over the campaign’s positions on Russia.
The special counsel did not uncover any evidence that Simes passed any information from Russia to the Trump campaign and, when Simes brought up Russian contacts to Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law told him it would be “bad optics for the Campaign to develop hidden Russian contacts,” according to the report.
Simes is charged alongside his wife, Anastasia Simes. The two are facing three charges for money laundering and violating both the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the Emergency Economic Powers Act.
Simes left the United States in 2022 after obtaining Russian citizenship and has not returned, according to court documents. It was not immediately clear if Simes has an attorney.
The FBI searched Simes’ home last month. The bureau also searched the homes of other Americans who have worked with Russia’s state television networks.
The charges come just one day after the Biden administration launched a broad campaign to combat Russian efforts to interfere with the upcoming presidential election in the United States.
That multipronged strategy included charges against two employees of RT accused of participating in a scheme that funneled nearly $10 million to set up and direct a Tennessee-based front company to produce online content aimed at sowing divisions among Americans.
The indictment against Simes, which did not mention the upcoming US election, details his salary and other perks he received while hosting a show for the sanctioned RT media outlet.
“Simes received funds and services from Channel One Russia after it was sanctioned,” the indictment says, “including monthly salary payments totaling over $1 million; a personal car and driver; a stipend for an apartment in Moscow, Russia; health insurance; business-class plane tickets between Washington, D.C., and Moscow, Russia; a team of ten employees, including an assistant; and efforts by Channel One Russia to promote his ‘positive image’ in mass media.”
For his work, according to court documents, in late 2023 the Russian government honored Simes with an award for his show.

The Venezuela Prosecutor’s Office requested the warrant Monday, accusing Gonzalez of “crimes associated with terrorism.” Gonzalez has failed to respond to three summons regarding its investigation into an opposition website that posted results from the contested vote, it said.
Maduro claims to have won the July 28 vote, but the official results have attracted widespread skepticism from abroad and the opposition has insisted that it won. Shortly after the vote, the opposition published tally sheets on a website indicating their candidate – Gonzalez – had won by a landslide.
CNN has not independently confirmed the data published by the opposition, but experts consulted by CNNE say the data appears to show an opposition win.
In a letter posted on X on Monday, the Prosecutor’s Office said Gonzalez is suspected of “crimes associated with terrorism” including “usurpation of functions, forging a public document, instigation to disobedience of the laws (and) association to commit a crime and conspiracy.”

Gonzalez has denied the accusations against him. The Prosecutor’s Office has previously said it is also investigating opposition leader Maria Corina Machado for the same alleged crimes.
Machado said Monday that the threat of arrest would only help to unite the opposition.
“(The government) have lost all notion of reality. By threatening the president-elect they only manage to unite us more and increase the support of Venezuelans and the world for Edmundo González.”
“Serenity, courage and firmness. We move forward,” she added.

K3LGRF9UT8_QN43WWAZU12P1GJ,Man accused of plotting wife’s rape by at least 50 strangers over almost 10 years in French trial,"By Camille Knight, Emmanuel Miculita and Caroline Baum, CNN","4 minute read Updated 4:02 PM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240903,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/03/europe/france-rape-trial-intl-latam/,"A man is on trial accused of repeatedly drugging and raping his wife, as well as encouraging dozens of other men to rape her in their home while she was unconscious, court documents show.
The alleged victim, Gisèle, 72, appeared in a courtroom in Avignon, France, on Monday for the opening of the trial, sunglasses on, her daughter and two sons by her side.
For the next four months, she will come face to face with her accused abusers, most of whom are complete strangers to her.
Prosecutors say the defendant, Dominique, 71, would recruit men online to rape his wife, after drugging her with sleeping pills and anti-anxiety medication. CNN is not using the full names of the man and wife to protect the identities of other family members.
He faces nine charges including several counts of rape with aggravating circumstances, the drugging of a victim to commit rape, and the sharing of images related to those assaults.
Prosecutors were able to put together a case because Dominique documented a number of the alleged assaults on camera.
Held in pre-trial detention since 2020, courtroom sketches show the defendant entered the courtroom in a black t-shirt and sat facing his wife.
“He recognizes that he’s done what he has done,” his lawyer, Béatrice Zavarro told journalists in court on Monday. “There was not an ounce of contestation during the whole investigation.”
In the dock, the men accused of taking part in these rapes sat with their heads down.
Police have identified at least 92 sexual assaults committed by 72 men, with ages ranging from 26 to 74, court documents show.
Fifty were identified, and most have been charged with either aggravated or attempted rape and are standing trial alongside Gisèle’s husband.
The ordeal lasted almost ten years, the first alleged assaults dating back to 2011.
The crimes came to light in 2020 when Dominique was caught filming under women’s skirts in a shopping center.
After police seized his phone and computer, they say they found evidence of the rapes. An investigation was opened and the wife was made aware of the abuse she had endured for almost ten years.
Court documents show that Dominique has told investigators that the other men were all aware his wife had been drugged without her knowledge, something a number of the other defendants deny.
Christophe Huguenin-Virchaux, a lawyer for one of the men told CNN affiliate BFMTV on Tuesday that his client “admits that sexual relations did in fact take place” but that they took place as part of a “sexual game between a husband and his wife that he was invited to,” adding that he was “not aware that Gisèle was drugged or under medication.”
Throughout the trial, Gisèle will see and hear what was done to her.
On Tuesday, she sat through a reading of the horrific acts she was subjected to, as well as the arguments from each of the defendants’ lawyers.
“It was very difficult,” one of her lawyers, Stéphane Babonneau told CNN on Tuesday. “It was unbearable for her to hear people say they thought she was pretending to sleep and were convinced it was consensual,” he added.
Last Friday ahead of the trial, another one of her lawyers, Antoine Arebalo-Camus told reporters “she had no idea what had been inflicted on her, so she has no memory of the rapes she suffered for 10 years.”
Gisèle could have requested the trial be held privately, but Babonneau told CNN “she wanted it to be a public trial so that everyone can hear and get an idea of the excuses given by men in such circumstances.”
Gisèle’s daughter says her mother sought medical advice for the memory loss and extreme fatigue she was experiencing as a side effect of the drugs.
Speaking to French media in several interviews, she said that her mother “saw doctors, she saw neurologists,” and that the medical profession failed to detect the problem.
The daughter has now started an awareness campaign called “M’endors Pas,” meaning “Don’t put me to sleep” on drug-facilitated sexual assault.
The trial began on September 2 in the southern French town of Avignon, and a verdict is due on December 20 this year."
K4PXWHDQ14_GROVBN3EWFLL6C0,Exclusive: US seizes Venezuela President Nicolas Maduro’s airplane in the Dominican Republic,"By Priscilla Alvarez and Abel Alvarado, CNN","6 minute read Updated 12:34 AM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240902,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/02/politics/us-seizes-venezuela-president-maduros-airplane/,"The United States has seized Venezuela President Nicolas Maduro’s airplane after determining that its acquisition was in violation of US sanctions, among other criminal issues. The US flew the aircraft to Florida on Monday, according to two US officials.
It’s the latest development in what has long been a frosty relationship between the US and Venezuela, and its seizure in the Dominican Republic marks an escalation as the US continues to investigate what it regards as corrupt practices by Venezuela’s government.
“This sends a message all the way up to the top,” one of the US officials told CNN. “Seizing the foreign head of state’s plane is unheard-of for criminal matters. We’re sending a clear message here that no one is above the law, no one is above the reach of US sanctions.”
The plane has been described by officials as Venezuela’s equivalent to Air Force One and it  has been pictured in previous state visits by Maduro around the world.
The Dominican Republic’s President Luis Abinader said the plane seized by the US on Monday was not registered under the name of the Venezuelan government, but rather under “the name of an individual.”
Foreign Minister of the Dominican Republic Roberto Álvarez said the country’s Attorney General’s Office received an order last May from a national court to “immobilize” the plane. The US had requested it be immobilized so they could search it for “evidence and objects linked to fraud activities, smuggling of goods for illicit activities and money laundering,” he said.
In a statement, US Attorney General Merrick Garland said that “the Justice Department seized an aircraft we allege was illegally purchased for $13 million through a shell company and smuggled out of the United States for use by Nicolás Maduro and his cronies.”
The plane, a Dassault Falcon 900EX, was purchased from a company in Florida, the Justice Department said, and was illegally exported in April 2023 from the United States to Venezuela through the Caribbean. It was used for Maduro’s international travels, and flew “almost exclusively to and from a military base in Venezuela,” according to the Justice Department.
Records show that the plane’s last registered flight was in March, flying from Caracas to the Dominican capital of Santo Domingo.
A second plane linked to Maduro’s regime is under 24-hour surveillance by authorities in the Dominican Republic, a source with knowledge of the matter told CNN.
The source did not specify details about the plane’s model, make or whether the aircraft had been requested to be immobilized.
The Venezuelan government described the Falcon’s seizure as “piracy” in a statement on Monday, and accused Washington of escalating “aggression” toward Maduro’s government following a contested presidential election this July.
“Once again, the authorities of the USA, in a recurring criminal practice that could not be labeled anything but piracy, have illegally seized an aircraft that has been used by the president of the Republic, justifying its action in coercive measures that, illegally and unilaterally, they impose around the world,” it said.
“The United States has already demonstrated that it uses its economic and military power to intimidate and pressure states such as the Dominican Republic to serve as accomplices in its criminal acts. This is an example of the supposed ‘rules-based order’, which, disregarding international law, seeks to establish the law of the strongest,” it said.
For years, US officials have sought to disrupt the flow of billions of dollars to the regime. Homeland Security Investigations — the second largest investigative agency in the federal government — has seized dozens of luxury vehicles, among other assets, heading to Venezuela.
“The plane was seized in violation of US sanctions with Venezuela and other criminal matters that we’re still looking at regarding this aircraft,” Anthony Salisbury,Special Agent in Charge, Homeland Security Investigations told CNN.
A high-ranking official from the Dominican Republic told CNN that Maduro’s aircraft had been in Dominican territory undergoing maintenance at the time it was seized by US authorities. The source added that the government had no record that Maduro’s private plane was in the country until it was seized.
US officials worked closely with the Dominican Republic, which notified Venezuela of the seizure, according to one of the US officials.

Multiple federal agencies were involved in the seizure, including Homeland Security Investigations; Commerce agents, the Bureau of Industry and Security; and the Justice Department.
The Dominican Republic’s Foreign Minister said the government did not participate in the US’ investigation and only “international legal cooperation” was required under the two countries’ bilateral agreements.
One of the next steps, upon arriving to the US, will be pursuing forfeiture, meaning the Venezuelan government has a chance to petition for it, and collecting evidence from the aircraft.
The US recently placed pressure on the Venezuelan government to “immediately” release specific data regarding its presidential election, citing concerns about the credibility of Maduro’s claimed victory.
Venezuela’s opposition has published more than 80% of tallies printed and collected from voting machines across the country. Though partial, the documentation appears to show that the opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia actually won the vote, several experts told CNN.
The situation in Venezuela has had implications for US politics as millions flee the country, many of whom have chosen to migrate to the US-Mexico border.
Earlier this year, the US reimposed sanctions on Venezuela’s oil and gas sector in response to the Maduro government’s failure to allow “an inclusive and competitive election” to take place.
After the controversial reelection of Maduro on July 28, Venezuela suspended commercial flights to and from the Dominican Republic.
Federal agencies, including HSI, have long been going after the Venezuelan government over corruption concerns. Over recent years, HSI has disrupted $2 billion worth of the Venezuelan government’s illicit proceeds or resources, including judgements, seizures, liquidation of bank accounts, according to one of the US officials.
In March 2020, the US Department of Justice charged Maduro, together with 14 current and former Venezuelan officials, with narco-terrorism, drug trafficking and corruption.
“For more than 20 years, Maduro and a number of high-ranking colleagues allegedly conspired with (Colombian left-wing guerrilla group) the FARC, causing tons of cocaine to enter and devastate American communities.,” then-Attorney General William Barr said at the time.
The State Department’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs has offered a reward of up to $15 million for information leading to Maduro’s arrest or conviction.
In 2017, two nephews of Maduro’s wife Cilia Flores were sentenced to 18 years in prison by a federal court in New York City for trying to smuggle up to 800 kilograms of cocaine into the United States on a private jet; the two were later released by the United States in a prisoners’ exchange in 2022.
“We see these officials and the Maduro regime basically fleecing the Venezuelan people for their own gain,” the US official said. “You have people who can’t even afford a loaf of bread there and then you have the president of Venezuela jetting around in a high-class private jet.”
Poor economic conditions, food shortages and limited access to health care have pushed more than 7.7 million people to flee Venezuela, marking the largest displacement in the Western Hemisphere.

“From my perspective, I don’t have any problem with an enforceable code,” Jackson, the newest member of the high court, told “CBS News Sunday Morning” in an interview about her new memoir.
“A binding code of ethics is pretty standard for judges. And so I guess the question is, ‘Is the Supreme Court any different?’” Jackson said. “And I guess I have not seen a persuasive reason as to why the court is different than the other courts.”
Asked whether she was considering supporting the idea, Jackson said she was “as a general matter.”

Jackson is the latest justice to indicate an openness to an enforceable code of ethics at a time when the Supreme Court is facing heavy scrutiny — and near record low approval ratings — because of private jet flights and luxury travel accepted by some members of the court. President Joe Biden called for an enforceable code of conduct in late July.
Jackson, Biden’s first and only nominee to the Supreme Court, declined to endorse any particular ethics policy.  She also declined to discuss Justice Clarence Thomas, who has been at the center of the court’s ethics controversies. Thomas initially failed to disclose trips and other gifts from GOP megadonor Harlan Crow, though the conservative justice has said he was following the court’s disclosure rules as he understood them at the time.
The high court adopted its own code of conduct last year. But the measure, while historic, was heavily criticized by ethics experts because it included no way to enforce its requirements. Justice Elena Kagan, a member of the court’s liberal wing, defended the code of conduct this summer but also conceded it would be more effective if it included an enforcement mechanism.
Jackson’s interview comes as she is promoting a new memoir, “Lovely One,” to be published Tuesday. She will also be speaking at events in New York, Washington and Atlanta this week.
Critics of a binding code of ethics have pointed to concerns about how to enforce rules against members of a tribunal who are supposed to be the final word on the law. Some proposals, including one advanced by Senate Democrats, would create a panel of lower court judges to review ethics matters.
“It really boils down to impartiality,” Jackson told CBS. “That’s what the rules are about. People are entitled to know if you’re accepting gifts as a judge, so that they can evaluate whether or not your opinions are impartial.”"

Dr. Salvador Plasencia and alleged drug dealer Jasveen Sangha, who prosecutors have also refer to as the “Ketamine Queen,” will be tried together.
The trial is scheduled to begin on March 4, 2025. A pretrial hearing is scheduled for February 19.
Plasencia and Sangha were arrested on August 15 and indicted on respective charges that include falsifying medical records and conspiracy to distribute, among others, according to the US Attorneys office.
Both Sangha and Plasencia, who prosecutors say are responsible for contributing to Perry’s death by distributing ketamine to the actor during the final weeks of his life, have pleaded not guilty to the charges.
The three other individuals charged in connection with Perry’s death – Dr. Mark Chavez, Perry’s personal assistant Kenneth Iwamasa and an acquaintance to Perry, Erik Fleming – are cooperating with prosecutors and have reached plea agreements. Fleming and Iwamasa have sentencing dates set for October and November, respectively.
Sangha remains in federal custody and Plasencia is free on bond, according to the Department of Justice.
Perry died in October 2023 at age 54 because of “acute effects” of ketamine and subsequent drowning, according to the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner’s Office autopsy report. His body was found floating face down in a hot tub at his Pacific Palisades home.
Plasencia was charged with one count of conspiracy to distribute ketamine, seven counts of distribution of ketamine and two counts of altering and falsifying documents or records related to the federal investigation, according to the US Attorney’s office.
Plasencia allegedly sold vials of ketamine that he obtained from Chavez to Perry and Iwamasa “outside the usual course of professional practice and without a legitimate medical purpose” in the weeks leading up to his death.
He is also accused of teaching Iwamasa how to inject Perry with the drug and personally injecting Perry on one occasion, despite being informed that the actor’s ketamine addiction “was spiraling out of control.”
If convicted, Plasencia faces up to 10 years in federal prison for each ketamine-related count and up to 20 years for each falsification count.
In addition to having legitimate medical uses, ketamine is increasingly popular as a party drug.
“In Hollywood, you have parties you have after parties and people like to feel altered… it’s become popular in that circle,” said Dr. David Mahjoubi, who runs one of the hundreds of ketamine clinics that have proliferated in recent years.
Clinics like Mahjoubi’s use forms of the drug in controlled doses and controlled environments as therapy for mental health conditions like depression, anxiety and PTSD. Doctors are given discretion to use medications for so-called “off-label” uses “as long as it’s within acceptable guidelines” and “not causing harm,” according to Mahjoubi.
“If somebody wanted to get high off ketamine, they’re gonna go buy it from the street,” Mahjoubi added. “It’s gonna be a lot cheaper than coming to see a physician getting an infusion.”
When the Ketamine clinic that was treating Perry declined to increase his dose, prosecutors say, he went first to Plasencia, and then due to the cost, to Sangha.
Sangha, whom authorities call the “Ketamine Queen” of North Hollywood, ran what amounted to “a drug selling emporium” in her home and had sold vials of ketamine to Fleming on Perry’s behalf, according to Fleming’s plea agreement.
Prosecutors also claim that Sangha was “aware of the danger of ketamine” and continued to sell it even after she was made aware that the ketamine she sold to aspiring personal trainer Cody McLaury in August 2019 contributed to his overdose death.
Federal agents and LAPD detectives found over 70 vials of ketamine, among other “fraudulently obtained” and illegal drugs, after executing search warrants at Sangha’s residence, according to a press release from the US attorney’s office.
She is charged with one count of conspiracy to distribute ketamine, one count of maintaining a drug-involved premises, one count of possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine, one count of possession with intent to distribute ketamine, and five counts of distribution of ketamine.
Sangha is facing a maximum sentence of life in prison."

District Judge Mark Scarsi accepted the guilty plea after a dramatic and convoluted all-day hearing in Los Angeles that began with the routine jury selection process.
The judge, who is a Trump appointee, set a sentencing date for December 16. President Joe Biden’s son could now face up to 17 years in prison for his crimes, which include tax evasion, filing fraudulent tax returns and failing to pay taxes. The judge also said he could also impose a hefty fine, perhaps as much as $1.3 million.
But looming over the proceedings – as well as Hunter Biden’s convictions in a separate gun trial in June – is the possibility of a presidential pardon, or a commutation of sentence. President Joe Biden has repeatedly ruled this out, and a White House spokesperson reiterated that position on Thursday.
The guilty plea was a unilateral move by Hunter Biden, and was called an “open plea” because it was done without a pre-arranged leniency deal with prosecutors. Leo Wise, the hard-nosed prosecutor who led the case, told the judge, “We were as shocked as everyone else in the courtroom this morning” when Biden’s team tried to change his not guilty plea.
After the hearing, Biden’s lawyer Abbe Lowell told reporters that the president’s son “put his family first today, and it was a grave and loving thing to do,” instead of subjecting them to another public trial about his addiction and family dysfunction.
“After watching prosecutors who exploit his family’s grief during the Delaware trial and realizing they were planning to do it again in California, Hunter decided to enter his plea to protect those he loves from unnecessary hurt and cruel humiliation,” Lowell said. “This plea prevents that kind of show trial that would have not provided all the facts or served any real point in justice.”
This is a victory of sorts for special counsel David Weiss, who is the Trump-appointed US attorney for Delaware, and also successfully prosecuted the gun case. In a Thursday night statement, his team touted that Hunter Biden was “convicted” of the tax crimes – but this outcome means they didn’t get to put on the trial that they’ve been working on since 2018, when they started the investigation.
About 120 prospective jurors waited in a sequestered assembly room throughout the day, while prosecutors and Biden’s lawyers haggled in court over how to move forward.
When the proceedings kicked off Thursday morning, Lowell stunned the courtroom by saying Biden wanted to enter an “Alford plea,” where he would maintain his innocence but acknowledge that prosecutors had enough evidence to convict. Under this maneuver, Biden would have skipped a trial and accepted the judge’s punishment at sentencing.
But Biden’s team backed away from that plan after prosecutors raised forceful objections, and the judge said he’d want to study the matter and reconvene Friday morning.
“I want to make something crystal clear – the United States opposes an Alford plea,” Wise said. He added, “Hunter Biden is not innocent. Hunter Biden is guilty. He is not permitted to plead guilty on special terms.”
After a break in the proceedings, Lowell said Biden was willing to move forward with an “open plea,” to unilaterally plead guilty to the offenses, because “enough is enough.”
Lowell said Biden was willing to proceed with the open plea because the special counsel was trying to “exact a pound of flesh” and a “drop of blood.” Pushing back, Wise said Biden was to blame for the situation.
“We’re not here because of what the government did. … He’s the one that triggered this set of events,” Wise said, calling it “offensive” for Lowell to paint Biden as a “victim” of this prosecution.
During the standard questioning as part of every federal plea, Biden said under oath that nobody made him any promises to convince him to plead guilty. The president’s son also testified that nobody pressured him in any way to plead guilty.
“Do you agree that you committed every element of every crime?” Scarsi asked.
“Yes,” Biden responded.
Prosecutors also read the full 56-page indictment during the plea proceeding, which took nearly 90 minutes, and delved into the salacious details of Biden’s extravagant spending on strippers, escorts, luxury cars and fancy hotels, while not paying his taxes.
Biden’s wife Melissa Cohen left the courtroom soon after the reading began, which meant she missed the most explicit and embarrassing details in the indictment.
A tax trial would’ve have been Biden’s second criminal trial this year, after he was convicted in June on three federal gun charges in Wilmington, Delaware. That sentencing is scheduled for November 13, and he could face as many as 25 years in prison for those offenses.
The tax indictment alleged that Biden failed to pay $1.4 million in federal taxes and evaded taxes by filing tax returns with fraudulent business deductions.
The president’s son eventually paid roughly $2 million in back taxes and penalties after learning of the investigation and getting sober, following a yearslong struggle with drug addiction and alcoholism.
In the weeks before the trial, the judge blocked Biden’s lawyers from telling jurors about the belated tax payment, or about the potential origins of his addiction – dealing a major blow to his defense strategy.
The special counsel himself, Weiss, was sitting front row in the courtroom benches during the hearing, most of the time leaned over his knees and calmly tapping his feet as prosecutors laid bare the culmination of his six-year investigation into Biden’s finances and foreign deals.
Biden’s facial expression was stoic for the majority of the hearing. Just before the judge sat the courtroom after an initial recess, Biden stared blankly ahead of him for several moments. While Wise recited the indictment, Biden followed along closely with his own annotated copy.
Biden’s former business partner Tony Bobulinski attended the hearing, sitting with the public and press in the courtroom. A sharp critic of the Biden family, he testified in the House Republicans impeachment inquiry that also scrutinized many of the same foreign deals that were part of the tax case. Claims from Bobulinski and GOP lawmakers that Joe Biden was intimately involved in Biden’s lucrative foreign business deals, have not been proven.
Lowell’s leading role in the plea hearing was notable. He was the lead defense attorney for Biden’s Delaware gun case, but he was absent from a key pretrial hearing two weeks ago in the California tax case. Instead, celebrity attorney Mark Geragos, who was retained earlier this summer, took the lead at that hearing. Lowell did all the speaking for Biden on Thursday.
Asked by CNN after the hearing if there have been any contacts with President Joe Biden about a pardon, Geragos said, “The question you should be asking is, are you disappointed that you don’t get to try the case?”
The convoluted and drawn-out plea proceedings Thursday in Los Angeles were reminiscent of a similar hearing last summer in Delaware, where the same parties attempted to get a judge’s approval for a plea agreement that would’ve resolved the tax and gun cases in one fell swoop. That agreement stunningly unraveled in open court, with the parties disagreeing on its terms, and the judge eventually withholding her support over constitutional concerns.
”I’ve been through one of these plea hearings before,” Wise quipped, drawing a laugh from the judge as they all tried to figure out the way forward.
“Deja vu,” Scarsi replied.

KB8MBE4Y7W_30YYYM6CJ2BO3RG,"US service member detained in Venezuela, officials say","By Stefano Pozzebon, Natasha Bertrand and Haley Britzky, CNN","3 minute read Updated 2:59 PM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/04/politics/us-service-member-detained-venezuela/,"A US service member has been detained in Venezuela, according to four US officials familiar with the matter.
The service member, a US Navy sailor, is a US citizen and was detained on August 30 in Caracas, according to the officials. One of the officials said he is being held by the Venezuelan intelligence agency SEBIN.
A defense official told CNN, “we are aware of reports that a US Navy Sailor was detained on or about August 30, 2024, by Venezuelan law enforcement authorities while on personal travel to Venezuela. The US Navy is looking into this and working closely with the State Department. We refer you to the State Department for additional questions.”
Another official said the service member was not on official travel or approved leave when he traveled to the country. It is not clear why he traveled there.
“We are aware of reports of the detention of an individual in Venezuela,” a State Department spokesperson said.
“We have no further information to share at this time,” the spokesperson said.
The White House said Wednesday that they are “in touch” with Venezuelan authorities to get more information about the situation, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said.
“We’re obviously in touch, as appropriate as you think we would be with Venezuela authorities to try to get more knowledge and information about this,” Kirby said in Wednesday’s White House press briefing.
The State Department advises Americans against traveling to Venezuela, warning that “there is a high risk of wrongful detention of U.S. nationals.”
“Security forces have detained U.S. citizens for up to five years,” the travel advisory for Venezuela says. “The U.S. government is not generally notified of the detention of U.S. citizens in Venezuela or granted access to U.S. citizen prisoners there.”
CNN has asked the Venezuelan government for comment.
The detention of a US citizen comes during a period of serious unrest within Venezuela, after opposition and multiple Latin American leaders refused to recognize the reelection of the country’s authoritarian leader, Nicolas Maduro, in July. Protests erupted in Venezuela over the election, which reportedly killed at least 11 people and resulted in the detention of hundreds of others.
Just this week, the US seized Maduro’s airplane in the Dominican Republic. CNN first reported the seizure, which was a significant development in an already tense relationship between the US and Venezuela. One US official told CNN the seizure “sends a message all the way to the top.”
“Seizing the foreign head of state’s plane is unheard-of for criminal matters. We’re sending a clear message here that no one is above the law, no one is above the reach of US sanctions,” the official said.
The latest detention of a US service member comes roughly two years after nine Americans — including the “Citgo 6” — were brought home from Venezuela by the Biden administration in 2022. after five years of detention in the country. In December 2023, the US secured the release of six wrongfully detained Americans and four other Americans held in Venezuela.

KCJVHBBEAH_6FOHKCLWPF241V1,New Zealand is tripling its tourist tax,"By Lilit Marcus, CNN","3 minute read Published 1:01 AM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240903,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/travel/new-zealand-tripling-its-tourist-tax-intl-hnk/,"It will now be more expensive to visit New Zealand’s lakes, mountains, bike trails and wineries as the country is increasing its International Visitor Conservation and Tourism Levy (IVL) from NZ$35 ($22) to NZ$100 ($62) from October 1.
“International tourism also comes with costs to local communities, including additional pressure on regional infrastructure and higher upkeep and maintenance costs across our conservation estate,” Matt Doocey, New Zealand’s Minister for Hospitality and Tourism, said in a statement announcing the news.
The IVL, which was originally introduced in 2019, is intended to help cover the costs of environmental protection around the country. According to Doocey, international tourists spent more than $11 billion in New Zealand between March 2023 and March 2024.
But not everyone is happy with the price hike.
Tourism Industry Aotearoa (TIA), a consortium of travel industry professionals from across the country, criticized the decision.
“New Zealand’s tourism recovery is falling behind the rest of the world, and this will further dent our global competitiveness,” the group said in a statement. The group believes that New Zealand will lose tourists to Canada and the UK, where flights are more plentiful and entry fees less prohibitive.

The IVL is not the only added cost that will hit tourists visiting New Zealand.
Higher prices for tourist visas kick in on October 1, going from $131 to $211.
Citizens of 60 countries and territories, including the United States, Canada, Singapore, Japan and Mexico, can enter New Zealand are eligible for a visa waiver that will allow them to stay up to three months in the country for tourism purposes. Travelers holding these passports are still required to get an e-visa and pay the IVL.
Due to the new rules, the government expects that it will take longer for visas to be processed this year. Immigration New Zealand announced that people hoping to visit during the Christmas holiday period should apply for tourist visas no later than October 15 and those planning to come for Lunar New Year should get their applications in by November 15.
Whether they’re called an IVL, an access fee, or a travel incentive, “tourist taxes” are one of the hottest conversations in the travel industry right now.
Some 60 destinations around the world, from Venice to Bhutan, charge some kind of fee for travelers simply to enter and visit – not including the costs of meals, hotels, or admission tickets. Nearly all of the places with these tourist taxes say that the fee is necessary to offset the congestion, environmental damage and other side effects of overtourism.
And it doesn’t look like these fees are going away any time soon. Edinburgh, Scotland and Zermatt, Switzerland are among the places considering charging fees in the future.
According to a study from Bangor University in Wales, “there is little evidence of tourists being put off from visiting” destinations that have tourist taxes."
KDPERKABA6_K4QYCM3DWC5NMVJ,Trump seeks stay of sentencing for hush money conviction,"By Kara Scannell, CNN","2 minute read Updated 3:52 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/04/politics/trump-seek-sentencing-delay-hush-money/,"Lawyers for Donald Trump asked a federal appeals court on Wednesday to stop his sentencing until the judges can hear the former president’s legal argument to move the hush money case into federal court.
The last-ditch request comes after a federal judge rejected Trump’s motion to move the state case into federal court and delay the sentencing currently scheduled for September 18.
Trump’s lawyers said, “absent the requested stay, the New York County proceedings are scheduled to proceed to sentencing and ‘judgment of conviction’ on September 18, 2024 … which could result in the immediate incarceration of President Trump and irreparable harm to the impeding election before this Court has an opportunity to address the federal interests implicated by this appeal.”
Specifically, Trump’s lawyers are asking the appeals court to pause the federal judge’s ruling so the case is not sent back to the state court where Trump will be sentenced.
Trump filed a motion to appeal the decision denying the move into federal court Wednesday morning. That evening his lawyers filed motions with the federal judge and the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals to stay the federal judge’s ruling until the appeals court can hear an argument on the merits of moving the case to federal court. The one-two effort is Trump’s latest attempt to delay his sentencing.
Trump’s lawyers have argued the case should be moved into federal court following the Supreme Court’s decision this summer that granted immunity for some of Trump’s conduct that fell within his official powers.
Prosecutors with the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office have opposed the challenge to move the case into federal court and in a filing Thursday urged the federal appeals court to reject Trump’s effort to hold up his sentencing, saying that there is no basis for an appeal.
“As an initial matter, defendant mischaracterizes the nature of this appeal,” prosecutors wrote.
Prosecutors added that even if the appeals court would consider the request, they urge the judges to wait until Judge Juan Merchan, who presided over the trial, rules on Trump’s effort to postpone his sentencing until after the election.
Merchan could issue a decision as soon as this week.

The pleading came in a Tuesday court filing, which also indicated he wished to be excused from appearing in person at an upcoming court hearing in the case.

“I, President Donald J. Trump, the above-named defendant … do hereby waive my right to be present at Arraignment and I authorize my attorneys to enter a plea of not guilty on my behalf to each and every count of the superseding indictment,” Trump told the court in a one-page filing that included his bold, black signature. “I further state that I have received a copy of the superseding indictment and reviewed it with my counsel.”
Thursday will mark the first court hearing before Judge Tanya Chutkan since the case was paused for the US Supreme Court to determine the extent of presidential immunity to which Trump is entitled.
Chutkan said later Tuesday that Trump does not have to appear at the hearing Thursday – when the former president’s formal arraignment will occur.
Trump’s attorneys plan to attend the hearing.
Chutkan, of the DC District Court, will have to decide how to proceed with the criminal case over efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, including setting a schedule. She must also decide whether prosecutors can take Trump to trial and be able to call certain witnesses, such as former Vice President Mike Pence.
The new indictment, approved by a grand jury last week, requires Trump to enter a new pleading. While prosecutors cut back some of the allegations against the former president in light of the Supreme Court ruling, Trump faces the same four criminal charges as before.

KIG4JVJRQH_OG43KTP1IFXHUIW,At least 129 killed during mass prison break attempt in DR Congo,"By Niamh Kennedy and Nimi Princewill, CNN","3 minute read Updated 2:52 PM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240903,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/03/africa/dr-congo-prison-break-intl/,"More than 120 people have been killed in an attempted mass breakout from the largest prison in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the latest in a series of violent attacks on jails in the central African nation.
Prisoners tried to break out en masse from the Makala Central Prison in the capital, Kinshasa, at around 2 a.m. local time (9 p.m. ET) on Monday, Interior Minister Jacquemain Shabani Lukoo Bihango told reporters.
“The provisional human toll stands at 129 dead including 24 by gunshot after warning. The others died by jostling, suffocation and some women were raped,” Bihango said. He added that 59 people were receiving medical care.
One Kinshasa resident, Daddi Soso, told Agence France-Presse that gunfire rang out for several hours during the incident and that he later saw security vehicles removing bodies from the scene.
A series of graphic videos circulating on social media - not verified by CNN - showed dozens of bloodied corpses on the ground.

Extensive damage to several prison buildings was also seen in interior ministry video. A large hole is shown in one exterior wall, where bricks appear to have been removed, while the walls of other buildings are black and burnt out.
Video filmed inside the prison showed several ransacked rooms with debris, burnt office furniture and papers strewn across the floor.
Several prison buildings including offices, the registry, the infirmary and food depots were destroyed by fires during the attempted prison break, the minister told the press conference.
Interior minister Bihango convened a crisis meeting of the country’s defense and security services on Tuesday after receiving instructions from the country’s “senior hierarchy.”
The government is relieved “by the restored calm,” he said, adding that investigations into the incident are ongoing.
More than 12,000 inmates, mostly pretrial detainees, were held in the Makala prison before the attempted jailbreak even though the facility could only contain 1,500 people, according to a recent report by Amnesty International which highlighted the “appalling” detention conditions at the facility.
In a statement on social media Monday, Justice Minister Constant Mutamba condemned the prison break attempt as a “pre-meditated act of sabotage.”
Mutamba barred public prosecutors from transferring any inmates to Makala prison “until further notice” as part of a series of measures he announced to tackle overcrowding at the country’s prisons.
In a statement on X, the European Union called for “an independent and rapid investigation to shed light on these tragic events and establish responsibilities.”
Prison breaks are common in the DRC, with several attacks being launched on correctional facilities in recent years.
More than 50 inmates, including the leader of a religious sect, broke free from the Makala prison in 2017 following an invasion by the group.
And in 2020, a rebel group linked to ISIS claimed responsibility for a jailbreak that freed nearly 1,000 inmates from a prison in Beni, in northeastern DRC. At least 11 people, including security personnel, were killed in that attack.
Another prison break was recorded the following year at Matadi, one of the country’s oldest prisons, which saw the escape of 189 prisoners. More than 200 other detainees escaped from the same prison in 2022 after seizing weapons from the facility’s armory.

The incident occurred near the Cathedral of Learning on campus. Two students were treated at the scene. The suspect, who has no known affiliation with the school, was immediately arrested and was in custody, the university said.
“Upon learning about this incident, Pitt leadership contacted Hillel University Center to offer support to our students and also connected with our partners at the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh,” the university said. “We are grateful to our Pitt Police officers for their swift action, and our Student Affairs team for their ongoing student support.”
There was no ongoing threat to the public, the school said.
It said, “To be clear: Neither acts of violence nor antisemitism will be tolerated. Local and federal partners are supporting Pitt Police in this ongoing investigation.”
The fall semester began Monday.
“The safety of our Jewish students remains a priority, and we will continue to be a home away from home for them, providing them with care, support and community,” Hillel University Center said in a statement.
University police said the incident was not connected to an earlier shooting at the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, across the street from the Cathedral of Learning. Pittsburgh Public Safety shared on X a man had been shot in the leg around 5:30 p.m. and was in stable condition.
CNN has reached out to university police requesting additional information about the incident but has not received a response.
On October 27, 2018, a man burst into the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh and shot people with an AR-15-style rifle. Eleven people were killed and six others, including four responding police officers, were wounded. It was the deadliest ever attack on Jews in the United States.
A federal jury sentenced him to death last year after prosecutors said the attack was motivated by the man’s hatred toward Jews, immigrants and particularly the non-profit organization Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society."
KTURBHLACP_6T3OQHO9T2UHIAI,2020 election deniers ordered to pay $1 million in Pennsylvania voting machine dispute,"By Zachary Cohen, CNN","3 minute read Published 12:56 PM EDT, Mon September 2, 2024",20240902,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/02/politics/election-deniers-pennsylvania-voting-machine-dispute/,"A Pennsylvania judge has determined that three 2020 election deniers must pay nearly $1 million in fees as the result of a years-long legal dispute with state officials over voting equipment used during the last presidential race, according to recent court filings.
Recommendations from the judge, who was appointed to serve as a special master overseeing the case, attach a dollar figure to sanctions previously imposed by the state’s Supreme Court against two Republican county commissioners and their attorney for allowing an outside firm to examine voting equipment after the 2020 election – despite a court order prohibiting them to do so, according to the new filings.
The case, which dates back to 2021, involves actions taken by two Fulton County, Pennsylvania, commissioners – Stuart Ulsh and Randy Bunch – who sought to have Dominion voting equipment examined by a third-party after the 2020 election. Many of former President Donald Trump’s allies falsely blamed Dominion’s software for his election defeat.
Thomas Carroll, an attorney who also served as a pro-Trump fake elector in 2020, was also sanctioned by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court for his conduct and – along with the county and the county commissioners – “shall be jointly and severally responsible” for paying nearly $1 million in fees to cover the Pennsylvania Secretary of State’s legal bills, according to the special master’s latest report.
The state Supreme Court will ultimately use the special master recommendations in awarding fees and costs resulting from the case.
Last week’s special master report marks one of the final chapters of the Fulton County voting equipment dispute – one of several legal battles over unauthorized access to election systems that emerged from the 2020 presidential race.
In Fulton County, multiple outside firms were ultimately given unauthorized access to voting systems after the 2020 election without authorization from the Board of Elections, according to previous court filings in the special master probe. The third county commissioner only learned that an outside firm had been allowed to inspect the election equipment until after it was done, court filings show.
None of the third party groups granted access to the voting systems in Fulton County were contracted by the county itself or had the proper accreditation to carry out such an inspection, according to court records.
In July 2021, upon learning of the unauthorized inspection, the secretary of state’s office argued that the inspection itself had compromised the integrity of the equipment by undermining chain of custody requirements and access limitations necessary to prevent tampering.
The state secretary issued a directive barring county boards of elections from providing access to third parties seeking to examine state-certified voting systems. The directive provided for the revocation of funding from counties whose machines had been decertified under the directive and stated that Pennsylvania would not reimburse any cost of replacement voting equipment that had to be withdrawn.
The commissioners and their lawyers then launched legal proceedings.
During the proceedings, the state secretary learned that Fulton County intended to allow another entity, Envoy Sage LLC, to inspect the equipment. The secretary sought and received a protective order from the Pennsylvania Supreme Court barring such an inspection. In January 2022, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court entered the protective order.
Months after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court entered the protective order, the commissioners nonetheless allowed another party – Speckin Forensics – to inspect the voting equipment without the knowledge of the state, according to court papers. After the completion of that report, the county moved to sue Dominion, arguing that the machines were not fit for their intended use and purpose.
When Pennsylvania state officials brought the action to the attention of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, the court issued sanctions. It ordered the county officials to pay attorney’s fees and referred their attorney, Thomas Carroll to Pennsylvania’s attorney disciplinary board. The court also ordered the Dominion voting equipment to be placed in the custody of a neutral agent."
KTVPZEJ25K_7ULCQ73YX07YX82,Federal judge denies Trump’s request to move hush money case to federal court,"By Kara Scannell, CNN","3 minute read Updated 6:18 PM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/03/politics/trump-hush-money-request-federal-court/,"A federal judge Tuesday denied Donald Trump’s request to move the New York hush money case to federal court, finding there is nothing in the Supreme Court’s presidential immunity ruling that alters his view of the fact that the payments were “private, unofficial acts.”
Last week, the former president’s attorneys sought to move the state case to federal court, an effort they previously lost, citing the Supreme Court’s decision this summer that granted immunity for some of Trump’s conduct that fell within his official powers. They also urged the judge to postpone Trump’s sentencing, currently set for September 18.
Judge Alvin Hellerstein rejected the long shot bid, saying no facts have changed since he rejected Trump’s attempt to move the case last year. At the time, the judge found that Trump’s reimbursement to Michael Cohen, who facilitated hush money payments to adult film actress Stormy Daniels, were not official acts he took as president.
“Nothing in the Supreme Court’s opinion affects my previous conclusion that the hush money payments were private, unofficial acts, outside the bounds of executive authority,” Hellerstein wrote in his decision Tuesday.
“Private schemes with private actors, unconnected to any statutory or constitutional authority or function of the executive, are considered unofficial acts,” he wrote.
Trump also claimed the case should be moved to federal court because he alleged Judge Juan Merchan, who presided over the trial, is biased against him.
Hellerstein said it was not his place to evaluate the New York trial.
“District Courts may not reverse or modify state judgments, even those containing constitutional infirmities because ‘to do so would be an exercise of appellate jurisdiction,’” Hellerstein wrote. He said the proper vehicle would be for Trump to appeal the conviction through the state courts. Trump has said he will appeal the decision, which in New York occurs after sentencing.
“It would be highly improper for this Court to evaluate the issues of bias, unfairness or error in the state trial,” Hellerstein wrote. The judge said for the same reasons, it would be improper for him to postpone Trump’s sentencing later this month.
Trump has separately asked Merchan to delay the sentencing until after the election. Prosecutors haven’t opposed that request, and the judge could issue a decision as soon as this week.
Trump has also argued in a motion to Merchan that his conviction should be overturned in light of the Supreme Court decision, which in part found that evidence of official acts can’t be used at trial. His attorneys said the jury should not have been allowed to hear the testimony of former White House aide Hope Hicks or see social media posts Trump made while in office.
Merchan said he will rule on that motion on September 16.
Trump could face as much as four years in prison when he is sentenced. He was convicted earlier this year of 34 counts of falsifying business records.

KVNSBX8NGX_F1FCZMCPTW470T9,New Maori Queen anointed following the death of her father,Story by Reuters,"3 minute read Published 5:49 AM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/05/world/new-maori-queen-anointed-intl-scli/,"A new Maori Queen was anointed Thursday, taking on the role at a time when New Zealand is facing some of the biggest challenges to race relations in two decades.
A statement released by representatives said Nga Wai Hono i te Po had been chosen by Maori elders to replace her father, King Tuheitia Pootatau Te Wherowhero VII, who died aged 69 last week following surgery.
“The new monarch was raised up in a ceremony known as Te Whakawahinga, in front of thousands of people gathered for the tangihanga (funeral and burial) of Kiingi Tuheitia,” a spokesperson for the Kiingitanga or royal family said.
The new queen is not crowned and instead a bible that has been used since 1858 was placed upon her head and Archbishop Don Tamihere used sacred oils to bestow prestige, sacredness, power and spiritual essence upon her.
Thousands gathered at Tuurangawaewae, the meeting place of the King movement, to farewell him in a traditional funeral.
Following the anointment of his daughter, the King’s coffin was taken to the Waikato River by hearse before being paddled in a flotilla of traditional Maori waka or canoe to Taupiri Mountain, where he was to be buried alongside other royals and high-profile Maori.
The Maori King or Queen is considered the paramount chief of several tribes, or iwi, but is not affiliated with all of them. The monarch’s role has no judicial or legal authority in New Zealand and is largely ceremonial.
The role is not necessarily hereditary but voted on by representatives from iwi across the country. The new queen, or Kuini, is the only daughter and youngest child of the former King and his wife Te Atawhai Makau Ariki and is aged 27.
Radio New Zealand says that the new monarch, who has two older brothers, was favored to ascend the throne, although it had not been a foregone conclusion.

The new queen holds a Master of Arts in Tikanga (societal lore of) Maori and has served on a number of boards include that of the Te Kohanga Reo National Trust, an organization charged with revitalizing Maori language, according to 1News.
New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said the government welcomed the new queen’s appointment as she carries forward the mantle of leadership left by her father.
Her anointment comes at a time when New Zealand is struggling with race relations.
New Zealand’s center-right coalition which took office last year has started undoing policies of previous governments, particularly those promoting the official use of the Maori language, the enhancement of Indigenous living standards and rights and efforts to repair some of the wrongs undertaken during colonization.
King Tuheitia held a gathering of tribes from across the country in January to discuss how to respond to government plans. As King Tuheitia told the thousands who attended that their voices matter, his daughter, the new queen stood beside him."
KW0BZTQF6O_XV8I94DU2L496JI,China kicks off major African summit as it seeks to woo leaders amid pressure from the West,"By Simone McCarthy, CNN","6 minute read Published 7:50 PM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/03/china/china-africa-summit-intl-hnk/,"Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.
Delegations from dozens of African countries are gathering in Beijing for a three-day summit set to see China showcase itself as a lead partner for the continent, despite slowing lending for its development – and as it faces rising frictions with the West.
A procession of African leaders have arrived in the Chinese capital in recent days, greeted at the airport by honor guards and dance troupes with images flashed across state media, while Chinese officials have touted the gathering as the largest diplomatic event they’ve hosted in recent years.
The fanfare comes as Chinese leader Xi Jinping has much to signal to his visiting counterparts, and the world, as the summit gets underway Wednesday.
It is the first such gathering between Chinese and African leaders in the capital since 2018 and arrives at a critical juncture in ties between Beijing and a continent that’s home to its only overseas military base and where it has been the driving economic foreign power.
In recent decades, free flowing Chinese funding has driven the construction of highways, rail lines and power plants across Africa. The financing has filled funding gaps and expanded China’s political influence, but also generated criticism it was saddling countries with unsustainable debt.
Now, in the face of these concerns and its own economic slowdown, Xi and his officials will be likely pitching a new tune – what they posit as sustainable “small yet beautiful” investments and more collaboration on the green technologies in which China leads the world in producing.
This week will be Beijing’s most high-profile chance to telegraph that vision, as it seeks to point the direction forward for ties with a continent whose political backing is only growing more important amid Beijing’s rising frictions with Washington – and for Xi’s aim to position China as a champion of the Global South and alternative leader to the US.
How these changes play out for African leaders remains another question. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa bluntly called on China to “narrow the trade deficit and address the structure of our trade” during a bilateral meeting with Xi on Monday.
A number of leaders attending the three-yearly Forum on China and Africa Cooperation are from countries grappling with heavy international debt, including from Chinese loans, and seek more investment and trade to boost their economies.
They will likely probe whether a 2021 pledge from Xi to import products worth $300 billion from Africa by next year will be achieved. They’re also likely to press for ways to ensure growing trade is not merely an exchange of African raw materials for Chinese manufactured goods.
“Critical questions are going to be asked –  and so African countries and their Chinese partners are going to be hard pressed to provide answers,” said Paul Nantulya, a senior China specialist at the Africa Center for Strategic Studies in Washington.
When it comes to investment, even before the pandemic, China had already been reducing funding for the big-scale infrastructure projects that saw the world’s second largest economy become Africa’s largest bilateral creditor over recent decades.
Chinese lending to African government or state-linked borrowers cratered during the pandemic, reaching a low of roughly $1 billion in 2022, according to Boston University’s Global Development Policy Center. The data showed a modest recovery to $4.6 billion in 2023, a far cry from a peak of more than $28.8 billion in 2016.
Some African leaders holding talks in Beijing are facing steep challenges repaying debt from China and other lenders.
Kenya, whose president, William Ruto, is in Beijing this week, was rocked by protests earlier this summer over a finance bill introduced by the government to rein in public debt. That debt includes nearly $6 billion owed to China and more than $20 billion payable to multilateral banks, according to an April government statement.
Analysts say China is not the main cause of African debt distress in most cases, making up a comparatively small portion of the continent’s overall public debt. But the influx of Chinese loans increased the debt burden, and observers suggest China has moved too slowly or been inflexible in cases when it comes to helping countries that are heavily indebted to it get relief.
Beijing has defended its lending practices and its efforts to ease debt repayment but is unlikely to make debt relief a major theme of the multilateral summit, where it will focus on trade measures and promoting what it says is a shift to “small yet beautiful” investments.
The term, referring to projects with smaller budgets and environmental or social impact, has emerged as a key buzzword as Xi’s flagship Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). That’s as the infrastructure drive for the developing world transitions to a new phase following a decade of growth – that saw some projects slammed for environmental costs or poor labor standards and others stalled.
“There will be fewer projects but a greater spotlight on them. In an ironic way, I think this will lead to a more sustainable path,” said Bhaso Ndzendze, an associate professor of politics and international relations at the University of Johannesburg in South Africa.
But “the African side is keen to accept almost anything that China has to offer,” he continued, pointing to limited alternative avenues of support.
Beijing is also expected to push to make Africa’s market a destination for its prolific production of green tech like solar panels and electric vehicles.
The move may be welcomed by African nations grappling with power shortages and climate threat, but also comes as such Chinese goods face hefty tariffs in the US, Europe and Canada, as those markets move to block what they see as a flood of unfairly subsidized products.
Past gatherings of the twenty-four-year-old forum have included big promises of financing and boosting bilateral trade. Beijing will now be keenly aware that its commitments face competition.
In recent years, the US and its European partners have launched their own efforts to fund infrastructure in Africa, widely seen to be driven by their concern over China’s expansive footprint in the region – and its access to African critical minerals key for the fabrication of green tech.

“Now (China) has competition on the street … so that also might trigger them to keep the momentum going on infrastructure, because they don’t want to cede that space to the US,” said Ammar A. Malik, a faculty affiliate in public policy at William & Mary, who monitors China’s overseas spending.
Xi is also expected to use the gathering to project to the rest of the world the idea of solidarity between China’s view on the world and that of countries across Africa – a sign to Washington that despite pressure from the US and its allies, Beijing has numerous friends.
Visiting leaders are likely to continue to endorse Xi’s cornerstone rhetoric around building a global “community with a shared future,” a vision he sees as unlike the one that’s been unfairly dominated by the West. Attendees could also express a unified opinion on global issues like the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.
The forum has, in recent years, expanded beyond economic cooperation into areas like peace and security, alongside China’s own growing security interests in the region, where its companies’ sprawling mining operations have been subject to criminal attacks.
“China-Africa relations is going back to the basics in the sense that it started as a political relationship,” said Ovigwe Eguegu, a Nigeria-based policy analyst at the consultancy Development Reimagined.
Eguegu pointed to current Chinese Communist Party-funded initiatives to fund training for African political parties as well as African port calls from the People’s Liberation Army navy and joint military drills as part of a “ramping up of engagement in the political-security dimension.”
“China is preparing its diplomatic relationships across the world at a time of increasing geopolitical tensions,” he said."
KW9KK24YST_OK5MJA2FEGAIM8Q,Biden administration announces major actions to tackle Russian efforts to influence 2024 election,"By Sean Lyngaas, Evan Perez, Kylie Atwood, Zachary Cohen and Jennifer Hansler, CNN","5 minute read Updated 8:18 PM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/04/politics/biden-administration-accuse-russia-election-influence-efforts/,"The Biden administration announced a sweeping set of actions to tackle a major Russian government-backed effort to influence the 2024 US presidential election on Wednesday, including unveiling criminal charges against two Russian nationals, sanctions on 10 individuals and entities, and the seizure of 32 internet domains.
At Russian President Vladimir Putin’s direction, three Russian companies used fake profiles to promote false narratives on social media, US Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said in a statement. Internal documents produced by one of those Russian companies show one of the goals of the propaganda effort was to boost the candidacy of Donald Trump or whoever emerged as the Republican nominee for president, according to an FBI affidavit.
Separately, two employees of RT, the Russian state media network, were indicted in a US court for allegedly being part of a scheme that funneled nearly $10 million to set up and direct a Tennessee-based front company to produce online content aimed at sowing divisions among Americans, according to the Justice Department. The scheme targeted millions of American news consumers with what Attorney General Merrick Garland described as “hidden Russian government messaging.”

Taken together, the actions represent the Biden administration’s most significant public response yet to alleged Russian influence operations targeting American voters. After the US accused Iran of trying to hack both the Trump and Biden-Harris campaigns last month, Wednesday’s actions are a reminder that US officials continue to see Russia as a prominent foreign influence threat to November’s election, sources familiar with the matter said.
One of the three Russian companies allegedly behind the internet domains seized by the Justice Department is a company called Social Design Agency (SDA), which the Treasury Department previously sanctioned for allegedly running fake news sites in Europe on behalf of the Russian government.
CNN first reported on the pending US actions earlier Wednesday. The Russian disinformation operation is being laundered through both Americans and non-American voices, four sources told CNN.
A nearly 300-page FBI affidavit released on Wednesday describes the domain seizures and lays out a broad, Kremlin-backed effort to seed fake news stories to attack US politicians supporting Ukraine in the war against Russia and stoke tensions in US society.
Internal SDA documents cited in the affidavit, which appear to date to before Trump officially clinched the Republican nomination, say one of the “goals” of the company’s disinformation efforts was to “secure victory of a U.S. Political Party A candidate (Candidate A or one of his internal party opponents” in the 2024 election.
The documents included in the affidavit do not mention Trump by name, but the US intelligence community has said that Russia’s preferences for the presidential race also haven’t shifted since 2020, when Moscow conducted a range of influence operations in support of Trump and aimed at denigrating Joe Biden.
The SDA documents also propose targeting US voters in six swing states with disinformation, hitting on themes such as the “risk of job loss for white Americans” and the purported threat of crime from “Ukrainian immigrants,” according to the FBI affidavit.
Prosecutors in the indictment of two RT employees also describe an operation intended to fuel pro-Russian narratives, in part, by pushing content and news articles favoring Trump and others who the Kremlin deemed to be friendlier to its interests.
The unnamed Tennessee-based company that the Justice Department alleges was being funded by Russian operatives working as part of the Kremlin-orchestrated influence operation is Tenet Media, which is linked to right-wing commentators with millions of subscribers on YouTube and other social media platforms, according to a US official briefed on the matter.
Formerly known as Russia Today, RT runs television and online platforms around the world that advance the Kremlin’s agenda. The Justice Department forced RT America to register as a foreign agent in 2017 after US intelligence officials concluded that the media outlet contributed to Russian efforts to meddle in the 2016 election.
Wednesday’s announcements mark the second major effort by the Biden administration to blunt RT’s influence in as many months. In July, the Justice Department accused an RT employee of being involved in a scheme that used a network of about 1,000 social media accounts to pose as US residents to spread disinformation about the Ukraine war and other topics. US officials accuse the Kremlin of financing the scheme; a Kremlin spokesperson denied the allegation.
Asked for comment, an RT spokesperson did not respond to the substance of the allegations, and instead emailed mocking comments including, “2016 called and it wants its clichés back.”
CNN was not immediately able to reach Social Design Agency for comment.
A growing number of foreign operatives have attempted to influence US elections since Russia’s 2016 activity, which included hacking the Democratic National Committee and leaking documents aimed at undercutting Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign.
In the 2024 election, Iran’s alleged embrace of a similar hack-and-leak playbook that Russia used in 2016 has US officials on heightened alert. In June, a group of Iranian government-linked hackers successfully targeted the Trump campaign, stole internal campaign documents and shared them with news organizations. The hackers breached the email account of longtime Trump ally Roger Stone to target campaign staff, CNN has reported.
US officials are also keeping a close eye on China, which US officials and private experts say uses a vast set of online accounts to also target US voters. Chinese leader Xi Jinping told US President Joe Biden that China would not interfere in the 2024 US presidential election when the two men met last November, CNN previously reported.
But any foreign or domestic attempts to sow discord during the US election and shape voters’ opinions don’t change the fact that the voting process is very difficult to tamper with and protected by layers of defenses. There is no evidence of successful efforts — foreign or domestic —to swing an American election by changing vote tallies.
An estimated 97% of registered voters in the 2024 US election will cast their ballot in a jurisdiction with a verified paper record — adding to transparency around the vote, Jen Easterly, director of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, told reporters this week.
“Election infrastructure has never been more secure,” Easterly said.

L4QA8B4104_NJCJGUOC67M4WF0,China-Africa ties ‘best in history’ claims Xi as Beijing pushes back on Western debt trap criticism,"By Simone McCarthy, CNN","6 minute read Updated 8:28 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/05/china/china-africa-forum-xi-speech-aid-pledge-intl-hnk/,"Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.
China is enjoying its “best in history” ties with African nations, leader Xi Jinping said on Thursday, as he pledged $50 billion in financial support for the continent in addition to military aid.
China and Africa should rally their populations together to become a “powerful force” and write a “new chapter in peace, prosperity and progress,” Xi said in a sweeping speech to delegates from more than 50 African nations as he sought to bolster relationships seen as key to Beijing’s position as a rising global power.
Flanked by African dignitaries seated on stage in the cavernous Great Hall of the People in Beijing, Xi said “China-Africa relations are at their best in history,” and vowed to elevate China’s bilateral relations with all African countries with which it has formal ties to the level of “strategic relations.”
Xi separately pledged another $280 million in aid to African countries, split evenly between military and food assistance. The announcements are a sign Beijing wants to demonstrate its commitment to the continent, despite a recent slowdown in its overseas development lending and as Africa struggles with its foreign debt, including those owed to China.
The pledge of $140 million in military aid is the largest amount that China has earmarked for this purpose at the three-yearly Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, signaling the increasing importance of security in the relationship between Beijing and its partners in Africa. In 2018, China said it would provide $100 million to support the African Standby Force and African Capacity for Immediate Response to Crisis.
Leaders including South Africa’s Cyril Ramaphosa, Kenya’s William Ruto and Nigeria’s Bola Tinubu assembled in the Chinese capital this week for the three-day forum that Beijing has hailed as its largest diplomatic gathering in years.
This year’s event comes amid questions about the direction of those relations as Beijing, long the driving foreign economic power in Africa, has been recalibrating its extensive economic ties to the continent, while other major powers are ramping up their own efforts to engage Africa.
China has been pulling back on big-ticket spending under Xi’s signature Belt and Road Initiative. That infrastructure drive saw it fund projects like railways, roads and power plants and expand its influence on the continent. However, it also faced criticism that unsustainable lending contributed to heavy international debt loads now shouldered by many African countries.
Xi did not mention these debt challenges in his address but did make broad pledges for China to deepen cooperation with Africa in industry, agriculture, infrastructure, trade and investment.
Xi’s pledge of $50 billion to the continent over the next three years — a mix of credit funds, assistance and private investment from Chinese firms — outstrips a previous pledge made three years ago of around $30 billion during a prior iteration of the forum in Dakar, Senegal.
While lower than the $60 billion pledged in 2015 and 2018 respectively, it appears to be aimed at sending a strong signal to visiting leaders about China’s commitment to the continent.
In his 10-minute speech, Xi outlined 10 action areas for cooperation over the coming three years, including infrastructure connectivity, trade, security and green development – an area where Beijing is widely seen as pushing to enhance its exports of green technology.
He also pledged to create at least 1 million jobs for Africa.
It’s unclear how Xi’s pledges would align in practice with the expectations from visiting African leaders, analysts say. Fulfillment of past pledges has also been difficult to track, they say.

Leaders in Beijing are seeking investment, trade, and support to industrialize and create jobs. That includes a push for China to import more processed goods from Africa, rather than simply exporting and processing raw materials – like Africa’s highly sought after critical minerals.
Following Xi’s speech, African leaders also gave remarks, with South Africa’s Ramaphosa praising China’s “solidarity” with the continent. He pointed to global challenges including conflict, climate change and a “global contestation for critical minerals” that is fueling geopolitical rivalry.
“These challenges affect all nations but are more often severely felt on the African continent, yet amid these challenges there is hope and opportunity,” he said.
Speaking later on the sidelines of the summit, Senegal’s Foreign Minister Yassine Fall told reporters that there would always be global competition but observers should look to evidence of the “quality of partnership between Africa and China.”
“You see how Africans today are saying that China is on our side,” Fall said.
This year’s gathering comes as China’s longstanding relations with Africa appear even more critical for Beijing amid rising frictions with Washington.
The US and Europe have also been ramping up their own efforts to engage Africa and access its critical minerals, widely seen as a bid to counter inroads that China has made both politically and in the continent’s resources sector.
In his address, Xi played up what Beijing hopes is a kindred political stance with the continent, hailing a joint vision for “shared future,” a key buzzword he uses to denote alignment with China’s vision for a world order that provides an alternative to the one championed by the US.
He also pointed to what he described as the “great suffering” of developing countries under the West’s historical process of modernization.
Observers say Beijing is even more keen to use this year’s gathering to signal its ongoing commitment, given concerns about its role in high levels of debt among African nations.
China is not seen by analysts to be the main cause of African debt distress in most cases, as countries also owe huge sums to multilateral banks and private lenders. But its hefty loans have upped debt burdens and Beijing has been criticized for not moving quickly enough or being flexible in helping distressed or at-risk countries.
“With the intensification of this great power competition with the United States, China is coming to the realization that it has to rely on the Global South as the foundation for its diplomacy,” said Yun Sun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center think tank in Washington.
“The choice of African countries in this great power competition is becoming more important than ever, because Africa is such a big block in the Global South,” she said.
In a press conference later Thursday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi acknowledged other countries were turning their attention toward Africa.
“As Africa’s good friend, China is happy for that, we also welcome more countries for their support and assistance to Africa,” he said, adding that any “condescending approach” must be rejected.
Xi’s push to bolster security is also a sign of how Beijing is looking to expand its strategic partnership with a region that has emerged as a key node in China’s military ambitions.
The People’s Liberation Army opened its first and only overseas military base in Djibouti in 2017, and its navy has made regular port calls in different African countries amid concern in Washington that Beijing could seek to open an Atlantic base.
In addition to the $140 million in military assistance announced Thursday, Xi pledged to train 6,000 military personnel and 1,000 law enforcement officers and establish a “partnership with Africa to implement the Global Security Initiative,” referring to his broader vision to reshape global security architecture away from the US alliance-based security system.
Security cooperation also has a pragmatic angle for Beijing, whose companies’ mining operations in Africa have been subject to criminal attacks.
Xi alluded to this in his comments, calling for China and Africa to “jointly maintain the safety of personnel and projects.”
However, analysts note that while China plays a substantial role in United Nations peacekeeping efforts, it’s seen as less likely to want to get involved directly in regional conflicts, even as it continues to push for other collaborations in the security realm.
China “is very proactive in understanding the mindset of the region,” said Ovigwe Eguegu, a Nigeria-based policy analyst at the consultancy Development Reimagined, and now it sees “there is a lot of dissatisfaction with the current global security order.”

Residents said the death toll could be even higher, with villagers still missing and feared dead after fighters chased them into the bush.
The attack took place on Sunday afternoon in Yobe, one of three states at the frontline of an insurgency that has lasted 15 years. Thousands of Nigerians have been killed and more than 2 million displaced.
Yobe police spokesperson Dungus Abdulkarim said the attack in Yobe’s Mafa village was apparent retaliation for the killing of two suspected Boko Haram fighters by local vigilantes.

After shooting at the market and torching buildings, the militants chased other residents into the bush and shot them, Abdulkarim added.
“The terrorists killed many people, but we are yet to ascertain the actual number of casualties,” Abdulkarim said.
A military official who accompanied the army’s commanding officer for Yobe to Mafa on Monday evening said the route to the village had been rigged with explosives, which troops managed to defuse.
“We recovered 37 corpses and brought them to Babangida General Hospital,” said the official, who declined to be identified because he is not authorized to speak to the media.
Modu Mohammed, a resident, said several more residents were missing and estimated the death toll at over 100. He said some corpses were still in the bush."

It’s a common quandary: a traveler planning a vacation wants to be responsible, stay at a locally-owned hotel instead of a big chain and hire local guides who can take them off the typical tourist trail. But how?
Mark Olsen, CEO of Tourism Tropical North Queensland, has a name for these kinds of travelers: “conservation-curious.” He describes them as “people who are interested in conservation but don’t know how their holiday and conservation can come together.”
Enter Guardian of the Reef, a website where people planning visits to the Great Barrier Reef can watch informative videos to unlock 10-20% discounts off of hotels or book custom experiences that aren’t available elsewhere. The platform, created with online booking company Expedia, is aimed at travelers who want to spend their money in productive ways but don’t want to spend weeks online researching every single hotel and tour operator.
According to data from Expedia, 90% of its users say they are interested in sustainable options when traveling.
Some of the bookable Guardian of the Reef experiences are traditional tourist activities like snorkeling trips and whale-watching cruises led by certified, licensed eco-guides. Others are specifically about conservation: visitors can help restore seagrass, an important habitat for sea turtles, or place “baby” corals on reefs where they can grow.
Still, there are limits on what the site can provide.
“It doesn’t book your flights,” says Olsen, who adds that travelers should also purchase carbon offsets.

Australia has long struggled to find a happy medium between supporting tourists who want to visit and spend money at the UNESCO World Heritage site and also caring for the reef, which has suffered mass coral bleaching events amid global climate change.
According to Statistics Australia, tourism brought in $57 billion AUD ($38 billion USD) in the 2022-2023 fiscal year, about 2.5% of the country’s total economy.
Many of the travelers who come to Australia head to the Great Barrier Reef, which at 133,000 square miles is about the size of California. It alone is responsible for about $6 billion AUD of the country’s total tourism revenue. An estimated 64,000 people have jobs that depend on reef tourism.
Guardian of the Reef addresses some of those environmental issues head on, acknowledging that climate change is the single biggest challenge to the Reef. However, Olsen believes that tourism is a pro, not a con.
“There’s so many things that consumers can do actively on the Great Barrier Reef, but we say the single most important thing you can do is see it. We know you’re going to fall in love with it, and you’re going to be a part of its conservation for the future,” says Olsen.
More and more destinations are asking – or, in some cases, requiring – travelers to follow certain environmental regulations during their visit.
One the most famous examples is the “Palau Pledge,” where the South Pacific nation asked all visitors to promise to the children of Palau, in writing, to “preserve and protect your beautiful island home.” The pledge is mandatory for visitors and those who break the rules can be fined. The pledge was launched in 2017."
LIEU1JDNB4_QYPITULH8NXWJWB,"Israel’s military says six hostages ‘brutally murdered’ in Gaza, including Israeli-American Goldberg-Polin","By Alex Stambaugh, Nectar Gan and Jeremy Diamond, CNN","8 minute read Updated 11:58 AM EDT, Sun September 1, 2024",20240901,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/08/31/middleeast/israeli-american-hostage-hersh-goldberg-polin-death-intl-hnk/,"Israel’s military said it has recovered the bodies of six hostages killed by Hamas militants in Gaza – including an Israeli-American captive – dealing fresh heartbreak to relatives who fear time is running out for loved ones seized by the militants more than 10 months ago.
Israeli soldiers found the six bodies in tunnels under the enclave, according to the military. The hostages were “brutally murdered by Hamas terrorists, a short while before we reached them,” Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said in a briefing Sunday.
The development has sparked protests across Israel, with fresh public anger directed at Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his cabinet for failing to secure a hostage deal. Israel’s largest trade union has also called for a nationwide strike starting Monday.
Three of the six whose bodies were recovered had been expected to be released during the first phase of an eventual ceasefire agreement, two Israeli officials have told CNN.
Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Eden Yerushalmi and Carmel Gat were slated to be released as part of a “humanitarian category,” based on a framework agreed by Israel and Hamas in early July, the officials said.
“Our prime minister delayed it,” one of the Israeli officials said. “It’s way too late for the six who have been killed, but it’s time to reach an agreement.”
The ordeal of California native Goldberg-Polin, who was taken at gunpoint at the Nova music festival on October 7, led to him becoming one of the faces of the devastating international hostage crisis that has challenged Netanyahu’s leadership and triggered widespread destruction in Gaza.
The parents of 23-year-old Goldberg-Polin have been among the most vocal of the hostage families pushing Netanyahu to seek a deal securing their relatives’ return. Their tireless and high-profile campaigning saw them meet with world leaders, and earlier this month, give an emotional address at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago.

“With broken hearts, the Goldberg-Polin family is devastated to announce the death of their beloved son and brother, Hersh. The family thanks you all for your love and support and asks for privacy at this time,” the family said in a statement Sunday.
The Israeli military named the other three victims as Almog Sarusi, Alex Lobanov and Ori Danino. CNN is reaching out to their families.
In a taped message Sunday, Netanyahu said he had been shocked to the core by what he said was “the terrible cold-blooded murder of six of our hostages.” He also stressed that “those who murder hostages do not want a deal.”
He said Israel would continue to pursue Hamas, and accused it of not wanting to conduct genuine negotiations since December.
“Three months ago, on May 27, Israel agreed to a hostage release deal with the full backing of the United States. Hamas refused. Even after the United States updated the outline of the deal on August 16 – we agreed, and Hamas again refused.”
He added that the Israeli government and he, personally, are “committed to continue working towards a deal that will bring back all our hostages and guarantee our security and existence.”
In response, the Hostages Families Forum, a volunteer-based organization that represents relatives of those held captive, criticized the Prime Minister, calling on him to “stop blaming everyone” and to “take responsibility” for his alleged failures.
“Take responsibility for the thwarting (of a deal). Take responsibility for the neglect. Take responsibility for the hostages who were murdered in captivity,” the Forum demanded in a statement.
The Forum also said Netanyahu had ignored the views of the security establishment in insisting on conditions in the negotiations.
“Hamas is not the only one responsible for the thwarting of the deal. We do not expect the terrorist (Hamas leader Yahya) Sinwar to want to return the hostages, we expect the Prime Minister of Israel to do everything, everything, everything in order to return the hostages home.”
The Forum has called for demonstrations across Israel, while also announcing a vigil honoring the “hostages murdered in Gaza by Hamas” in Tel Aviv at 6 p.m. local time (11 a.m. ET).
US President Joe Biden said the bodies of the hostages were recovered under the city of Rafah in southern Gaza.
“I am devastated and outraged,” Biden said in a statement released by the White House that also paid tribute to Goldberg-Polin’s parents.
“They have been courageous, wise, and steadfast, even as they have endured the unimaginable,” Biden said. “They have been relentless and irrepressible champions of their son and of all the hostages held in unconscionable conditions.”
Goldberg-Polin’s death in particular will reverberate not just in Israel but in US political circles.
His parents Rachel and Jonathan have regularly met top US officials in Washington to press the case of the hostages, and their emotional address to top Democrats at the convention earlier this month inextricably tied the hostages’ fate to US policy over the war in Gaza.
Rachel Goldberg-Polin told CNN in January that she wears a piece of tape marking each day that has passed since her son was kidnapped.
At her convention speech, she described life since October 7 as like living on “another planet.”
“Anyone who is a parent or has had a parent can try to imagine the anguish and misery that Jon and I and all the hostage families are enduring,” she told delegates.
Some of those discovered dead in the tunnels under Gaza this weekend were, like Goldberg-Polin, captured at the Nova music festival. Lobanov, a 32-year-old father of two, and Yerushalmi, 24, were both tending bar at the gathering, according to the Hostages Families Forum. Danino, 25, and Sarusi, 27, were also at the festival.
Gat, 40, was taken from Kibbutz Be’eri. She had been visiting her parents when Hamas militants stormed the community close to Gaza’s border, killing and taking hostages as they went.
News of more hostage deaths piles pressure on Netanyahu as anger inside Israel swells over the failure to strike a ceasefire deal, and as stark disagreements between the prime minister and his military leaders increasingly spill out into the open.
A number of protests sparked across Israel on Sunday, with demonstrators’ anger directed at the government’s handling of the crisis.
Protests have occurred or are ongoing in Tel Aviv, Ra’anana, Rehovot and Be’er Sheva. In several instances, protesters have blocked roads – demanding an immediate agreement to secure the remaining hostages’ release. The banner at one protest read: “Look them in the eyes.”
The chairman of Israel’s General Federation of Labor (Histadrut) Arnon Bar-David has also called for a nationwide general strike to begin on Monday at 6 a.m. local time, after holding a “charged and difficult” meeting with representatives of hostage families in Tel Aviv.
“I will not tolerate the neglect,” Bar-David stated, emphasizing the urgency of the situation of the hostages in Gaza. Histadrut is the country’s biggest labor union.
“We are in a downward spiral, and we don’t stop receiving body bags. Only a strike would shock, and that’s why I’ve decided that starting tomorrow at six in the morning, the entire Israeli economy will shut down,” the labor leader said.
The hostage deaths up the stakes for Biden to push US ally Israel to find a way out of a devastating war in Gaza that has inflamed global public opinion and repeatedly threatened to spiral into an all-out regional conflict.
“Make no mistake, Hamas leaders will pay for these crimes. And we will keep working around the clock for a deal to secure the release of the remaining hostages,” Biden said in his statement on Goldberg-Polin’s death.
Israeli President Isaac Herzog said “the heart of an entire nation is shattered to pieces” by the news of the six dead.
“On behalf of the State of Israel, I embrace their families with all my heart, and apologize for failing to bring them home safely,” Herzog said in a statement.
“We will continue to fight relentlessly against the criminal, terrorist organization Hamas, which has once again proven there is no end to its willingness to commit murder and crimes against humanity.”
Israel launched its war against Hamas in Gaza after the militant group’s October 7 cross-border attacks, in which more than 1,200 Israelis were killed and 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli authorities.
More than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the war began, according to the health ministry in the enclave.
Anger has been growing inside Israel, led by many hostage families who believe Netanyahu and key far-right cabinet colleagues have been stalling on achieving a ceasefire resolution with Hamas that might bring those captured and killed home.
Netanyahu has been adamant that a deal can only be signed when Israel’s safety is assured.
But domestic pressure is building,  with the Hostages Families Forum being among the most critical of the Israeli prime minister.
“The delay in signing the deal has led to their deaths and those of many other hostages,” the forum said in a statement in English on Sunday.
“We call to Netanyahu: Stop hiding. Provide the public with a justification for this ongoing abandonment,” the forum added.
Biden said Saturday evening that his staff has been in touch with Israeli officials. Biden also called for an end to the war, expressing optimism that an agreement could be reached on a ceasefire-for-hostages deal and adding that parties involved in the negotiation have said they “agree on the principles.”
“It’s time this war ended,” Biden added. “I think we’re on the verge of having an agreement. It’s time to end it. It’s time to finish it.”
The US, Qatar and Egypt, who have acted as mediators, this month renewed a push to reach a hostage and ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas.
The mediators have proposed a three-phase approach: a first phase involving a six-week ceasefire; a second phase that would release all hostages and a withdrawal of all IDF presence from Gaza; and a third reconstruction phase.

LL8D06AYKM_EH3OCW6RVE3Z0PV,This tourism experience costs $800 for an hour. Here’s why it’s worth it,"By Joe Minihane, CNN","8 minute read Updated 6:33 AM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/travel/uganda-gorillas-treks-sustainable-tourism/,"Editor’s Note: This CNN Travel series is, or was, sponsored by the country it highlights. CNN retains full editorial control over subject matter, reporting and frequency of the articles and videos within the sponsorship, in compliance with our policy
Kenya has the majestic Maasai Mara. The reputation of the verdant, fauna-filled Ngorongoro Crater in Tanzania precedes it. Rwanda’s Virunga volcanoes have become the go-to for once-in-a-lifetime encounters with mountain gorillas. And further south, Botswana, Namibia and South Africa are seen as essential stop-offs for those hungry to experience the best wildlife Africa has to offer.
Yet one country is easily forgotten when it comes to spending time in true wilderness and getting up close to nature: Uganda.
This East African gem has it all for the wildlife obsessive: the plains of Queen Elizabeth National Park, home to tree-climbing lions and leopards; the Kazinga Channel with its hippos, elephants, crocodiles and stunning fish eagles; and Bwindi Impenetrable Forest.
Quite simply, it’s underrated and waiting to be explored – especially one profound tourism experience that costs $800 an hour, but is said to be worth every single dollar.
That huge price tag is part of a pattern of big-budget experiences in Uganda that, although inaccessible to many wallets, could help set the country on the path to sustainable tourism at a time when many destinations are now being overwhelmed by visitors.
In Bwindi Impenetrable Forest, home to the largest mountain gorilla population in the world, with over 500 roaming the dense woodland, it costs $800 for foreign non-residents to head out on a strictly timed one-hour trek to meet a group of habituated gorillas. These are led by experts from the Uganda Wildlife Authority, with small groups of eight people assigned to visit one of 18 habituated groups each day.
For $1,500, visitors can take part in a habituation process. Those with a cold are not allowed to take part, such is the concern around passing on the disease to these incredible animals, which share 98% of their DNA with humans.
Although it’s possible to travel relatively cheaply on either side of this experience, many visitors make this bucket-list activity part of a premium adventure. Again, the high price tag usually results in money going to support the at-risk environment.
Volcanoes Safaris has been operating in the region for over 25 years and in July 2024 it opened its fourth luxury lodge in Uganda. Kibale Lodge sits in an unrivaled location, with the Rwenzori Mountains to the West and the Kazinga Channel to the south. With just eight rooms, or bandas, it’s at the very highest end of eco-tourism in Uganda, with rates starting at $1,200 per person per night. Volcanoes is, however, at pains to talk about how it leans on local knowledge and skills to create and sustain its business.
In Kibale it is working with the Jane Goodall Institute to organize community outreach programs, specifically working to build a new generation of women leaders in conservation. And throughout the construction of the lodge learning from local people was vital, says Volcanoes founder Praveen Moman.

“We work in ‘the barefoot villager’ style, sitting down together and working out practical local approaches to aesthetics, making everything locally, whatever the origin of the design,” he says.
“Volcanoes’ in-house construction team is comprised of engineers, fundis, decorators and upholsterers that live in the communities surrounding Volcanoes lodges,” adds Kevin James, Volcanoes Safaris’ chief operating officer.
For example, he says the company’s head of construction, Cyprien Serugero, was born near the Virunga Lodge across the border in Rwanda. He was involved at every stage of the construction of that lodge and now ensures that those living close to the sites in Uganda are able to enjoy the same opportunity.
James says that the company employs over 200 full-time and 300 casual staff from Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Some 85% of those who work at the lodges themselves are drawn from the communities which surround them.
While this work has been successful, one of the biggest issues surrounding sustainable tourism in Uganda centers on “conservation refugees.” The Batwa were forcibly removed from Gahinga and Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Parks on their creation in 1991. While gorilla populations in these areas rebounded, these hunter-gatherers, one of the oldest indigenous tribes in the entire continent, became displaced within their own country. No compensation was paid and years of ostracization followed. With the tribe unused to traditional farming methods, they have faced persecution and discrimination at every turn.
“We believe that the focus of conservation and tourism must be on communities,” says James.
“Local people will only be supporters of tourism and conservation if they receive a tangible benefit. They need to have food on the table, education for the next generation, and progress in their lives. If they are part of the ecotourism and conservation chain and share in its success, then they have an incentive to protect the wildlife and the parks.”

At Volcanoes’ Gahinga Lodge there is a 13-acre permanent Batwa settlement, home to 100 people from 18 families. There is land for crops, a dedicated vocational center for training and passing down ancient rites to the next generation and the opportunity for guests to meet elders and tribal leaders to learn directly about their way of life. It’s a powerful experience and one that lingers long in the mind after visiting.
“The forest is heavily guarded, we know we could be shot [if we go there],” said Batwa tribal leader Safari Monday, speaking his native Rufumbira dialect via an interpreter, back in 2019. “But I understand the restrictions. I don’t think about it.”
Monday spread his arms wide and grinned as he took in what was now his and that of his fellow tribespeople. A place to call home after four years living beneath makeshift shelters. It’s not the same as being in his native habitat, but does go some way to redress the balance and create a path towards a better future.
There is no denying that the model of highly priced, high-quality tourism has the potential to be successful when considered from a sustainability angle, at least when it comes to nature. It’s evident in the numbers of mountain gorillas in particular. According to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the population stood at over 1,000 in 2018 when the last census was conducted, up from 680 in 2008. This is believed to be a direct result of expensive, heavily policed gorilla treks.
While costly, the money raised from the treks allows the UWA and other authorities to pay for greater protection of mountain gorillas from illegal poachers and to prevent devastating habitat loss. Being just a few meters from a mother tending to her young or a silverback staring gruffly into the middle distance is unquestionably one of the most profound things a traveler can do and paying all that money makes a lot of sense.
While such costs may seem extreme, the alternative is something operators cannot entertain, especially when the environment is so fragile and the imperative of balancing the needs of local communities so vital.
According to UK-based operator Responsible Travel, charging high prices and guarding the experience so heavily is key.
“When it comes to the mountain gorillas, low tourist numbers and heavy restrictions are not simply a gimmick,” it says, “… they are essential to prevent the gorillas from becoming distressed or from catching diseases.”

Moreover, local people and the environment won’t see any benefit from a mass tourism model which has caused so many issues across the planet, particularly in famously fragile ecosystems such as Australia’s Great Barrier Reef and Vietnam’s Ha Long Bay.
“The great ape national parks of Uganda and Rwanda are tiny natural habitats under immense pressure,” says Kevin James. “There is increasing population pressure around the parks, which is predicted to double in the next 25 years. Local people need land to live on and from which to make a living. If development is not controlled around National Parks, wildlife could be overwhelmed.”
Despite this, he says, tourism, and especially sustainable tourism, has to be part of the solution.
“Volcanoes has seen that without tourism the animals have no value and therefore there’s no economic incentive to safeguard their future. Sensitive and controlled tourism is crucial. However, if tourism is uncontrolled, it risks putting undue pressure through disease and stress on the great apes which will not be conducive to their survival.
“It is imperative that the unique tourism protocols and IUCN best practices guidelines are followed to ensure a positive future for the great apes in the Albertine Rift. It is a very delicate balance.”
According to EU Africa Rise, a European Union-funded body that supports sustainability in East Africa, tourism accounted for 5.9% of Uganda’s GDP in 2019, with a growing awareness of the need for sustainable certification, something which can be expensive for start-ups and small operators.
“Although Uganda struggles internationally with its brand recognition and image (especially compared with regional peers such as Kenya and Tanzania), it does receive very high satisfaction ratings from travelers that visit the country,” according to EU Africa Rise, in a March 2024 report entitled “Towards a Sustainable Tourism economy in Uganda.”
Despite this, there is a growing push towards creating a high-quality experience for travelers in Uganda that is, crucially, both sustainable in terms of development and employment, and where local people are made to feel part of that work.
According to the Adventure Travel Trade Association’s Annual Industry Snapshot Report from June 2023, cited by EU Africa Rise, 68% of operators surveyed had obtained or were trying to gain sustainable certification globally. Yet the Global Sustainable Tourism Criteria, considered the sustainability gold standard for operators, alongside Travelife, a similar certification platform, are seen as too costly by tourism businesses in Uganda. EU Africa Rise says there needs to be a more cost-effective way for Ugandan businesses to gain such recognition, which would in turn allow them to market themselves as among the best in the world.
That Volcanoes, Responsible Travel and EU Africa Rise are doing such important work means that sustainable tourism can grow and even thrive in Uganda. But it needs to be based around a model where expensive trips that fund research and communities come first, all the better to stop these places being overwhelmed and potentially lost forever."
LM99ZHPBNT_S9PIQ8UTPUHNOBS,Russian trolling 2.0: How the Kremlin shifted tactics from its 2016 election strategy,"By Sean Lyngaas, CNN","4 minute read Updated 6:31 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/05/politics/russian-trolling-2-0-how-the-kremlin-shifted-tactics-from-its-2016-election-strategy/,"The recent US indictment of two employees of Russian state-run media network RT underscores a significant shift in the Kremlin’s tactics to influence US elections since 2016, current and former US officials told CNN.
Rather than relying on fake accounts and bogus online personas, the current effort alleged in this week’s indictment involves coopting real American influencers to try to push Russian narratives to US audiences, particularly aimed at undermining support for Ukraine.
The indictment alleges that the RT employees secretly poured nearly $10 million into a Tennessee company that hired prominent right-wing commentators who produced content on hot-button political issues, including Russia’s war on Ukraine. The influencers say they were unaware of any Russian hand in the operations of the media company, which CNN has identified as Tenet Media, and that they controlled their own content.
“Buying authentic influencers is a far better use of funds than creating fake personas, because they bring their own trusting audiences and are actually, you know, real,” Renee DiResta, an expert on online influence operations, said in a social media post.
With its US offices forced to shut down in 2022 following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, RT has resorted to more covert operations to disseminate its message, prosecutors allege.
That shift shows that Russia’s best bet for undermining US support for Ukraine may lie in capitalizing on influential American voices that bypass the mainstream media and are critical of aid to Kyiv, the sources said.
“The Russians have diversified well beyond the 2016 model,” said Chris Krebs, former head of the federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. “It’s unclear what the real impact is, at least from a tactical perspective. My sense is that they’re not successful in changing specific behaviors or decisions, like the outcome of a single election,” Krebs said. “However, it’s much more likely that the Russians’ efforts are burning on a longer fuse, and we don’t quite understand the real damage done just yet.”
The shift in Russian tactics also shows a keen understanding of a fractured media environment in the US. Where in 2016, Russian intelligence prioritized leaking hacked information in order to reach mainstream news outlets, they’re now tapping directly into a disparate corner of conservative media, where individual podcasters reach an audience that rivals that of traditional newspapers.
As a result, Russia no longer needs to orchestrate the kind of hack-and-leak operation it used to great effect in 2016, when Russian intelligence officers stole a trove of emails from Democratic officials and leaked them to Wikileaks.
Related article DOJ alleges Russia funded US media company linked to right-wing social media stars
The Russians thought that American media outlets would see Wikileaks as a relatively credible source of information, according to Michael van Landingham, a former CIA official who assessed the 2016 Russian activity.
“But now, in the absence of a current hack-and-leak campaign, Russia has reverted to the age-old tactic of supporting public voices that express views aligned with Russian messaging,” van Landingham said.
Artificial intelligence has also made it much easier for Russian (or any other) intelligence agencies to pose as Americans online with fake photos and bios.
“It’s night and day,” said Emerson Brooking, a resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab. Compared to 2016, this time, “Russian actors showed a far more sophisticated understanding of the US information environment,” Brooking said.
It’s also unclear how useful hack-and-leak operations would be in 2024. Journalists are more attuned to foreign influence efforts, and at least one known operation aimed at influencing this year’s election has had questionable impact.
Iran conducted its own hack-and-leak this summer, stealing documents from the Trump campaign and sending them to multiple major news outlets, as CNN previously reported. But there was little news coverage of the content of the stolen documents, partly because they were unremarkable.
The Justice Department also on Wednesday seized dozens of fake news sites that other Russian companies used to closely mimic the appearance of Fox News and the Washington Post. The Russian companies used ChatGPT, the popular AI tool, to write some of their content, according to an FBI affidavit.
Internal project documents from one of the Russian companies propose targeting US voters in six swing states with disinformation, hitting on themes such as the “risk of job loss for white Americans” and the purported threat of crime from “Ukrainian immigrants,” according to the affidavit.
“They obsessed over impact and set clear targets,” Brooking said.
But measuring the impact and efficacy of Russian influence efforts is difficult. The influencers hired by Tenet Media, including Benny Johnson and Tim Pool, say they were victims of the alleged Russian scheme. They had millions of followers to whom they’ve been broadcasting their views long before, according to the indictment, RT employees invested in Tenet Media.
“I’m skeptical that this operation would have resulted in preaching to anyone who wasn’t already converted,” Gavin Wilde, a former National Security Council official focused on Russia, told CNN.
“It’s mostly a grift cycle,” said Jason Kikta, a former US Cyber Command official now with security firm Automox. “The Russian money lets them expand operations within the ideologically aligned population to further grift, while the Russians can claim fanciful success within their government for budget and career promotion.”"

The pleading came in a Tuesday court filing, which also indicated he wished to be excused from appearing in person at an upcoming court hearing in the case.

“I, President Donald J. Trump, the above-named defendant … do hereby waive my right to be present at Arraignment and I authorize my attorneys to enter a plea of not guilty on my behalf to each and every count of the superseding indictment,” Trump told the court in a one-page filing that included his bold, black signature. “I further state that I have received a copy of the superseding indictment and reviewed it with my counsel.”
Thursday will mark the first court hearing before Judge Tanya Chutkan since the case was paused for the US Supreme Court to determine the extent of presidential immunity to which Trump is entitled.
Chutkan said later Tuesday that Trump does not have to appear at the hearing Thursday – when the former president’s formal arraignment will occur.
Trump’s attorneys plan to attend the hearing.
Chutkan, of the DC District Court, will have to decide how to proceed with the criminal case over efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, including setting a schedule. She must also decide whether prosecutors can take Trump to trial and be able to call certain witnesses, such as former Vice President Mike Pence.
The new indictment, approved by a grand jury last week, requires Trump to enter a new pleading. While prosecutors cut back some of the allegations against the former president in light of the Supreme Court ruling, Trump faces the same four criminal charges as before.

LR0Q8E7AQY_X4Q6BQ1WBDIDP13,Exclusive: US seizes Venezuela President Nicolas Maduro’s airplane in the Dominican Republic,"By Priscilla Alvarez and Abel Alvarado, CNN","6 minute read Updated 12:34 AM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240902,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/02/politics/us-seizes-venezuela-president-maduros-airplane/,"The United States has seized Venezuela President Nicolas Maduro’s airplane after determining that its acquisition was in violation of US sanctions, among other criminal issues. The US flew the aircraft to Florida on Monday, according to two US officials.
It’s the latest development in what has long been a frosty relationship between the US and Venezuela, and its seizure in the Dominican Republic marks an escalation as the US continues to investigate what it regards as corrupt practices by Venezuela’s government.
“This sends a message all the way up to the top,” one of the US officials told CNN. “Seizing the foreign head of state’s plane is unheard-of for criminal matters. We’re sending a clear message here that no one is above the law, no one is above the reach of US sanctions.”
The plane has been described by officials as Venezuela’s equivalent to Air Force One and it  has been pictured in previous state visits by Maduro around the world.
The Dominican Republic’s President Luis Abinader said the plane seized by the US on Monday was not registered under the name of the Venezuelan government, but rather under “the name of an individual.”
Foreign Minister of the Dominican Republic Roberto Álvarez said the country’s Attorney General’s Office received an order last May from a national court to “immobilize” the plane. The US had requested it be immobilized so they could search it for “evidence and objects linked to fraud activities, smuggling of goods for illicit activities and money laundering,” he said.
In a statement, US Attorney General Merrick Garland said that “the Justice Department seized an aircraft we allege was illegally purchased for $13 million through a shell company and smuggled out of the United States for use by Nicolás Maduro and his cronies.”
The plane, a Dassault Falcon 900EX, was purchased from a company in Florida, the Justice Department said, and was illegally exported in April 2023 from the United States to Venezuela through the Caribbean. It was used for Maduro’s international travels, and flew “almost exclusively to and from a military base in Venezuela,” according to the Justice Department.
Records show that the plane’s last registered flight was in March, flying from Caracas to the Dominican capital of Santo Domingo.
A second plane linked to Maduro’s regime is under 24-hour surveillance by authorities in the Dominican Republic, a source with knowledge of the matter told CNN.
The source did not specify details about the plane’s model, make or whether the aircraft had been requested to be immobilized.
The Venezuelan government described the Falcon’s seizure as “piracy” in a statement on Monday, and accused Washington of escalating “aggression” toward Maduro’s government following a contested presidential election this July.
“Once again, the authorities of the USA, in a recurring criminal practice that could not be labeled anything but piracy, have illegally seized an aircraft that has been used by the president of the Republic, justifying its action in coercive measures that, illegally and unilaterally, they impose around the world,” it said.
“The United States has already demonstrated that it uses its economic and military power to intimidate and pressure states such as the Dominican Republic to serve as accomplices in its criminal acts. This is an example of the supposed ‘rules-based order’, which, disregarding international law, seeks to establish the law of the strongest,” it said.
For years, US officials have sought to disrupt the flow of billions of dollars to the regime. Homeland Security Investigations — the second largest investigative agency in the federal government — has seized dozens of luxury vehicles, among other assets, heading to Venezuela.
“The plane was seized in violation of US sanctions with Venezuela and other criminal matters that we’re still looking at regarding this aircraft,” Anthony Salisbury,Special Agent in Charge, Homeland Security Investigations told CNN.
A high-ranking official from the Dominican Republic told CNN that Maduro’s aircraft had been in Dominican territory undergoing maintenance at the time it was seized by US authorities. The source added that the government had no record that Maduro’s private plane was in the country until it was seized.
US officials worked closely with the Dominican Republic, which notified Venezuela of the seizure, according to one of the US officials.

Multiple federal agencies were involved in the seizure, including Homeland Security Investigations; Commerce agents, the Bureau of Industry and Security; and the Justice Department.
The Dominican Republic’s Foreign Minister said the government did not participate in the US’ investigation and only “international legal cooperation” was required under the two countries’ bilateral agreements.
One of the next steps, upon arriving to the US, will be pursuing forfeiture, meaning the Venezuelan government has a chance to petition for it, and collecting evidence from the aircraft.
The US recently placed pressure on the Venezuelan government to “immediately” release specific data regarding its presidential election, citing concerns about the credibility of Maduro’s claimed victory.
Venezuela’s opposition has published more than 80% of tallies printed and collected from voting machines across the country. Though partial, the documentation appears to show that the opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia actually won the vote, several experts told CNN.
The situation in Venezuela has had implications for US politics as millions flee the country, many of whom have chosen to migrate to the US-Mexico border.
Earlier this year, the US reimposed sanctions on Venezuela’s oil and gas sector in response to the Maduro government’s failure to allow “an inclusive and competitive election” to take place.
After the controversial reelection of Maduro on July 28, Venezuela suspended commercial flights to and from the Dominican Republic.
Federal agencies, including HSI, have long been going after the Venezuelan government over corruption concerns. Over recent years, HSI has disrupted $2 billion worth of the Venezuelan government’s illicit proceeds or resources, including judgements, seizures, liquidation of bank accounts, according to one of the US officials.
In March 2020, the US Department of Justice charged Maduro, together with 14 current and former Venezuelan officials, with narco-terrorism, drug trafficking and corruption.
“For more than 20 years, Maduro and a number of high-ranking colleagues allegedly conspired with (Colombian left-wing guerrilla group) the FARC, causing tons of cocaine to enter and devastate American communities.,” then-Attorney General William Barr said at the time.
The State Department’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs has offered a reward of up to $15 million for information leading to Maduro’s arrest or conviction.
In 2017, two nephews of Maduro’s wife Cilia Flores were sentenced to 18 years in prison by a federal court in New York City for trying to smuggle up to 800 kilograms of cocaine into the United States on a private jet; the two were later released by the United States in a prisoners’ exchange in 2022.
“We see these officials and the Maduro regime basically fleecing the Venezuelan people for their own gain,” the US official said. “You have people who can’t even afford a loaf of bread there and then you have the president of Venezuela jetting around in a high-class private jet.”
Poor economic conditions, food shortages and limited access to health care have pushed more than 7.7 million people to flee Venezuela, marking the largest displacement in the Western Hemisphere.

Delegations from dozens of African countries are gathering in Beijing for a three-day summit set to see China showcase itself as a lead partner for the continent, despite slowing lending for its development – and as it faces rising frictions with the West.
A procession of African leaders have arrived in the Chinese capital in recent days, greeted at the airport by honor guards and dance troupes with images flashed across state media, while Chinese officials have touted the gathering as the largest diplomatic event they’ve hosted in recent years.
The fanfare comes as Chinese leader Xi Jinping has much to signal to his visiting counterparts, and the world, as the summit gets underway Wednesday.
It is the first such gathering between Chinese and African leaders in the capital since 2018 and arrives at a critical juncture in ties between Beijing and a continent that’s home to its only overseas military base and where it has been the driving economic foreign power.
In recent decades, free flowing Chinese funding has driven the construction of highways, rail lines and power plants across Africa. The financing has filled funding gaps and expanded China’s political influence, but also generated criticism it was saddling countries with unsustainable debt.
Now, in the face of these concerns and its own economic slowdown, Xi and his officials will be likely pitching a new tune – what they posit as sustainable “small yet beautiful” investments and more collaboration on the green technologies in which China leads the world in producing.
This week will be Beijing’s most high-profile chance to telegraph that vision, as it seeks to point the direction forward for ties with a continent whose political backing is only growing more important amid Beijing’s rising frictions with Washington – and for Xi’s aim to position China as a champion of the Global South and alternative leader to the US.
How these changes play out for African leaders remains another question. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa bluntly called on China to “narrow the trade deficit and address the structure of our trade” during a bilateral meeting with Xi on Monday.
A number of leaders attending the three-yearly Forum on China and Africa Cooperation are from countries grappling with heavy international debt, including from Chinese loans, and seek more investment and trade to boost their economies.
They will likely probe whether a 2021 pledge from Xi to import products worth $300 billion from Africa by next year will be achieved. They’re also likely to press for ways to ensure growing trade is not merely an exchange of African raw materials for Chinese manufactured goods.
“Critical questions are going to be asked –  and so African countries and their Chinese partners are going to be hard pressed to provide answers,” said Paul Nantulya, a senior China specialist at the Africa Center for Strategic Studies in Washington.
When it comes to investment, even before the pandemic, China had already been reducing funding for the big-scale infrastructure projects that saw the world’s second largest economy become Africa’s largest bilateral creditor over recent decades.
Chinese lending to African government or state-linked borrowers cratered during the pandemic, reaching a low of roughly $1 billion in 2022, according to Boston University’s Global Development Policy Center. The data showed a modest recovery to $4.6 billion in 2023, a far cry from a peak of more than $28.8 billion in 2016.
Some African leaders holding talks in Beijing are facing steep challenges repaying debt from China and other lenders.
Kenya, whose president, William Ruto, is in Beijing this week, was rocked by protests earlier this summer over a finance bill introduced by the government to rein in public debt. That debt includes nearly $6 billion owed to China and more than $20 billion payable to multilateral banks, according to an April government statement.
Analysts say China is not the main cause of African debt distress in most cases, making up a comparatively small portion of the continent’s overall public debt. But the influx of Chinese loans increased the debt burden, and observers suggest China has moved too slowly or been inflexible in cases when it comes to helping countries that are heavily indebted to it get relief.
Beijing has defended its lending practices and its efforts to ease debt repayment but is unlikely to make debt relief a major theme of the multilateral summit, where it will focus on trade measures and promoting what it says is a shift to “small yet beautiful” investments.
The term, referring to projects with smaller budgets and environmental or social impact, has emerged as a key buzzword as Xi’s flagship Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). That’s as the infrastructure drive for the developing world transitions to a new phase following a decade of growth – that saw some projects slammed for environmental costs or poor labor standards and others stalled.
“There will be fewer projects but a greater spotlight on them. In an ironic way, I think this will lead to a more sustainable path,” said Bhaso Ndzendze, an associate professor of politics and international relations at the University of Johannesburg in South Africa.
But “the African side is keen to accept almost anything that China has to offer,” he continued, pointing to limited alternative avenues of support.
Beijing is also expected to push to make Africa’s market a destination for its prolific production of green tech like solar panels and electric vehicles.
The move may be welcomed by African nations grappling with power shortages and climate threat, but also comes as such Chinese goods face hefty tariffs in the US, Europe and Canada, as those markets move to block what they see as a flood of unfairly subsidized products.
Past gatherings of the twenty-four-year-old forum have included big promises of financing and boosting bilateral trade. Beijing will now be keenly aware that its commitments face competition.
In recent years, the US and its European partners have launched their own efforts to fund infrastructure in Africa, widely seen to be driven by their concern over China’s expansive footprint in the region – and its access to African critical minerals key for the fabrication of green tech.

“Now (China) has competition on the street … so that also might trigger them to keep the momentum going on infrastructure, because they don’t want to cede that space to the US,” said Ammar A. Malik, a faculty affiliate in public policy at William & Mary, who monitors China’s overseas spending.
Xi is also expected to use the gathering to project to the rest of the world the idea of solidarity between China’s view on the world and that of countries across Africa – a sign to Washington that despite pressure from the US and its allies, Beijing has numerous friends.
Visiting leaders are likely to continue to endorse Xi’s cornerstone rhetoric around building a global “community with a shared future,” a vision he sees as unlike the one that’s been unfairly dominated by the West. Attendees could also express a unified opinion on global issues like the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.
The forum has, in recent years, expanded beyond economic cooperation into areas like peace and security, alongside China’s own growing security interests in the region, where its companies’ sprawling mining operations have been subject to criminal attacks.
“China-Africa relations is going back to the basics in the sense that it started as a political relationship,” said Ovigwe Eguegu, a Nigeria-based policy analyst at the consultancy Development Reimagined.
Eguegu pointed to current Chinese Communist Party-funded initiatives to fund training for African political parties as well as African port calls from the People’s Liberation Army navy and joint military drills as part of a “ramping up of engagement in the political-security dimension.”
“China is preparing its diplomatic relationships across the world at a time of increasing geopolitical tensions,” he said."

The idea has re-entered the American political dialogue in the wake of a resurfaced clip of now-Republican vice-presidential candidate JD Vance criticizing some prominent Democrats as “childless cat ladies.”
Vance, who converted to Catholicism in 2019 and has written about his journey to joining the Catholic Church, also sent a series of emails that called Democratic leaders “childless sociopaths” who “don’t have a direct stake in this country.”
Pope Francis, 87, who is in Indonesia, the world’s most populous Muslim country, made his remarks to political leaders as part of a 12-day tour of Southeast Asia and the Pacific. He said, “You’re an example for everyone, for all the countries that maybe, and this might sound funny, these families prefer to have a cat or a little dog instead of a child.”
President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo laughed at the remark with Francis turning to him and saying, “it’s true, isn’t it?”
Francis has in the past criticized couples who choose to have pets rather than children, saying this “takes away our humanity.”
He has lamented low birth rates in Europe, particularly on his doorstep in Italy, and has backed plans by three government led by Giorgia Meloni to reverse the trend.
While US President Donald Trump’s running mate and Francis may agree on the importance of having children, the pope’s approach is at odds with Trumpism when it comes to migrants and climate change.
In 2016, Francis described then presidential candidate Trump’s plan to build a wall to stop migrants the US-Mexico border as “not Christian.”"
M1AEO0F15Q_9YMUVVK5O5JY3ZN,New York Times publisher sounds the alarm on Trump employing authoritarian anti-press ‘playbook’,"By Liam Reilly and Brian Stelter, CNN","3 minute read Published 2:20 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/05/media/new-york-times-a-g-sulzberger-authoritarian-playbook-trump/,"A.G. Sulzberger, the New York Times publisher, sounded the alarm Thursday on the “quiet war” against press freedoms unleashed by authoritarians around the world and said Americans should understand the anti-media “playbook” that Donald Trump might employ in a second term.
In an op-ed published by one of the Times’ main rivals, The Washington Post, Sulzberger warned that Trump and his allies have repeatedly threatened the press and said he wanted the Times “to ensure we are prepared for whatever is to come.”
“My colleagues and I have spent months studying how press freedom has been attacked in Hungary — as well as in other democracies such as India and Brazil,” he wrote.
The techniques include “sowing public distrust in independent journalism and normalizing the harassment” of journalists to create a “climate hospitable to crackdowns on the media;” using government authorities, like taxation, “to punish offending journalists and news organizations” while rewarding “those who demonstrate fealty to their leadership;” and filing meritless lawsuits and exploiting the courts to make it more costly to report the news.

“The effectiveness of this playbook should not be underestimated,” Sulzberger wrote.
The Times publisher said he didn’t wish to wade into politics, but Trump’s anti-press words and actions – declaring media outlets the “enemy of the people” and suggesting the use of government to quash dissent – must be taken seriously.
“I believe the risk is shared by our entire profession, as well as all who depend on it,” he wrote.
In championing the need for trustworthy news and information, Sulzberger called on his peers to bolster protections, which includes teaching staffers how to protect themselves and their sources, preparing for legal fights and harassment, and pushing back against campaigns that seek to unjustly undermine trust in news media.
Sulzberger occasionally writes essays to prompt journalism industry dialogue about key issues. Last year, he wrote for the Columbia Journalism Review about the debate around objectivity in journalism. This year, with Trump’s anti-media rhetoric again front and center, he wanted to write about what an escalating campaign against the American press could look like.
Sulzberger approached it as a summer project of sorts.
“To ensure we are prepared for whatever is to come, my colleagues and I have spent months studying how press freedom has been attacked in Hungary — as well as in other democracies such as India and Brazil,” he wrote in the essay. “The political and media environments in each country are different, and the campaigns have seen varying tactics and levels of success, but the pattern of anti-press action reveals common threads.”
Sulzberger thought extensively about the best way to publish the essay — whether in the pages of The Times or elsewhere. He wound up placing it with the Post, an unorthodox move given the long history of competition between the two publications. The collaboration makes a clear statement about the importance of solidarity in the face of existential threats to press freedom.
“I’m grateful to The Post for running the piece, especially given the length (and the suspect institutional affiliations of its author,” he wrote in an email to associates on Thursday. “They’ve been a great partner on the cause of press freedom over many decades and it’s great to see that tradition continue.”"
M2PBJ6YLF5_VSL0VUXAAUDSK4E,Arlington cemetery controversy deepens as Trump and Harris trade attacks,"By Samantha Waldenberg, Kate Sullivan and Shania Shelton, CNN","4 minute read Updated 10:31 PM EDT, Sat August 31, 2024",20240901,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/08/31/politics/harris-slams-trump-arlington-national-cemetery/,"Donald Trump on Saturday continued to defend his visit this week to Arlington National Cemetery amid mounting criticism, including from Vice President Kamala Harris, who said the former president “is unable to comprehend anything other than service to himself.”
Veterans, service members and their families “should be honored, never disparaged, and treated with nothing less than our highest respect and gratitude,” Harris wrote Saturday in a lengthy post on social media. “And it is my belief that someone who cannot meet this simple, sacred duty should never again stand behind the seal of the President of the United States of America.”
Trump has faced controversy over his Monday visit to the cemetery after a wreath-laying ceremony to honor the 13 US service members who were killed in the Kabul airport bombing in 2021. Trump was rebuked by the Army over his campaign’s use of video and images from the visit, which critics say ran afoul of rules prohibiting political activity on the sacred grounds. The Army has said participants in the ceremony “were made aware of federal laws” regarding political activity and an employee of the cemetery who “attempted to ensure adherence to these rules was abruptly pushed aside.”

After Harris’ statement, the former president highlighted the support of parents of service members killed in the airport bombing. In videos posted to Truth Social, the parents praised Trump while condemning Harris and President Joe Biden.
Jaclyn Schmitz, mother of Lance Cpl. Jared Schmitz, said in her video, “Kamala, your statement is nothing more than a political spin to help you look better in your presidential campaign against Donald Trump. You have never walked a single day in our shoes. Our kids were murdered because of your administration, and you are partly to blame.”
Similarly, Coral Doolittle, mother of Cpl. Humberto A. Sanchez, slammed Harris and Biden as the people responsible for “murdering our kids.”
“They called the withdrawal in Afghanistan a success, and for us, it was just sadness and a disgrace,” Doolittle added.
Darin Hoover, father of Staff Sgt. Taylor Hoover, said in another video that “the events that happened on August 26, 2024, with President Trump at Arlington National Cemetery were solemn and in keeping with the reverence and respect that is given to all members of our military that are buried there.”
Hoover said while at the cemetery, “We asked the Trump team to take the videos, take the pictures, of our time there.”
Saturday’s statement marks the first time the vice president has directly addressed the controversy as she attempts to draw a contrast between herself and her rival ahead of their September 10 debate. Michael Tyler, the Harris campaign’s communications director, previously called the incident “pretty sad” in an interview on CNN but said it is what people have “come to expect from Donald Trump and his team.”
The Trump campaign on Saturday also sent out a statement from Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton, an Army veteran and Trump ally, defending the former president and attacking Army Secretary Christine Wormuth.
Cotton, who was not present during Trump’s trip to the cemetery, said that “neither the families nor President Trump violated cemetery regulations or policies” and claimed the “political apparatchiks working for the incompetent secretary of the Army disrespected the wishes of these Gold Star families.”

Accounts of the incident on Monday have varied. Trump campaign officials have said an individual physically blocked the former president’s team from accompanying him during the visit, and a cemetery spokesperson confirmed to CNN “there was an incident” and a “report was filed.”
The campaign has insisted there were no violations of the law, while cemetery officials have said Trump’s team was told ahead of time to avoid political activity. Federal law prohibits political campaigning or election-related activities within Army National Military Cemeteries, according to a statement from Arlington National Cemetery obtained by CNN.
A video of the visit posted by the Trump campaign on TikTok earlier this week showed the former president walking through Arlington and visiting grave sites, with audio of him criticizing the Biden administration’s management of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan.
NPR first reported there had been a “verbal and physical altercation” during the cemetery visit. A source with knowledge of the incident told the outlet that a cemetery official attempted to prevent Trump’s team from photographing and filming in the area where recent US casualties are buried. In response, Trump campaign staff “verbally abused and pushed the official aside,” according to NPR.
An Army spokesperson said while the incident was reported to the police department at Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall, the employee in question “decided not to press charges” so the Army “considers this matter closed.”

M7BD4NQWFL_ANP7UO4RKIITE09,Supreme Court sides with Biden in fight over abortion referrals in Oklahoma,"By John Fritze and Tierney Sneed, CNN","4 minute read Published 7:22 PM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/03/politics/supreme-court-abortion-referrals-oklahoma/,"The Supreme Court on Tuesday backed a Biden administration plan to redistribute $4.5 million in public health funding that had been earmarked for Oklahoma because the state bars clinics from giving out a hotline number that patients can use to access information about abortion.
Conservative Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch said they would have sided with the state.
Though the emergency appeal was focused mainly on the federal government’s power to set terms and requirements on federal grants, it was also the latest case to reach the court stemming from its 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. Earlier this year, the court declined to block efforts by the Food and Drug Administration to ease access to the abortion pill mifepristone and temporarily permitted abortions in medical emergencies in Idaho.
Oklahoma is one of several states challenging a US Department of Health and Human Services rule that requires clinics receiving federal family planning funds to offer pregnant patients counseling about their options, including abortion, if requested. After losing in a federal appeals court, Oklahoma filed its emergency request at the Supreme Court in early August, seeking to protect its share of that funding despite the rule.

The counseling rule isn’t new to the Biden administration. Democratic and Republican presidents have gone back and forth for years on whether to condition federal family planning funding on a requirement that such information is provided to patients.
What is new, however, is the Supreme Court’s divisive 2022 ruling overturning Roe, the 1973 decision that established a constitutional right to abortion. That decision led to a series of strict laws banning or severely limiting access to the procedure in red states. After the Supreme Court’s ruling in that case, Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, a law took effect in Oklahoma that made “advising or procuring” an abortion a felony.
The federal rule “foists upon Oklahoma a requirement concerning an issue that has been recognized as specifically reserved to the people to address in Dobbs,” the state told the Supreme Court.
The Justice Department had countered that Congress routinely allows federal agencies to set conditions for federal grants.
“Oklahoma’s radical reimagining of the spending clause would invalidate a host of regulatory conditions that have long governed federal spending,” the Biden administration told the Supreme Court. That outcome, the government warned, could fundamentally change programs from “Medicare to infrastructure funding.”
Oklahoma based its argument in part on a provision Congress has included in annual appropriations bills for years, known as the Weldon Amendment, that prohibits the HHS from requiring health care entities to provide or refer for abortions. The Biden administration countered that Oklahoma’s health department isn’t covered by that provision, which is named after a Republican former congressman from Florida.
The 10th US Circuit Court of Appeals previously declined to issue an order blocking the Biden administration from denying the grants. The 2-1 panel concluded that federal health officials had the authority to implement the requirement. The court also reasoned that providing the national hotline number did not amount to a referral under the Weldon Amendment.
The Justice Department made that very argument: Providing the hotline number is not the same thing as a referral.
A clinic “could have responded to a patient’s request for information about abortion by saying: ‘We cannot discuss abortion with you or direct you to an abortion provider, but you may call this hotline for nondirective information about your options,’” the government told the court in its brief.
“That statement is not a referral for abortion” within the meaning of federal law, the administration wrote.
Another appeals court, the 6th US Circuit Court of Appeals, sided with the Biden administration late last month in a similar case filed by Tennessee. The court, on a 2-1 vote, found that Tennessee “knowingly and voluntarily accepted the grant’s terms.”
State officials across the country distribute the federal funding at issue to public health services and county health departments.
Oklahoma had asked the justices to act by August 30. After that date, the federal government had said it would distribute Oklahoma’s grant to others."

Authorities were first alerted to the crew’s crisis around 1 p.m. on Monday, when they deployed a distress beacon, but it was hours before the first rescue helicopters located the vessel.
The 20-meter yacht, the Spirit of Mateship, had lost power and communications and was being hit by winds of up to 90 kilometers an hour (56 mph) as well as waves up to six meters high.
“(The helicopter’s crew) were able to fly above the yacht, and they could communicate via radio to the yacht, but they were unable to pick them up,” said Ben Flight, duty manager at the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Response Center.
Another rescue attempt was later abandoned due to rough seas, forcing the two people – named by New South Wales police as Brett, 60, and Lisa, 48 – to spend what Flight described as a “horrible” night at sea.
“They weren’t injured, but the vessel had suffered a mechanical issue of some kind, and they couldn’t steer, and they couldn’t make their own way through the water, so they were drifting, and they were taking on water as well. So, they were in quite a serious situation,” said Flight.
“They were sort of just at the mercy of the elements. They would have been moving around quite uncomfortably. It would have been particularly windy, noisy, probably quite wet as well.”
Two Australian Navy ships – HMAS Arunta and HMAS Canberra – answered calls for help, as well as Royal Australian Air Force C-130J Hercules aircraft, according to the Australian Defence Force (ADF).
The ships, along with a nearby merchant vessel, monitored the yacht’s location overnight, and the rescue resumed in the early hours of the morning, when conditions had eased.
NSW Police vessel Nemesis arrived at the yacht about 3 a.m. Tuesday and deployed a smaller boat to rescue the sailors around 7:30 a.m. in choppy seas with swells of four meters to five meters.
The couple returned to shore on the Nemesis on Tuesday evening, telling reporters in Sydney that they were “glad to be back.”
“The boat is more than seaworthy. It’s just mainly we were tired and seasick and couldn’t continue any further,” said Brett.
Flight said the outcome would have been much worse if the crew hadn’t deployed the distress beacon, which issues a satellite alert to advise the rescue coordination center of their location.
The Spirit of Mateship has competed in the prestigious Sydney to Hobart yacht race several times, crewed by wounded veterans and army personnel.
Together they raised money to support army veterans. However, the yacht has changed hands since then, according to Flight."
MB94VSLZHH_IK7NL3O69WEYSDA,Members of Turkish national youth organization in custody after assault on US Marines,"By Oren Liebermann, Gul Tuysuz and Avery Schmitz, CNN","3 minute read Updated 10:55 AM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240903,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/02/politics/us-marines-turkey-assault/,"More than a dozen members of a Turkish national youth organization were taken into custody in Turkey after local authorities say they assaulted two US Marines.
The Marines, assigned to the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit, were on liberty in Izmir when the assault occurred Monday afternoon, the US Sixth Fleet said in a statement.
The Marines were assaulted by members of the Turkish Youth Union, according to local authorities, a nationalist anti-American organization that has attacked US service members before.
Video of the assault confirmed by a US official shows several people holding the Marines by force as a speaker on the street screams loudly. One of the Marines shouts “Help!” several times, while the crowd puts a bag over the head of another Marine. The crowd then starts chanting, “Yankee, go home!”
The Marines were able to break away from the crowd with the help of other Marines in the area, the Navy said. They were screened at a local hospital and are not injured. The Marines have returned to the USS Wasp.
The US and Turkey are NATO allies, but relations between the two have often been fraught. Since the start of the war in Gaza, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has vociferously criticized Israel, accusing the country of carrying out a genocide. In April, Erdogan hosted Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Istanbul. Turkey also blocked Sweden’s ascension to NATO, claiming that Sweden harbored Kurdish terror groups. Erdogan relented when the US moved forward with plans to sell Turkey modern American fighter jets.
Local Izmir police and the Naval Criminal Investigative Service are investigating the incident, the Navy said. No Marines were detained, and those involved in the incident are cooperating with investigators.
“We can confirm reports that U.S. service members embarked aboard the USS Wasp were the victims of an assault in Izmir today, and are now safe,” the US Embassy in Turkey said on social media. “We thank Turkish authorities for their rapid response and ongoing investigation.”
Izmir Governorship said in a statement that local police intervened in the incident and that 15 suspects were taken into custody.
It’s not the first time the Turkish Youth Union has attacked US service members. In 2021, authorities in Turkey arrested 17 members of the group for putting a hood over the head of a US Navy civilian employee, Reuters reported at the time. Their actions were in protest of US policy in the Middle East.
In a similar incident in 2014, members of the organization attacked three US sailors on leave from their ship in Istanbul, placing bags over their heads. The assailants chanted “Yankee, go home!” during the attack.
For the Turkish Youth Union, placing bags over the heads of US service members is a reference to an infamous incident in 2003 known as the “hood incident.” Shortly after the invasion of Iraq, US troops captured Turkish soldiers and placed bags over their heads, detaining them for 60 hours.
The 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit is part of the USS Wasp Amphibious Ready Group, which is operating in the eastern Mediterranean Sea amid concerns of a regional escalation. The USS Wasp had pulled into Izmir one day earlier, and the Marines were allowed to leave the ship for a break.

A “remarkable” Pictish ring with “an intricate setting” was discovered in Scotland by an amateur archaeologist after being buried for more than 1,000 years.
The “kite-shaped ring with a garnet or red glass center” was unearthed by a volunteer at the site of a fort in Burghead, in northeast Scotland, according to the University of Aberdeen, which led the dig.
John Ralph, a former engineer and graduate of the university, signed up as a volunteer for the Burghead digs after retiring.
Ralph, whom the university said describes himself as an “enthusiastic amateur,” had many moments over the two-week excavation when experts told him “he had a knack for finding ‘shiny pebbles.’” It was his third dig at the site.
“So when, on the last day of the final dig, he found something that looked interesting, he didn’t hold out much hope. It was only when he showed it to a fellow volunteer and his eyes lit up that he realized he might ‘have something,’” the university said in a statement Wednesday.
The Professor of Archaeology who led the excavation, Gordon Noble, said what Ralph presented to him was “truly remarkable.”
“John was digging and then came over and said ‘look what I’ve found,’” Noble said, according to the statement. “Even before the conservation work we could see it was something really exciting as despite more than a thousand years in the ground we could see glints of the possible garnet setting.”
The Picts were an ancient people who lived in what is now eastern and northeastern Scotland. Little is known about them, and “only limited and contentious documentary sources survive to evidence their six centuries of life,” according to the University of Aberdeen’s website. All traces of the Picts disappeared from the written records in the 9th century CE, it said.
Noble explained that there are “very few Pictish rings which have ever been discovered and those we do know about usually come from hoards which were placed in the ground deliberately for safekeeping in some way.”

“We certainly weren’t expecting to find something like this lying around the floor of what was once a house but that had appeared of low significance so, in typical fashion, we had left work on it until the final day of the dig,” Noble said.
The ring is undergoing analysis at the National Museum of Scotland’s Post-excavation Service, the university said.
Ralph, who grew up in Burghead, said he was thrilled to have helped understand the region’s Pictish past. “It is a real thrill to dig up an artefact in the knowledge that you are probably the first person to see it for 1,000-1,500 years,” he said. “It becomes a real guessing game of who owned it, what did they use it for and how was it lost.”
Susan O’Connor, Head of Grants at Historic Environment Scotland, said Ralph “played such a pivotal role in bringing it to light - literally!”
While the materials used to make the rink “are not particularly valuable in today’s monetary sense, this find is hugely significant for what it tells us about Pictish lives and society,” O’Connor said. “We’re excited to find out more once our colleagues in the National Museum have finished their investigations.”"

“The Committee is holding this hearing because the Department of State was central to the Afghanistan withdrawal and served as the senior authority during the August non-combatant evacuation operation (NEO),” Republican Chairman Michael McCaul wrote of the hearing set for September 19.
In his letter, McCaul said Blinken had refused previous requests to appear before the committee.
The State Department said in a statement Wednesday that Blinken is unavailable to testify “on the dates proposed by the committee” and that they have proposed alternatives.
“It is disappointing that instead of continuing to engage with the department in good faith, the committee instead has issued yet another unnecessary subpoena,” Matthew Miller, a spokesman for the State Department, said in a statement.
McCaul has repeatedly called for accountability from the Biden administration on how the withdrawal from Afghanistan played out. He has slammed the administration for the Abbey Gate bombing that killed 13 US service members in the final chaotic days of the withdrawal.
McCaul is set to release on September 9 his committee’s report detailing the findings of its three-year investigation into the withdrawal from Afghanistan.
McCaul, in a statement, said the report “will serve as an indictment on the administration’s reckless refusal to properly prepare for the withdrawal, their cold indifference to the safety and security of U.S. personnel on the ground before and during the emergency evacuation, and their culpability in the deaths of 13 U.S. servicemembers who perished in the terrorist attack at Abbey Gate.”
Last year, the US State Department publicly released its Afghanistan After Action Review report, which found that the decisions to pull all US troops from Afghanistan had detrimental consequences.
“The decisions of both President (Donald) Trump and President (Joe) Biden to end the U.S. military mission in Afghanistan had serious consequences for the viability of the Afghan government and its security,” the unclassified report said.
“Those decisions are beyond the scope of this review, but the AAR (After Action Review) team found that during both administrations there was insufficient senior-level consideration of worst-case scenarios and how quickly those might follow,” it said.
The committee has conducted more than a dozen interviews as part of the investigation into the 2021 evacuation.
Former White House press secretary Jen Psaki sat for a transcribed interview before the committee in late July.
And three top State Department officials provided hours of closed-door testimony to the committee, providing more on the “unprecedented” situation in the final days of the US presence in Afghanistan.
Those officials – John Bass, Jim DeHart and Jayne Howell – rushed to Kabul in the days surrounding the Taliban’s seizure of the capital city, and dove into creating systems on the fly alongside the US military and with constantly changing input on the ground and coming from DC, as CNN has reported.

MER7774YDT_P2KGDZK9LZ9C5GJ,"China’s New York envoy ‘performing his duties as usual’ after Chinese agent case, Beijing’s consulate says","By Yong Xiong and Nectar Gan, CNN","6 minute read Updated 2:10 AM EDT, Fri September 6, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/05/us/china-new-york-envoy-intl-hnk/,"China’s consulate in New York has denied reports that its top diplomat was removed in the aftermath of an alleged Chinese agent bust, saying the consul general is “performing his duties as usual.”
“Consul General Huang Ping is performing his duties as usual. We hope the media will refrain from sensationalizing false information,” a spokesperson for the Chinese Consulate General in New York told CNN in a statement Wednesday.
The statement appears to contradict remarks made earlier by New York Gov. Kathy Hochul – whose former aide was charged with acting as an agent for the Chinese government – and the State Department, which claimed the Chinese envoy had left his position.
Hours later, the consulate published a press release on its website with photos showing Huang busy at work on Tuesday. In the photos, Huang was seen visiting the Philadelphia home of a former American pilot who helped China to fight Japan during World War II.
At a fundraising event on Thursday evening, Huang, who has been the consul general since December 2018, indicated that he would be leaving his position soon, citing the length of his term and the retirement age for Chinese government officials.
“I’ve been here six years already. I surpassed my term, which used to be three to four years. I’ve surpassed my (retirement) age. In China, government officials retire at 60,” the 61-year-old told the audience at the China Institute Blue Cloud Gala.
“I think it’s time for me to go home and start a new life,” Huang said.
An official at the Chinese embassy in Washington confirmed to CNN that Huang’s term is coming to an end, but did not offer a specific date for his departure. The official said plans for Huang’s departure had been set in motion long ago and have nothing to do with the recent indictment against Linda Sun.
This latest Chinese explanation, however, while confirming Huang remains in his post for now, does at least partially echo the US State Department’s previous response his term was coming to an end — albeit with a slightly different timeframe.
The envoy’s employment status was first thrown into the spotlight after Sun, a former aide to Hochul and her predecessor Gov. Andrew Cuomo, was charged on Tuesday with secretly acting as an agent of the Chinese government.
Sun was charged with violating and conspiring to violate the Foreign Agents Registration Act, visa fraud, alien smuggling and conspiracy to launder money, according to an unsealed copy of the indictment.
Sun’s husband and co-defendant, Chris Hu, was also charged with money laundering conspiracy and conspiracy to commit bank fraud as well as misusing means of identification, prosecutors said.
Details contained within the indictment appear to match some publicly available information, including an interaction between Sun and Huang, the consul general.
For example, at the request of Chinese government representatives, Sun allegedly obtained an unauthorized proclamation from the New York Governor’s Office – a formal framed document that bears the state seal and the governor’s signature – to present to a Chinese official at an event celebrating the Lunar New Year in January 2023, prosecutors said in the indictment.
A photo posted on the website of China’s Foreign Ministry shows Sun presenting a framed New York State proclamation to Huang at the Lunar New Year reception of the Chinese consulate in New York on January 17, 2023.
US prosecutors say the Chinese government gave Sun lavish, expensive gifts in return for violating internal rules and state government protocols while she served as an aide to the two New York governors in a scheme that enriched her family to the tune of millions of dollars.
Among the gifts she received were at least four deliveries of Nanjing-style salted duck between 2021 and 2022, prepared by the personal chef of the Chinese official to whom she later presented the proclamation, according to the indictment. Other examples of gifts in the indictment included travel reimbursements, hotel rooms and event tickets.
Sun was born in Nanjing, a city in eastern China’s Jiangsu province, and moved to the US with her parents at a young age, according to the overseas Chinese affairs office of the Jiangsu provincial government.
A statement released by the office in 2017 said Sun had led two to three American delegations to visit China every year since 2012, when she started to work for Gov. Cuomo.
Sun has denied the allegations. Defense attorney Seth DuCharme addressed reporters outside court Tuesday, saying “we have a lot of confidence in our case.”
“A lot of the allegations in this indictment are frankly perplexing, overly inflammatory,” he said. “As you heard in court today, we are looking forward to our day in court. The defendants are exercising their right to a speedy trial as soon as they can; we have a lot of confidence in Chris and in Linda.”
An attorney for Sun, Jarrod Schaeffer, told CNN the charges “are inflammatory and appear to be the product of an overly aggressive prosecution.”
“We are also troubled by aspects of the government’s investigation. As we said today in court, our client is eager … to defend against these accusations in the proper forum – a court of law,” Schaeffer said.
The case has threatened to spiral into a diplomatic row between Washington and Beijing, in part because of contradicting statements about the fate of China’s top diplomat in New York.
At a news conference earlier Wednesday, Hochul said she spoke by phone at the request of Secretary of State Antony Blinken to a high-ranking State Department official about Huang’s status.
“I had conveyed my desire to have the consul general from the People’s Republic of China in the New York mission expelled,” she said. “And I’ve been informed that the consul general is no longer in the New York mission.”
State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller later clarified that Huang “was not expelled.”

“Our understanding is that the consul general reached the end of a regular scheduled rotation in August, and so rotated out of the position, but was not expelled,” Miller said.
“But of course, when it comes to the status of particular employees of a foreign mission, I would refer you to the foreign country to speak to it. But there was no expulsion action,” he added.
In a statement Wednesday, China’s embassy in Washington said reports saying Huang was expelled were “completely inconsistent with the facts” and “made malicious speculations.”
Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the embassy, said Chinese diplomats in the US “have never and will not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries.”
“Their normal performance of duties in the US should not be interfered with or disrupted in any way. We firmly oppose relevant parties and the media fabricating and spreading false information,” Liu added.
China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was unaware of the aide accused of working for China.
“I am not aware of the situation you mentioned,” spokesperson Mao Ning said at a regular news briefing Monday, adding, “I will not comment on the domestic cases in the United States, but we oppose malicious associations and slander against China.”"
MFPVJNRPJI_N4UOBWF2TEWQIF7,A man accused of killing his girlfriend and leaving her body at Boston’s airport has been extradited to the US,"By Faith Karimi and Larry Madowo, CNN","3 minute read Published 10:14 AM EDT, Mon September 2, 2024",20240902,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/02/world/mbitu-killing-suspect-extradited-kenya-boston-cec/,"A man accused of killing his girlfriend in Boston and fleeing to Kenya has been extradited back to the United States — the latest twist in an international case that saw his arrest at a Nairobi nightclub and his escape from jail.
Kevin Kangethe, 42, is accused of killing nurse Margaret “Maggie” Mbitu, whose body was found in a parked car last November at Boston’s Logan International Airport, two days after she was reported missing. Authorities say he then immediately boarded a flight and fled the country.
For months, the suspect eluded authorities after he arrived in Kenya. In January, investigators spotted Kangethe at a nightclub in Nairobi and arrested him. He escaped from jail days later and was on the run for a week before he was rearrested in Nairobi in early February.
Kenya has an extradition treaty with the United States.
Kangethe’s extradition Sunday returns him to the jurisdiction of his alleged crime, some 7,000 miles away. He is expected to face a murder charge at Suffolk Superior Court on Tuesday, said Renson Ingonga, Kenya’s director of public prosecutions.
“I wish to reiterate my commitment and support, whenever needed, to the United States of America, and in particular the prosecution team as they proceed with the next phase of the case,” Ingonga said in a statement Monday.
Mbitu, 31, lived in Whitman, a Boston suburb, and was the youngest in a family of health care workers. Her two older sisters and her mother are all nurses.
She was reported missing in late October after she didn’t show up for work, which was uncommon for her.
Her family notified the police and called nearby hospitals to check if she was a patient. Investigators believed her boyfriend was a suspect, according to a criminal complaint from the state police.
With the help of surveillance cameras, police tracked his Toyota SUV to the airport and found it in a parking garage. Inside they found Mbitu’s bloodied body with slash wounds on her face and neck, Massachusetts State Police said in an affidavit.
The day before her body was found, Kangethe boarded flights from Boston to Kenya. Surveillance footage showed him leaving the parking garage and entering an airport terminal, police said.
Investigators learned he had bought a plane ticket the previous morning, state police said.
“Why her?” her sister, Ann Mbitu, told CNN in November. “Nobody’s daughter deserves this, but why my sister? Why Maggie?” “I’m so angry, I’m still trying to process everything. At 31, we’re not supposed to be planning her funeral. We’re supposed to be planning celebrations, birthdays, weddings, travel.”
Kangethe has been arrested twice with the help of tipsters.
After he arrived in Kenya, he eluded authorities for three months. Then in late January, someone alerted police that a man at a nightclub in Nairobi resembled images of the suspect they’d seen on social media, Kenyan authorities said.
An undercover officer tracked him down and struck up a conversation with him, a police official told CNN. Within hours, authorities identified the man as Kangethe, whom authorities in Massachusetts had obtained an arrest warrant on a murder charge.
A week later, a man claiming to be his lawyer appeared at the police station where he was being held and asked to speak with him. Officers released the suspect from his cell and left them alone in an office. The suspected escaped on foot and evaded authorities for days, police said.
He was re-arrested a week later at a relative’s house in a suburb of Nairobi after another tip-off, Kenyan police said.
Kevin Hayden, District Attorney of Suffolk County in suburban Boston, thanked the US State Department, the FBI, the state police, the Kenyan government and Kenyan law enforcement agencies for facilitating the arrest.
“Their tremendous and untiring efforts will provide Margaret’s family and friends the opportunity to see Kevin Kangethe face justice for this terrible crime,” Hayden said in a statement in February.
Investigators have not revealed a motive in the killing."
MIQGLWRW9C_M4ZJ2GN0E70JBIM,Ukraine’s foreign minister tenders resignation ahead of cabinet reshuffle as Russian missiles kill at least 7,"By Kosta Gak, Alex Stambaugh, Helen Regan and Ivana Kottasová, CNN","6 minute read Updated 11:33 AM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/04/europe/ukraine-foreign-minister-kuleba-resigns-intl-hnk/,"Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba became the latest top official to tender his resignation on Wednesday, ahead of a major government reshuffle, as yet another wave of Russian attacks overnight killed at least seven people, including a child.
As Ukraine’s top diplomat, Kuleba has been a prominent fixture in Zelensky’s administration and one of the most public-facing, especially dealing with overseas officials. He was seen as a capable politician and a safe pair of hands, one of the strongest members of Zelensky’s cabinet. His offer to resign comes ahead of an expected visit by the president to the United States this month.
Kuleba’s was the latest in a flurry of resignations. Two of Ukraine’s vice premiers, three ministers, the head of the State Property Fund and a top official in Zelensky’s Presidential Office have all quit within the last day or so.
The parliament approved Kuleba’s resignation on Thursday and Andrii Sybiha was sworn in as foreign minister to replace him. Sybiha has previously served as ambassador to Turkey and deputy head of the presidential office.
The resignations of the three other ministers and one of the vice premiers were approved on Wednesday.
Zelensky has not yet given any explanation for the reshuffle, but said in his nightly address on Tuesday that the coming fall will be “extremely important for Ukraine” and as such “our state institutions must be set up so that Ukraine achieves all the results we need.”
Kuleba and others who tendered their resignations are widely expected to be appointed into other roles in the Zelensky administration. The reshuffle comes at a precarious time for Ukraine. Its troops are under increasing pressure on the eastern frontlines, especially around the strategic city of Pokrovsk that is on the brink of falling to Russia.

It seems likely that Zelensky wants to have his new team in place for his trip to the US later this month, where he is expected to attend the United Nation General Assembly and meet the US President Joe Biden. Zelensky said last week that he intends to present Biden with a new four-part “victory plan” – without providing details.
The last major change Zelensky made to the top echelon of Ukraine’s leadership came in February, when he replaced the former Commander in Chief Valerii Zaluzhnyi with Oleksander Syrskyi. Zaluzhnyi currently serves as Ukraine’s ambassador to the United Kingdom.
Ukrainian political scientist Mykola Davydiuk said there were no major disagreements within the government. Instead, Zelensky is likely trying to send a signal that he is injecting new energy into his government.
“(The president’s office) wanted to do this last fall, then in December, then in May. They spoke about it so they need to do something, otherwise people will not believe them,” he said, adding that Zelensky likely sensed a window of opportunity for the reshuffle. “The West can’t criticize him now because they have a lot of domestic issues to deal with – the US election, election trouble in Germany and France,” he added.
Davyd Arakhamia, the majority leader of Ukraine’s parliament, said Tuesday that there would be major changes expected in the cabinet this week.
“As promised, a major government reset can be expected this week. More than 50% of the Cabinet of Ministers’ staff will be changed,” Arakhamia said on Telegram, adding that new members would be appointed imminently.
Among those who have resigned was the Minister for Strategic Industries Oleksandr Kamyshin, who was in charge of weapons production. He is expected to assume another defense role, Reuters reported.
The resignations also include the justice, environment and reintegration ministers.
“To do this, we need to strengthen some areas of the government… I am also counting on a slightly different weight for certain areas of our foreign and domestic policy,” Arakhamia said.
Speaking to CNN Chief International Anchor Christiane Amanpour Tuesday, Kuleba said he expects Putin to continue increasing air attacks on Ukraine before winter sets in.
“Putin still has the same purpose to freeze people, to destroy our economy and this is his strategy. So I’m afraid he will continue with his barrage of missile and drone attacks over the course of the autumn,” he said.
The attacks, Kuleba said, are “just another reason why delivery of air defense systems to Ukraine must be expedited.”
The expected reshuffle came as Russian missiles continued to rain down on Ukrainian cities. Just a day after two ballistic missiles hit an educational facility in Poltava in central Ukraine, a major attack struck Lviv, a city in western Ukraine that has long been considered a safe haven in the war-torn country.
Lviv’s mayor Andriy Sadovyi said seven people, including a 14-year-old girl, were killed and 25 were injured in the attacks.
A 15-month-old child suffered “moderate” injuries and four other children have minor injuries, according to the head of the city’s regional military administration Maksym Kozytskyi.

Lviv, in Ukraine’s far west, is generally far away from Russian borders, which means missiles and drones take longer to reach it – giving the Ukrainian military more time to shoot them down. Many people from eastern regions relocated there to seek safety.
Kozytskyi said that at least seven “architectural monuments of local importance,” including houses located in a historic part of the city and inside a UNESCO buffer zone, were also damaged in the attack.
On Tuesday, a Russian strike against a military educational facility in central Ukraine killed 54 people and injured nearly 300 others, according to the state emergency service of Ukraine. It was one of the deadliest single attacks since the start of Moscow’s full-scale invasion in February 2022.
Ukraine’s Air Force said Wednesday it shot down 22 attack drones and seven cruise missiles.
At the same time, Ukraine is still reeling from a massive wave of attacks against the energy infrastructure last week. Power cuts are still impacting lives across Ukraine, with millions suffering from power cuts every day.
At least five people were killed and more than 10 wounded in Russian attacks in the central city of Kryvyi Rih after a hotel building was destroyed, according to the head of the Dnipropetrovsk regional military administration Serhiy Lysak.
The strike on Kryvyi Rih appears to be part of a wave of Russian attacks targeting hotels. Facilities in Kramatorsk, Zaporizhzhia, and another one in Kryvyi Rih were all hit by strikes in the past week or so.
Speaking about the attacks, Zelensky again appealed for Kyiv’s allies to supply Ukraine with more air defenses and to lift restrictions on the use of western weapons on targets in Russia.
Meanwhile, the chief of the UN nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, visited the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in occupied southern Ukraine on Wednesday.
Grossi, who heads the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on Tuesday that the situation at the largest nuclear power plant in Europe was “very fragile.” The Ukrainian energy company Energoatom said one of two power supply lines to the plant was damaged on Monday following Russian strikes in the region.
“Today we have one of the two existing power lines down, which means that the station is again on the verge of being on a blackout,” Grossi told reporters in Kyiv on Tuesday, before heading to Zaporizhzhia.
Explaining why a power cut could cause a serious accident at the plant, Grossi said: “Blackout, no power… No power, no cooling… No cooling, maybe you have a disaster.”

MOVMS9T1ER_AQIT6MYMRRT0JB8,New York Times publisher sounds the alarm on Trump employing authoritarian anti-press ‘playbook’,"By Liam Reilly and Brian Stelter, CNN","3 minute read Published 2:20 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/05/media/new-york-times-a-g-sulzberger-authoritarian-playbook-trump/,"A.G. Sulzberger, the New York Times publisher, sounded the alarm Thursday on the “quiet war” against press freedoms unleashed by authoritarians around the world and said Americans should understand the anti-media “playbook” that Donald Trump might employ in a second term.
In an op-ed published by one of the Times’ main rivals, The Washington Post, Sulzberger warned that Trump and his allies have repeatedly threatened the press and said he wanted the Times “to ensure we are prepared for whatever is to come.”
“My colleagues and I have spent months studying how press freedom has been attacked in Hungary — as well as in other democracies such as India and Brazil,” he wrote.
The techniques include “sowing public distrust in independent journalism and normalizing the harassment” of journalists to create a “climate hospitable to crackdowns on the media;” using government authorities, like taxation, “to punish offending journalists and news organizations” while rewarding “those who demonstrate fealty to their leadership;” and filing meritless lawsuits and exploiting the courts to make it more costly to report the news.

“The effectiveness of this playbook should not be underestimated,” Sulzberger wrote.
The Times publisher said he didn’t wish to wade into politics, but Trump’s anti-press words and actions – declaring media outlets the “enemy of the people” and suggesting the use of government to quash dissent – must be taken seriously.
“I believe the risk is shared by our entire profession, as well as all who depend on it,” he wrote.
In championing the need for trustworthy news and information, Sulzberger called on his peers to bolster protections, which includes teaching staffers how to protect themselves and their sources, preparing for legal fights and harassment, and pushing back against campaigns that seek to unjustly undermine trust in news media.
Sulzberger occasionally writes essays to prompt journalism industry dialogue about key issues. Last year, he wrote for the Columbia Journalism Review about the debate around objectivity in journalism. This year, with Trump’s anti-media rhetoric again front and center, he wanted to write about what an escalating campaign against the American press could look like.
Sulzberger approached it as a summer project of sorts.
“To ensure we are prepared for whatever is to come, my colleagues and I have spent months studying how press freedom has been attacked in Hungary — as well as in other democracies such as India and Brazil,” he wrote in the essay. “The political and media environments in each country are different, and the campaigns have seen varying tactics and levels of success, but the pattern of anti-press action reveals common threads.”
Sulzberger thought extensively about the best way to publish the essay — whether in the pages of The Times or elsewhere. He wound up placing it with the Post, an unorthodox move given the long history of competition between the two publications. The collaboration makes a clear statement about the importance of solidarity in the face of existential threats to press freedom.
“I’m grateful to The Post for running the piece, especially given the length (and the suspect institutional affiliations of its author,” he wrote in an email to associates on Thursday. “They’ve been a great partner on the cause of press freedom over many decades and it’s great to see that tradition continue.”"
MPA9N0ZAZ4_THRVICPRPSW77RD,Man charged with murder in connection with the deaths of a California couple at a nudist resort,"By Nicole Chavez, CNN","3 minute read Updated 10:30 PM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/03/us/missing-california-couple-murder-charges/,"A man was charged with murder on suspicion of killing his neighbors at a California nudist resort, San Bernardino County District Attorney Jason Anderson announced Tuesday afternoon in a news conference.
Michael Royce Sparks, 62, is facing two counts of murder in connection with the deaths of missing couple Daniel and Stephanie Menard, who are 79 and 73, authorities said.
The couple was last seen on August 24 at their home in the Olive Dell Ranch resort in San Bernardino County. Human remains were found underneath Sparks’ home after he was arrested last week, following a tense and lengthy standoff.
Police have said they believe the remains are those of the Menards, who lived next door.
“We know they’re dead, and we know there’s two victims,” Anderson said about the reasoning for the charges.
Sparks is set to appear in court Wednesday and is ineligible for bail, jail records show. CNN has been unable to identify an attorney for Sparks or locate family members.
• Redlands Police Chief Rachel Tolber said one of Sparks’ relatives led them to him. Hours prior to his arrest last week, a family member called police saying he was involved in the Menards’ disappearance.
He “had admitted to killing two people and was threatening suicide,” Tolber said about Sparks.
“I believe that there may have been other people that were texted, but the initial call that started our focus on him was from the family,” Tolber added.
Officials couldn’t discuss a potential motive for the killings and Anderson said it did not appear to be planned.
Police had been looking for the couple in the hills and canyon area around Olive Dell Ranch. The resort is between the southern California cities of Redlands and Colton, about 65 miles east of Los Angeles.
The search began after a friend who lives in the resort became worried for the Menards when they didn’t attend Sunday church service as usual. Their dog Cuddles, a white shih tzu, remains missing, police said on Tuesday.
Irene Engkraf, who identified herself as the person who contacted police about the Menards, told reporters last week that she saw the their car sitting “abandoned” down the road from their home.
When she entered the couple’s home using a spare key, Engkraf said she saw Stephanie’s purse and both of the Menards’ phones. Then she called 911 and hospitals in the area, searching for news of her friends.
After receiving a tip from Sparks’ family, police locked down the resort because they learned that he could be armed and barricaded, Tolber said.
Officers had been looking for him for several hours when they used a battering ram and a drone to search Sparks’ home, police said. They located him with a camera used to evaluate sewer blockages, Redlands Police Department spokesman Carl Baker said Friday.
He had been hiding inside a 5-foot deep concrete space under the home, which forced officers to remove the front wall of the house, Baker said.
Anderson, the district attorney, described the space as similar to a “homemade basement” area underneath the mobile home.
When officers discovered him, Sparks, who was armed and barricaded, attempted to shoot himself but his weapon misfired, police said. After “lengthy negotiations” with officers, Sparks surrendered voluntarily, Baker said.
A day after Sparks was arrested, firefighters and cadaver dogs found human remains under his home and spent several days searching the site, police said.
The search took days because of the state of the property, its potential collapse and the need to remove debris with heavy equipment.
Tolber declined to discuss more details about the remains and noted that police don’t have a reason to believe there are other victims.

MQX8FYUVOG_TAMQE9J0FC5L272,America’s massive hotel strike just got even bigger,"By Gloria Pazmino and Chris Isidore, CNN","3 minute read Updated 8:26 AM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240902,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/02/business/hotel-strike/,"Baltimore hotel workers are joining a massive nationwide strike against three major hotel chains during one of the biggest travel holidays of the year.
Unite Here, the union representing hotel workers, said approximately 200 hotel workers walked off the job in Baltimore at the Hilton Inner Harbor this morning.
Hotel union workers are now on strike at hotels across 9 US cities. As many as 10,200 hotel workers at 25 hotels stretching from Boston to the West Coast to Hawaii went on strike starting early Sunday morning. But, as planned, 840 went back to work Tuesday.
“I walked out today because we just cannot keep working paycheck to paycheck, not able to pay our bills,” Jerome Roberts, a dishwasher at the Hilton Baltimore Inner Harbor said in a statement. “Going on strike is hard, but not nearly as hard as trying to get by on what we are getting paid. We told the bosses in our negotiations how much we are struggling right now but they didn’t care. We are on strike to make them pay.”
Workers say they want higher pay, better conditions and more staff to help. The union is asking for a restoration of many of the pandemic-era cuts that hotels made, including daily room cleaning. The union says the travel and hotel industries have recovered from the pandemic but worker salaries have not reflected the comeback.
The hotels are reportedly still open but guests are contending with a skeleton staff unable to provide full services.
“We’re on strike because the hotel industry has gotten off track,” Gwen Mills, International President of Unite Here, said in a statement Sunday morning. “During Covid, everyone suffered, but now the hotel industry is making record profits while workers and guests are left behind. Too many hotels still haven’t restored standard services that guests deserve. Workers aren’t making enough to support their families. Many can no longer afford to live in the cities that they welcome guests to.”
The hotel chains facing striking workers include Hilton, Hyatt and Marriott. The hotels have 23,776 rooms between them in the cities of Baltimore, Boston, San Diego, San Francisco, San Jose, Seattle, as well as Honolulu and Kauai in Hawaii, and Greenwich, Connecticut, according to the union.
The union is threatening to possibly expand the strike to as many as 65 hotels in 12 different cities, possibly adding hotels in Oakland, California, as well as Providence, Rhode Island, and New Haven, Connecticut. Spokespeople for Hilton and Hyatt told CNN on Friday they are committed to reaching deals with the union, but they also will continue to serve customers during any work stoppage.
Hyatt said in a statement it is disappointed by the union’s decision to strike. “We look forward to continuing to negotiate fair contracts and recognize the contributions of Hyatt employees,” said Michael D’Angelo, head of labor relations at Hyatt.
Last year, the 15,000 members of the same union went on strike during the Fourth of July holiday weekend at 65 hotels in Los Angeles and Orange counties in Southern California. They returned to work a few days later but staged a series of rolling strikes in the months that followed, sometimes tied to major tourist periods, such as the weekend of Taylor Swift concerts in Los Angeles.
These strikes are set to end after three days."
MTYK4DMERC_P3GHB41D9104SS0,Michigan judge denies RFK Jr. request to be removed from ballot,"By Aaron Pellish, CNN","2 minute read Published 6:57 PM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/03/politics/rfk-jr-michigan-ballot-removal-request-denied/,"A Michigan judge ruled Tuesday that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. must remain on the ballot in the battleground state after he filed a lawsuit asking the court to remove him, inhibiting his plan to withdraw from key states to ease former President Donald Trump’s path to victory after endorsing him last month.
Michigan Court of Claims Judge Christopher Yates dismissed Kennedy’s request to be removed after he qualified for the ballot through a minor party earlier this year. Kennedy had initially requested the Michigan secretary of state’s office remove him from the ballot, but that request was denied.
“Elections are not just games, and the Secretary of State … is not obligated to honor the whims of candidates for public office,” Yates wrote in the ruling Tuesday.
The judge added that Kennedy’s request to withdraw as the Natural Law Party’s presidential nominee “at this late date is just a self-serving act that would cause harm to the party that nominated him by leaving the party with no candidate at the top of the ticket.”
The ruling undermines the strategy Kennedy is pursuing to withdraw his name from competitive states’ ballots in order to boost Trump’s chances of winning in those states. Kennedy is also continuing to push for ballot access in states where his name won’t likely have an impact on the outcome of November’s election.
Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said in a social media post Tuesday that candidates who accept the nomination of a minor party in Michigan “shall not be permitted to withdraw.” Her statement came in response to a post from Trump ally Rudy Giuliani, who claimed the decision to keep Kennedy on the ballot in Michigan is “election interference.”
While Kennedy has been able to remove his name from the ballot in several key states, he has encountered obstacles in other states besides Michigan. Wisconsin’s elections office ruled last week Kennedy will appear on the ballot despite his request to withdraw.

MVUFER2FNQ_8WDW23LSD6DG8P8,Australia’s Great Barrier Reef tries to make sustainability cool,"By Lilit Marcus, CNN","3 minute read Published 2:59 AM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/travel/australia-great-barrier-reef-ecotourism-discounts-intl-hnk/,"Editor’s Note: Call to Earth is a CNN editorial series committed to reporting on the environmental challenges facing our planet, together with the solutions. Rolex’s Perpetual Planet Initiative has partnered with CNN to drive awareness and education around key sustainability issues and to inspire positive action.
It’s a common quandary: a traveler planning a vacation wants to be responsible, stay at a locally-owned hotel instead of a big chain and hire local guides who can take them off the typical tourist trail. But how?
Mark Olsen, CEO of Tourism Tropical North Queensland, has a name for these kinds of travelers: “conservation-curious.” He describes them as “people who are interested in conservation but don’t know how their holiday and conservation can come together.”
Enter Guardian of the Reef, a website where people planning visits to the Great Barrier Reef can watch informative videos to unlock 10-20% discounts off of hotels or book custom experiences that aren’t available elsewhere. The platform, created with online booking company Expedia, is aimed at travelers who want to spend their money in productive ways but don’t want to spend weeks online researching every single hotel and tour operator.
According to data from Expedia, 90% of its users say they are interested in sustainable options when traveling.
Some of the bookable Guardian of the Reef experiences are traditional tourist activities like snorkeling trips and whale-watching cruises led by certified, licensed eco-guides. Others are specifically about conservation: visitors can help restore seagrass, an important habitat for sea turtles, or place “baby” corals on reefs where they can grow.
Still, there are limits on what the site can provide.
“It doesn’t book your flights,” says Olsen, who adds that travelers should also purchase carbon offsets.

Australia has long struggled to find a happy medium between supporting tourists who want to visit and spend money at the UNESCO World Heritage site and also caring for the reef, which has suffered mass coral bleaching events amid global climate change.
According to Statistics Australia, tourism brought in $57 billion AUD ($38 billion USD) in the 2022-2023 fiscal year, about 2.5% of the country’s total economy.
Many of the travelers who come to Australia head to the Great Barrier Reef, which at 133,000 square miles is about the size of California. It alone is responsible for about $6 billion AUD of the country’s total tourism revenue. An estimated 64,000 people have jobs that depend on reef tourism.
Guardian of the Reef addresses some of those environmental issues head on, acknowledging that climate change is the single biggest challenge to the Reef. However, Olsen believes that tourism is a pro, not a con.
“There’s so many things that consumers can do actively on the Great Barrier Reef, but we say the single most important thing you can do is see it. We know you’re going to fall in love with it, and you’re going to be a part of its conservation for the future,” says Olsen.
More and more destinations are asking – or, in some cases, requiring – travelers to follow certain environmental regulations during their visit.
One the most famous examples is the “Palau Pledge,” where the South Pacific nation asked all visitors to promise to the children of Palau, in writing, to “preserve and protect your beautiful island home.” The pledge is mandatory for visitors and those who break the rules can be fined. The pledge was launched in 2017."
MWN6AQY48Q_H2O84R8U8J2HUIW,Republican-led states file new lawsuit to block Biden’s student loan forgiveness plans,"By Katie Lobosco, CNN","3 minute read Updated 2:07 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/03/politics/student-loan-forgiveness-lawsuit-biden/,"A group of seven Republican-led states filed a fresh lawsuit Tuesday, seeking to block new student loan forgiveness plans that the Biden administration expected to start rolling out this fall.
The lawsuit marks yet another legal challenge to President Joe Biden’s student loan policies and could potentially tie up his latest effort to deliver debt relief before the November election.
Currently, Biden’s student loan repayment plan known as SAVE (Saving on a Valuable Education) is blocked while litigation plays out at the 8th US Circuit Court of Appeals. And the president’s sweeping, one-time student loan forgiveness program was knocked down by the Supreme Court last year.
At issue in the latest lawsuit is a set of proposals that the Department of Education started drafting soon after the Supreme Court rejected the Biden administration’s program. The new plans are meant to deliver narrower student loan forgiveness that could withstand legal challenges.
One of the provisions would cancel accumulated interest for people with federal student loan balances bigger than what they originally borrowed. The full amount of interest would be canceled for borrowers whose annual income is $120,000 or less. Others could receive up to $20,000 in debt relief.
About 23 million people would benefit from the interest cancellation under the proposed rule, according to the Department of Education. In an email sent to borrowers in August, the department said it would start delivering this debt relief in the fall.
The cost of the interest cancellation is estimated to total $73 billion.
The set of student loan relief proposals have gone through a lengthy rulemaking process but have yet to be finalized.
The lawsuit claims that the plaintiffs have obtained documents showing the Department of Education intends to provide some of the student debt relief as early as this week – and that this would violate a statute prohibiting the education secretary from implementing a rule sooner than 60 days after its publication.
On Thursday, Judge J. Randal Hall, who is overseeing the case in the US District Court for the Southern District of Georgia, sided with the states and temporarily blocked the Department of Education from using the new rule to cancel student loan debt or interest for 14 days, though he could extend the order. The judge also set an initial hearing on the matter for September 18.
Hall wrote in his order that the states have a “substantial likelihood of success on the merits.”
“This is especially true in light of the recent rulings across the country striking down similar federal student loan forgiveness plans,” he wrote.
“We successfully halted their first two illegal student loan cancellation schemes; I have no doubt we will secure yet another win to block the third one,” Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, who is leading the lawsuit, said in a statement on Tuesday.
The Department of Education declined to comment on pending litigation.
Even though Biden’s sweeping student loan forgiveness got knocked down by the Supreme Court, his administration has still canceled more student loan debt than under any other president – mostly by using existing programs. His administration has made it easier for certain groups of borrowers – such as public-sector workers, including teachers; disabled borrowers; and people who were defrauded by for-profit colleges – to qualify for student loan debt forgiveness.
So far, nearly 4.8 million people have seen their federal student debt canceled under Biden, totaling $169 billion.

MXCVPY6WCE_UR9T3I9E6XUAR22,Ukraine’s foreign minister tenders resignation ahead of cabinet reshuffle as Russian missiles kill at least 7,"By Kosta Gak, Alex Stambaugh, Helen Regan and Ivana Kottasová, CNN","6 minute read Updated 11:33 AM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/04/europe/ukraine-foreign-minister-kuleba-resigns-intl-hnk/,"Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba became the latest top official to tender his resignation on Wednesday, ahead of a major government reshuffle, as yet another wave of Russian attacks overnight killed at least seven people, including a child.
As Ukraine’s top diplomat, Kuleba has been a prominent fixture in Zelensky’s administration and one of the most public-facing, especially dealing with overseas officials. He was seen as a capable politician and a safe pair of hands, one of the strongest members of Zelensky’s cabinet. His offer to resign comes ahead of an expected visit by the president to the United States this month.
Kuleba’s was the latest in a flurry of resignations. Two of Ukraine’s vice premiers, three ministers, the head of the State Property Fund and a top official in Zelensky’s Presidential Office have all quit within the last day or so.
The parliament approved Kuleba’s resignation on Thursday and Andrii Sybiha was sworn in as foreign minister to replace him. Sybiha has previously served as ambassador to Turkey and deputy head of the presidential office.
The resignations of the three other ministers and one of the vice premiers were approved on Wednesday.
Zelensky has not yet given any explanation for the reshuffle, but said in his nightly address on Tuesday that the coming fall will be “extremely important for Ukraine” and as such “our state institutions must be set up so that Ukraine achieves all the results we need.”
Kuleba and others who tendered their resignations are widely expected to be appointed into other roles in the Zelensky administration. The reshuffle comes at a precarious time for Ukraine. Its troops are under increasing pressure on the eastern frontlines, especially around the strategic city of Pokrovsk that is on the brink of falling to Russia.

It seems likely that Zelensky wants to have his new team in place for his trip to the US later this month, where he is expected to attend the United Nation General Assembly and meet the US President Joe Biden. Zelensky said last week that he intends to present Biden with a new four-part “victory plan” – without providing details.
The last major change Zelensky made to the top echelon of Ukraine’s leadership came in February, when he replaced the former Commander in Chief Valerii Zaluzhnyi with Oleksander Syrskyi. Zaluzhnyi currently serves as Ukraine’s ambassador to the United Kingdom.
Ukrainian political scientist Mykola Davydiuk said there were no major disagreements within the government. Instead, Zelensky is likely trying to send a signal that he is injecting new energy into his government.
“(The president’s office) wanted to do this last fall, then in December, then in May. They spoke about it so they need to do something, otherwise people will not believe them,” he said, adding that Zelensky likely sensed a window of opportunity for the reshuffle. “The West can’t criticize him now because they have a lot of domestic issues to deal with – the US election, election trouble in Germany and France,” he added.
Davyd Arakhamia, the majority leader of Ukraine’s parliament, said Tuesday that there would be major changes expected in the cabinet this week.
“As promised, a major government reset can be expected this week. More than 50% of the Cabinet of Ministers’ staff will be changed,” Arakhamia said on Telegram, adding that new members would be appointed imminently.
Among those who have resigned was the Minister for Strategic Industries Oleksandr Kamyshin, who was in charge of weapons production. He is expected to assume another defense role, Reuters reported.
The resignations also include the justice, environment and reintegration ministers.
“To do this, we need to strengthen some areas of the government… I am also counting on a slightly different weight for certain areas of our foreign and domestic policy,” Arakhamia said.
Speaking to CNN Chief International Anchor Christiane Amanpour Tuesday, Kuleba said he expects Putin to continue increasing air attacks on Ukraine before winter sets in.
“Putin still has the same purpose to freeze people, to destroy our economy and this is his strategy. So I’m afraid he will continue with his barrage of missile and drone attacks over the course of the autumn,” he said.
The attacks, Kuleba said, are “just another reason why delivery of air defense systems to Ukraine must be expedited.”
The expected reshuffle came as Russian missiles continued to rain down on Ukrainian cities. Just a day after two ballistic missiles hit an educational facility in Poltava in central Ukraine, a major attack struck Lviv, a city in western Ukraine that has long been considered a safe haven in the war-torn country.
Lviv’s mayor Andriy Sadovyi said seven people, including a 14-year-old girl, were killed and 25 were injured in the attacks.
A 15-month-old child suffered “moderate” injuries and four other children have minor injuries, according to the head of the city’s regional military administration Maksym Kozytskyi.

Lviv, in Ukraine’s far west, is generally far away from Russian borders, which means missiles and drones take longer to reach it – giving the Ukrainian military more time to shoot them down. Many people from eastern regions relocated there to seek safety.
Kozytskyi said that at least seven “architectural monuments of local importance,” including houses located in a historic part of the city and inside a UNESCO buffer zone, were also damaged in the attack.
On Tuesday, a Russian strike against a military educational facility in central Ukraine killed 54 people and injured nearly 300 others, according to the state emergency service of Ukraine. It was one of the deadliest single attacks since the start of Moscow’s full-scale invasion in February 2022.
Ukraine’s Air Force said Wednesday it shot down 22 attack drones and seven cruise missiles.
At the same time, Ukraine is still reeling from a massive wave of attacks against the energy infrastructure last week. Power cuts are still impacting lives across Ukraine, with millions suffering from power cuts every day.
At least five people were killed and more than 10 wounded in Russian attacks in the central city of Kryvyi Rih after a hotel building was destroyed, according to the head of the Dnipropetrovsk regional military administration Serhiy Lysak.
The strike on Kryvyi Rih appears to be part of a wave of Russian attacks targeting hotels. Facilities in Kramatorsk, Zaporizhzhia, and another one in Kryvyi Rih were all hit by strikes in the past week or so.
Speaking about the attacks, Zelensky again appealed for Kyiv’s allies to supply Ukraine with more air defenses and to lift restrictions on the use of western weapons on targets in Russia.
Meanwhile, the chief of the UN nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, visited the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in occupied southern Ukraine on Wednesday.
Grossi, who heads the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on Tuesday that the situation at the largest nuclear power plant in Europe was “very fragile.” The Ukrainian energy company Energoatom said one of two power supply lines to the plant was damaged on Monday following Russian strikes in the region.
“Today we have one of the two existing power lines down, which means that the station is again on the verge of being on a blackout,” Grossi told reporters in Kyiv on Tuesday, before heading to Zaporizhzhia.
Explaining why a power cut could cause a serious accident at the plant, Grossi said: “Blackout, no power… No power, no cooling… No cooling, maybe you have a disaster.”

A “remarkable” Pictish ring with “an intricate setting” was discovered in Scotland by an amateur archaeologist after being buried for more than 1,000 years.
The “kite-shaped ring with a garnet or red glass center” was unearthed by a volunteer at the site of a fort in Burghead, in northeast Scotland, according to the University of Aberdeen, which led the dig.
John Ralph, a former engineer and graduate of the university, signed up as a volunteer for the Burghead digs after retiring.
Ralph, whom the university said describes himself as an “enthusiastic amateur,” had many moments over the two-week excavation when experts told him “he had a knack for finding ‘shiny pebbles.’” It was his third dig at the site.
“So when, on the last day of the final dig, he found something that looked interesting, he didn’t hold out much hope. It was only when he showed it to a fellow volunteer and his eyes lit up that he realized he might ‘have something,’” the university said in a statement Wednesday.
The Professor of Archaeology who led the excavation, Gordon Noble, said what Ralph presented to him was “truly remarkable.”
“John was digging and then came over and said ‘look what I’ve found,’” Noble said, according to the statement. “Even before the conservation work we could see it was something really exciting as despite more than a thousand years in the ground we could see glints of the possible garnet setting.”
The Picts were an ancient people who lived in what is now eastern and northeastern Scotland. Little is known about them, and “only limited and contentious documentary sources survive to evidence their six centuries of life,” according to the University of Aberdeen’s website. All traces of the Picts disappeared from the written records in the 9th century CE, it said.
Noble explained that there are “very few Pictish rings which have ever been discovered and those we do know about usually come from hoards which were placed in the ground deliberately for safekeeping in some way.”

“We certainly weren’t expecting to find something like this lying around the floor of what was once a house but that had appeared of low significance so, in typical fashion, we had left work on it until the final day of the dig,” Noble said.
The ring is undergoing analysis at the National Museum of Scotland’s Post-excavation Service, the university said.
Ralph, who grew up in Burghead, said he was thrilled to have helped understand the region’s Pictish past. “It is a real thrill to dig up an artefact in the knowledge that you are probably the first person to see it for 1,000-1,500 years,” he said. “It becomes a real guessing game of who owned it, what did they use it for and how was it lost.”
Susan O’Connor, Head of Grants at Historic Environment Scotland, said Ralph “played such a pivotal role in bringing it to light - literally!”
While the materials used to make the rink “are not particularly valuable in today’s monetary sense, this find is hugely significant for what it tells us about Pictish lives and society,” O’Connor said. “We’re excited to find out more once our colleagues in the National Museum have finished their investigations.”"
N5RXS26B6N_L7UBLHG1TSU1I9U,Who is the real Alice Guo? Fugitive mayor accused of spying for China faces legal reckoning after weeks on the run,"By Kathleen Magramo, CNN","7 minute read Updated 9:29 PM EDT, Fri September 6, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/04/asia/philippines-alice-guo-fugitive-arrested-intl-hnk/,"For months, millions of people were glued to their TV screens as a slight, bespectacled young woman was grilled by lawmakers in the Philippines for hours at a time about her origin story
What is her real name? Age? Who are her parents? Where did she grow up? The official inquiry into Alice Guo, disgraced former mayor of a small town not far from the capital Manila, has been compulsive viewing for Filipinos since it began in May.
At stake was whether Guo, 34, had spent years in the Philippines as a sleeper agent for China, an incendiary accusation in a country that has seen tension with its giant neighbor soar along with multiple confrontations in the South China Sea.
In July, Guo left the country and went on the run across Southeast Asia. This week, the authorities finally caught up with her. On Friday, the former mayor was extradited from Indonesia to the Philippines.
In a press conference shortly after her return, she told reporters: “I have received death threats, and I asked for help (from authorities). And I was happy when I saw them. I felt safe.”
Her sanguine attitude was in sharp contrast with that of Philippine officials, including President Ferdinand Marcos Jr, who warned lawbreakers that “the arm of the law is long, and it will reach you” shortly after Guo’s arrest abroad.
Upon arriving in Manila, Guo was immediately hit by charges from immigration authorities accusing her of “undesirability and misrepresentation,” for allegedly acquiring Philippine citizenship through fraud.
Guo also faces a slew of money laundering charges – as well as possible future charges for illegal gambling and human trafficking – all of which allegedly took place in Bamban, a small town in Tarlac province about 60 miles north of Manila, where she had served as mayor for about two years before absconding.
Guo’s legal team described her arrest as a “welcome development” as she would now be able to “answer the allegations and issues thrown against her.”
“We trust that Alice L. Guo will demonstrate her courage and resilience in the face of adversity,” the David Buenaventura and Ang Law Office said in a statement to CNN on Thursday.
But who exactly is Alice Guo? And how did she come to embody the Philippines’ growing nervousness about China?
With long black hair and a beaming smile, the young candidate running for mayor of Bamban in 2022 welcomed voters into her life. She appeared in campaign promotional material posted to YouTube with the description: “Get to know the real Alice Guo.”
Dressed in a pink polo shirt and jeans, she’s seen waving to supporters also dressed in pink, her signature color. Her provincial life seemed ordinary. On her YouTube videos, she’s seen tending her chickens and having deep-fried dried fish for breakfast, like a typical Filipino.
The campaign worked, and Guo was elected.
But her reputation as an enthusiastic young public servant was called into question earlier this year when the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission (PAOCC) received separate tip-offs from two workers from Malaysia and Vietnam.
They had asked for help to get back to their home countries after claiming to have been held against their will in a building in Bamban, a town home to just 78,000 people.
The building was suspected to be a Philippine Offshore Gaming Operation (POGO), which caters to punters based in China, where gambling is illegal. POGOs were popular places of employment for tens of thousands of foreign workers and lucrative, but were often linked with organized crime.
When authorities raided the Bamban complex in March, they found more than 800 Filipinos, Chinese, Vietnamese and other nationals, who claimed to have been working there against their will.
The government-run Philippine News Agency reported police found “love scam” scripts, firearms and mobile phones allegedly used for scam transactions.
The rescued workers were allegedly made to pose as lovers to lure people to send money, in what’s commonly known as “pig-butchering” – a type of confidence fraud in which victims are lured by scammers often impersonating young women on the internet.
To get to the bottom of what was happening in Bamban, the Philippine senate ordered an inquiry into Guo on May 7 headed by Senator﻿ Risa Hontiveros.
Guo failed to show up for at least three of the hearings, citing death threats and poor mental health, according to a statement on Facebook before her official account was taken down.
While she was absent from the hearings, raids on casino hubs continued and public criticism intensified over POGOs, which have spread across the country.
Subsequent probes into the complex in Bamban also uncovered alleged links between the mayor and the shady underworld of gambling centers, with some suspected of being vehicles to launder money.
President Marcos Jr expressed his growing concern about the explosion of offshore casinos in an address to the nation on July 22. To a standing ovation from lawmakers, he ordered a total ban with immediate effect.
“Disguising as legitimate entities, their operations have ventured into illicit areas furthest from gaming, such as financial scamming, money laundering, prostitution, human trafficking, kidnapping, brutal torture — even murder,” Marcos said. “The grave abuse and disrespect to our system of laws must stop.”
Against this heightened scrutiny, the senate inquiry into Guo’s possible links to Chinese criminals transfixed the country.
Many parts of her life story did not add up, lawmakers said during the publicly broadcast sessions that lasted for hours, filled with the dizzying back-and-forth of questions aimed at Guo and her suspected accomplices.
During her testimony, Guo claimed she grew up on a livestock farm in the town of Bamban, and was the lovechild of a Filipino maid and a Chinese man.
Guo speaks Tagalog fluently, but she does not speak the regional language, Kapampangan, which is typically spoken in the town. She said she was homeschooled by a woman called “Teacher Rubilyn” and claimed she did not have any childhood friends who could vouch for her.

Suspicion that she was working as an “asset” for Beijing grew among lawmakers, as they cited her evasive answers to questions about her Chinese parentage. Her alleged business ventures with foreigners who have criminal records also raised doubts.
Speculation intensified when the senate probe revealed that her real name was “Guo Hua Ping” based on immigration records from 2005. Later, the National Bureau of Investigation found that her fingerprints matched those of a Chinese national of the same name.
Even though tension with China is rising, it hasn’t been a feature of daily life for the large ethnic Chinese population in the Philippines. Generations of Chinese migrants have intermarried with local natives and Spaniards over centuries, with millions of Filipinos today having some degree of Chinese lineage.
The real concern about Guo arose from her alleged ties with business associates from China currently in prison.
The Philippine senate investigation presented documents showing Guo had incorporated Baofu Land Development in 2019 with business partners Zhang Ruijin and Lin Baoying. It was registered to the same sprawling complex in Bamban where the workers were rescued by authorities.
Zhang and Lin are both serving prison time in Singapore for fraudulently using forged documents to launder millions of dollars.
Armed with mounting evidence, Philippine law enforcement agencies, including the Anti-Money Laundering Council (AMLC), jointly filed multiple charges of money laundering against Guo and 35 others for allegedly laundering over 100 million Philippine pesos ($1.8 million) in proceeds from criminal activities.

The AMLC also filed to forfeit assets valued at more than 6 billion Philippine pesos ($106 million) from Guo and her associates.
Among those charged were Guo, her alleged sister Shiela, and a business partner named Cassandra Li Ong. They allegedly ran scam-farm operations under a number of companies: QSeed Genetics; Zun Yuan Technology Inc; Hongshen Gaming Technology Inc; QJJ Farms; and Baofu Land Development Inc.
But by the time the charges were filed on August 30, Guo was already on the run.
President Marcos Jr said Guo would be entitled to standard legal rights but stressed the country would waste no time seeking justice and tracking down those who had helped her flee.
“We will not allow this to prolong the resolution of the case whose outcome will be a victory for the Filipino people,” he said.

N8RE7C9GJQ_RPPEX5P5NOPNF4O,AfD becomes first far-right party to win German state election since 1945,"By Christian Edwards, Claudio Otto, Matties Otto and Nadine Schmidt, CNN","5 minute read Updated 8:09 AM EDT, Mon September 2, 2024",20240902,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/02/europe/afd-germany-election-thuringia-saxony-intl/,"The Alternative for Germany (AfD) has become the first far-right party to win a state election in Germany since the Nazi era, dealing a crushing blow to Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s government with only a year to go before the next federal election.
After voting closed on Sunday, the AfD was projected to become the strongest party in the eastern state of Thuringia, with 32.8% of the vote, and to come a close second in Saxony, with 30.6% of the vote.
In another worrying development for Germany’s mainstream, the fledgling Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) – a far-left party that has questioned the country’s support for Ukraine and shares some of the AfD’s anti-immigration streak – came third in both states, despite only being founded earlier this year.
Although extremism has long been concentrated in Germany’s east, the results will be a concern for Scholz’s center-left SPD coalition, which slumped to a dismal fifth in both states. If federal elections were held now, recent polls show the AfD could become the second-largest group in the Bundestag, with the SDP trailing in third.
Scholz described the results as “bitter” and, calling on the European principle of the “cordon sanitaire,” urged mainstream parties in Thuringia and Saxony to exclude the AfD from any state governing coalitions.
“All democratic parties are now called upon to form stable governments without right-wing extremists,” Scholz said in a statement. “Our country cannot and must not get used to this. The AfD is damaging Germany. It is weakening the economy, dividing society and ruining our country’s reputation.”
Alice Weidel, co-leader of the AfD, told German public broadcaster ARD that the results were a “requiem” for Scholz’s coalition and questioned “whether it can continue to govern at all.”
Speaking to CNN at a campaign rally in the city of Erfurt in Thuringia, where chants of “deport, deport” rang out across the room, Weidel said that Germany has become “a country without borders, where anyone can come in and we do nothing about it.”
The AfD’s solution? “The immediate expulsion of all illegal immigrants from our country. All criminals, all extremists must leave,” she said.
If other parties heed Scholz’s call to shun the AfD, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) – the mainstream center-right party projected to come first in Saxony and second in Thuringia – would be well-placed to benefit. However, in a sign of the rightward shift of Germany’s politics, the CDU has recently taken a far harsher line on immigration than under its former leader Angela Merkel.
Founded in 2013, initially in opposition to the euro and the German-backed bailout of southern European countries during the eurozone crisis, the AfD has since coupled its rhetoric of economic grievance with a staunch opposition to immigration.
The issue of immigration became more salient – and the AfD more popular – after then-Chancellor Merkel allowed into the country more than 1 million refugees in 2015, mostly those fleeing civil war in Syria.
While the decision won her praise from Europe’s more liberal mainstream, it has provided a rallying cry for extremist parties in Germany’s formerly communist east, where economic growth is more anemic and opportunities more scarce than in the richer west.
“There’s a much more anti-political sentiment in East Germany, which has its roots in the transformative years of the 1990s” after the collapse of communism, Johannes Kiess, a sociologist at the University of Leipzig specializing in far-right extremism, told CNN. Mainstream parties perform less well in the east, creating space for anti-establishment parties like the AfD and political entrepreneurs like Wagenknecht.
Just days before the state elections, a Syrian man stabbed three people to death and wounded several others at a festival in the western Germany city of Solingen. Weidel pinned the blame solely on Germany’s migration policy: “Instead of racking our brains over the various models of knife bans, we must finally tackle the problem at its roots. Migration change immediately.”
The message is also winning the support of some young Germans. The movement has even acquired its own anthem, after a video filmed on the German vacation island of Sylt showed well-dressed youths chanting “Ausländer Raus” (“foreigners out”) and “Deutschland den Deutschen” (“Germany for Germans”) over a 1999 Eurodance beat. The chant swirled across the country as it hosted the European soccer championships earlier this summer.

At the campaign in Erfurt, Kevin Flurschutz, a 21-year-old public transport engineer who recently joined the youth wing at the AfD, told CNN that immigration had become his foremost concern. “Hardly anyone dares to go out anymore. To be honest, I find that sad,” said Flurschutz, wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with, “White boy summer.”
Carolin Lichtenfeld, another 21-year-old attendee, said she’d experienced harassment on the streets. “You notice it on public transport. You notice it when you go shopping,” she told CNN.
Both Lichtenfeld and Flurschutz have joined the Young Alternative (JA), the youth wing of the AfD which has been designated by German authorities as a “confirmed extremist” organization. The main AfD has been designated as “suspected extremist.”
The party’s lead candidate in Thuringia, Björn Höcke, was convicted earlier this year after breaking German laws against uttering Nazi slogans in public.
Kiess, the sociologist, said sections of the German public are becoming more tolerant of extremists like Höcke. “Twenty or 30 years ago, we would have said, ‘This is a neo-Nazi, a fascist, and you cannot vote for a guy like that.’ But people don’t care anymore,” Kiess said.
While the AfD’s growing popularity is for many reminiscent of the country’s darkest political era, Höcke has campaigned on a platform of national pride untainted by historical guilt, under the banner of “Heimat” (“homeland”).
“Yes to freedom, yes to the community, yes to the youth, yes to the future, yes to our Heimat, Thuringia and Germany,” he said at the campaign in Erfurt.
That message is taking root in the fertile ground of Germany’s east, where voters told CNN they felt neglected by traditional parties. “The AfD is the only alternative we have left here in Germany,” said Flurschutz."

On Monday, Musk posted an AI-generated image on his social media platform that depicted Harris as a communist, wearing a red uniform complete with hammer and sickle emblazoned hat.
Musk, who has endorsed former President Donald Trump for president and poured millions into a super PAC supporting the Republican, captioned the image with the false assertion, “Kamala vows to be a communist dictator on day one. Can you believe she wears that outfit!?”
The image, which appeared to violate X’s policy on manipulated content, resembled an AI-generated image posted by Trump last month during the Democratic National Convention, envisioning Harris addressing a crowd under communist symbols.
Musk’s post came a day after he shared another post with a screenshot suggesting that only “high status males” should be able to participate in government because women (and men with “low testosterone”) are not capable of critical thought. Musk posted it to his 196 million followers with the comment, “interesting observation.”
The sexist screed appears to have originated on 4Chan, the notorious hate-filled website that has been linked to mass-shootings.
By choosing to amplify disinformation and misogynist views, Musk, a South African billionaire who is both the owner of X and the most-followed account on the platform, is promoting radical content to the masses that might otherwise languish in the darkest corners of the internet.
By Tuesday afternoon, less than 24 hours after Musk shared the fake image and false statement depicting Harris as a communist, the post had been viewed nearly 60 million times, according to data from X. Musk’s post suggesting women shouldn’t take part in democracy had been viewed more than 19 million times.
X did not respond to a CNN request for comment.
The posts come after Brazilian authorities blocked access to X in the country in a battle over the spread of misinformation and hate speech on the platform aimed at undermining the nation’s democracy.
Since taking over the platform, Musk has touted X’s “community notes” feature as a way of transparently allowing crowd-sourced fact-checking misinformation on his platform.
Related article ‘White Dudes for Harris’ said their account was targeted by X for the second time
Yet neither post was fact-checked through the community notes feature. Musk’s defenders, of which there are many who are vocal on X, have attempted to argue that some posts like these are satirical or are not meant to be taken seriously.
But Musk is taken seriously. He is one of the world’s most powerful people who controls one of the world’s most important online platforms on the precipice of an historic American presidential election where he is actively campaigning for a candidate.
When Musk took over Twitter in 2022 in a $44 billion acquisition, he claimed that the platform would remain impartial to avoid the perception of tilting the scales for a political party.
“For Twitter to deserve public trust, it must be politically neutral, which effectively means upsetting the far right and the far left equally,” he wrote.
But Musk’s posts, and the lack of scrutiny they receive from his company’s own fact-checking system, lay bare how Musk has turned X into a pro-Trump machine."
NFA3EHEJJX_DZB5ULX1JR694QN,White House condemns Tucker Carlson’s ‘Nazi propaganda’ interview as ‘disgusting and sadistic insult’,"By Brian Stelter, CNN","4 minute read Updated 5:54 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/05/media/white-house-condemns-tucker-carlson-nazi-propaganda-interview/,"The Biden administration is denouncing Tucker Carlson after the far-right personality hosted a guest on his show this week who suggested the Holocaust happened by accident, calling the interview “a disgusting and sadistic insult to all Americans.”
During Carlson’s two-hour sit-down with Darryl Cooper, a podcaster whom he said “may be the best and most honest popular historian in the United States,” Cooper claimed that Nazi Germany’s mass murder of Jews was an unintended consequence – something akin to poor planning instead of the methodical extermination that it actually was.
British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, Cooper claimed, was the “chief villain of the Second World War” and “primarily responsible for that war becoming what it did, becoming something other than an invasion of Poland.”

Carlson’s platforming of Cooper has been widely criticized in recent days, including by some right-wing figures who have defended Carlson in the past. Elon Musk, who promoted the interview on his social media platform, X, calling it “Very interesting. Worth watching,” later deleted his post.
On Thursday the White House added its weight to the matter.
In a statement first shared with CNN, senior deputy press secretary Andrew Bates said “giving a microphone to a Holocaust denier who spreads Nazi propaganda is a disgusting and sadistic insult to all Americans, to the memory of the over 6 million Jews who were genocidally murdered by Adolf Hitler, to the service of the millions of Americans who fought to defeat Nazism, and to every subsequent victim of Antisemitism.”
The administration’s statement specifically refuted Cooper’s claim to Carlson that Churchill was the “chief villain” of World War II.
“Hitler was one of the most evil figures in human history and the ‘chief villain’ of World War II, full stop,” Bates wrote. “The Biden-Harris Administration believes that trafficking in this moral rot is unacceptable at any time, let alone less than one year after the deadliest massacre perpetrated against the Jewish people since the Holocaust and at a time when the cancer of Antisemitism is growing all over the world.”
Reached for comment on Thursday, Carlson sharply criticized the White House.
“The fact that these lunatics have used the Churchill myth to bring our country closer to nuclear war than at any moment in history disgusts me, and should terrify every American,” he said in a text message to CNN. “They’re warmonger freaks. They don’t get the moral high ground.”
But numerous columnists have pointed out inaccuracies in Cooper’s remarks, including his assertion that the Nazis “went in with no plan” for housing millions of prisoners of war “and just threw these people into camps, and millions of people ended up dead there.”

Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, denounced Carlson’s interview with Cooper as “truly revolting.”
“The Nazis’ extensive network of concentration, forced labor, and death camps was part of Hitler’s deliberate plan to exterminate the Jewish people. Inmates didn’t just ‘end up dead’ and they did not ‘surrender,’” he said Wednesday.
In the year and a half since Carlson was fired by Fox News, the former primetime host turned internet vlogger has stoked controversy and garnered embarrassment through his web videos and speaking appearances. On Musk’s X and on his subscription video website, Carlson has interviewed radical figures including Alex Jones and others, offering a big platform to fringe voices and seemingly delighting in the outrage that ensues.
Despite the condemnation, Carlson has continued to be embraced by the Republican Party, which gave him a prime time speaking slot at last month’s party convention in Milwaukee.
Carlson is also undertaking a live speaking tour this fall with events across the country. Donald Trump’s vice presidential nominee, JD Vance, is scheduled to appear with Carlson at a Sept. 21 event in Hershey, Pennsylvania, a person familiar with the plans told CNN.
Several conservative columnists have raised questions about whether Vance will move forward with the appearance in light of the Cooper controversy. In a statement, the Vance campaign sought to distance the candidate from the interview.
“Senator Vance doesn’t believe in guilt-by-association cancel culture but he obviously does not share the views of the guest interviewed by Tucker Carlson,” Vance campaign spokesperson William Martin told CNN in a statement.

NH3YUSOGAG_EKZY1O7ERQG81GB,Biden prepared to block US Steel purchase by Nippon Steel,"By Chris Isidore, Kayla Tausche and Arlette Saenz, CNN","9 minute read Updated 9:00 PM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/04/business/us-steel-nippon-steel-chances/,"President Joe Biden is prepared to block Japan’s Nippon Steel’s proposed acquisition of US Steel, two sources familiar with the matter said, a move that would deal a major blow to the $14 billion merger that has become a lightning rod in an election year as candidates on both sides of the aisle vow to protect American manufacturing.
A White House official would not comment on the president’s decision but said the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which is investigating the proposed merger on national security grounds, has not transmitted its recommendations to Biden yet. The president would oppose the deal, one source said, if the CFIUS committee recommended the deal not go through or withheld a recommendation.
“CFIUS hasn’t transmitted a recommendation to the president, and that’s the next step in this process,” the White House official said.
Customarily, a final report from the committee informs a president’s view of the potential risks a deal poses. In this case, high-profile public opposition to a deal in advance of the report’s submission may end up influencing the recommendation the committee makes. Treasury chairs the committee, which is comprised of high-level officials from the president’s Cabinet agencies who are responsible for areas of national security.
One source said the president’s announcement could come as early as this week, but cautioned the timing remains fluid.
US Steel and Nippon Steel both indicated in statements that they’re open to legal fights to get the deal approved, no matter what actions is announced by Biden.
“We continue to stand by the fact that there are no national security issues associated with this transaction, as Japan is one of our most staunch allies,” US Steel said. “We fully expect to pursue all possible options under the law to ensure this transaction closes.”
In a statement, a spokesperson for Nippon Steel said the company has not received any updates on the CFIUS process.
“Since the outset of the regulatory review process, we have been clear with the administration that we do not believe this transaction creates any national security concerns,” according to the statement. “US Steel and the entire American steel industry will be on much stronger footing because of Nippon Steel’s investment in US Steel – an investment that Nippon Steel is the only willing and able party to do so.”
And Nippon Steel indicated it was not ready to give up the fight: “Nippon Steel strongly believes that the US government must appropriately handle procedures on this matter in accordance with the law.”
The news, first reported earlier Wednesday by the Washington Post, is not a surprise as Biden is on record opposing the deal, even as it was being considered by members of his administration.
Shares of US Steel (X) closed down 17.5% on the news at $29.37, well below the $55 a share that Nippon Steel agreed to pay for the stock back in December when the deal was announced.
The president had previously outlined opposition to the deal in March, saying it is “vital for it to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and operated.”
In addition to Biden’s stated opposition, Vice President Kamala Harris, former President Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance have all voiced opposition to the deal. Harris is the most recent to come out against the proposed purchase at a rally in Pittsburgh on Labor Day, in which she was introduced by Biden and spoke to members of the United Steelworkers union. The union has been a leading opponent of the agreement.
But there are risks if Biden undertakes the action. Earlier in the day Wednesday, US Steel issued a statement threatening to close its mills with unionized workers if it doesn’t get approval of the unpopular deal, a move that could put pressure on the United Steelworkers union to reach an agreement with the two companies that would clear the way for approval of Nippon’s purchase.
The Justice Department is also conducting an antitrust review of the potential merger.
US Steel has said that the multi-billion dollar investment from its Japanese rival would go further in shoring up the company’s facilities and finances than it could afford on its own.
“Without the Nippon Steel transaction, US Steel will largely pivot away from its blast furnace facilities, putting thousands of good-paying union jobs at risk, negatively impacting numerous communities across the locations where its facilities exist,” the company said in a statement Wednesday. It said it might also move its headquarters away from Pittsburgh without the deal.
The company said the $2.7 billion that Nippon Steel has pledged to invest in its unionized mills outside of Pittsburgh and in Gary, Indiana, would support the future of manufacturing at those facilities.
“Those investments are subject to the closing of the transaction with US Steel and receipt of necessary regulatory approvals,” US Steel said. “A stand-alone US Steel would not make the same financial commitments.”
The USW responded by accusing US Steel of making “baseless and unlawful threats,” and “a last gasp and desperate effort to save a merger on life support.” It said CEO David Burritt’s “reckless statements and mismanagement are the only true obstacle to US Steel remaining a sustainable steel company.”
As for the promised investment by Nippon Steel in the union-represented facilities, the union said, “a press release is not a contract, and Nippon has shown that when it puts its promises in writing, it fills its proposals with so many conditions as to make its commitments worthless.”
The USW did not immediately responded Wednesday afternoon to requests for comment on Biden’s expected action.
It is also not immediately clear if the action by Biden would kill the deal for good or would simply give the two steel companies and the union a chance to negotiate a deal that would be acceptable to all sides.
If the latter is the case, the political opposition to the deal and Biden’s action would give the union some bargaining leverage as well. Without the union changing its position and supporting the deal, it’s unlikely that the political opposition to the deal will change.
But there’s reason to think that if deal is not completely dead, it could yet win approval not only from regulators but also from the union now firmly opposed to the deal – although experts who believe that could happen say it wouldn’t occur until after the election.
The union, for example, is using its current political leverage to get the best possible deal from Nippon and US Steel, including even stronger promises to keep US Steel’s mills that employ union members open and financial protections for anyone who does lose a job, said Philip Gibbs, a steel analyst for KeyBanc, in an interview with CNN ahead of word of Biden’s plans.
“This might be the best possible deal for US Steel,” Gibbs said. “If a change in ownership is perhaps inevitable, if all roads lead to attrition, why not try to maximize the safety nets in writing. They want to make sure their families are taken care of.”
The proposed purchase was bound to be unpopular. US Steel was once a symbol of American industrial might. It was the most valuable company in the world and the first to be worth $1 billion soon after its creation in 1901. It was also crucial to the US economy and the cars, appliances, bridges and skyscrapers that tangibly indicated that strength. Decades of decline later, it is no longer even the largest US steelmaker, and a relatively minor employer.
But it is still not a company that politicians who enjoy talking about the American greatness want to see fall into foreign hands.
There are relatively few steelworkers still working for the company in the crucial electoral battleground state of Pennsylvania. US Steel says it has more than 3,000 employees in the state in its remaining steel mills along the Monongahela River just outside of Pittsburgh. But the company has tens of thousands of retirees still in the state, and many more voters whose parents, grandparents or even great-grandparents may have worked in its mills. It makes the idea of a Japanese purchase of the once powerful US company a politically fraught move, said Gibbs.

“You’re not just talking about the perception of the steelworkers, it’s the perception of the state itself,” said Gibbs. “As a politician you have to say you’re not going to stand by and let the deal happen.”
To try to assure its US critics, Nippon Steel issued a statement Wednesday promising that US Steel would continue to have a board of directors made up mostly of American citizens, and that Americans would also be a majority of management at the company. It also said there would be no transfer of any of US Steel’s production capacity or jobs outside the United States.
The union is concerned that Nippon is more interested in US Steel’s nonunion plants that use electric furnaces to make steel by melting scrap, rather than in the unionized mills, known as integrated steel mills, that still make steel from its raw materials, such as iron ore.
“Nippon has shown through their own actions that they’re changing the way they operate in Japan,” Gibbs said about the shift from integrated mills to electric furnaces there.
The union says it doesn’t believe in the promises made by Nippon Steel so far and that it remains opposed to the purchase. It said it believes that Nippon is interested in using US Steel’s finishing mills to finish slabs of steel it would produce in Japan and ship here, rather than producing the steel slab in blast furnaces in America.

“Nippon still has not provided any true guarantees that our jobs, wages or benefits will be protected beyond the expiration of our current agreements in 2026,” said a union statement last month. It did not answer a question from CNN asking if it is still talking with Nippon and US Steel about dropping opposition to the deal.
If the union does drop its opposition, it becomes much easier for politicians to allow it go through, Gibbs said, even if they would likely want to wait until after the election.
CFIUS is supposed to look into the national security implications of deals, and many of the politicians who have come out opposed to the deal claim it would be a threat to the nation’s long-term economic health. A number of experts argue that doesn’t hold up to scrutiny.
“Given the US-Japanese alliance, Nippon Steel’s record, and the US steel industry’s existing weaknesses, it is difficult if not impossible to identify a national security risk that justifies opposing the merger,” said Michael Leiter, head of Skadden’s CFIUS and National Security Practices, in an interview with CNN ahead of word of Biden’s plans. “It is much, much easier, however, to identify a political risk, and regrettably that calculus is dominating the issue.”

NI3KIUPC21_04KLSPJWMR7F49L,Former aide to New York governors charged with acting as an agent of the Chinese government,"By Gloria Pazmino and Mark Morales, CNN","8 minute read Updated 10:56 AM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240903,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/03/us/linda-sun-former-hochul-staff-arrest/,"A former aide to New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and former Gov. Andrew Cuomo was charged with acting as an agent for the Chinese government, US Attorney Breon Peace announced Tuesday.
Linda Sun, a former deputy chief of staff to Hochul and Cuomo aide, was charged with violating and conspiring to violate the Foreign Agents Registrations Act, visa fraud, alien smuggling and money laundering conspiracy, according to an unsealed copy of the indictment.
Her husband and co-defendant, Chris Hu, was also charged with money laundering conspiracy and conspiracy to commit bank fraud as well as misusing means of identification, prosecutors said.
Their home was raided by federal investigators in July, according to sources.
Sun acted as “an undisclosed agent of the Chinese government while her husband, Hu, facilitated the transfer of millions of dollars in kickbacks for personal gain,” prosecutors said in a news release.
While working for state government, Sun influenced the messaging of high-level state officials regarding issues of importance to China, blocked Taiwanese government representatives from access to the officials, and obtained official New York State proclamations for Chinese government representatives without authorization, prosecutors alleged in the indictment.
The couple’s arrest comes at a time when US-China relations remain fraught over a host of frictions including Beijing’s aggressions in the South China Sea and toward Taiwan, and US trade controls targeting China.
Sun and Hu were arrested at their Long Island residence Tuesday morning.
Sun and Hu both pleaded not guilty to all charges in federal court Tuesday afternoon. Sun’s bond is set at $1.5 million and her husband’s is set at $500,000. Both will have their travel limited to New York City, Long Island, Maine and New Hampshire. Their next court date was set for September 25.
During the hearing, prosecutors alleged the defendants used shell companies, iCloud accounts and WeChat messages – with everything in Mandarin – in their alleged crimes.
Defense attorney Seth DuCharme addressed reporters outside court Tuesday, saying “we have a lot of confidence in our case.”
“A lot of the allegations in this indictment are frankly perplexing, overly inflammatory,” he said. “As you heard in court today, we are looking forward to our day in court. The defendants are exercising their right to a speedy trial as soon as they can; we have a lot of confidence in Chris and in Linda.”
An attorney for Sun, Jarrod Schaeffer, told CNN the charges “are inflammatory and appear to be the product of an overly aggressive prosecution.”
“We are also troubled by aspects of the government’s investigation. As we said today in court, our client is eager … to defend against these accusations in the proper forum – a court of law,” Schaeffer said.
China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was unaware of the aide accused of working for China.
“I am not aware of the situation you mentioned,” spokesperson Mao Ning said, adding, “I will not comment on the domestic cases in the United States, but we oppose malicious associations and slander against China.”

Sun held several government titles for more than a decade. Public employment records and her LinkedIn profile show positions spanned across several agencies focused on New York’s economic development, labor and the executive chamber.
In 2009, Sun was hired as chief of staff in Rep. Grace Meng’s office when Meng was in the State Assembly. The administration of then-Gov. Andrew Cuomo then hired Sun in 2012, naming her director of Asian American affairs and Queens representative. Sun then became director of external affairs for Empire State Development, which handles economic development across the state. In 2018 the Cuomo administration re-hired her, naming her chief diversity officer; she later took a job in the state Department of Financial Services.
After Hochul ascended to the state’s top office in 2021, Sun was hired as deputy chief of staff, serving for about a year before heading for a post as deputy commissioner for strategic business at the Department of Labor, which terminated her employment in March 2023.
That 2023 firing happened after the governor’s office discovered “evidence of misconduct,” Hochul’s press secretary, Avi Small, said in a statement to CNN without elaborating about the misconduct.
“(We) immediately reported her actions to law enforcement and have assisted law enforcement throughout this process,” Small said.
Rich Azzopardi, a spokesperson for Cuomo, said in a statement that national security “must be free from foreign influence.”
“While Ms. Sun was promoted to deputy chief of staff in the subsequent administration, during our time she worked in a handful of agencies and was one of many community liaisons who had little to no interaction with the governor.”
Sun violated internal rules and state government protocols to benefit the Chinese government, according to court documents.
Among Sun’s activities, prosecutors say, she acted as an undisclosed agent of the People’s Republic of China and the Chinese Communist Party, acting at their request and engaging in political activities to further the interests of the CCP.
The indictment details an effort by Sun to secure “unauthorized invitation letters” from the office of the governor which were then used to facilitate travel by government officials with the People’s Republic of China into the United States for meetings with state officials in New York.
Sun’s unauthorized letters included false statements about immigration documents and “induced the foreign citizens into unlawfully entering the United States,” prosecutors wrote.
Prosecutors also allege she tried to “facilitate a trip” to China by a high-level, unnamed New York politician.
Sun and her husband received “substantial economic and other benefits” which included millions of dollars in transactions for PRC business activities of Hu, travel benefits, tickets to events, employment for Sun’s cousin in the PRC, a delivery of “Nanjing-style salted ducks prepared by a PRC official’s personal chef” that were then delivered to the residence of Sun’s parents, among others, according to the indictment.
They also laundered the monetary proceeds to buy real estate in New York and Hawaii and various luxury vehicles, according to the indictment.
Sun is accused of acting at the request of the Chinese government and the CCP to block representatives of the Taiwanese government from having access to state government officials because she knew CCP officials were “opposed to such diplomacy,” according to the court documents.
Prosecutors also said while the office of the governor did not have a position on recognizing Taiwan, Sun used her position to change both Cuomo’s and Hochul’s “messaging regarding issues of importance to the PRC and the CCP” and helped minimize interactions between the governor’s office and representatives from the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the US. Also known as TECO, the office serves as a de facto, yet unofficial, embassy to Taiwan. TECO maintains offices that provide consular and other services across various cities in the US, including New York.
Court documents show Sun used her position to block small shows of diplomacy. In January 2020, a TECO representative wrote a letter to Cuomo informing him of the latest presidential election results in Taiwan and requested a congratulatory message to be forwarded to Taipei. After an employee in the governor’s office flagged the request to Sun, she quickly blocked the effort, responding, “No letter; would set off political firestorm.”
By the time the pandemic arrived in New York, Sun was working behind the scenes to give Chinese officials access to New York government officials, prosecutors say. In one instance, prosecutors say Sun added a Chinese official to a “private New York State government conference call concerning the health response to the Covid-19 pandemic and the administration’s response to rising hate crimes against Asian Americans.” The call was not open to the public.
As the pandemic took hold, court documents say, Sun worked to ensure Cuomo was heaping public praise on Chinese officials for sending medical equipment to the city while simultaneously blocking Taiwan, which also sought public acknowledgment for providing 200,000 masks at the height of the pandemic that was ravaging New York.
In April 2020, a PRC official informed Sun that several Chinese foundations would donate 1,000 ventilators to the Greater New York Hospital Association, according to the indictment. In return, Sun told the official that Cuomo would call him to thank him for the donation. After waiting two hours for the call, the official complained that he had not yet heard from Cuomo. In turn, Sun apologized and indicated that Cuomo would thank him in public and on social media for facilitating the donation which was scheduled to arrive in New York the next day, according to the indictment.
Cuomo is not identified by name in the indictment, but his tenure as governor aligns with the timeline of the allegations.
An archived X post shows Cuomo posted a message of thanks from his government account the next day.
“We finally got some good news today. The Chinese government helped facilitate a donation of 1,000 ventilators that will arrive in JFK today. I thank the Chinese government, Jack Ma, Joe Tsai, the Jack Ma Foundation, the Tsai Foundation and Consul General Huang,” the post reads.
Hochul is furious, outraged and “absolutely shocked at how brazen” Sun’s behavior is alleged to have been, the governor said in an appearance Tuesday evening with WNYC radio.
“It was a betrayal of trust,” Hochul told WNYC about the allegations against Sun.
Hochul said her office fired Sun in 2023 “the second we discovered some levels of misconduct” and “alerted the authorities – and hence we ended up with what happened here today.”
When WNYC asked Hochul for details about why Sun was fired, the governor declined to give specifics, citing authorities’ investigation. The depth of the allegations against Sun were apparent to the governor and her staff only after reading details of the indictment, said Hochul, who emphasized to WNYC that Sun worked only 15 months for her administration and had initially been hired by the previous one.
New York State Senate Republican Leader Rob Ortt has called for an investigation into the alleged breach.
“The fact that a spy for a hostile nation was embedded at the highest levels of our state government under two administrations is an alarming security failure, jeopardizing both New York and the entire country,” Ortt said in a statement. “New York should be a beacon of freedom, a place where people flee from oppressive regimes, not a platform for spies to infiltrate our government and undermine our state and nation.”

NIRAPNL1NH_G93ZFV1WKRGVK85,Man charged with murder in connection with the deaths of a California couple at a nudist resort,"By Nicole Chavez, CNN","3 minute read Updated 10:30 PM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/03/us/missing-california-couple-murder-charges/,"A man was charged with murder on suspicion of killing his neighbors at a California nudist resort, San Bernardino County District Attorney Jason Anderson announced Tuesday afternoon in a news conference.
Michael Royce Sparks, 62, is facing two counts of murder in connection with the deaths of missing couple Daniel and Stephanie Menard, who are 79 and 73, authorities said.
The couple was last seen on August 24 at their home in the Olive Dell Ranch resort in San Bernardino County. Human remains were found underneath Sparks’ home after he was arrested last week, following a tense and lengthy standoff.
Police have said they believe the remains are those of the Menards, who lived next door.
“We know they’re dead, and we know there’s two victims,” Anderson said about the reasoning for the charges.
Sparks is set to appear in court Wednesday and is ineligible for bail, jail records show. CNN has been unable to identify an attorney for Sparks or locate family members.
• Redlands Police Chief Rachel Tolber said one of Sparks’ relatives led them to him. Hours prior to his arrest last week, a family member called police saying he was involved in the Menards’ disappearance.
He “had admitted to killing two people and was threatening suicide,” Tolber said about Sparks.
“I believe that there may have been other people that were texted, but the initial call that started our focus on him was from the family,” Tolber added.
Officials couldn’t discuss a potential motive for the killings and Anderson said it did not appear to be planned.
Police had been looking for the couple in the hills and canyon area around Olive Dell Ranch. The resort is between the southern California cities of Redlands and Colton, about 65 miles east of Los Angeles.
The search began after a friend who lives in the resort became worried for the Menards when they didn’t attend Sunday church service as usual. Their dog Cuddles, a white shih tzu, remains missing, police said on Tuesday.
Irene Engkraf, who identified herself as the person who contacted police about the Menards, told reporters last week that she saw the their car sitting “abandoned” down the road from their home.
When she entered the couple’s home using a spare key, Engkraf said she saw Stephanie’s purse and both of the Menards’ phones. Then she called 911 and hospitals in the area, searching for news of her friends.
After receiving a tip from Sparks’ family, police locked down the resort because they learned that he could be armed and barricaded, Tolber said.
Officers had been looking for him for several hours when they used a battering ram and a drone to search Sparks’ home, police said. They located him with a camera used to evaluate sewer blockages, Redlands Police Department spokesman Carl Baker said Friday.
He had been hiding inside a 5-foot deep concrete space under the home, which forced officers to remove the front wall of the house, Baker said.
Anderson, the district attorney, described the space as similar to a “homemade basement” area underneath the mobile home.
When officers discovered him, Sparks, who was armed and barricaded, attempted to shoot himself but his weapon misfired, police said. After “lengthy negotiations” with officers, Sparks surrendered voluntarily, Baker said.
A day after Sparks was arrested, firefighters and cadaver dogs found human remains under his home and spent several days searching the site, police said.
The search took days because of the state of the property, its potential collapse and the need to remove debris with heavy equipment.
Tolber declined to discuss more details about the remains and noted that police don’t have a reason to believe there are other victims.

The idea has re-entered the American political dialogue in the wake of a resurfaced clip of now-Republican vice-presidential candidate JD Vance criticizing some prominent Democrats as “childless cat ladies.”
Vance, who converted to Catholicism in 2019 and has written about his journey to joining the Catholic Church, also sent a series of emails that called Democratic leaders “childless sociopaths” who “don’t have a direct stake in this country.”
Pope Francis, 87, who is in Indonesia, the world’s most populous Muslim country, made his remarks to political leaders as part of a 12-day tour of Southeast Asia and the Pacific. He said, “You’re an example for everyone, for all the countries that maybe, and this might sound funny, these families prefer to have a cat or a little dog instead of a child.”
President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo laughed at the remark with Francis turning to him and saying, “it’s true, isn’t it?”
Francis has in the past criticized couples who choose to have pets rather than children, saying this “takes away our humanity.”
He has lamented low birth rates in Europe, particularly on his doorstep in Italy, and has backed plans by three government led by Giorgia Meloni to reverse the trend.
While US President Donald Trump’s running mate and Francis may agree on the importance of having children, the pope’s approach is at odds with Trumpism when it comes to migrants and climate change.
In 2016, Francis described then presidential candidate Trump’s plan to build a wall to stop migrants the US-Mexico border as “not Christian.”"
NKXYCWR1HK_EFTPQNZEFLPBP2V,This tourism experience costs $800 for an hour. Here’s why it’s worth it,"By Joe Minihane, CNN","8 minute read Updated 6:33 AM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/travel/uganda-gorillas-treks-sustainable-tourism/,"Editor’s Note: This CNN Travel series is, or was, sponsored by the country it highlights.

Kenya has the majestic Maasai Mara. The reputation of the verdant, fauna-filled Ngorongoro Crater in Tanzania precedes it. Rwanda’s Virunga volcanoes have become the go-to for once-in-a-lifetime encounters with mountain gorillas. And further south, Botswana, Namibia and South Africa are seen as essential stop-offs for those hungry to experience the best wildlife Africa has to offer.
Yet one country is easily forgotten when it comes to spending time in true wilderness and getting up close to nature: Uganda.
This East African gem has it all for the wildlife obsessive: the plains of Queen Elizabeth National Park, home to tree-climbing lions and leopards; the Kazinga Channel with its hippos, elephants, crocodiles and stunning fish eagles; and Bwindi Impenetrable Forest.
Quite simply, it’s underrated and waiting to be explored – especially one profound tourism experience that costs $800 an hour, but is said to be worth every single dollar.
That huge price tag is part of a pattern of big-budget experiences in Uganda that, although inaccessible to many wallets, could help set the country on the path to sustainable tourism at a time when many destinations are now being overwhelmed by visitors.
In Bwindi Impenetrable Forest, home to the largest mountain gorilla population in the world, with over 500 roaming the dense woodland, it costs $800 for foreign non-residents to head out on a strictly timed one-hour trek to meet a group of habituated gorillas. These are led by experts from the Uganda Wildlife Authority, with small groups of eight people assigned to visit one of 18 habituated groups each day.
For $1,500, visitors can take part in a habituation process. Those with a cold are not allowed to take part, such is the concern around passing on the disease to these incredible animals, which share 98% of their DNA with humans.
Although it’s possible to travel relatively cheaply on either side of this experience, many visitors make this bucket-list activity part of a premium adventure. Again, the high price tag usually results in money going to support the at-risk environment.
Volcanoes Safaris has been operating in the region for over 25 years and in July 2024 it opened its fourth luxury lodge in Uganda. Kibale Lodge sits in an unrivaled location, with the Rwenzori Mountains to the West and the Kazinga Channel to the south. With just eight rooms, or bandas, it’s at the very highest end of eco-tourism in Uganda, with rates starting at $1,200 per person per night. Volcanoes is, however, at pains to talk about how it leans on local knowledge and skills to create and sustain its business.
In Kibale it is working with the Jane Goodall Institute to organize community outreach programs, specifically working to build a new generation of women leaders in conservation. And throughout the construction of the lodge learning from local people was vital, says Volcanoes founder Praveen Moman.

“We work in ‘the barefoot villager’ style, sitting down together and working out practical local approaches to aesthetics, making everything locally, whatever the origin of the design,” he says.
“Volcanoes’ in-house construction team is comprised of engineers, fundis, decorators and upholsterers that live in the communities surrounding Volcanoes lodges,” adds Kevin James, Volcanoes Safaris’ chief operating officer.
For example, he says the company’s head of construction, Cyprien Serugero, was born near the Virunga Lodge across the border in Rwanda. He was involved at every stage of the construction of that lodge and now ensures that those living close to the sites in Uganda are able to enjoy the same opportunity.
James says that the company employs over 200 full-time and 300 casual staff from Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Some 85% of those who work at the lodges themselves are drawn from the communities which surround them.
While this work has been successful, one of the biggest issues surrounding sustainable tourism in Uganda centers on “conservation refugees.” The Batwa were forcibly removed from Gahinga and Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Parks on their creation in 1991. While gorilla populations in these areas rebounded, these hunter-gatherers, one of the oldest indigenous tribes in the entire continent, became displaced within their own country. No compensation was paid and years of ostracization followed. With the tribe unused to traditional farming methods, they have faced persecution and discrimination at every turn.
“We believe that the focus of conservation and tourism must be on communities,” says James.
“Local people will only be supporters of tourism and conservation if they receive a tangible benefit. They need to have food on the table, education for the next generation, and progress in their lives. If they are part of the ecotourism and conservation chain and share in its success, then they have an incentive to protect the wildlife and the parks.”

At Volcanoes’ Gahinga Lodge there is a 13-acre permanent Batwa settlement, home to 100 people from 18 families. There is land for crops, a dedicated vocational center for training and passing down ancient rites to the next generation and the opportunity for guests to meet elders and tribal leaders to learn directly about their way of life. It’s a powerful experience and one that lingers long in the mind after visiting.
“The forest is heavily guarded, we know we could be shot [if we go there],” said Batwa tribal leader Safari Monday, speaking his native Rufumbira dialect via an interpreter, back in 2019. “But I understand the restrictions. I don’t think about it.”
Monday spread his arms wide and grinned as he took in what was now his and that of his fellow tribespeople. A place to call home after four years living beneath makeshift shelters. It’s not the same as being in his native habitat, but does go some way to redress the balance and create a path towards a better future.
There is no denying that the model of highly priced, high-quality tourism has the potential to be successful when considered from a sustainability angle, at least when it comes to nature. It’s evident in the numbers of mountain gorillas in particular. According to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the population stood at over 1,000 in 2018 when the last census was conducted, up from 680 in 2008. This is believed to be a direct result of expensive, heavily policed gorilla treks.
While costly, the money raised from the treks allows the UWA and other authorities to pay for greater protection of mountain gorillas from illegal poachers and to prevent devastating habitat loss. Being just a few meters from a mother tending to her young or a silverback staring gruffly into the middle distance is unquestionably one of the most profound things a traveler can do and paying all that money makes a lot of sense.
While such costs may seem extreme, the alternative is something operators cannot entertain, especially when the environment is so fragile and the imperative of balancing the needs of local communities so vital.
According to UK-based operator Responsible Travel, charging high prices and guarding the experience so heavily is key.
“When it comes to the mountain gorillas, low tourist numbers and heavy restrictions are not simply a gimmick,” it says, “… they are essential to prevent the gorillas from becoming distressed or from catching diseases.”

Moreover, local people and the environment won’t see any benefit from a mass tourism model which has caused so many issues across the planet, particularly in famously fragile ecosystems such as Australia’s Great Barrier Reef and Vietnam’s Ha Long Bay.
“The great ape national parks of Uganda and Rwanda are tiny natural habitats under immense pressure,” says Kevin James. “There is increasing population pressure around the parks, which is predicted to double in the next 25 years. Local people need land to live on and from which to make a living. If development is not controlled around National Parks, wildlife could be overwhelmed.”
Despite this, he says, tourism, and especially sustainable tourism, has to be part of the solution.
“Volcanoes has seen that without tourism the animals have no value and therefore there’s no economic incentive to safeguard their future. Sensitive and controlled tourism is crucial. However, if tourism is uncontrolled, it risks putting undue pressure through disease and stress on the great apes which will not be conducive to their survival.
“It is imperative that the unique tourism protocols and IUCN best practices guidelines are followed to ensure a positive future for the great apes in the Albertine Rift. It is a very delicate balance.”
According to EU Africa Rise, a European Union-funded body that supports sustainability in East Africa, tourism accounted for 5.9% of Uganda’s GDP in 2019, with a growing awareness of the need for sustainable certification, something which can be expensive for start-ups and small operators.
“Although Uganda struggles internationally with its brand recognition and image (especially compared with regional peers such as Kenya and Tanzania), it does receive very high satisfaction ratings from travelers that visit the country,” according to EU Africa Rise, in a March 2024 report entitled “Towards a Sustainable Tourism economy in Uganda.”
Despite this, there is a growing push towards creating a high-quality experience for travelers in Uganda that is, crucially, both sustainable in terms of development and employment, and where local people are made to feel part of that work.
According to the Adventure Travel Trade Association’s Annual Industry Snapshot Report from June 2023, cited by EU Africa Rise, 68% of operators surveyed had obtained or were trying to gain sustainable certification globally. Yet the Global Sustainable Tourism Criteria, considered the sustainability gold standard for operators, alongside Travelife, a similar certification platform, are seen as too costly by tourism businesses in Uganda. EU Africa Rise says there needs to be a more cost-effective way for Ugandan businesses to gain such recognition, which would in turn allow them to market themselves as among the best in the world.
That Volcanoes, Responsible Travel and EU Africa Rise are doing such important work means that sustainable tourism can grow and even thrive in Uganda. But it needs to be based around a model where expensive trips that fund research and communities come first, all the better to stop these places being overwhelmed and potentially lost forever."

“I was looking through — I can’t remember if it was a phone book,” the “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice” star told People about the origin of his use of Keaton. “I must’ve gone, ‘I don’t know, let me think of something here.’ And I went, ‘Oh, that sounds reasonable.’”
The now 72-year-old actor explained that while he was born “Michael Douglas,” he was unable to use that name in Hollywood given that another Oscar-winning actor and the son of Kirk Douglas, Michael Douglas, was already using it.
Mike Douglas was also spoken for by the famous talk-show host.
The Screen Actors Guild prohibits two performers from using the same name, so Keaton chose Keaton. And while he’s made quite an accomplished name for himself, the actor would like to be known professionally as “Michael Keaton Douglas.”
He planned on doing just that for his recent directorial effort “Knox Goes Away.” In the hustle of making the film, however, Keaton forgot to seal it on screen.
“I said, ‘Hey, just as a warning, my credit is going to be Michael Keaton Douglas.’ And it totally got away from me,” he explained. “And I forgot to give them enough time to put it in and create that. But that will happen.”

Mohammed Mansour, a journalist for the Palestinian news agency WAFA, was injured when the car he was driving was struck by gunfire, according to video of the aftermath and his employer.
Footage filmed in the car by freelance journalist Jarah Khalaf shows a chaotic scene, as Mansour races through the streets and blood pours from his leg. All journalists were wearing flak jackets with “press” labels, and the car bore a “press” identifier on its hood.
“The occupation surprised us by shooting at us directly. Our colleague Mohammed Mansour was here in this car,” said Khalaf. “The army shot at us more than once, even though we had press signs and were wearing body armor and everything.”

WAFA said that the Israeli military “fired live bullets directly at the vehicle,” which was carrying four journalists reporting on the Tuesday raid. The Palestine Red Crescent Society said that it treated four journalists who were injured by gunfire and shrapnel.
CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for comment.
Violence from the Israeli offensive in Gaza since the Hamas-led October 7 attacks has spilled into the occupied West Bank in recent months. The IDF unleashed a barrage of raids and airstrikes in multiple parts of the territory on August 28 – including in the cities of Jenin, Tubas and Tulkarem – bulldozing highways and razing buildings to rubble.
The IDF has said that its operations in the West Bank are necessary “in order to remove immediate terror threats in real time.”
Humanitarian groups have accused the Israeli military of using disproportionate force against Palestinian residents, inflicting severe damage on critical infrastructure and disrupting health care services. On Tuesday, a UN spokesperson warned that Israeli forces are using “lethal war-like tactics” in the occupied territory, with people being killed, injured and displaced – and have blocked critical access to aid organizations.
On Monday, two Palestinian journalists were injured by shrapnel and had to dodge Israeli bulldozers while covering the devastation left by forces in the city of Jenin, according to video obtained by CNN and interviews with the journalists. The sound of gunfire can be heard in the background.
In another video, reporters film Israeli military bulldozers tearing up the surface of a street in Jenin. The IDF says this is done to find and dismantle explosive devices.
“This was one of the craziest and most dangerous days of coverage, as we were directly targeted,” Shatha Hanaysha, a reporter for the Mondoweiss news website, said on Monday. She told CNN that she sustained minor shrapnel injuries to her leg. “We saw Israeli journalists with the military today … While they fire at us, they treat the Israeli journalists in a different way. These are double standards.”
Khalaf said he was also among the journalists filming the Israeli military bulldozers on Monday, when suddenly “a bulldozer started backing on us.”
“We moved down the road when the bulldozer turned … and chased after us,” added Khalaf. “We were trapped behind a wall, but the bulldozer kept coming forward toward us when it started destroying shops and the sidewalk we were on. We were trapped for a few minutes before we managed to get away.”
Israeli forces have killed 33 Palestinians in the West Bank, including six children and two elderly people, since launching the operation last month, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah. Another 130 people have been injured. The ministry does not differentiate between civilians and militants.
The Al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas’ armed wing, said Friday that three of its members had been killed."
O8VIYELFZJ_UG5I8SH6WHJXVY0,"Harris campaign has agreed to debate rules, including muted mics","By MJ Lee, CNN","4 minute read Updated 10:55 PM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/04/politics/harris-trump-abc-debate-rules-microphones/,"Kamala Harris’ campaign has accepted the terms of next week’s presidential debate with former President Donald Trump, including the fact that the candidates’ microphones will be muted when it is not their turn to speak, according to a person familiar with the debate negotiations.
However, in a letter to ABC News Wednesday afternoon agreeing to the rules, the Harris campaign again laid out their objections to the muted mics condition, insisting that they believe the vice president will be “disadvantaged” by the format.
“Vice President Harris, a former prosecutor, will be fundamentally disadvantaged by this format, which will serve to shield Donald Trump from direct exchanges with the Vice President. We suspect this is the primary reason for his campaign’s insistence on muted microphones,” the letter from the Harris campaign to the network, shared in part with CNN, said.
ABC News officially announced the rules later Wednesday, noting that both candidates had agreed to the format.

The network, according to the source familiar, has offered assurances to the Harris campaign that if there is significant cross talk between Harris and Trump, it may choose to turn on the mics so that the public can understand what is happening, the moderator would discourage either candidate from interrupting constantly and the moderator would also work to explain to viewers what is being said.
Pool reporters, who can report on what they hear both sides saying, will also be in the room, the source added.
“Beyond the debate rules published today, which were mutually agreed upon by two campaigns on May 15th, we have made no other agreements,” an ABC News spokesperson told CNN.
The campaign wrote in its letter that it was accepting the terms so as not to risk Trump pulling out of the debate.
“Notwithstanding our concerns, we understand that Donald Trump is a risk to skip the debate altogether, as he has threatened to do previously, if we do not accede to his preferred format,” the campaign said. “We do not want to jeopardize the debate. For this reason, we accept the full set of rules proposed by ABC, including muted microphones.”
The former president on Wednesday said he was going to “let her talk” when asked about the upcoming debate with Harris.
“You know when I had Biden, you and I had the same discussion, and I let him talk. I’m going to let her talk,” Trump said to Fox News host Sean Hannity during a town hall in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.
“It depends a lot on ABC, will they be fair or not?” Trump said. “I hope they will be fair.”
Trump, according to ABC News, won a virtual coin flip held earlier in the week to determine podium placement and order of closing statements during the debate. Trump chose to offer the last closing statement, and Harris chose the right podium position on screen.
The Trump campaign had previously accepted the rules governing the September 10 matchup.
The former president addressed the issue of microphones during an event in Virginia last week, saying: “We agreed to the same rules, I don’t know, doesn’t matter to me, I’d rather have it probably on, but the agreement was that it would be the same as it was last time.”
But in a post on his Truth Social platform the next day, Trump added, “The Rules will be the same as the last CNN Debate, which seemed to work out well for everyone except, perhaps, Crooked Joe Biden.”
ABC’s rules, first shared with the campaigns last month, largely mirror the format of CNN’s presidential debate in June between Trump and President Joe Biden, during which the candidates’ microphones were muted as their opponent spoke. It was a rule that the Biden campaign had insisted on but something the Harris campaign had sought to change after she became a presidential candidate.
The network’s rules also state that there will be no audience, the candidates will not be permitted to have written notes, no staff can visit them during the two commercial breaks and the candidates cannot ask questions of one another.

The beluga, nicknamed Hvaldimir, rose to fame in 2019 after being spotted wearing a specially-made harness with mounts for a camera, sparking claims that the animal may have been trained by the Russian military.
Two Norwegian animal rights groups alleged on Wednesday that the whale was “shot to death” after Hvaldimir was found dead over the weekend in southern Norway.
OneWhale and NOAH are calling for a criminal investigation “based on compelling evidence that the whale was killed by gunshot wounds,” OneWhale, which describes itself as a “nonprofit committed to protecting Hvaldimir and relocating him to a wild population of belugas,” wrote in an Instagram post.
It added that “several veterinarians, biologists, and ballistics experts have reviewed [the] evidence of Hvaldimir’s injuries, determining that the whale’s death was the result of a criminal act.”
The post included pictures of what appeared to be holes and streaks of blood on the lifeless body of the whale. CNN is unable to independently verify their claim that the whale was shot.
The organizations filed a police report to the Sandnes Police District and the Norwegian National Authority for Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime.
The Southwestern Police District confirmed to CNN on Wednesday that it has received a request to investigate the death of Hvaldimir, though the unit has not yet determined whether it will open a formal inquiry.
“I don’t think we’ve had a case like this before,” said Southwestern Police District Superintendent Victor Fenne-jensen, who declined to comment on whether his department had investigated rumors that the whale was a Russian spy.
He added, Hvaldimir was “kind of a celebrity.”
However, Marine Mind, another non-profit that advocates for protecting marine life, has called the public to “refrain from speculation” until the country’s Veterinary Institute has finished its own investigation.
It was Marine Mind that found Hvaldimir’s body in the bay. “When we found Hvaldimir on Saturday, it was not possible to immediately determine the cause of death, and therefore it is important to refrain from speculation until the institute has completed its work,” Marine Mind posted to its Facebook page on Wednesday.

Before Hvaldimir’s death, OneWhale and NOAH had been collaborating to relocate him to a safer area in northern Norway, and had obtained permits from the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries. CNN has reached out to the Norwegian Ministry of Climate and Environment for comment.
Norwegian public broadcaster NRK reported that his body was found floating at the Risavika Bay in southern Norway Saturday by a father and son who were fishing, according to the Associated Press (AP).
The beluga, named by combining the Norwegian word for whale — hval — and the first name of Russian President Vladimir Putin, was lifted out of the water with a crane and taken to a nearby harbor where experts for experts to examine, AP reported.
Marine biologist Sebastian Strand told NRK Hvaldimir’s cause of death was not immediately clear and that no major external injuries were visible on the animal, the AP reported.
Back in 2019, experts told CNN that Hvaldimir was a trained animal, and evidence suggested that the whale had come from Russia.
Jorgen Ree Wiig, a marine biologist at Norway’s Directorate of Fisheries, told CNN that the Hvaldimir’s harness appeared “specially made” and had “mounts for GoPro cameras on each side of it.”
That the harness clips read “Equipment St. Petersburg” only contributed to the popular theory that he came from Murmansk, Russia, and was trained by the Russian navy."

McKellen fell in June during a performance of “Player Kings,” a new version of Shakespeare’s “Henry IV,” in London.

Although May is most famous as a founding member of Queen and for writing some of the legendary rock band’s biggest hits, including “We Will Rock You” and “Who Wants to Live Forever,” he has also enjoyed a career as an astrophysicist and animal rights activist.
“Good news is that I can play guitar after the events of the last few days,” he said, adding that it “was a little scary” but that he “had the most fantastic care and attention from Frimley Hospital.”

He said he was “okay” and “just doing what I’m told, which is basically nothing,” listing the things he can’t do at the moment like drive, get on a plane or raise his heart rate too high.
As he spoke, a plane flew overhead and he joked that “I’m not allowed to have planes flying over, which will stress me.”
Later in the video, May also spoke about his recently released documentary detailing his decade-long campaign to stop Britain’s controversial badger cull.
The musician has suffered from a series of health issues in recent years.
In May 2020, he had a heart attack, after which he had three stents – short, wire-mesh tubes that act like a scaffold to help keep an artery open – put in to alleviate the danger of blood supply being blocked from the heart.

Later this month it could add a strike by 32,000 workers to its list of woes.
The contract between Boeing and the International Association of Machinists is due to expire at 11:59 pm PT on September 12. Without a new contract, the workers who build its planes in Washington state are set to start the first strike at the company in 16 years. And right now, the chances of a deal don’t look good, according to the head of the union local.
“We’re far apart is on all the main issues — wages, health care, retirement, time off,” Jon Holden, president of IAM District 751, told CNN this past week. “We continue to work through that, but it’s been a tough slog to get through.”
It’s just the latest in a series of serious and high-profile problems at a company that has dealt with fatal crashes traced to a design flaw in its best-selling jet, accusations that it put profits and production speed ahead of quality and safety, tanking aircraft sales, an agreement to plead guilty to criminal charges that it deceived regulators, and massive financial losses covered by soaring levels of debt.
Both sides say they want to reach a deal without a strike. But the anger of rank-and-file union members over recent contract concessions and difficulties at the once-proud company could make reaching that deal in the short time remaining a tall order.
The launch of Boeing’s long-delayed 777X aircraft has encountered another problem, forcing the company to pause testing and dealing yet another blow to Boeing's reputation. CNN’s Tom Foreman reports.

“We continue to bargain in good faith as we focus on the topics that are important to our employees and their families,” said a statement from Boeing. “We’re confident we can reach a deal that balances the needs of our employees and the business realities we face as a company.”
But Holden said that any deal that can win the support of the rank-and-file needs to recapture some of the concessions the union gave up in two previous agreements since 2008.
Both those talks were contract extensions, rather than negotiations for new deals. And in both cases the union felt forced to agree to concessions, including increased payments by members for health insurance and the loss of traditional pension plans, or risk losing thousands of jobs. Boeing was threatening to build nonunion facilities to handle the production of the 737 Max and the 777X. Boeing, which has one non-union 787 Dreamliner plant in South Carolina, dropped plans to move production of the Max and 777X after the labor deals were reached.
Boeing goes into these talks with a brand new CEO, Kelly Ortberg, who started the job on August 8. He issued a statement that he wants to “reset our relationship” with the union after meeting with Holden and other union leadership in his first week on the job. But Holden said he has not seen any differences in Boeing’s stance at the bargaining table.
Ortberg’s predecessor, former CEO Dave Calhoun, also told investors in July that Boeing’s intention is to avoid a strike and seemed to signal it’d be willing to pay what it takes to avoid a work stoppage.

“We know wage asks will be big,” he said. “We’re not afraid to treat our employees well in this process. So, we’re just going to work as hard as we can not to have a strike.”
The company said that wages for IAM members have increased 60% over the last 10 years due to general wage increases, cost-of-living adjustments and incentive pay. But the union is still angry over the earlier concessions. It is also seeking improved time off and also better job guarantees so it won’t be faced once again with the threat of losing work to nonunion plants.
“We cannot go through another period where a year or two from now where our jobs are threatened,” Holden said,
Numerous unions, including the Teamsters at UPS and the United Auto Workers union at GM, Ford and Stellantis, won double-digit wage increases in recent union deals. But in those and many other cases, they were negotiating with companies making record profits and with plenty of resources to satisfy union demands.
By contrast, the problems at Boeing have resulted in $33.3 billion in core operating losses over the course of the last five years, forcing the company to go deeply into debt. It is in danger of having that debt downgraded to junk bond status, but Holden insists that the union still has leverage in these talks.
Despite its problems, Boeing is still a major force in the US economy and shutting it down will have a wide-ranging impact. Beyond the 32,000 union members out of the nearly 150,000 US employees, the company estimates its own economic impact at $79 billion, supporting 1.6 million direct and indirect jobs at more than 9,900 suppliers spread across all 50 states.
But perhaps more importantly, Boeing is one of only two major suppliers of commercial jets to the airline industry. And the industry is already dealing with Boeing’s delayed deliveries that can’t be ramped back up until it addresses questions about the safety and quality of its planes.
“They haven’t said they can’t afford our proposals,” he said. “They  are reasonable. We’re in a tough position because of decisions they made to keep increasing the dividend and share repurchases, cutting R&D. They’ve been paralyzed to launch a new airplane. It’s because of those decisions and the crashes that we’re in this position.”
One of the union’s bargaining goals is to get a union representative on the Boeing board of directors, which has faced harsh criticism for the company’s many problems.
“The board certainly deserves to be criticized,” Holden said. “We don’t want to run the company. But we want to make sure our voices are being heard about the decisions being made. We love the Boeing Company. It’s the people on the board who don’t. They sacrificed its integrity.”"
OUT1SY5TF5_X32MP84CMAJM6G8,New Zealand is tripling its tourist tax,"By Lilit Marcus, CNN","3 minute read Published 1:01 AM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240903,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/travel/new-zealand-tripling-its-tourist-tax-intl-hnk/,"It will now be more expensive to visit New Zealand’s lakes, mountains, bike trails and wineries as the country is increasing its International Visitor Conservation and Tourism Levy (IVL) from NZ$35 ($22) to NZ$100 ($62) from October 1.
“International tourism also comes with costs to local communities, including additional pressure on regional infrastructure and higher upkeep and maintenance costs across our conservation estate,” Matt Doocey, New Zealand’s Minister for Hospitality and Tourism, said in a statement announcing the news.
The IVL, which was originally introduced in 2019, is intended to help cover the costs of environmental protection around the country. According to Doocey, international tourists spent more than $11 billion in New Zealand between March 2023 and March 2024.
But not everyone is happy with the price hike.
Tourism Industry Aotearoa (TIA), a consortium of travel industry professionals from across the country, criticized the decision.
“New Zealand’s tourism recovery is falling behind the rest of the world, and this will further dent our global competitiveness,” the group said in a statement. The group believes that New Zealand will lose tourists to Canada and the UK, where flights are more plentiful and entry fees less prohibitive.

The IVL is not the only added cost that will hit tourists visiting New Zealand.
Higher prices for tourist visas kick in on October 1, going from $131 to $211.
Citizens of 60 countries and territories, including the United States, Canada, Singapore, Japan and Mexico, can enter New Zealand are eligible for a visa waiver that will allow them to stay up to three months in the country for tourism purposes. Travelers holding these passports are still required to get an e-visa and pay the IVL.
Due to the new rules, the government expects that it will take longer for visas to be processed this year. Immigration New Zealand announced that people hoping to visit during the Christmas holiday period should apply for tourist visas no later than October 15 and those planning to come for Lunar New Year should get their applications in by November 15.
Whether they’re called an IVL, an access fee, or a travel incentive, “tourist taxes” are one of the hottest conversations in the travel industry right now.
Some 60 destinations around the world, from Venice to Bhutan, charge some kind of fee for travelers simply to enter and visit – not including the costs of meals, hotels, or admission tickets. Nearly all of the places with these tourist taxes say that the fee is necessary to offset the congestion, environmental damage and other side effects of overtourism.
And it doesn’t look like these fees are going away any time soon. Edinburgh, Scotland and Zermatt, Switzerland are among the places considering charging fees in the future.
According to a study from Bangor University in Wales, “there is little evidence of tourists being put off from visiting” destinations that have tourist taxes."

The group, known as FENAMAD, defends the rights of Peru’s Indigenous peoples. It says tensions between loggers and Indigenous tribes are on the rise and more government protective action is needed.
Two other loggers in the attack were missing and another was injured, FENAMAD said, and rescue efforts were underway.

The rights group, which represents 39 Indigenous communities in the Cusco and Madre de Dios regions in southeastern Peru, said the incident took place on August 29 in the Pariamanu river basin while loggers were expanding their passageways into the forest and came into contact with the reclusive and renowned territorial tribe.
“The Peruvian state has not taken preventive and protective measures to ensure the lives and integrity of the workers who have been gravely affected,” the group said in a statement Tuesday, adding authorities have yet to arrive in the area since the incident.
FENAMAD said the attack happened just 25 kilometers (15.5 miles) from a July incident, when the Mashco Piro again attacked loggers. The group said in their statement that even though they advised the government of the risk of a rise in violence, nothing has been done.
“It’s a heated and tense situation,” said Cesar Ipenza, an Amazon-based lawyer who specializes in environmental law in Peru. “Undoubtedly, every day there are more tensions between Indigenous peoples in isolation and the different activities that are within the territory that they ancestrally pass through.”
There have been several other previous reports of conflicts. In one incident in 2022, two loggers were shot with arrows while fishing, one fatally, in an encounter with tribal members.

In January, Peru loosened restrictions on deforestation, which critics dubbed the “anti-forest law.” Researchers have since warned of the rise in deforestation for agriculture and how it is making it easier for illicit logging and mining.
Ipenaza said some effort has been made by authorities in the area, like mobilizing a helicopter, but overall there has been “little commitment” by Peru’s Ministry of Culture, responsible for the protection of Indigenous peoples.
The Ministry of Culture did not immediately respond to a message Wednesday seeking comment on the attack and their protection efforts.
The attack took place a day before the Forest Stewardship Council suspended the sustainability certification of a logging company for eight months which rights groups and activists have accused of encroaching on the Indigenous group’s land.
“It’s absurd that certifiers like the FSC keep the certification of companies that clearly and openly violate basic human rights and Indigenous rights,” said Julia Urrunaga, director of the Peru program at the Environmental Investigation Agency. “How terrible that people have to keep dying and that it has to be an international scandal for action to be taken.”"
OZUST2V3QB_CRWV0YFLRRVC1O2,"Netanyahu derailed a potential Gaza hostage deal in July, Israeli newspaper reports","By Mick Krever, Becky Anderson, Jeremy Diamond and Dana Karni, CNN","7 minute read Updated 6:50 PM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/04/middleeast/netanyahu-derailed-hostage-deal-in-july-intl/,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in July effectively spiked a draft hostage and ceasefire deal by introducing a raft of new, 11th-hour demands, according to a report by the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth citing a document it obtained.
The report lends credence to charges often leveled at the prime minister – most notably by hostage families – of purposefully prolonging the war and torpedoing deals for his political benefit. Far-right members of Netanyahu’s coalition have pledged to bring down the government should he end the war.
Several news outlets, including CNN, have reported on the late July demands made by Netanyahu, but this is the first time the Israeli document has been obtained in full.
Among the 11th-hour demands, according to the newspaper, was that Israel retain control of the Egypt-Gaza border area – a condition Netanyahu has since portrayed as non-negotiable, including at a press conference on Wednesday.
Yedioth Ahronoth also reported that at least three of six hostages found dead in Gaza by the Israel Defense Forces over the weekend were due for release as part of the May draft agreement – Carmel Gat, Aden Yerushalmi, and Hersh Goldberg-Polin.
The Israeli Prime Minister’s Office in August confirmed to CNN the existence of the document but denied that it added “new conditions to the May 27 proposal.” The statement came in response to a report by the same Israeli correspondent who wrote the Yedioth Ahronoth report, Ronen Bergman, this time in The New York Times.

A senior Israeli official on Wednesday said the new report was “misinformed, misleading and hampers the chance of achieving the release of hostages.”
But separately, an Israeli source familiar with the talks said Netanyahu’s demands were to blame for the deaths of the hostages over the weekend.
“Two months ago, when he (Netanyahu) put the obstacles, he said no to the deal,” the source told CNN. “The hostages died because he insisted.”
The Hostages Families Forum said this weekend that “the finding of the bodies yesterday is a direct result of Netanyahu’s thwarting of the deals.”
On July 25, a senior US Administration official told CNN that negotiators were “closer than we’ve ever been” and that it was “up to the Israelis to accept it.”
Yedioth Ahronoth reported that rather than accepting that proposal, the Israeli negotiators submitted new demands, making changes to the proposals they themselves had originally made.
The new demands were nicknamed the “Netanyahu Outline,” the newspaper reported.
Hamas at the time said that Netanyahu had “returned to the strategy of procrastination, evasion, and avoiding reaching an agreement by setting new conditions and demands.”
Bergman, writing in Hebrew, wrote in Tuesday’s report that among the new demands was that Israeli forces continue to occupy the Egypt-Gaza border area, known as the Philadelphi Corridor, and maintain a 1.4-kilometer perimeter in Gaza along the Israeli border. The newspaper posted maps reportedly from the late-July Israeli response. The original May 27 proposal, according to Yedioth Ahronoth, offered an eventual full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.
The Israeli source familiar with the talks who spoke to CNN said: “The moment he (Netanyahu) insisted to stay in Rafah, to stay in the Philadelphi corridor, it was very clear that it was an obstacle.”
At Wednesday’s press conference, at which only foreign media were allowed, Netanyahu doubled down on his argument that control of the corridor is central to Israel’s war aims.
“The first war goal was to destroy Hamas’ military and governing capabilities. The second was to free our hostages, and the third was to ensure that Gaza never again poses a threat to Israel. And all three of those goals – all three of them – go through Israel’s control of the Philadelphi corridor,” Netanyahu said in English.
Israel’s prior lack of control of the corridor had allowed Iran to arm Hamas, the prime minister argued, adding, “It’s clear Gaza must be demilitarized, and it can only be demilitarized if the Philadelphi corridor remains under firm control and is not a supply line for armaments and for terror equipment.”
However, he insisted he was still willing to make a deal, saying, “The real obstacle to making a deal is not Israel, and it’s not me. It’s Hamas.”
In a Telegram post Wednesday, Hamas condemned Netanyahu’s refusal to withdraw from the corridor, saying it was an attempt to “thwart reaching an agreement.”
Frustration at what many see as Netanyahu’s failure to secure a deal has continued to mount in Israel, with demonstrations on Wednesday marking the fourth straight day of protests since the bodies of the six hostages were found.
Large crowds of protesters gathered outside the homes of members of the Knesset (Israel’s parliament) on Wednesday night to demand a deal be reached, according to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.
Videos released by the forum show demonstrations in various cities, including Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.
Protests also took place outside the Israel Defense Force’s (IDF) Kirya headquarters in Tel Aviv.
In a sign of the growing hostility toward Netanyahu, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum demanded Wednesday that he stop wearing the yellow ribbon pin, which has become a symbol of support for the hostages.
However, it was clearly visible on the Israeli prime minister’s lapel during the press conference Wednesday – a meeting where CNN’s Jeremy Diamond pressed him to answer the question of a hostage’s wife who wanted to know if her husband, Israeli-American Keith Siegel, would come back alive or dead.
“I spoke to Aviva Siegel tonight… she told me that she believes that you are sentencing her husband Keith to die by prioritizing the Philadelphi Corridor over a deal, and she has this question for you: is Keith going to come home alive or dead?” Diamond asked.
Netanyahu responded, “I’ll do everything to make sure that Keith and all the other hostages come back” – though he did not reply specifically to the alive or dead part of the question.
“I’m telling you that if we relieve the pressure, if we get out of the Philadelphi Corridor, we’re not going to get the hostages back,” the Israeli prime minister continued. “Certainly, we’re going to condemn a lot of them to stay there.”
He went on to say he could “understand the torment of families,” adding that many of the families also did not believe Israel would be able to get hostages released during November’s temporary truce or previous negotiations. “I believe that our strategy is the best way to achieve both goals – both releasing, freeing the hostages and ensuring that Gaza never poses a threat to Israel again.”
A diplomatic source familiar with the matter told CNN on Wednesday that there would be no ceasefire deal until Israel and Hamas settle the dispute around the deployment of Israeli troops along the Philadelphi corridor.
“Things are very tense. Very much up in the air,” the source said.
David Barnea, the director of Israel’s intelligence agency Mossad, met on Monday with officials from Qatar, which is mediating a deal, but there are “no meetings this week and nothing planned,” the source said.
CNN understands that during his visit to Doha, Barnea insinuated that while troop withdrawal from the Philadelphi corridor in Phase One of a deal is not up for discussion, it may be possible in Phase Two.
In its report on Tuesday, Yedioth said Israeli negotiators in July insisted as part of their new demands on specific guarantees that Palestinian civilians be allowed to return to northern Gaza would not bring weapons with them.
Netanyahu’s team, also for the first time, submitted a list of 40 hostages it wanted released as part of a first phase of a potential agreement, the paper reported. It added that the move was controversial because the Israeli negotiators were themselves determining whom they considered to be “sick,” and thus eligible for release, rather than leaving it vague.
Finally, the newspaper reported that the new Israeli demands said a specific group of long-term Palestinian prisoners to be exchanged for female Israeli soldiers be sent “abroad” after their release, rather than – as the previous agreement reportedly stated – “abroad or into Gaza.”
In its August statement to CNN, the Prime Minister’s Office said that this proposal did “not introduce new terms. To the contrary, it includes essential clarifications to help implement the May 27 proposal.”

P8N1WLIKJR_Q0TCB0KO2BTKIA7,Cathay Pacific inspects entire A350 fleet after finding engine problems,"By Chris Lau and Juliana Liu, CNN","4 minute read Updated 3:42 AM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240903,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/02/business/hong-kong-cathay-pacific-a350-hnk-intl/,"Hong Kong’s flag carrier Cathay Pacific has canceled dozens of flights as it conducts an inspection of its entire Airbus A350 fleet after finding engine problems affecting the plane.
The airline, one of the world’s largest users of the long-haul jet, said it identified an engine component failure on flight CX383 from Hong Kong to Zurich on Monday. The plane later returned to Hong Kong.
“This component was the first of its type to suffer such failure on any A350 aircraft worldwide,” Cathay said in a statement sent to CNN. A thorough inspection of its 48-plane fleet revealed “a number of the same engine components that need to be replaced,” it added. It did not detail the nature of the engine issue.
By Tuesday afternoon, the company said it had identified 15 aircraft with affected engine parts that require replacement. Three had been fixed, it said, adding that all affected aircraft will resume operations by Saturday.
Cathay had earlier canceled 24 flights operating over Monday and Tuesday amid inspection and repair work. The carrier is expected to cancel 10 regional return flights on Wednesday, but long-haul services should not be affected, it said.
According to Reuters, which cited an unnamed source, the incident involved a problem with a fuel nozzle, a component that directs fuel inside the engine. CNN has reached out to Cathay for additional comment.
The issue affecting the A350 has emerged after rival Boeing (BA) suffered a number of serious and high-profile problems. The American plane maker has spent months embroiled in a safety crisis since the mid-air blowout of one of its door plugs on a 737 Max flight operated by Alaska Airlines earlier this year.
Cathay said it had contacted the aircraft manufacturer about the engine problem, as well as the engine maker, Rolls-Royce, and regulators. According to Airbus, the A350 family uses two Trent XWB turbofan engine models from Rolls-Royce. An Airbus spokesperson referred questions to Rolls-Royce.
The British aerospace company confirmed in a statement that flight CX383 was “powered by Trent XWB-97 engines,” adding it was “committed to working closely with the airline, aircraft manufacturer and the relevant authorities to support their investigation into this incident.” Its London-traded shares closed more than 6% lower on Monday.
Shukor Yusof, founder of Endau Analytics, a firm that tracks the aviation industry, said the A350 was “very safe,” but the problem appeared to be arising out of logistical delays involving components, parts and other engine materials.
“Other airlines are affected, too, albeit on different scales, but the problem isn’t going away anytime soon due to manpower shortages, among other things,” he added.
Air traffic tracking website Flightradar24 showed that CX383, normally a 13-hour flight, took off from Hong Kong International Airport on Monday at 4:24pm local time. The engine issue appears to have been spotted quickly.

Instead of going north, the A350-1000 flew south and made circles near Hong Kong before diverting back to the city. It landed safely about 75 minutes later.
The Trent engine in question was harshly criticized by Tim Clark, president of Emirates, at the Dubai Airshow in November, according to Reuters.
At the time, Clark reportedly dismissed a possible deal to buy A350-1000 jets, the larger of two models offered by Airbus, blaming a dispute with Rolls-Royce over the poorer-than-expected durability of its engines and pressure for higher servicing prices.
Rolls-Royce later said it was working on improving the Trent XWB-97 engines and denied that it was defective, according to Reuters. Months later, in August, engine problems — among other challenges — hit Boeing.
An issue affecting the plane maker’s long-delayed 777X aircraft dealt yet another blow to its reputation for quality. Boeing said it had paused testing after discovering problems in a structural component between the engine and the plane’s wings in a test flight.
Boeing said in a statement that it had identified a component that did not perform as designed and that it was replacing the part.
The 777X, billed by Boeing as the “world’s largest and most efficient twin-engine jet,” was supposed to enter service four years ago. It had been expected to have delivered several hundred of the planes by now. But it has been plagued by delays and cost overruns. It now has a revised launch date of 2025.

P9DOZJLGNQ_T1YMJO8O7B56MLS,Want job security in this uncertain market? A surprising trend is paying off,"By Elisabeth Buchwald, CNN","4 minute read Published 9:11 AM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240903,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/03/economy/college-jobs-blue-collar-workers/,"Going to college in the United States has long been considered the ticket to a higher-paying job. But the growing share of high school graduates who are enrolling in vocational schools instead of four-year programs may not be missing out on as much earnings potential as you might think.
From 2019 to 2024, hiring rates fell for workers in their 20s for roles that tend to require a bachelor’s degree, while hiring rates rose for roles requiring a vocational or associate’s degree, according to data from national payroll processing company ADP. And during that five-year span, enrollment in bachelor’s degree programs fell by 4%, while enrollment in vocational schools grew by 5%, according to data from the National Student Clearinghouse.
“The promise of quicker entry into the workforce, lower educational costs and the ability to earn higher wages earlier in their careers are compelling reasons for this trend,” said Bart Taylor, a professor at Texas A&M University, who teaches curriculum development for career and technical education programs.
Related article New data shows US job growth has been far weaker than initially reported
That means that while the overall labor market shows signs of cooling, hiring for workers without a college education can still be a source of strength for the economy.
Earnings growth rates for workers with vocational or associate’s degrees are on par with those of bachelor’s degree recipients, according to the Atlanta Federal Reserve’s Wage Growth Tracker.
That said, bachelor’s degree recipients earned a median weekly salary of $1,493 last year compared to the $1,058 associate’s degree recipients earned, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The data for associate’s degree recipients includes people who graduated from academic and vocational programs.
But some industries that skew toward workers without a degree even notch higher wage growth than industries that favor degree holders. For example, pay for construction workers rose by 4.3% on average over the 12 months ended in July; in the professional services industry, wages climbed by 3.9%, according to the BLS.
Part of the shift toward trade and vocational school enrollment stems from a reevaluation of blue-collar work that happened during the pandemic, said Taylor, who is also the vice president of the trade and industrial education division at the Association for Career and Technical Education. “This has driven employers to offer more competitive wages and benefits to attract and retain workers.”
The practical, hands-on experience required for many blue-collar jobs couldn’t be taught virtually during the pandemic, he added. For instance, “although welding concepts could be taught online, students were deprived of the crucial practice time needed with real equipment.”
Now that many of those programs are operating normally again, more Americans are building trade skills to take jobs where there’s still a shortage of skilled labor, such as electricians, carpenters and plumbers.
Another factor behind the shift toward enrollment in vocational and trade schools is the advancement of artificial intelligence, said Ben Hanowell, director of people analytics research at ADP’s Research Institute.
Across all major working-age groups, Americans between the ages of 18 and 24 are the most concerned about AI replacing some or most of their existing jobs, according to a recent survey conducted by ADP.
This could help explain why the share of 20- to 24-year-olds working in blue-collar roles rose faster in recent years and remains higher compared to people 25 to 39, according to an August report Hanowell authored. Generally, blue-collar roles, which require more manual labor, tend to be thought of as less vulnerable to being replaced by AI, he said.
“This relative job security can contribute to the ongoing demand for these roles,” he told CNN. “Moreover, as AI and technology evolve, the demand for workers who can maintain, operate and work alongside these technologies may further enhance the value of trade skills.”
It’s unclear how the blue-collar workforce will hold up relative to the white-collar workforce should the overall labor market cool more significantly.
In any event, Taylor said he’s confident that the “appreciation for skilled trades is likely to persist.”
“However, a severe economic downturn could hamper the pace of wage growth and possibly lead to more job volatility,” he added."
PCBCSF31Z3_GG79MTXKLUFI2UW,Brazil’s president says world doesn’t have to put up with Elon Musk’s ‘far right’ ideology just because he’s rich,"By Juliana Liu, CNN","2 minute read Published 12:45 AM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/04/tech/brazil-lula-elon-musk-x-suspension-hnk-intl/,"Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva says the world isn’t obliged to put up with billionaire Elon Musk’s “far-right anything goes” agenda because of his immense wealth.
Lula da Silva made the remarks in an interview with CNN affiliate CNN Brasil published Monday, days after Musk’s social media site X was suspended in the country, making it inaccessible in a major market.
“The Brazilian justice system may have given an important signal that the world is not obliged to put up with Musk’s extreme right-wing anything goes just because he is rich,” the president said.
Lula da Silva’s comments are the latest salvo in a long-running feud with Musk over free speech, far-right accounts and misinformation in the country. Over the weekend, Brazilians, including the president, bid farewell to X, with some posting links to their profiles on other social media platforms.
Brazil is an important market for X, which has struggled with the loss of advertisers since Musk acquired Twitter and renamed the platform last year. Some 40 million Brazilians, roughly one-fifth of the population, access X at least once per month, according to market research group Emarketer.
Access to the platform was blocked after Brazil’s Supreme Court ordered the suspension of X nationwide, because Musk refused to name a legal representative in the country.
The court had previously issued orders to block multiple X accounts as part of the country’s sweeping investigation into the spread of misinformation online and hate speech aimed at undermining the country’s democracy.
Accounts that the platform has previously shut down on Brazilian orders include lawmakers affiliated with former President Jair Bolsonaro’s right-wing party and activists accused of undermining Brazilian democracy.
Musk, a self-proclaimed “free speech absolutist” has repeatedly claimed the court’s actions amount to censorship, and his argument has been echoed by Brazil’s political right.
Musk once again waded into Brazilian politics on Tuesday by sharing a link on X to an upcoming demonstration that bills itself as a march for “freedom, protesting judicial overreach and defending free speech.”

PDO678T84Y_MF36MK7UTNDOP4G,Student leaders reveal prison ‘nightmare’ after Gen Z revolution sets them free,"By Rebecca Wright, Anna Coren, Salman Saeed and Mark Phillips, CNN","7 minute read Updated 11:54 PM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/03/asia/bangladesh-house-mirrors-detention-center-intl-hnk-dst/,"The banging on the door started just after sunrise, when law student Iftekhar Alam was still sleeping in his fifth-floor apartment.
Around half a dozen armed police officers pushed inside, shouting obscenities and telling him he had wronged the nation of Bangladesh.
“Where is your phone? Where is your laptop?” the officers shouted as they pointed their guns at him and searched his apartment, Alam said. “They were like crazy, really crazy.”
“They put me in the black glass car, and right away, they handcuffed me. They blindfolded me,” he said.
Alam believes he was taken to Aynaghor, known in Bangladesh as the “House of Mirrors” – a notorious detention center at the headquarters of the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI) in the capital Dhaka.
Human rights groups say hundreds of people were tortured there during the 15-year rule of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who resigned in August after weeks of protest.
After Hasina fled the country by helicopter, some of the political prisoners detained in Bangladesh’s shadowy prison system have been freed and have started to reveal what took place there.
Alam, 23, had been part of anti-government protests since they began in early July, and was close friends with one of the main protest leaders.
The protests started as student-led demonstrations against government job quotas, then later exploded into a nationwide movement to expel Hasina after she ordered a deadly crackdown, killing hundreds of people in Bangladesh’s worst political violence in decades.
During the interrogations, Alam said he was pressured to reveal the locations of the protest leaders. His captors threatened to “vanish” and kill him if he didn’t.
In detention, he says security personnel tortured him for hours – they beat him all over his body with metal pipes until they broke bones in his foot, then forced him to walk around in circles over and over, making him vomit from the pain.
They also extinguished cigarettes on his hands and feet, screaming at him that he would be punished further if he cried out in pain – calling it a “game,” he said.
Alam said his interrogators told him that the next phase was electric shocks and waterboarding – and gave him a “sample” of the electric shock on the back of his neck as a warning.
“There is no escaping from this, and my life will end here, and no one will know,” he said, reflecting on his mindset during those hours.
Rights groups say he’s far from the only victim.
During Hasina’s rule, detainees were subjected to torture at a network of other secret centres across the country, run by the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) and the Detective Branch of the police, according to Odhikar, a Bangladeshi human rights organization.
The RAB – a joint taskforce composed of the police, military and border guards – was sanctioned by the United States in 2021 for its alleged involvement in “serious human rights abuse.”
Odhikar estimates that 709 people were forcibly disappeared under Hasina’s rule. Some were later released, sentenced or found dead – 155 are still missing.
“Bangladeshi law enforcement agencies and security forces systematically committed enforced disappearances” mostly targeting “academics, journalists, dissenting voices, and political activists” which created a “climate of fear in the country,” Okhikar said in a statement on August 29.
International rights groups like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have also published multiple reports documenting disappearances and torture by police and other security forces during Hasina’s rule.
CNN can’t independently verify the testimonies of torture and has reached out to the new interim government in Bangladesh for comment on the allegations of abuses at Aynaghor and the number of people still missing.
Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Mohammed Yunus – who is leading the new interim government – has announced the creation of a commission to investigate the “disappeared” people, and has invited a UN fact-finding team to Bangladesh to independently probe alleged atrocities committed during the recent protests.
“The issue of enforced disappearances has a long and painful history in Bangladesh,” said Ravina Shamdasani, spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.
“The UN Human Rights Office looks forward to supporting the Interim Government and people of Bangladesh at this pivotal moment to revitalise democracy, seek accountability and reconciliation, and advance human rights for all the people in Bangladesh.”
Hours after Hasina fled and her government collapsed – and within 24 hours of his capture – Alam said he was released.
His captors dropped him on a quiet road before dawn, threatening to shoot him if he opened his eyes as they drove away.
Nearly one month after his release, Alam has had the plaster cast on his foot removed, and he is now moving around on crutches.
But he says the mental scars will take much longer to heal.
“It was like (a) nightmare,” he said.
Nusrat Tabassum – one of the most senior women coordinating the protest – was also pursued by the authorities.
“(It was a) very traumatic time for me,” Tabassum said. “They broke three doors. They took me with them, and oh my god, the physical torture, that was miserable.”
Tabassum says she was badly beaten during five days in detention from July 28 to August 1. She re-joined the protests the day after her release.
The 23-year-old political science student attends the prestigious Dhaka University, which became a central gathering point for the protests in July and early August.
On the university’s manicured campus sits Curzon Hall, a British colonial-era building surrounded by palm trees that offers an oasis away from the chaotic streets of the capital.
As Tabassum walks through the building’s historic arches, it’s clear that her bravery has turned her into a poster child for the movement.
Fellow female students occasionally stop her to take selfies and ask about her time in detention.
“Our reunion will be at Aynaghor,” one shouts at her as she walks past – a sign of how many of the students spent time at detention centers. “Aynaghor” or “House of Mirrors” has morphed into a catch-all term for the various places political prisoners were held.
Tabassum says she was beaten for more than four hours, covering her in bruises, filling her mouth with cuts, and bursting her ear drum.
“Without (a) hearing aid, I can’t listen in my right ear,” Tabassum said. “Two teeth (became) loose because of the beating.”
During her detention, she was forced to make a joint confession with five other student leaders which was broadcast on television.
“They forced us to make a video statement that we stopped our protest, and there will be no more movement,” she said.
Making that video was “more traumatic” than the beatings, she said, because she feared the people of Bangladesh would feel betrayed.
“That was the most sad thing,” she said.
Tabassum said that when word spread that Hasina had resigned her post, ending her authoritarian grip on the country, protesters felt their sacrifice had been worth it.
“I cried a lot after I heard the news,” she said. “It was like I lived for that moment my whole life.”
As she continues her recovery, Tabassum says she’s struggling with memory loss, and has trouble recalling events that occurred even before the beating.
But she is determined to help shape the new country – or “Bangladesh 2.0”, as people here call it.
Protest art and murals now line the streets of Dhaka with striking pop art-style designs and slogans such as “long live resistance,” “let your dreams fly,” and “this is new Bangladesh, made by Gen Z.”
The streets are alive with renewed optimism and civic pride – with micro-protests popping up across Bangladeshi cities, as interest groups try to make their voices heard during the reform process.
In late August, CNN witnessed half a dozen small peaceful protests in the capital Dhaka and south-eastern city of Cox’s Bazar – on niche issues such as doctors trying to prevent paramedics from gaining medical licenses, and rickshaw drivers campaigning against electric rickshaws.
Previously, many people were too afraid to protest on the streets for fear of arrest or being “disappeared” under the time of Hasina.
But now even families are on the street, campaigning for the release of victims caught in Bangladesh’s shadowy detention system.
There’s cautious optimism that the country will change under new leadership, but some remain wary, as instability pervades every sector of society.
Yunus, the interim leader, has asked the public for patience as his team tries to address “mountain-like challenges” after “15 years of fascist rule.”
The students who brought him to power believe that he will uphold the country’s best interests.
Yunus has “guardian vibes,” Tabassum said.
“He cares about us, he cares about my country,” she said. “We like to keep our trust in him.”
But she acknowledges that “post revolution reformation is very hard.”
“My country is sick,” she said. “But our people, we (will) stand together.”"
PG9SCLOEN0_08XWFHK7E6MVYLL,Andrew Cuomo agrees to testify publicly next week about his Covid-era nursing home advisory,"By Jake Tapper, CNN","3 minute read Updated 10:44 AM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240827,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/02/politics/andrew-cuomo-testify-covid-hearing/,"Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo will testify publicly before Congress next week about his controversial nursing home advisory from the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, informed sources and a House subcommittee say.
As CNN reported earlier, Cuomo, who testified in June behind closed doors before members of the House Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic, will testify in front of the same panel on September 10.
“Andrew Cuomo owes answers to the 15,000 families who lost loved ones in New York’s nursing homes during the COVID-19 pandemic. On September 10, Americans will have the opportunity to hear directly from the former governor about New York’s potentially fatal nursing home policies,” Rep. Brad Wenstrup, an Ohio Republican who chairs the subcommittee, said in a statement Tuesday morning.
A spokesperson for Cuomo confirmed Monday night that the former governor will testify.
“The one question that needs to be answered is still being ignored: ‘Why did more people die from COVID in the United States than any other country and how do we make sure it never happens again?’ It is Governor Cuomo’s pleasure to join the committee once again to try to get an answer,” said Rich Azzopardi, Cuomo’s spokesperson.
In a series of tweets Tuesday morning, the committee detailed takeaways from Cuomo’s June interview. The panel said he was “shockingly callous when discussing New York’s nursing home mortality rate” and that he “repeatedly deflected responsibility for issuing the nursing home directive.”
The committee said it also conducted interviews with nine high-ranking former Cuomo administration officials. It said transcripts from all interviews, including Cuomo’s, would be released ahead of the hearing next week.
A 2021 investigation by New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, found that the New York State Department of Health undercounted Covid-19 deaths among residents of nursing homes by approximately 50%, essentially by leaving out deaths of residents who had been transferred to hospitals. A 2022 audit by State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli concluded that Cuomo’s health department failed to report roughly 4,100 deaths between April 2020 and February 2021.
Cuomo has insisted that advisory was consistent with guidance from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Wenstrup said on “The Lead” in April that lawmakers wanted to ask the Democratic former governor about the March 2020 advisory, which barred nursing homes from rejecting patients solely on the basis of a Covid-19 diagnosis.
“I’m trying to learn why he would do something like this,” Wenstrup said. “As a doctor who has treated infections, it goes against all medical common sense to take someone who was highly contagious and put them amongst the most vulnerable.”
Cuomo was first elected governor in 2010 and served nearly three full terms before he resigned in August 2021 following the release of a report by James’ office that found he had sexually harassed 11 women. Cuomo has denied the allegations.

PGPG2HZIIT_9W41EP7LIX7O5H0,Supreme Court sides with Biden in fight over abortion referrals in Oklahoma,"By John Fritze and Tierney Sneed, CNN","4 minute read Published 7:22 PM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/03/politics/supreme-court-abortion-referrals-oklahoma/,"The Supreme Court on Tuesday backed a Biden administration plan to redistribute $4.5 million in public health funding that had been earmarked for Oklahoma because the state bars clinics from giving out a hotline number that patients can use to access information about abortion.
Conservative Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch said they would have sided with the state.
Though the emergency appeal was focused mainly on the federal government’s power to set terms and requirements on federal grants, it was also the latest case to reach the court stemming from its 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. Earlier this year, the court declined to block efforts by the Food and Drug Administration to ease access to the abortion pill mifepristone and temporarily permitted abortions in medical emergencies in Idaho.
Oklahoma is one of several states challenging a US Department of Health and Human Services rule that requires clinics receiving federal family planning funds to offer pregnant patients counseling about their options, including abortion, if requested. After losing in a federal appeals court, Oklahoma filed its emergency request at the Supreme Court in early August, seeking to protect its share of that funding despite the rule.

The counseling rule isn’t new to the Biden administration. Democratic and Republican presidents have gone back and forth for years on whether to condition federal family planning funding on a requirement that such information is provided to patients.
What is new, however, is the Supreme Court’s divisive 2022 ruling overturning Roe, the 1973 decision that established a constitutional right to abortion. That decision led to a series of strict laws banning or severely limiting access to the procedure in red states. After the Supreme Court’s ruling in that case, Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, a law took effect in Oklahoma that made “advising or procuring” an abortion a felony.
The federal rule “foists upon Oklahoma a requirement concerning an issue that has been recognized as specifically reserved to the people to address in Dobbs,” the state told the Supreme Court.
The Justice Department had countered that Congress routinely allows federal agencies to set conditions for federal grants.
“Oklahoma’s radical reimagining of the spending clause would invalidate a host of regulatory conditions that have long governed federal spending,” the Biden administration told the Supreme Court. That outcome, the government warned, could fundamentally change programs from “Medicare to infrastructure funding.”
Oklahoma based its argument in part on a provision Congress has included in annual appropriations bills for years, known as the Weldon Amendment, that prohibits the HHS from requiring health care entities to provide or refer for abortions. The Biden administration countered that Oklahoma’s health department isn’t covered by that provision, which is named after a Republican former congressman from Florida.
The 10th US Circuit Court of Appeals previously declined to issue an order blocking the Biden administration from denying the grants. The 2-1 panel concluded that federal health officials had the authority to implement the requirement. The court also reasoned that providing the national hotline number did not amount to a referral under the Weldon Amendment.
The Justice Department made that very argument: Providing the hotline number is not the same thing as a referral.
A clinic “could have responded to a patient’s request for information about abortion by saying: ‘We cannot discuss abortion with you or direct you to an abortion provider, but you may call this hotline for nondirective information about your options,’” the government told the court in its brief.
“That statement is not a referral for abortion” within the meaning of federal law, the administration wrote.
Another appeals court, the 6th US Circuit Court of Appeals, sided with the Biden administration late last month in a similar case filed by Tennessee. The court, on a 2-1 vote, found that Tennessee “knowingly and voluntarily accepted the grant’s terms.”
State officials across the country distribute the federal funding at issue to public health services and county health departments.
Oklahoma had asked the justices to act by August 30. After that date, the federal government had said it would distribute Oklahoma’s grant to others."
PHNRRPMA2A_ICFKR4U5Q5UHQTD,Workers in Japan can’t quit their jobs. They hire resignation experts to help,"By Samra Zulfaqar, Nodoka Katsura and Rinka Tonsho, CNN","6 minute read Published 8:30 PM EDT, Sat August 31, 2024",20240901,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/08/31/business/japan-workers-resignation-agencies-intl-hnk/,"Yuki Watanabe used to spend 12 hours every day toiling away in the office. And that’s considered a short day.
A typical 9-to-9 workday is the bare minimum. “The latest I would leave [the office] would be 11 p.m.,” said the 24-year-old, who used to work for some of Japan’s largest telecoms and e-payment companies.
So intense were the demands that Watanabe - who used an alias to speak to CNN, for fear of jeopardizing future job prospects - began to develop health problems. She had “shaky legs and stomach issues.”
She knew she had to quit, but there was one thing in the way: Japan’s notoriously top-down work culture.
Asking to leave work on time or taking some time off can be tricky enough. Even trickier is tendering a resignation, which can be seen as the ultimate form of disrespect in the world’s fourth-biggest economy, where workers traditionally stick with one employer for decades, if not for a lifetime.
In the most extreme cases, grumpy bosses rip up resignation letters and harass employees to force them to stay.
Watanabe was unhappy at her previous job, saying her former supervisor often ignored her, making her feel bad. But she didn’t dare resign.
“I didn’t want my ex-employer to deny my resignation and keep me working for longer,” she told CNN during a recent interview.
But she found a way to end the impasse. She turned to Momuri, a resignation agency that helps timid employees leave their intimidating bosses.
For the price of a fancy dinner, many Japanese workers hire these proxy firms to help them resign stress-free.
The industry existed before Covid. But its popularity grew after the pandemic, after years of working from home pushed even some of Japan’s most loyal workers to reflect upon their careers, according to human resources experts.
There is no official count on the number of resignation agencies that have sprung up across the country, but those running them can testify to the surge in demand.
Shiori Kawamata, operations manager of Momuri, said that in the past year alone they received up to 11,000 enquiries from clients.
Located in Minato, one of Tokyo’s busiest business districts, the firm launched in 2022 with a name that seeks to resonate with their helpless clientele – “Momuri” means “I can’t do this anymore” in Japanese.
At a cost of 22,000 yen (about $150) – or 12,000 yen for those who work part time – it pledges to help employees tender their resignations, negotiate with their companies and provide recommendations for lawyers if legal disputes arise.
“Some people come to us after having their resignation letter ripped three times and employers not letting them quit even when they kneel down to the ground to bow,” she said, in another illustration of the deferential workplace culture embedded in Japan.
“We sometimes get calls from people crying, asking us if they can quit their job based on XYZ. We tell them that it is okay, and that quitting their job is a labor right,” Kawamata added.
Some workers complain that bosses harass them if they try to resign, she said, including stopping by their apartments to ring their doorbell repeatedly, refusing to leave.
For another quitter, what would have been a straightforward business took a bizarre turn. The person was dragged to a temple in Kyoto by their boss. “[The worker] was told to go to Onmyoji temple because ‘they were cursed,’” she said.
Kawamata said people who reach out often work for small to medium-sized businesses, with those in the food industry most vulnerable, followed by healthcare and welfare.
Japan has long had an overwork culture. Employees across various sectors report punishing hours, high pressure from supervisors and deference to the company. These employers are widely known as “black firms.”
Human resources professor Hiroshi Ono, from Hitotsubashi University Business School in Tokyo, said the situation had become so pressing that the government had begun publishing a list of unethical employers to hamper their ability to hire, and warn job seekers of the dangers of working for them.
“There are some issues with… black firms, where working conditions are so bad, there’s no psychological safety, and some employees might feel threatened,” he said.
More than 370 companies have been blacklisted by labor bureaus across the country since the list was published in 2017.
The stress has proven fatal for decades, as exemplified by a phenomenon called “karoshi,” or “death by overwork.”

According to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, 54 people died from work-induced brain and heart conditions and were granted compensation in 2022, which is actually a major decline from the 160 recorded two decades ago.
But the number of people filing claims over mental stress at work is on the rise, shooting up to 2,683 from 341 over the same period of time.
A 31-year-old political reporter from national broadcaster NHK died in 2017 after suffering heart failure caused by spending long hours on the job. She worked 159 hours of overtime in the month before her death.
Five years later, a 26-year-old doctor from a hospital in Kobe died by suicide after working more than 200 hours of overtime in a single month.
Hisakazu Kato, an economics professor at Meiji University in Tokyo, said the country has labor laws in place to protect workers and make sure they are free to resign.
“But sometimes the atmosphere in the workplace makes it difficult to say so,” he said.
So why did these resignation agents only emerge in recent years? That, experts say, is down to young people’s changing approach to work.
“When one party is unhappy, you could end up in a divorce. But like a divorce, nobody is 100% faultless, right?” Ono, from Hitotsubashi University, said.
As the country grapples with a labor shortage fueled by a rapidly aging population and declining birth rates, young people now have more say in the market than their predecessors.
Many of them no longer subscribe to older generations’ thinking that one should do whatever they are told regardless of the job’s nature, Ono said, adding that when there is a mismatch of expectation, they won’t hesitate to quit.
But that doesn’t mean they want to march into their boss’s office and quit in a blaze of glory – preferring to let a third party handle it.
“I think that younger people these days are more non-confrontational,” the expert said, noting that many have been deprived of social interactions at work due to Covid. As a result, young workers prefer to quit without having direct contact with their bosses.
But Ono suggested that it’s always good to have a discussion and not to burn bridges with employers, so he would recommend against accessing such services.
Kawamata, from Momuri, somewhat agreed.
“We honestly think that our resignation agency service should disappear from society and we hope for that. We think it’s best if people can tell their bosses themselves, but hearing the horror stories of our clients, I don’t think that our business will disappear anytime soon,” she said.
For now, Momuri offers a 50% discount for those who seek their service to resign the second time.

PJVH76ONGI_I9AP48SH90ZOJOL,At least 12 dead after boat carrying migrants sinks in the English Channel,"By Emmanuel Miculita and Chris Liakos, CNN","3 minute read Updated 2:37 PM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240903,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/03/europe/english-channel-migrant-boat-deaths-intl/,"At least 12 people died, most of them women and children, when a migrant boat capsized off the coast of northern France on Tuesday, according to French authorities.
Nearly 70 people were on board the vessel, according to Boulogne-sur-Mer mayor, Frédéric Cuvillier. The exact number is unclear.
Emergency crews rescued 53 people and recovered the bodies of the dead, the maritime prefecture said. Several of those saved were in critical condition and required urgent medical care.
Three helicopters, two fishing vessels and two boats have been deployed in the search and rescue operation.
The incident is the latest in a number of tragedies on the English Channel, where small boat crossings of migrants attempting to reach Britain has soared in recent years.
“This maritime sector is one of the busiest areas in the world, with more than 600 merchant ships passing through it every day and the weather conditions are often difficult, so it is a particularly dangerous sector, even when the sea seems calm,” the prefecture said.
Most of the migrants on board appeared to be from Eritrea, the Boulogne-sur-Mer prosecutor, Guirec Le Bras, said Tuesday. He added that 10 of the 12 who died were women and some were minors.
Le Bras said it appears that the boat sank about 5 kilometers (3 miles) off the coast of Cap Gris-Nez, on the northern coast of France.
French interior minister Gerald Darmanin told reporters in Boulogne-sur-Mer on Tuesday that “less than eight people had a life jacket” on board the boat, as he pointed the finger at smugglers for the unsafe conditions.
“Obviously, it is a tragedy. As soon as a person loses their life on our territory, I would obviously like to have a compassionate thought for their families,” Darmanin added. “They were undoubtedly looking for a better world in Great Britain.”
Nearly 30,000 people reached Britain by crossing the Channel in a small boat last year, according to Home Office figures, with dinghies and other small vessels frequently being used to take large groups of people on the dangerous journey in the hope of seeking asylum in the United Kingdom.
Deadly incidents like Tuesday’s have occurred on a number of occasions during that time. Last August, six people died when a boat carrying dozens of migrants capsized.
The issue became a major political obstacle for the previous Conservative government, which was criticized by migrant rights groups for its hardline rhetoric against asylum seekers, and for the new Labour administration.
The head of the French mission for Médecins Sans Frontières, Xavier Crombé, on Tuesday blamed the policies of the French and British governments for the latest deaths.
“We are shocked and angry after this new tragedy in the English Channel,” Crombé said. “These deaths are not inevitable, but the tragic consequence of inhumane and absurd migration policies.”
Crombé said that current policies prioritize border control rather than human lives, making migrant journeys “more precarious and dangerous.”

Critics of the phrase, which refers to the land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, say that it calls for the abolishment of the Israeli state. The Anti-Defamation League accused the slogan of being antisemitic and a “rallying cry (that) has long been used by anti-Israel voices, including supporters of terrorist organizations such as Hamas.”
But the chant is also frequently used at pro-Palestinian demonstrations by protesters who say it is to call for equal rights and an independent state for Palestinians. It can refer to Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza who are restricted in their movements and from visiting Jerusalem.
The Board said it reviewed three cases involving the use of “From the River to the Sea” on Facebook and said that all appeals to remove the content were closed without human review. Those users then appealed to the Board, which exists for users to challenge Meta’s appeals process on Facebook, Instagram or Threads.
“Specifically, the three pieces of content contain contextual signs of solidarity with Palestinians – but no language calling for violence or exclusion. They also do not glorify or even refer to Hamas, an organization designated as dangerous by Meta,” the decision said. The posts and comments also didn’t contain threats of violence or physical harm.
Though the majority of the Board agreed the phrase has multiple meanings, the decision noted that a minority believed it glorifies Hamas because it appeared in the group’s 2017 charter.
“The phrase’s use by this terrorist group with explicit violent eliminationist intent and actions, does not make the phrase inherently hateful or violent – considering the variety of people using the phrase in different ways,” the Board said.
The Board said the decision underscores tensions in protecting free expression and political speech.
In June, a Palestinian-American engineer sued Meta, accusing his former employer of discriminating against pro-Palestinian speech and wrongfully firing him when he investigated those issues.
“The employee was dismissed for violating Meta’s data access policies, which we make clear to employees will result in immediate termination,” Meta spokesperson Andy Stone said in a statement to CNN at the time.
The company said it is expanding on its hate speech policies. In July, Meta said it would remove posts that have the term “Zionist” when used in conjunction with antisemitic tropes or dehumanizing rhetoric.
“These cases have again underscored the importance of data access to effectively assess Meta’s content moderation during conflicts, as well as the need for a method to track the amount of content attacking people based on a protected characteristic,” the decision said.
The chant had been contentious even before the Israel and Hamas war, which has killed more than 40,000 Palestinians after Hamas’ October 7th attack that killed more than 1,200 Israelis and took 250 hostage. For example, in 2018 CNN said it severed ties with a liberal pundit after he called for a “free Palestine from the river to the sea.”
But new attention has been drawn to the chant as protesters call for an end to the war, and the phrase is frequently used at protests ranging from college campuses to large cities. In Germany, using the slogan “From the river to the sea” is now a criminal offense. In December, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) filed a discrimination complaint on behalf of a Black Muslim Arab American teacher in Maryland after she was placed on administrative leave for her email signature, which contained the slogan. US Congress member Rashida Tlaib was censured for using the phrase.
The slogan used in the cases had wide reach through Meta’s platforms. In one case, a likely AI-generated image of floating watermelon slices that formed the slogan was viewed about eight million times and reported by 937 users.

PSFUE5BTOH_61JMR8TLZXNEUWB,Leader of Afghanistan’s resistance movement says he will defeat the Taliban ‘no matter the odds’,"By Peter Bergen, CNN","14 minute read Published 2:00 AM EDT, Sun September 1, 2024",20240901,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/01/politics/ahmad-massoud-afghanistan-resistance-interview/,"Three years after the departure of the final US troops from Afghanistan, the situation in the country is bleak, with the Taliban tightening its grip as it introduces increasingly oppressive laws that restrict political freedoms and suppress the rights of women.
Most Afghans have had to acquiesce to the Taliban not because they embrace their misogynistic ideology but because they have all the guns. Still, there is a nascent resistance movement. I spoke to its leader, Ahmad Massoud, who said he’s engaged in “a fight for the soul and future of our nation, and we are determined to win, no matter the odds.”
He is the son of Ahmad Shah Massoud, who led the Afghan resistance to the Taliban more than two and half decades ago when the Taliban first seized power in Afghanistan in 1996.
Massoud is now 35, and he leads the National Resistance Front to the Taliban. In our interview, he asserted that his group has carried out 207 military operations around Afghanistan this year and that he has 5,000 soldiers under his control. Verifying this kind of information independently is nearly impossible as there are relatively few international journalists covering Afghanistan, while the Taliban have closed hundreds of Afghan media outlets. The UN put out a report in June that documented a surge of anti-Taliban attacks during the first six months of this year but put the number at 29 operations carried out by the National Resistance Front, while on the group’s X feed, there are claims of far more operations.
Massoud told me that “the Taliban’s true victory wasn’t on the battlefield; it was at the negotiating table,” a withdrawal agreement that was negotiated by then-President Donald Trump’s team and carried out by President Joe Biden.
Massoud lives in an undisclosed location in Central Asia directing military operations in Afghanistan from outside the country. We conducted our interview over email, and it has been edited for clarity.
BERGEN: The Taliban last week banned the sound of women’s voices outside of the home. This seems crazy, but the Taliban can do it with impunity. What does this say about their hold on power?
MASSOUD: This is a blatant display of ignorance and arrogance. The Taliban believe they can punish the people of Afghanistan, especially women, and yet they can also still gain international recognition. [Today, no government officially recognizes the Taliban, though several governments do have diplomatic relations with them.] This impunity is a direct result of the international community’s policy of appeasement of the Taliban over the past three years. If we hope to see a change in the Taliban’s behavior, we must alter our approach towards them. It’s that simple.
Within Afghanistan, our strategy for resistance is clear. The Taliban only respond to power and force. Diplomatic engagement with the Taliban has only emboldened them.
BERGEN: This is the third anniversary of the withdrawal of all US troops from Afghanistan. What are your feelings on this anniversary after two decades of a US military and diplomatic presence in Afghanistan? Was this a betrayal of America’s Afghan allies?
MASSOUD: The hasty US withdrawal in 2021 caused us to lose many achievements that we had gained in the last 20 years. Afghanistan had started experiencing social and political transformations that it never had before. We had rights like freedom of speech, and a new generation, both women and men, was on the rise. Yet we lost all of this when the agreement with the Taliban was signed in 2020 and when the withdrawal abruptly happened in 2021. Now we are the only country fully controlled by terrorists.
BERGEN: What kind of military operations are you carrying out in Afghanistan?
MASSOUD: The National Resistance Front’s military activities started in August 2021 when the Taliban attacked us in the Panjshir Valley [in northern Afghanistan]. Since then, we have been resisting them. We started from two provinces in the north, yet now we have networks and operations in almost 20 provinces after three years of expansion. [There are 34 provinces in Afghanistan.] Our operations at the moment are unconventional and mostly guerrilla operations. Yet, the military wing of the National Resistance Front is based inside Afghanistan, our bases, and our commando units are all in the country, and as every day passes, we are increasing our recruitment and operational capacity.
BERGEN: Can you give us a sense of the strengths of your National Resistance Front?
MASSOUD: The National Resistance Front’s military wing is solely made up of the remnants of Afghanistan’s former armed forces. These forces joined us instead of abandoning the fight for democracy on August 15, 2021 [when the Taliban captured Kabul, the capital]. Today, we have more than 5,000 permanent forces scattered in some 20 provinces. We have been able to increase their capabilities even though we aren’t receiving any external support. To give you a sense of our strength, since January 2024, we have launched 207 operations around the country.
BERGEN: Your soldiers claimed an attack at Kabul Airport last month. Can you describe what happened?
MASSOUD: Operational security prevents me from disclosing specifics, but I can assure you that this operation and many others demonstrate the significant military and intelligence capabilities we’ve developed since 2021. Despite the risks and complexities, our forces, supported by our deep intelligence network within the enemy’s ranks, executed the operation precisely.
Also, I would like to make something clear. All our targets are and will be military targets. We only target where the Taliban and other terror groups reside and avoid civilian casualties.
BERGEN: Tell us about how you became the leader of the anti-Taliban resistance, and are there other resistance groups you work with?
MASSOUD: I started my political efforts back in 2018 by consulting Afghanistan’s people. I went to the furthest villages and valleys of Afghanistan, engaging directly with my people to formulate a strategic response to the imminent US-Taliban deal and withdrawal. On September 5, 2019, I received a clear mandate from our citizens, gathered at my father’s mausoleum, to lead a solution to this coming crisis.  The critical moment arrived on August 15, 2021, when my people and some of the former armed forces of Afghanistan established the National Resistance Front of Afghanistan, entrusting me with its leadership. This was not a choice but a call to duty that I answered without any hesitation.
BERGEN: You attended Sandhurst, the British equivalent of West Point, and studied in the War Studies department of Kings College, London. Was that helpful training for what you are doing now?
MASSOUD: My training at Sandhurst and education at King’s College provided me with a solid foundation. However, the burden of real-world conflict has been my true academy. The lessons I’ve learned leading our resistance these past few years far surpass any classroom instruction.
BERGEN: You won’t recall this, but I met you when you were only around 4 years old when CNN was interviewing your father, Ahmad Shah Massoud, in the Panjshir Valley in Afghanistan in 1993 during the Afghan civil war. I was very impressed by your father, his extraordinary charisma and his intelligence.
It must have been very difficult for you, aged 11 when he was assassinated by al Qaeda assassins two days before 9/11. How has your father’s assassination affected what you are doing today?
MASSOUD: The video of our first encounter, when you met my father during that CNN interview in the Panjshir Valley in 1993, is indeed part of our historical record. While I wish I had been older to fully grasp the gravity of those moments and learn more directly from my father, his legacy has become the cornerstone of my mission. My father’s assassination by al Qaeda, just days before 9/11, was a moment that shaped not just my family but the course of our nation. As I’ve detailed in my memoir “In the Name of My Father,” the impact was profound. However, it also ignited an unshakeable determination within me. At that moment, I vowed to continue his vision for a free and peaceful Afghanistan. His sacrifice wasn’t in vain – it’s the foundation upon which we’re building Afghanistan’s future. [Disclosure: I wrote the foreword to Massoud’s memoir, which I do not benefit from financially in any manner.]
BERGEN: When the Americans left Afghanistan three years ago, they left behind $8.5 billion dollars worth of military equipment, according to an estimate by the UN. That’s more than the defense budget of some European nations. Does this make your task of resisting the Taliban more difficult?
MASSOUD: The $8.5 billion worth of military equipment abandoned by the Americans has of course altered the battlefield dynamics, but it hasn’t dampened our determination and commitment. Yes, the Taliban are now better armed than ever before. However, military history is full of examples where determination and strategy overcame material advantages. The Taliban may have the weapons, but we have the will of the people – and history shows that’s a far more powerful force.
What’s more concerning is the Taliban’s transformation of Afghanistan into a black market for these weapons. We know that they are not just arming themselves; they’re fueling global terror networks. This isn’t just about our resistance; it’s about preventing Afghanistan from becoming a nexus of international terrorism.
BERGEN: When your father, Ahmad Shah Massoud, was fighting the Taliban before 9/11, he controlled some territory inside Afghanistan and could be resupplied from neighboring Tajikistan. You are not in Afghanistan, and it’s hard for you to supply your forces inside Afghanistan as you control no territory in Afghanistan. You do have a political office in Tajikistan, but no other countries support you; how does this lack of support affect your ability to fight the Taliban?
MASSOUD: Our current position differs strategically from my father’s era, but our determination remains unshaken. Since 2021, we’ve not only survived but expanded our influence, despite minimal external support. It is important to emphasize that we are not just fighting the Taliban; we’re engaged in a broader conflict against a coalition of regional and global terror groups. When al Qaeda and the Pakistani Taliban supply fighters to the Taliban, it’s clear that our struggle is an extension of the global war on terror.
However, let me be clear: to defeat these 20 terrorist organizations in Afghanistan threatening global security, we require international backing. It’s unrealistic to expect us to single-handedly neutralize this threat without resources. Our fight isn’t just for Afghanistan; it’s for global security. Any nation that perceives terrorism as a threat must recognize the strategic necessity of supporting our cause and efforts.
BERGEN: What support do you need?
MASSOUD: We need any kind of support that will allow us to defeat this group. We believe we have capable forces who were trained for 20 years to pursue counterterrorism. For this reason, we are asking for resources instead of foreign forces to liberate our country.
BERGEN: What do you say to those who say your resistance movement doesn’t have much of a chance against the well-armed Taliban and without financial and military support from other countries?
MASSOUD: Those who underestimate our resistance fail to grasp the lessons of Afghanistan’s history. Despite our current lack of external support, we’ve consistently grown in strength and numbers. The Taliban may control territory and possess billions in arms, but they lack the most crucial asset – the support of the people of Afghanistan. Our history proves that popular legitimacy, not weaponry, determines ultimate victory. Even the communist regime [which controlled Afghanistan from 1979 to 1992], which was far stronger than today’s Taliban, fell due to lack of popular support. Our resistance is expanding because we represent and embody the will of the people.
BERGEN: Will the Taliban still be in charge in Afghanistan a decade from now? If not, why not?
MASSOUD: The Taliban’s grip on Afghanistan is already slipping. Their lack of discipline, competence, legitimacy, and internal disunity makes their long-term rule ineffective. We don’t just hope for their downfall – we’re working to ensure it.
In Vienna, Austria, this year we initiated a political process, uniting Afghanistan’s diverse political and civil groups. This isn’t only opposition – it’s the foundation of a democratic alternative for Afghanistan’s future. We’re not waiting for the Taliban to fail; we’re building the system that will replace them.
The fractures within the Taliban are widening. Their implosion is not a matter of if, but when. When that moment comes – and it will come sooner than many expect – we’ll be ready. The democratic government we’re preparing will fill the void, representing all citizens and bringing stability to our nation.
A decade from now, Afghanistan won’t just be free of Taliban rule – it will be on the path to becoming a beacon of democracy in the region. That’s not wishful thinking – it’s our objective.
BERGEN: Has the Taliban created an “inclusive” government as they promised?
MASSOUD: The Taliban’s promise of an inclusive government has proven to be nothing but propaganda. The fundamentally reject the core democratic principle that political legitimacy stems from the will of the people and free elections. Their current power structure is a sham, with various factions of their terrorist organization vying for control and systematically marginalizing each other.
The very notion that this group could create an inclusive government is absurd when they can’t even maintain unity within their own ranks. Their internal power struggles and ideological inflexibility make any form of genuine inclusivity impossible. They’ve demonstrated time and again that their only interest is in consolidating power for their extremist vision.
BERGEN: Flawed presidential elections produced flawed Afghan governments. How culpable were Afghanistan’s leaders like President Ashraf Ghani for what transpired in Afghanistan?
MASSOUD: The government of Afghanistan was corrupt and flawed. The flaws in Afghanistan’s previous governments were systemic and deep-rooted. I consistently opposed these administrations precisely because of their corruption and ineffectiveness.
The root of the problem lies in the political system adopted after 2004, which was fundamentally unsuited to Afghanistan’s diverse demographic reality. Afghanistan is a highly diverse country without an ethnic majority. Its constitution concentrated excessive power in Kabul, essentially creating a presidential monarchy. This centralization was a primary factor in the government’s weakness and the marginalization of numerous communities.
The situation worsened dramatically during Ashraf Ghani’s presidency. His further centralization of power, limiting decision-making to only himself and a small circle of advisors, exacerbated the alienation of large segments of our population.
Recognizing this flaw, I advocated for the decentralization of power in a 2020 New York Times article. I firmly believe that Afghanistan’s path to peace and stability lies in the distribution of power. It is a strategic requirement for building a stable, resilient nation that can withstand internal divisions and external threats.
BERGEN: In all the discussions about the mistakes made in Afghanistan, sometimes it’s easy to lose sight of what went right. In addition to the rise of independent media and the provision of education to girls and jobs for women, what else worked? Programs like the National Solidarity Programme, which offered small grants for public works to local communities in consultation with those communities?
MASSOUD: Yes, despite challenges and setbacks in Afghanistan, it’s important to acknowledge the significant progress made during the two decades after 9/11. The rise of independent media was a cornerstone of this progress, giving voice to diverse perspectives and creating a more informed population. The expansion of education for girls and employment opportunities for women were transformative. Programs like the National Solidarity Programme were particularly effective.
BERGEN: What was the effect of the Trump administration’s 2020 Doha peace agreement with the Taliban and President Joe Biden announcing in April 2021 that he was going to go through with the total US withdrawal?
MASSOUD: The Trump administration’s 2020 Doha deal with the Taliban and President Biden’s later announcement of a total US withdrawal in April 2021 had detrimental effects on Afghanistan’s stability. These decisions legitimized the Taliban on the international stage while signaling the end of substantial Western support for the government of Afghanistan at the same time.
The Doha agreement, in particular, undermined the morale of our security forces and government officials. It created a sense of certainty about the Taliban’s return to power. Biden’s withdrawal announcement made it worse. It triggered a rapid loss of confidence in the government’s ability to stand independently. These policy decisions, which sought to end America’s longest war, sacrificed the hard-won progress of two decades and betrayed the trust of millions of our people.
BERGEN: Did the Taliban win at the negotiating table with the United States, what they couldn’t win on the battlefield from them?
MASSOUD: The Taliban’s true victory wasn’t on the battlefield; it was at the negotiating table.  Prior to the negotiations, their territorial control was limited. The negotiation process itself became their launch pad to power. This diplomatic engagement legitimized a terrorist group. It turned them from insurgents to political actors. Had the US simply withdrawn without these negotiations, the Taliban wouldn’t be in power today.
The consequences were devastating – it demoralized Afghanistan’s armed forces, normalized relations with terrorists, facilitated the release of thousands of extremists from our prisons, and paved the way for the fall of our government.
This colossal mistake handed the Taliban a victory they couldn’t achieve through force of arms.
BERGEN: This year, you published a book, “In the Name of My Father: Struggling For Freedom In Afghanistan.” What was the main message of the book?
MASSOUD: My book is more than a memoir – it’s a manifesto for Afghanistan’s future and a testament to our ongoing struggle. I lay out my convictions on democracy, women’s rights and the role of Islam in our society. These are the foundational principles upon which we’re building our resistance.
BERGEN: What is your vision of the future? The Taliban control more of the country than they did before 9/11. They’re better armed. They’ve been fighting for 20 years. So, what’s the end goal here for you?
MASSOUD: Let me be very clear about our vision and end goal. We are fighting for a democratic, decentralized and pluralistic Afghanistan where every citizen, regardless of gender, ethnicity or religious belief, enjoys equal rights. This is our non-negotiable objective.
Yes, the Taliban currently control more territory and are better armed than before 9/11. But control of land and possession of weapons does not mean legitimate governance or popular support.
We’re not just resisting the Taliban; we’re building the foundation for a new Afghanistan. We’re creating a system that’s resilient against extremism and responsive to the diverse needs of all our citizens.
Make no mistake – we are prepared for a long struggle. This isn’t just a fight against the Taliban; it’s a fight for the soul and future of our nation, and we are determined to win, no matter the odds."
PVRWSQYU5Y_QNR4Q7G415TWI57,DOJ alleges Russia funded US media company linked to right-wing social media stars,"By Zachary Cohen, Donie O'Sullivan, Evan Perez, Sean Lyngaas and Majlie de Puy Kamp, CNN","6 minute read Updated 11:08 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/04/politics/doj-alleges-russia-funded-company-linked-social-media-stars,"The unnamed Tennessee-based company that the Justice Department alleges was being funded by Russian operatives working as part of a Kremlin-orchestrated influence operation targeting the 2024 US election is Tenet Media, which is linked to right-wing commentators with millions of subscribers on YouTube and other social media platforms, according to a US official briefed on the matter.
The indictment unsealed in New York’s Southern District accused two employees of RT, the Kremlin’s media arm, of funneling nearly $10 million to an unidentified company, described only as “Company 1” in court documents.
CNN has independently confirmed that “Company 1” is Tenet Media, which is a platform for independent content creators. It is self-described as a “network of heterodox commentators that focus on Western political and cultural issues,” according to its website, which matches language contained in the newly unsealed indictment.
The alleged Russian operation tapped two people to set up the company in their names to add to its legitimacy and the two founders were aware Russian money backed the operation, according to the indictment.
The goal of the operation, according to prosecutors, was to fuel pro-Russian narratives, in part, by pushing content and news articles favoring Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and others who the Kremlin deemed to be friendlier to its interests.
Among the commentators listed on Tenet Media’s website are right-wing personalities Benny Johnson, Tim Pool and Dave Rubin. All have released statements saying they were victims of the alleged Russian scheme and they maintained editorial control of the content they created.
Each has a loyal fanbase online, with a combined roughly 6 million followers on YouTube alone. Pool interviewed Trump on his podcast in May.
Wednesday’s indictment outlined how the American social media stars were hired by Tenet Media. Some of the creators were told the project was being bankrolled by a man named Eduard Grigoriann. “In truth and fact,” the indictment reads, “Grigoriann was a fictional persona.”
The indictment outlines how one of the social media stars was approached by Tenet Media’s founder with an offer of $2 million a year to make videos for the company. One of the founders later wrote, “It would need to be closer to 5 million yearly for him to be interested,” according to the indictment.
The social media star expressed some skepticism about who was funding the deal and asked for more information about Grigoriann.
Eventually the social media star agreed on a contract of a $400,000 monthly fee to create “four weekly videos,” along with a $100,000 signing bonus.
Tenet Media’s US-based founders are not named in the indictment, but business records filed in Tennessee reveal two people connected to the company: Lauren Chen and Liam Donovan. A Twitter account for Donovan identifies him as the president of Tenet Media and his Instagram account describes Donovan as Chen’s husband.
A private message between the two in May 2021 read, “So we’re billing the Russians from the corporation, right?” Two weeks later, another message said, “Also, the Russians paid. So we’re good to bill them for the next month I guess,” the legal filing details.
Chen, is a rightwing online influencer in her own right. She has appeared in some of Tenet Media’s videos and has more than 500,000 subscribers on YouTube.
The Russian state-controlled media RT lists Chen as a contributor for several articles in 2021 and 2022. She is also linked to the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA. As of Thursday afternoon Turning Point US had deleted webpages featuring Chen.
A YouTube video referenced in the indictment further describes Tenet Media as “a project of Lauren Chen and her husband Liam.”
Blaze Media on Thursday said it had fired Chen.
BlazeTV, a subset of the Glenn Beck-founded conservative outlet, has since taken down a page that previously promoted content Chen produced for the outlet, including her show “Pseudo-Intellectual.”
“Lauren Chen was an independent contractor, whose contract has been terminated,” Tyler Cardon, the chief executive of Blaze Media, said in a statement to CNN. The news was first reported by Semafor.
YouTube has removed Tenet Media’s channel and others associated with Chen, a YouTube spokesperson said in a statement Thursday.
“Following an indictment from the US Department of Justice and after careful review, we are terminating the Tenet Media channel and four channels operated by its owner Lauren Chen as part of our ongoing efforts to combat coordinated influence operations,” the statement said.
The company’s investigation into the matter is ongoing, according to YouTube.
Neither Chen nor Donovan responded to CNN’s request for comment.
Others ensnared in the alleged Russian plot, however, insist they are the victims.
“We are disturbed by the allegations in today’s indictment, which make clear that myself and other influencers were victims in this alleged scheme,” Johnson wrote in a post on X after the indictment was unsealed on Wednesday.
“Should these allegations prove true, I as well as the other personalities and commentators were deceived and are victims,” Pool said on X. “The show is produced in its entirety by our local team without input from anyone external to the company,” he added.
In a statement also posted to X, Rubin wrote, “These allegations clearly show that I and other commentators were the victims of this scheme. I knew absolutely nothing about any of this fraudulent activity. Period.”
Adding, “The DoJ has never contacted me regarding this matter and I have no intention to comment further.”
The DOJ’s revealing of the alleged Russian plot was part of a wider set of actions the Biden administration announced Wednesday it was taking to tackle a major Russian government-backed effort to influence the 2024 US presidential election including sanctions on 10 individuals and entities, and the seizure of 32 internet domains.
At Russian President Vladimir Putin’s direction, three Russian companies used fake profiles to promote false narratives on social media, US Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said in a statement. Internal documents produced by one of those Russian companies show one of the goals of the propaganda effort was to boost the candidacy of Trump or whoever emerged as the Republican nominee for president, according to an FBI affidavit.
Taken together with the indictment of the RT employees, the actions represent the Biden administration’s most significant public response yet to alleged Russian influence operations targeting American voters. After the US accused Iran of trying to hack both the Trump and Biden-Harris campaigns last month, Wednesday’s actions are a reminder that US officials continue to see Russia as a prominent foreign influence threat to November’s election, sources familiar with the matter told CNN ahead of the announcements.

Q23YJKNZ5W_U5EO6C4H1JVPYPK,2020 election deniers ordered to pay $1 million in Pennsylvania voting machine dispute,"By Zachary Cohen, CNN","3 minute read Published 12:56 PM EDT, Mon September 2, 2024",20240902,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/02/politics/election-deniers-pennsylvania-voting-machine-dispute/,"A Pennsylvania judge has determined that three 2020 election deniers must pay nearly $1 million in fees as the result of a years-long legal dispute with state officials over voting equipment used during the last presidential race, according to recent court filings.
Recommendations from the judge, who was appointed to serve as a special master overseeing the case, attach a dollar figure to sanctions previously imposed by the state’s Supreme Court against two Republican county commissioners and their attorney for allowing an outside firm to examine voting equipment after the 2020 election – despite a court order prohibiting them to do so, according to the new filings.
The case, which dates back to 2021, involves actions taken by two Fulton County, Pennsylvania, commissioners – Stuart Ulsh and Randy Bunch – who sought to have Dominion voting equipment examined by a third-party after the 2020 election. Many of former President Donald Trump’s allies falsely blamed Dominion’s software for his election defeat.
Thomas Carroll, an attorney who also served as a pro-Trump fake elector in 2020, was also sanctioned by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court for his conduct and – along with the county and the county commissioners – “shall be jointly and severally responsible” for paying nearly $1 million in fees to cover the Pennsylvania Secretary of State’s legal bills, according to the special master’s latest report.
The state Supreme Court will ultimately use the special master recommendations in awarding fees and costs resulting from the case.
Last week’s special master report marks one of the final chapters of the Fulton County voting equipment dispute – one of several legal battles over unauthorized access to election systems that emerged from the 2020 presidential race.
In Fulton County, multiple outside firms were ultimately given unauthorized access to voting systems after the 2020 election without authorization from the Board of Elections, according to previous court filings in the special master probe. The third county commissioner only learned that an outside firm had been allowed to inspect the election equipment until after it was done, court filings show.
None of the third party groups granted access to the voting systems in Fulton County were contracted by the county itself or had the proper accreditation to carry out such an inspection, according to court records.
In July 2021, upon learning of the unauthorized inspection, the secretary of state’s office argued that the inspection itself had compromised the integrity of the equipment by undermining chain of custody requirements and access limitations necessary to prevent tampering.
The state secretary issued a directive barring county boards of elections from providing access to third parties seeking to examine state-certified voting systems. The directive provided for the revocation of funding from counties whose machines had been decertified under the directive and stated that Pennsylvania would not reimburse any cost of replacement voting equipment that had to be withdrawn.
The commissioners and their lawyers then launched legal proceedings.
During the proceedings, the state secretary learned that Fulton County intended to allow another entity, Envoy Sage LLC, to inspect the equipment. The secretary sought and received a protective order from the Pennsylvania Supreme Court barring such an inspection. In January 2022, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court entered the protective order.
Months after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court entered the protective order, the commissioners nonetheless allowed another party – Speckin Forensics – to inspect the voting equipment without the knowledge of the state, according to court papers. After the completion of that report, the county moved to sue Dominion, arguing that the machines were not fit for their intended use and purpose.
When Pennsylvania state officials brought the action to the attention of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, the court issued sanctions. It ordered the county officials to pay attorney’s fees and referred their attorney, Thomas Carroll to Pennsylvania’s attorney disciplinary board. The court also ordered the Dominion voting equipment to be placed in the custody of a neutral agent."
Q26TZ53TJX_TVD646H1HDVDBI8,Liz Cheney says she is voting for Harris for president,"By Jamie Gangel, Rashard Rose and Piper Hudspeth Blackburn, CNN","2 minute read Updated 10:27 PM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/04/politics/liz-cheney-voting-kamala-harris/,"Republican former Rep. Liz Cheney will vote for Vice President Kamala Harris in November, she said during remarks at Duke University, according to audio obtained by CNN.
The former Wyoming congresswoman noted the importance of voting for Harris in states like North Carolina, where she appeared on Wednesday.
“I think it is crucially important for people to recognize, not only is what I just said about the danger that Trump poses something that should prevent people from voting for him, but I don’t believe that we have the luxury of writing in candidates’ names, particularly in swing states,” Cheney said.
She made the announcement in North Carolina specifically because it is a battleground state, according to a source close to Cheney.
“And as a conservative, as someone who believes in and cares about the Constitution, I have thought deeply about this, and because of the danger that Donald Trump poses, not only am I not voting for Donald Trump, but I will be voting for Kamala Harris,” she continued.
The Harris campaign highlighted Cheney’s endorsement Wednesday night and pointed to other Republicans who have backed her, including former Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger and former Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan.
“The Vice President is proud to have earned Congresswoman Cheney’s vote. She is a patriot who loves this country and puts our democracy and our Constitution first,” campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon said in a statement.

Cheney, who is the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney and a vocal critic of Trump, previously told CNN she is committed to doing what’s necessary to stop the former president from returning to the White House.
Cheney’s outspokenness against Trump and his efforts to overturn the 2020 election — including her vote to impeach him — eventually cost her her post in House Republican leadership. The House GOP ousted her as conference chair, replacing her with a top Trump defender, several months after the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.
She went on to serve as vice chair of the House select committee that investigated the insurrection, ultimately losing her seat in Congress in a 2022 primary to a Trump-backed challenger.
Cheney tried to counteract Trump’s influence in the 2022 midterms by opposing candidates who repeated his falsehoods about the 2020 election being stolen. The political action committee she started placed an ad buy urging Arizona voters to reject GOP gubernatorial nominee Kari Lake and Republican Secretary of State nominee Mark Finchem. She also crossed party lines to stump for two moderate Democrats in competitive House races that year.

Q34MY9AM6S_4HMCVIHZWXKQFST,A man was found dead in a closet at a Florida nursing home. His family wants answers,"By Rebekah Riess and Melissa Alonso, CNN","2 minute read Published 1:59 PM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/04/us/florida-nursing-home-death/,"A grieving Florida family is demanding answers after a man was found dead in a storage closet more than a week after he was reported missing at a North Miami nursing home and rehab center.
Elin Etienne’s body was discovered in the closet at the North Dade Nursing and Rehabilitation Center on Monday morning, North Miami Police Department Maj. Kessler Brooks told CNN.
Etienne, 71, was reported missing on August 22, police said. A missing person’s poster for him was issued on August 23, according to a police department post on X.
Etienne’s family says he had dementia – which the facility disputes, police told CNN.
“They said that he signed himself out, he doesn’t have the capacity to sign himself out,” family member Kimberly Etienne told CNN affiliate WSVN.
“At North Dade Nursing and Rehab, we are deeply committed to the health, well-being and safety of our residents, above all else,” center administrator Stephanie Pena said in a statement released to CNN.
“Our team is cooperating fully with the appropriate authorities, including law enforcement and our state regulatory partners. We are compassionate caregivers, and that will help get us through this difficult experience.
“At the same time, we remain committed to ensuring our residents continue receiving the high-quality care they have come to expect from our facility,” Pena said.
The local medical examiner removed Etienne’s body and autopsy results are pending, Brooks said. The investigation is ongoing, he said.
Family members gathered outside the nursing facility this week. “The entire family is here, and there’s been no answers,” Kimberly Etienne told WSVN.
North Dade Nursing and Rehabilitation Center has a two out of five stars overall rating, with only one star for health inspections and two for staffing, according to Medicare.gov.
It has faced over $23,000 in federal penalties over the last three years. Medicare says a facility can face a penalty for issues including “serious health or fire safety citation,” or failures “to correct a citation for a long period of time.”"
Q4EWLJGDBD_QGW2VZ1JOTXLV4W,White House condemns Tucker Carlson’s ‘Nazi propaganda’ interview as ‘disgusting and sadistic insult’,"By Brian Stelter, CNN","4 minute read Updated 5:54 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/05/media/white-house-condemns-tucker-carlson-nazi-propaganda-interview/,"The Biden administration is denouncing Tucker Carlson after the far-right personality hosted a guest on his show this week who suggested the Holocaust happened by accident, calling the interview “a disgusting and sadistic insult to all Americans.”
During Carlson’s two-hour sit-down with Darryl Cooper, a podcaster whom he said “may be the best and most honest popular historian in the United States,” Cooper claimed that Nazi Germany’s mass murder of Jews was an unintended consequence – something akin to poor planning instead of the methodical extermination that it actually was.
British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, Cooper claimed, was the “chief villain of the Second World War” and “primarily responsible for that war becoming what it did, becoming something other than an invasion of Poland.”

Carlson’s platforming of Cooper has been widely criticized in recent days, including by some right-wing figures who have defended Carlson in the past. Elon Musk, who promoted the interview on his social media platform, X, calling it “Very interesting. Worth watching,” later deleted his post.
On Thursday the White House added its weight to the matter.
In a statement first shared with CNN, senior deputy press secretary Andrew Bates said “giving a microphone to a Holocaust denier who spreads Nazi propaganda is a disgusting and sadistic insult to all Americans, to the memory of the over 6 million Jews who were genocidally murdered by Adolf Hitler, to the service of the millions of Americans who fought to defeat Nazism, and to every subsequent victim of Antisemitism.”
The administration’s statement specifically refuted Cooper’s claim to Carlson that Churchill was the “chief villain” of World War II.
“Hitler was one of the most evil figures in human history and the ‘chief villain’ of World War II, full stop,” Bates wrote. “The Biden-Harris Administration believes that trafficking in this moral rot is unacceptable at any time, let alone less than one year after the deadliest massacre perpetrated against the Jewish people since the Holocaust and at a time when the cancer of Antisemitism is growing all over the world.”
Reached for comment on Thursday, Carlson sharply criticized the White House.
“The fact that these lunatics have used the Churchill myth to bring our country closer to nuclear war than at any moment in history disgusts me, and should terrify every American,” he said in a text message to CNN. “They’re warmonger freaks. They don’t get the moral high ground.”
But numerous columnists have pointed out inaccuracies in Cooper’s remarks, including his assertion that the Nazis “went in with no plan” for housing millions of prisoners of war “and just threw these people into camps, and millions of people ended up dead there.”

Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, denounced Carlson’s interview with Cooper as “truly revolting.”
“The Nazis’ extensive network of concentration, forced labor, and death camps was part of Hitler’s deliberate plan to exterminate the Jewish people. Inmates didn’t just ‘end up dead’ and they did not ‘surrender,’” he said Wednesday.
In the year and a half since Carlson was fired by Fox News, the former primetime host turned internet vlogger has stoked controversy and garnered embarrassment through his web videos and speaking appearances. On Musk’s X and on his subscription video website, Carlson has interviewed radical figures including Alex Jones and others, offering a big platform to fringe voices and seemingly delighting in the outrage that ensues.
Despite the condemnation, Carlson has continued to be embraced by the Republican Party, which gave him a prime time speaking slot at last month’s party convention in Milwaukee.
Carlson is also undertaking a live speaking tour this fall with events across the country. Donald Trump’s vice presidential nominee, JD Vance, is scheduled to appear with Carlson at a Sept. 21 event in Hershey, Pennsylvania, a person familiar with the plans told CNN.
Several conservative columnists have raised questions about whether Vance will move forward with the appearance in light of the Cooper controversy. In a statement, the Vance campaign sought to distance the candidate from the interview.

Q4RQ9N3H27_VW0EP31A2F50NY4,Trump allies hope Jack Smith’s revised indictment lets them off the hook,"By Katelyn Polantz, Zachary Cohen and Devan Cole, CNN","5 minute read Published 4:00 AM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/04/politics/jack-smith-revised-indictment-trump-allies/,"While Donald Trump faces a fresh indictment over efforts to overturn the 2020 election, some of his biggest allies are hoping the revised charging document helps them evade professional consequences and criminal prosecution for their roles nearly four years ago.
Special counsel Jack Smith rewrote Trump’s federal indictment after the US Supreme Court ruled this summer that the president can’t be prosecuted for “official acts” taken while president. Smith not only narrowed the allegations against Trump but also removed references to communications between Trump and federal government officials.
Now former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark are trying to use their onetime boss’ winnowed indictment to their advantage.
Trump is the only one charged in the federal case, but several of his allies and members of his administration are facing state-level criminal charges over their meddling after the last election, including Clark and Meadows. Clark and others also are facing professional disciplinary proceedings that could disrupt their ability to practice law.
Meadows, in particular, could stand to benefit from the new Trump indictment handed up in federal court last week. Meadows was cut from much of the document, except for some interactions he had with Trump as the then-president sought to reach the secretary of state in Georgia on the phone to pressure him into aiding his election reversal gambit.
That has led Meadows’ attorneys to argue he should not be prosecuted for actions he took while serving in the White House. He’s been charged in Georgia and Arizona over his efforts to reverse the election results in the battleground states. His main defense so far has been to try to get the cases moved to federal court, which could make it easier for him to make a bid for his own immunity.
“I don’t think that’s Jack Smith’s intent,” an attorney close to the case told CNN about the new indictment bolstering Meadows’ argument. But, the attorney added, “it’s the way chips have fallen.”
Smith’s office declined to comment.
The Supreme Court’s ruling on immunity doesn’t provide protections outside of the president, but some legal experts say the fallout naturally extends beyond Trump – even if the arguments aren’t ultimately successful.
“These are not legal arguments that are, you know, outside the bounds of plausibility or just kind of good legal argumentation,” said Anthony Michael Kreis, a constitutional law professor at Georgia State University.
“But I think that they are weak,” he added.
Meadows has already seized on the changes in the new federal indictment in his Arizona criminal case.
“Mr. Meadows’ case for removal (to federal court) is supported by the superseding indictment filed this week by Special Counsel Jack Smith in United States v. Trump,” Meadows’ attorneys wrote in a court filing two days after the new indictment was unveiled.
The lawyers pointed to language Smith added to the indictment about the Georgia call in an apparent effort to distinguish it from Meadows’ role as chief of staff. The new indictment notes that Meadows “sometimes handled private and Campaign logistics for (Trump).”
Meadows’ attorneys took issue with that in the Arizona case.
“This is not an alleged criminal act by Mr. Meadows; as Chief of Staff, he was carrying out his official duties, even if the President was engaged in ‘unofficial’ activity,” they wrote in the court filing.
A federal judge in Arizona is set to consider Meadow’s arguments for moving his state criminal case to federal court during a hearing Thursday. A grand jury in Arizona handed up an indictment in April against Meadows and 17 other Trump associates over their election reversal efforts. Meadows has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
Two federal courts have already rejected Meadows’ bid to move his Georgia prosecution to federal court. His request for the Supreme Court to review the matter remains pending.
Clark could also stand to benefit from the new Trump indictment.
As an environmental lawyer at the Justice Department, Clark tried to push through a letter to officials in Georgia after the 2020 election, urging the state to interfere with the election results.
Though Clark was previously an unindicted co-conspirator of Trump’s in Smith’s case, the special counsel prosecutors have taken him out of the indictment entirely, because of the Supreme Court decision that his efforts were undertaken as an officer of the president.
Like Meadows’ legal team, Clark’s attorney has wasted no time in trying to invoke the superseding indictment to his client’s advantage. In a filing last week as part of professional disciplinary proceedings, Clarks’ attorney said it “bolsters Mr. Clark’s immunity and evidentiary arguments.”
“The issuance of a new indictment handed down by a new grand jury effectively concedes that Mr. Clark is not just unidicted (sic), but unindictable,” his attorney, Harry MacDougald, wrote.
Clark also is trying to move his Georgia criminal case to federal court. That criminal case is currently on hold while a Georgia appeals court considers an attempt by some of the defendants to disqualify the Atlanta-area prosecutor who brought the charges.
Several former Trump administration officials – including some who were compelled to speak to the grand jury more than a year ago or were described as witnesses in the previous indictment – were relieved to see the new version deleted them as well as the allegations they witnessed, sources familiar with the matter told CNN.
They hope the superseding indictment means they won’t have to testify publicly against the former president, if his case goes to trial, the sources said.
Smith waged secret court fights for months to force advisers like former White House counsel Pat Cipollone to appear before the grand jury in the Trump election subversion investigation. Cipollone, who was described in the original indictment, no longer appears in the superseding indictment.
Some legal experts say the Justice Department could be less likely to push for testimony from White House officials in future criminal investigations if prosecutors aren’t able to use their testimony at trial.
Still, some witnesses like Meadows could appear in court in Trump’s case before a trial. Courts still must determine whether some of Trump’s actions after the 2020 election were presidential – and therefore immune – or part of his campaign, and Trump’s allies could be called to testify."
Q50HFFOKNH_TOS1Q164CATI877,Arlington cemetery controversy deepens as Trump and Harris trade attacks,"By Samantha Waldenberg, Kate Sullivan and Shania Shelton, CNN","4 minute read Updated 10:31 PM EDT, Sat August 31, 2024",20240901,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/08/31/politics/harris-slams-trump-arlington-national-cemetery/,"Donald Trump on Saturday continued to defend his visit this week to Arlington National Cemetery amid mounting criticism, including from Vice President Kamala Harris, who said the former president “is unable to comprehend anything other than service to himself.”
Veterans, service members and their families “should be honored, never disparaged, and treated with nothing less than our highest respect and gratitude,” Harris wrote Saturday in a lengthy post on social media. “And it is my belief that someone who cannot meet this simple, sacred duty should never again stand behind the seal of the President of the United States of America.”
Trump has faced controversy over his Monday visit to the cemetery after a wreath-laying ceremony to honor the 13 US service members who were killed in the Kabul airport bombing in 2021. Trump was rebuked by the Army over his campaign’s use of video and images from the visit, which critics say ran afoul of rules prohibiting political activity on the sacred grounds. The Army has said participants in the ceremony “were made aware of federal laws” regarding political activity and an employee of the cemetery who “attempted to ensure adherence to these rules was abruptly pushed aside.”

After Harris’ statement, the former president highlighted the support of parents of service members killed in the airport bombing. In videos posted to Truth Social, the parents praised Trump while condemning Harris and President Joe Biden.
Jaclyn Schmitz, mother of Lance Cpl. Jared Schmitz, said in her video, “Kamala, your statement is nothing more than a political spin to help you look better in your presidential campaign against Donald Trump. You have never walked a single day in our shoes. Our kids were murdered because of your administration, and you are partly to blame.”
Similarly, Coral Doolittle, mother of Cpl. Humberto A. Sanchez, slammed Harris and Biden as the people responsible for “murdering our kids.”
“They called the withdrawal in Afghanistan a success, and for us, it was just sadness and a disgrace,” Doolittle added.
Darin Hoover, father of Staff Sgt. Taylor Hoover, said in another video that “the events that happened on August 26, 2024, with President Trump at Arlington National Cemetery were solemn and in keeping with the reverence and respect that is given to all members of our military that are buried there.”
Hoover said while at the cemetery, “We asked the Trump team to take the videos, take the pictures, of our time there.”
Saturday’s statement marks the first time the vice president has directly addressed the controversy as she attempts to draw a contrast between herself and her rival ahead of their September 10 debate. Michael Tyler, the Harris campaign’s communications director, previously called the incident “pretty sad” in an interview on CNN but said it is what people have “come to expect from Donald Trump and his team.”
The Trump campaign on Saturday also sent out a statement from Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton, an Army veteran and Trump ally, defending the former president and attacking Army Secretary Christine Wormuth.
Cotton, who was not present during Trump’s trip to the cemetery, said that “neither the families nor President Trump violated cemetery regulations or policies” and claimed the “political apparatchiks working for the incompetent secretary of the Army disrespected the wishes of these Gold Star families.”
analysis Arlington confrontation isn’t Trump’s first military cemetery controversy
Accounts of the incident on Monday have varied. Trump campaign officials have said an individual physically blocked the former president’s team from accompanying him during the visit, and a cemetery spokesperson confirmed to CNN “there was an incident” and a “report was filed.”
The campaign has insisted there were no violations of the law, while cemetery officials have said Trump’s team was told ahead of time to avoid political activity. Federal law prohibits political campaigning or election-related activities within Army National Military Cemeteries, according to a statement from Arlington National Cemetery obtained by CNN.
A video of the visit posted by the Trump campaign on TikTok earlier this week showed the former president walking through Arlington and visiting grave sites, with audio of him criticizing the Biden administration’s management of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan.
NPR first reported there had been a “verbal and physical altercation” during the cemetery visit. A source with knowledge of the incident told the outlet that a cemetery official attempted to prevent Trump’s team from photographing and filming in the area where recent US casualties are buried. In response, Trump campaign staff “verbally abused and pushed the official aside,” according to NPR.
An Army spokesperson said while the incident was reported to the police department at Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall, the employee in question “decided not to press charges” so the Army “considers this matter closed.”

QH5CV0S49T_B1UI07FO3CCGPHG,Vladimir Putin trolls US presidential race with ‘endorsement’ of Kamala Harris,"Analysis by Nathan Hodge, CNN","3 minute read Updated 4:09 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/05/europe/vladimir-putin-kamala-harris-endorsement-intl/,"Russian President Vladimir Putin raised eyebrows Thursday when he expressed his support for US Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential bid, flattering the Democratic nominee with some curiously timed remarks.
“Our ‘favorite,’ if you can call it that, was the current president, Mr. [Joe] Biden. But he was removed from the race, and he recommended all his supporters to support Ms. Harris. Well, we will do so – we will support her,” Putin said Thursday at the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok. “She laughs so expressively and infectiously that it means that she is doing well.”
Putin also criticized former president and current Republican nominee Donald Trump for placing “so many restrictions and sanctions against Russia like no other president has ever introduced before him.”
Putin’s comments come on the heels of sweeping sanctions announced by the Biden administration to combat a Russian government-backed disinformation effort to influence the 2024 elections and boost Trump’s candidacy.
And despite the Russian leader’s vocal support of the Democrats, US Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said on Wednesday that three Russian companies – at Putin’s direction – used fake profiles to promote false narratives on social media. Internal documents produced by one of those Russian companies show one of the goals of the propaganda effort was to support Trump’s candidacy or whoever emerged as the Republican nominee for president, according to an FBI affidavit.
So what is Putin trying to accomplish?
If the past is any guide, Putin is simply stirring the pot of US domestic politics. In December 2015, Putin praised Trump, calling him the front-runner months before the businessman secured the Republican nomination.
“He is a bright and talented person without any doubt,” Putin said, calling Trump “an outstanding and talented personality.”
Did Putin know something about the 2016 US presidential elections that the pollsters didn’t? No, but the Kremlin leader did little to conceal his dislike of Hillary Clinton, then the likely Democratic nominee.
And when purloined Democratic National Committee emails were leaked just ahead of the Democratic National Convention, Putin did not hide his glee.
While US officials pointed a firm finger of blame at Russia for the hack, Putin denied the Russian state had anything to do with it. And in remarks at the same forum in September 2016, he praised the leak as a sort of service to the voters, saying, “The important thing is the content that was given to the public.”
That content being the embarrassing revelation in the leaked emails that Democratic officials gave preferential treatment to Clinton.
In other words, the whole DNC hack episode supported the Kremlin’s view that American democracy is a sham: Nothing matters but power, everything is decided in smoke-filled rooms, and hectoring countries like Russia about adherence to democracy and human rights is hypocritical.
Putin’s view of the American political system makes even more sense when we are reminded of an insight from exiled Russian political journalist Mikhail Zygar, the author of “All the Kremlin’s Men.”
Zygar noted that Putin loved “House of Cards” – the darkly cynical television series about Washington politics – and even recommended it to his ministers.
“That’s his American politics textbook,” Zygar said in an interview.
It’s also possible that Putin was simply trolling Harris by winking at a consistent insult from Trump about the way she laughs.
So if Putin’s take on US election politics is seen through the lens of “House of Cards,” then, Putin’s support of Harris is a sort of Frank Underwood move: A kind of endorsement poisonous to its recipient.

QHQA9DTTN4_HMM37KR9VU324DV,Your children’s smartphones aren’t making them smarter,"Analysis by Kara Alaimo, CNN","5 minute read Updated 7:44 AM EDT, Mon September 2, 2024",20240902,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/02/health/phones-allowed-school-children-wellness/,"Get inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple. Sign up for CNN’s Life, But Better newsletter for information and tools designed to improve your well-being
As kids head back to school, many schools aren’t allowing them to bring their phones to class. Legislation to ban phones in schools has been proposed or passed in many cities and states. Most schools already have policies prohibiting them for nonacademic use, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.
Parents often question these policies because they want to be able to reach their kids in an emergency such as a school shooting.
Yet research suggests it’s not just a good idea for kids to put their phones away while in class — they shouldn’t bring them to school at all.
Related article More than a third of teens say they spend too much time on their phones, new study finds
Some 97% of 11- to 17-year-olds use their phones during school time, for an average of 43 minutes, according to a 2023 Common Sense Media study. If they’re checking their phones between classes or at lunch and recess, they’re likely preoccupied with what they’re seeing on their screens and therefore spending less time talking, playing or even just hanging out with their friends.
Such preoccupation is not healthy because, as social psychologist Jonathan Haidt wrote in “The Anxious Generation: How the Great Rewiring of Childhood is Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness,” one of the most important things young people should be doing is playing with peers.
In doing so, they learn to navigate social dynamics and build skills by figuring out how to do different activities. It teaches them they can handle other challenges they’ll face in the future, which Haidt said can help protect them from anxiety.
But phones aren’t just intruding on kids’ time outside class. In a June Pew Research Center survey, 72% of public high school teachers said cell phone distractions are a major problem in their classrooms. If children are sneaking peeks at their phones, they can’t possibly be paying attention to what they’re supposed to be learning. A wide body of evidence tells us the human brain can’t multitask — we can only do one thing at a time.
One indicator that students aren’t learning as much at school as they did in the pre-phone era is scores on the ACT — a standardized test that measures whether they have the English, reading, math and science skills needed for first-year college courses. Last year, ACT scores dropped to the lowest level in more than 30 years, according to the organization that administers the test.
As a professor who has taught at five universities since 2010, I’ve witnessed this trend myself. When I first started teaching, before smartphones became ubiquitous, many of my students arrived better able to concentrate and work through long reading passages than they are now.

Of course, it’s easy to imagine how kids will respond if we ask them to leave their phones home: They’ll promise not to check them during the school day. Unfortunately, it’s unreasonable to expect them to fight the urge to look at products that are designed to be addictive, with features such as bottomless scrolling and continuous notifications. The average teen gets 237 phone notifications a day on their phones, according to the Common Sense Media study — with a quarter coming in during the school day.
Sending kids to school sans smartphones forces them to concentrate on what’s happening in front of them rather than on their screens. That’s another important skill to learn.
“The phone-based life makes it difficult for people to be fully present with others when they are with others, and to sit silently with themselves when they are alone,” Haidt warned.
What’s more, the idea that having a phone with them makes kids safer is often a myth.
Phones can be dangerously distracting to teens. At one of my recent talks at a private school, the school psychologist told parents she regularly sees their children walk out of school looking at their screens while crossing the streets of Manhattan. So, phones may cause emergencies in the first place.
Of course, if children have a crisis on the way home from school, in most places in the United States, there will be businesses and people around with phones who will be willing to let them call their parents.
Similarly, while many parents wish they could reach their children in the unthinkable event of a school shooting, kids will be safer if they remain quiet and focused on the instructions they receive from school administrators or law enforcement.

In addition, children often have extraordinarily dangerous experiences on their phones. In August, a report by Thorn, a nonprofit that combats child sex abuse, revealed that the great majority — 59% — of youth said they’ve had online experiences that have been potentially harmful. One in 3 minors and 1 in 5 preteens said they’d had online sexual experiences with someone they thought was an adult, according to the report.
It’s true that letting kids bring phones to school can make coordinating things like pickups after extracurricular activities easier. If children truly need a phone to communicate with their parents — perhaps because they have a medical condition and need to be able to reach someone in an emergency or because their pickup arrangements are so complicated that a time and location can’t be set in advance — one option Haidt recommended is an old-fashioned flip phone. Having one lets them text or call but not log on to social media apps.
Related article Parents are not OK right now. Here’s what they can do
Sending kids to school with smartphones is unlikely to make them smarter or safer. It’s more likely to distract them and make them unable to focus on learning.
Without a phone, kids can focus on interacting with peers, learning and being fully present in their surroundings — rather than having these things compete for their attention with influencers and internet memes.

QL3A2ISO4O_I5R7NYYU97ZVKNG,Biden prepared to block US Steel purchase by Nippon Steel,"By Chris Isidore, Kayla Tausche and Arlette Saenz, CNN","9 minute read Updated 9:00 PM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/04/business/us-steel-nippon-steel-chances/,"President Joe Biden is prepared to block Japan’s Nippon Steel’s proposed acquisition of US Steel, two sources familiar with the matter said, a move that would deal a major blow to the $14 billion merger that has become a lightning rod in an election year as candidates on both sides of the aisle vow to protect American manufacturing.
A White House official would not comment on the president’s decision but said the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which is investigating the proposed merger on national security grounds, has not transmitted its recommendations to Biden yet. The president would oppose the deal, one source said, if the CFIUS committee recommended the deal not go through or withheld a recommendation.
“CFIUS hasn’t transmitted a recommendation to the president, and that’s the next step in this process,” the White House official said.
Customarily, a final report from the committee informs a president’s view of the potential risks a deal poses. In this case, high-profile public opposition to a deal in advance of the report’s submission may end up influencing the recommendation the committee makes. Treasury chairs the committee, which is comprised of high-level officials from the president’s Cabinet agencies who are responsible for areas of national security.
One source said the president’s announcement could come as early as this week, but cautioned the timing remains fluid.
US Steel and Nippon Steel both indicated in statements that they’re open to legal fights to get the deal approved, no matter what actions is announced by Biden.
“We continue to stand by the fact that there are no national security issues associated with this transaction, as Japan is one of our most staunch allies,” US Steel said. “We fully expect to pursue all possible options under the law to ensure this transaction closes.”
In a statement, a spokesperson for Nippon Steel said the company has not received any updates on the CFIUS process.
“Since the outset of the regulatory review process, we have been clear with the administration that we do not believe this transaction creates any national security concerns,” according to the statement. “US Steel and the entire American steel industry will be on much stronger footing because of Nippon Steel’s investment in US Steel – an investment that Nippon Steel is the only willing and able party to do so.”
And Nippon Steel indicated it was not ready to give up the fight: “Nippon Steel strongly believes that the US government must appropriately handle procedures on this matter in accordance with the law.”
The news, first reported earlier Wednesday by the Washington Post, is not a surprise as Biden is on record opposing the deal, even as it was being considered by members of his administration.
Shares of US Steel (X) closed down 17.5% on the news at $29.37, well below the $55 a share that Nippon Steel agreed to pay for the stock back in December when the deal was announced.
The president had previously outlined opposition to the deal in March, saying it is “vital for it to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and operated.”
In addition to Biden’s stated opposition, Vice President Kamala Harris, former President Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance have all voiced opposition to the deal. Harris is the most recent to come out against the proposed purchase at a rally in Pittsburgh on Labor Day, in which she was introduced by Biden and spoke to members of the United Steelworkers union. The union has been a leading opponent of the agreement.
But there are risks if Biden undertakes the action. Earlier in the day Wednesday, US Steel issued a statement threatening to close its mills with unionized workers if it doesn’t get approval of the unpopular deal, a move that could put pressure on the United Steelworkers union to reach an agreement with the two companies that would clear the way for approval of Nippon’s purchase.
The Justice Department is also conducting an antitrust review of the potential merger.
US Steel has said that the multi-billion dollar investment from its Japanese rival would go further in shoring up the company’s facilities and finances than it could afford on its own.
“Without the Nippon Steel transaction, US Steel will largely pivot away from its blast furnace facilities, putting thousands of good-paying union jobs at risk, negatively impacting numerous communities across the locations where its facilities exist,” the company said in a statement Wednesday. It said it might also move its headquarters away from Pittsburgh without the deal.
The company said the $2.7 billion that Nippon Steel has pledged to invest in its unionized mills outside of Pittsburgh and in Gary, Indiana, would support the future of manufacturing at those facilities.
“Those investments are subject to the closing of the transaction with US Steel and receipt of necessary regulatory approvals,” US Steel said. “A stand-alone US Steel would not make the same financial commitments.”
The USW responded by accusing US Steel of making “baseless and unlawful threats,” and “a last gasp and desperate effort to save a merger on life support.” It said CEO David Burritt’s “reckless statements and mismanagement are the only true obstacle to US Steel remaining a sustainable steel company.”
As for the promised investment by Nippon Steel in the union-represented facilities, the union said, “a press release is not a contract, and Nippon has shown that when it puts its promises in writing, it fills its proposals with so many conditions as to make its commitments worthless.”
The USW did not immediately responded Wednesday afternoon to requests for comment on Biden’s expected action.
It is also not immediately clear if the action by Biden would kill the deal for good or would simply give the two steel companies and the union a chance to negotiate a deal that would be acceptable to all sides.
If the latter is the case, the political opposition to the deal and Biden’s action would give the union some bargaining leverage as well. Without the union changing its position and supporting the deal, it’s unlikely that the political opposition to the deal will change.
But there’s reason to think that if deal is not completely dead, it could yet win approval not only from regulators but also from the union now firmly opposed to the deal – although experts who believe that could happen say it wouldn’t occur until after the election.
The union, for example, is using its current political leverage to get the best possible deal from Nippon and US Steel, including even stronger promises to keep US Steel’s mills that employ union members open and financial protections for anyone who does lose a job, said Philip Gibbs, a steel analyst for KeyBanc, in an interview with CNN ahead of word of Biden’s plans.
“This might be the best possible deal for US Steel,” Gibbs said. “If a change in ownership is perhaps inevitable, if all roads lead to attrition, why not try to maximize the safety nets in writing. They want to make sure their families are taken care of.”
The proposed purchase was bound to be unpopular. US Steel was once a symbol of American industrial might. It was the most valuable company in the world and the first to be worth $1 billion soon after its creation in 1901. It was also crucial to the US economy and the cars, appliances, bridges and skyscrapers that tangibly indicated that strength. Decades of decline later, it is no longer even the largest US steelmaker, and a relatively minor employer.
But it is still not a company that politicians who enjoy talking about the American greatness want to see fall into foreign hands.
There are relatively few steelworkers still working for the company in the crucial electoral battleground state of Pennsylvania. US Steel says it has more than 3,000 employees in the state in its remaining steel mills along the Monongahela River just outside of Pittsburgh. But the company has tens of thousands of retirees still in the state, and many more voters whose parents, grandparents or even great-grandparents may have worked in its mills. It makes the idea of a Japanese purchase of the once powerful US company a politically fraught move, said Gibbs.

“You’re not just talking about the perception of the steelworkers, it’s the perception of the state itself,” said Gibbs. “As a politician you have to say you’re not going to stand by and let the deal happen.”
To try to assure its US critics, Nippon Steel issued a statement Wednesday promising that US Steel would continue to have a board of directors made up mostly of American citizens, and that Americans would also be a majority of management at the company. It also said there would be no transfer of any of US Steel’s production capacity or jobs outside the United States.
The union is concerned that Nippon is more interested in US Steel’s nonunion plants that use electric furnaces to make steel by melting scrap, rather than in the unionized mills, known as integrated steel mills, that still make steel from its raw materials, such as iron ore.
“Nippon has shown through their own actions that they’re changing the way they operate in Japan,” Gibbs said about the shift from integrated mills to electric furnaces there.
The union says it doesn’t believe in the promises made by Nippon Steel so far and that it remains opposed to the purchase. It said it believes that Nippon is interested in using US Steel’s finishing mills to finish slabs of steel it would produce in Japan and ship here, rather than producing the steel slab in blast furnaces in America.

“Nippon still has not provided any true guarantees that our jobs, wages or benefits will be protected beyond the expiration of our current agreements in 2026,” said a union statement last month. It did not answer a question from CNN asking if it is still talking with Nippon and US Steel about dropping opposition to the deal.
If the union does drop its opposition, it becomes much easier for politicians to allow it go through, Gibbs said, even if they would likely want to wait until after the election.
CFIUS is supposed to look into the national security implications of deals, and many of the politicians who have come out opposed to the deal claim it would be a threat to the nation’s long-term economic health. A number of experts argue that doesn’t hold up to scrutiny.
“Given the US-Japanese alliance, Nippon Steel’s record, and the US steel industry’s existing weaknesses, it is difficult if not impossible to identify a national security risk that justifies opposing the merger,” said Michael Leiter, head of Skadden’s CFIUS and National Security Practices, in an interview with CNN ahead of word of Biden’s plans. “It is much, much easier, however, to identify a political risk, and regrettably that calculus is dominating the issue.”

QLUN7JFZ9H_JTPTTMG7M3EXZ3G,What to watch for at the first post-SCOTUS hearing in the Trump federal election subversion case,"By Tierney Sneed and Hannah Rabinowitz, CNN","7 minute read Published 5:00 AM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/05/politics/donald-trump-election-jan-6-hearing/,"Lawyers for Donald Trump and special counsel Jack Smith will be before Judge Tanya Chutkan on Thursday for the first hearing in the federal election subversion case since prosecutors revised their indictment to try to bring their case in line with a Supreme Court ruling extending to Trump some presidential immunity in the prosecution.
Chutkan will consider where the case goes from here, as a pre-election trial is now firmly out of reach. Smith’s and Trump’s teams have differing visions for what should come next, and they laid out their dueling approaches in court filings late Friday night.
Now the trial judge will have the opportunity to press them on those proposals. Thursday’s hearing could give a view into how Chutkan – an Obama appointee who was eager to get the prosecution to trial before the Supreme Court intervened – sees the case now that it is back in her court. She will ultimately decide what happens in the case before Americans cast their ballots, with Trump again topping the GOP presidential ticket, and how far the case moves along before Inauguration Day, when Trump, if elected, could bring about the end of the case.
Trump has claimed the Justice Department engaged in election interference by filing the newly revised indictment, an allegation Attorney General Merrick Garland rejected Wednesday, telling reporters that he was “confident” that Smith abided by DOJ policies regarding the sensitivities around major public activity near elections.
“I stand by the actions of the special counsel,” Garland said. “The superseding indictment is an effort to respond to the direct instructions of the Supreme Court as to how to effectuate a new indictment in an ongoing case.”
The hearing starts at 10 a.m. ET in Washington, DC’s federal courthouse. Cameras are not allowed into Chutkan’s courtroom, but CNN will be providing live updates as it unfolds. Here’s what to watch for:
Smith and Trump both offered their perspectives of the case’s schedule on Friday: Smith did not offer firm dates for the next phase of the case, while Trump recommended a schedule for certain pre-trial disputes that would carry through until at least the beginning of 2025.
Their staunch disagreements set up what could be a fierce debate Thursday in front of the judge, who will ultimately decide how the case will move forward.
Chutkan hasn’t yet tipped her hand as to whether she sees any detailed legal fights playing out before November’s presidential election. When she scheduled Thursday’s hearing last month, Chutkan only instructed the parties to get together to see whether they could agree on scheduling matters, and to highlight where they disagree.
In the past, the judge has shown a desire to push the case forward as quickly as possible. Chutkan has ruled on issues several times without holding in-person hearings, and before the case was upended by a lengthy appeals process, repeatedly refused to push back deadlines or the now-defunct March trial date.
In those disputes, however, prosecutors fiercely argued to keep the case on a tight schedule, whereas now they appear to be leaving all scheduling matters up to the judge. That switch could be because prosecutors don’t want to be perceived as explicitly pushing for dramatic public flare-ups in the case during the weeks before the election. Leaving those deadline decisions entirely up to Chutkan would take the onus off of the Justice Department.
With the filing last week of a so-called “superseding indictment,” Smith signaled that, though he spent several months without publicly indicating how they would handle the election interference prosecution going forward, his team has been quietly re-assembling their case.
Those preparations would allow prosecutors to propel the case forward – and quickly – should the judge decide to do so.
In the few weeks since the case returned to the district court’s jurisdiction, prosecutors rewrote the indictment against Trump entirely so that it would, in their eyes, conform with the high court’s mandate on presidential immunity.
The Supreme Court said in July that Trump had absolute immunity when it came to the executive branch’s “core” functions and said that his election-related dealings with the Justice Department fit in that category, so Smith removed the DOJ-related allegations entirely for that case. For other official presidential acts, such as Trump’s interactions with his vice president, Mike Pence, the immunity is “presumed” but could be overcome if prosecutors could prove that criminalizing that conduct wouldn’t interfere with a president performing his “constitutional functions,” the Supreme Court said. So, Smith has made significant edits to other parts of his indictment to distinguish Trump’s post-election actions – including his pressure campaign on Pence – from the duties of a president, while removing some interactions Trump had with his official advisers.
And in their scheduling proposal to Chutkan on Friday, the special counsel prosecutors indicated that they have been prepping other filings too, particularly over issues likely to arise in the continued and arduous fight over what evidence can still be presented in the case. “The Government is prepared to file its opening immunity brief promptly at any time the Court deems appropriate,” prosecutors wrote of those briefings.
Trump and Smith have different procedural ideas for how the battle over immunity that the Supreme Court ruling teed up should be tackled. On Thursday, Chutkan could indicate that she is choosing one of those approaches over the other, or she might press to find some middle ground way that melds their opposing proposals.
Smith, in Friday’s court filings, suggested that the issue could be decided just with legal briefings and said that his office was ready to file an opening briefing explaining how the superseding indictment comports with the Supreme Court’s decision.
Trump disagreed with that process in Friday’s filings. Instead, his lawyers think Trump is entitled to another round of immunity-related discovery from the government before the judge considers whether the revised case comports with the Supreme Court’s ruling. Trump argued the court should reserve time on its schedule to hash out any disputes that would arise if prosecutors refused to turn over records Trump is seeking. And Trump thinks he should be able to file the first brief on the merits of the immunity issues instead of the special counsel, with a motion to dismiss that would seek to toss the entire superseding indictment.
But before all that, Trump says that the court should decide a challenge he is planning to file alleging that Smith was unconstitutionally appointed and that his office was unlawfully funded – a similar motion to that which led to the dismissal of his federal case in Florida.
Another process-related question Chutkan may weigh in on is whether she will deal with non-immunity issues while she’s considering the immunity question, or if each dispute will need to be dealt with separately.
In addition to the immunity issue, Trump previewed in Friday’s filing what will be several other possible efforts he launches to attack Smith’s case. At Thursday’s hearing, Chutkan could lay out a process for dealing with those potential requests for the case’s dismissal, while signaling how seriously she views them.
Trump will try to replicate the successful challenge he brought to Smith’s appointment in the Florida case, which led to the judge there dismissing the classified documents prosecution (that ruling is up on appeal). Trump also plans a separate attack on the election subversion case that will allege that the grand jury that handed up the new indictment was exposed to evidence covered by the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling, requiring the case’s dismissal.
Trump’s lawyers are additionally considering a challenge zeroing in on the central role Trump’s conduct toward Pence continues to play in Smith’s case.
Another challenge they might bring would argue Smith’s case is flawed because it brings an obstruction charge that was undermined by a separate Supreme Court ruling this term, in which the court limited the use of the obstruction charge in Capitol rioter cases.
“Fully considering, researching, briefing, and resolving each of these potential motions will take considerable time and resources,” Trump’s attorneys said in the Friday filing.

QR8AOK6ZVG_QXW3VUYJC8D1QR1,The Murdoch family is secretly battling over succession. News outlets are asking a court to make it public,"By Hadas Gold, CNN","2 minute read Published 9:45 PM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/04/media/rupert-murdoch-lachlan-succession-court-news-outlets/,"A coalition of media organizations, including CNN, has petitioned a Nevada court to open up the secret proceedings surrounding a legal battle over the future of billionaire Rupert Murdoch’s media empire.
The New York Times, Associated Press, National Public Radio, The Washington Post, Reuters and CNN filed a motion Wednesday in the Second Judicial District Court in Nevada to make public the proceedings, objecting to the case being so extensively sealed that it doesn’t even appear on any court schedule or docket.
The Murdoch family, famous for helming one of the world’s most influential media empires that includes Fox News, The Wall Street Journal and outlets in Australia and the UK, is locked in a secret court battle over succession and control of the future of the family business, according to a New York Times report published in July citing sealed court documents.
According to the report, Murdoch, the 93-year-old patriarch, filed a petition late last year to amend the irrevocable family trust that would have given equal voting shares to Murdoch’s eldest four children. Instead, Murdoch wanted to grant exclusive control to his eldest son and chosen successor Lachlan, according to The Times.
Lachlan, who is more politically aligned with his father’s conservative views than his siblings, took over as chairman of Fox Corporation and News Corporation last September. Citing the court documents, which CNN has not independently seen, the Times reported that Murdoch felt handing Lachlan control of the media businesses he founded would better protect their value following his death by maintaining its right-wing editorial bent.
But the entire process has been completely sealed in Nevada, with even the existence of the proceedings kept in secret.
“Nevada’s courts are accountable to the public, and the public is entitled to know whether the trust at issue is being administered in accordance with the law,” the filing stated. “Certainly, an entire matter cannot be sealed such that its very existence is not a public record, even if all parties to the litigation agree. Rather, the court must apply the presumption of access and make specific findings to underpin any sealing.”
The filing argued that completely sealing the proceedings “meets neither the substantive nor procedural requirements imposed by the constitutional right of access,” and any concerns over privacy could be met with redactions.
According to the Times, the trust only allows changes that are done in good faith with the purpose of benefiting all heirs. A trial to decide whether Murdoch is acting in good faith is expected to begin in September."

A federal judge in Manhattan denied his initial request to move the case to the Southern District of New York on Tuesday. Trump’s attorneys filed a notice of appeal of that decision soon after.
Trump’s legal team filed the petition last week to move the state case to federal court in the wake of the Supreme Court’s presidential immunity decision. They also asked the federal judge to postpone Trump’s sentencing, currently set for September 18.
Last week, Trump’s attorneys asked Judge Juan Merchan to refrain from issuing a decision over presidential immunity to allow the process in federal court to play out. Merchan had previously said he’d rule on that motion September 16.
In a letter filed with the state court on Wednesday, the Manhattan district attorney’s office said Trump now has no basis for his request to pause the state proceedings because of that federal ruling.
“Because there is no pending notice of removal with the federal court, there is no basis for the relief sought in defendant’s August 29 letter-motion,” the letter says.
The letter does not reference Trump’s notice of appeal.
Merchan still has not ruled on Trump’s separate request to delay the sentencing until after the election.
The judge could issue a decision as soon as this week.

Adetshina, age 23, triumphed at the pageant held in Lagos on Saturday night. She will represent Nigeria in the Miss Universe competition in Mexico in November.
Last month, she quit the Miss South Africa contest after becoming the target of xenophobic online attacks and later accepted an invitation to compete in the Nigerian pageant.
Many South Africans had questioned her eligibility to participate in their country’s contest after reports emerged that she was born to a Nigerian father and a South African mother with Mozambican roots.
Organizers of Miss Universe Nigeria said at the time that Adetshina’s invitation was “an opportunity to represent her father’s native land on an international stage.” They added that her “journey in pageantry is far from over.”

Writing on Instagram after her victory, Adetshina said it was “a dream come true,” describing the crown as “not just a symbol of beauty” but “a call to action” for a united Africa.
“As I accept this honor, I want to share a vision that burns deeply within me, a vision of African unity and peaceful coexistence!” she wrote in a statement on her Instagram page.
“Let’s break down the barriers that divide us. Let’s foster a continent where every African can move freely without prejudice, pursue their dreams, and contribute to the growth and prosperity of our great continent,” the statement added.
South African authorities say they are working to clarify Adetshina’s citizenship status after the country’s Home Affairs department, which oversees immigration, said her mother may have committed identity fraud to obtain South African citizenship in 2001.
The department, however, exonerated Adetshina of any wrongdoing, saying she was just an infant at the time."
R1DUQXK7DD_GFLBX0Y09LNWYKR,Independent Russian watchmaker upends race to design world’s thinnest wristwatch,"By Oscar Holland, CNN","4 minute read Updated 12:19 AM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/05/style/konstantin-chaykin-thinking-worlds-thinnest-watch/,"In recent years, the giants of European horology have been locked in a heated battle to design the world’s thinnest mechanical watch.
Luxury brands Bulgari, Piaget and Richard Mille have all, since 2018, held the coveted record, which was most recently broken by Bulgari’s sleek 1.7-millimeter-thick Octo Finissimo Ultra Mark II, in April.
But now, an independent Russian watchmaker and inventor may have trumped them all.
Moscow-based Konstantin Chaykin says his new ThinKing prototype, which he debuted at the Geneva Watch Days fair in Switzerland last week, is just 1.65 millimeters (less than one-fifteenth of an inch) thick. He also believes it to be among the world’s lightest watches, weighing just 13.3 grams (less than 0.47 ounces), without its strap.
In an email to CNN, Chaykin said he has developed various innovations to make his design thinner “without compromising its functionality,” including a winding mechanism that is integrated into the barrel of the watch. The ThinKing also features a “double balance” wheel that allowed Chaykin to reduce the number of layers in the watch movement.
Mechanisms for winding the watch and adjusting its dials are, meanwhile, found in a separate 5.4-millimeter-thick carrier case, freeing up space (though the ThinKing can also be wound with a key). Chaykin said he has filed several patent applications, though none have yet been granted.
The watch is made using stainless steel and tungsten carbide, a light but exceptionally rigid compound. Chaykin, who is the only Russian member of the prestigious Académie Horlogère des Créateurs Indépendants, said he is also considering using sapphires or diamonds in future versions of the watch, according to his brand’s website.
With the hour and minute displays separate from one another, the design resembles a face — a hallmark of the watchmaker’s signature Wristmons collection. The dials are each protected by 0.35-millimeter-thick (0.014-inch) sapphire crystals.
Producing ultra-slim watches that are reliable, accurate and durable enough to wear has posed a major technical challenge to the world’s watchmakers. But the race to design ever-thinner watches appears to have accelerated in recent years.
Swiss brand Piaget debuted its 2-millimeter-thick Altiplano Ultimate Concept, then the world’s slimmest, in 2018, before putting it into production two years later. Luxury giant Bulgari then took the crown with the first iteration of its Octo Finissimo Ultra, which came in at just 1.8 millimeters.

Watchmaker Richard Mille soon went 0.05 millimeters thinner — a difference equivalent to a piece of printer paper — in 2022, with its RM UP-01 Ferrari. Bulgari then reclaimed the title this year with its aforementioned Octo Finissimo Ultra Mark II, a limited-edition model that was widely reported to cost over $500,000.
Whether Chaykin’s ThinKing can now be considered the record-holder, however, may be a matter of debate in horology circles. (Guinness World Records does not currently list an independently adjudicated record for thinnest watch.)
For one, the ThinKing is currently just a prototype — and its functionality and accuracy are yet to be independently assessed. Describing it as “more of a design and engineering study at this point,” James Stacey, lead editor of online watch magazine Hodinkee, wrote last week that he was “sure any sort of record-setting will be with (a) for-production (rather than) than non-production” timepiece.
The design is also so thin that it requires a special strap, featuring titanium supports and elastic inserts, to protect it from the shocks and stresses of everyday wear.
Chaykin nonetheless believes his prototype’s timekeeping accuracy and 32-hour power reserve qualify it as the new record-holder. He welcomed outside assessment, telling CNN that during the five-day Geneva Watch Days fair “hundreds of people” were able to inspect his creation.
“Visitors were able to hold the watch in their hands, check the time and test its functionality,” he said. “It is quite a bold step on our part to show the prototype in this way.  But the watch, to our delight, works perfectly, and to the delight of the visitors, it was possible to touch the watch… However, we are prepared to carry out all the necessary independent tests.”
The watchmaker said he will present a “final” version of his design at the Watches & Wonders trade show, also in Geneva, next April. By that time, the updated design should feature improved accuracy, power reserve and “tightness,” among other things, he told CNN. He added that the watch’s price “is not yet known.”

In a separate statement, Chaykin, who founded his eponymous watchmaking brand in 2003, said he became interested in slim timepieces after encountering an ultra-thin 19th-century Bagnolet pocket watch around 20 years ago.
He was inspired to make one after being challenged by a client to design an ultra-thin watch of his own. “I initially considered many possibilities and dedicated an entire Moleskine (notebook) to finding technical solutions,” he is quoted saying.
Chaykin’s statement also compared the process of configuring the watch’s inner workings to a puzzle. “As with any good puzzle, I had to tinker, look for non-trivial solutions, choose the best options and calculate the energy flows,” he added."
R4Q9KMDZ5V_31P4U8830A1TTWG,US prosecutors charge Russian-American political pundit of violating sanctions,"By Hannah Rabinowitz and Holmes Lybrand, CNN","3 minute read Updated 3:21 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/05/politics/dimitri-simes-criminal-charges-russia/,"The Justice Department unsealed criminal charges against Russian-American political pundit Dimitri Simes on Thursday, alleging he was paid more than $1 million from a Russian news outlet in violation of US sanctions.
According to the indictment, Simes coordinated and communicated with the Russian government, including President Vladimir Putin, while hosting a show for RT, the Russian state media network.
Simes would work with the Russian government over what the show would cover and how, the indictment says, highlighting coverage over the war with Ukraine that was favorable to Russia.
Simes was a prominent part of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into election interference in the 2016 presidential election.
Mueller’s team found that Simes had contacts with several members of Trump’s campaign, including Jared Kushner, over the campaign’s positions on Russia.
The special counsel did not uncover any evidence that Simes passed any information from Russia to the Trump campaign and, when Simes brought up Russian contacts to Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law told him it would be “bad optics for the Campaign to develop hidden Russian contacts,” according to the report.
Simes is charged alongside his wife, Anastasia Simes. The two are facing three charges for money laundering and violating both the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the Emergency Economic Powers Act.
Simes left the United States in 2022 after obtaining Russian citizenship and has not returned, according to court documents. It was not immediately clear if Simes has an attorney.
The FBI searched Simes’ home last month. The bureau also searched the homes of other Americans who have worked with Russia’s state television networks.
The charges come just one day after the Biden administration launched a broad campaign to combat Russian efforts to interfere with the upcoming presidential election in the United States.
That multipronged strategy included charges against two employees of RT accused of participating in a scheme that funneled nearly $10 million to set up and direct a Tennessee-based front company to produce online content aimed at sowing divisions among Americans.
The indictment against Simes, which did not mention the upcoming US election, details his salary and other perks he received while hosting a show for the sanctioned RT media outlet.
“Simes received funds and services from Channel One Russia after it was sanctioned,” the indictment says, “including monthly salary payments totaling over $1 million; a personal car and driver; a stipend for an apartment in Moscow, Russia; health insurance; business-class plane tickets between Washington, D.C., and Moscow, Russia; a team of ten employees, including an assistant; and efforts by Channel One Russia to promote his ‘positive image’ in mass media.”
For his work, according to court documents, in late 2023 the Russian government honored Simes with an award for his show.

Earlier in the pandemic, vaccines were purchased by the federal government and free for everyone. Last year, as the shots transitioned to the commercial market, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Bridge Access Program provided free Covid-19 vaccines to adults without insurance and those whose insurance didn’t cover all vaccine costs. The program ended last month due to lack of federal funding.
“This means that purely uninsured people do not have access to get free Covid shots and so if they went to their pharmacy to try to get one, they’d come with a cost,” said Lori Freeman, chief executive officer for the National Association of County and City Health Officials. About 26 million people in the United States are uninsured.

“We know that cost, at this moment in time with the economy, is even more of a burden than ever,” Freeman said.
Most people with private insurance, Medicare or Medicaid will still be able to get vaccinated at no out-of-pocket cost, but for adults without insurance or those whose insurance does not cover the vaccine, getting the updated shot at a pharmacy could cost $201.99.
The change may catch some people by surprise.
CVS Pharmacy has posted information on its website about how much the updated Covid-19 vaccines may cost without insurance, said CVS spokesperson Amy Thibault. On a Q&A page on its site, it urged people to check whether their insurance plan covers the vaccines and if CVS is in-network.
During the last several months, Walgreens has been educating its pharmacy team members on the discontinuation of the Bridge Access Program, Walgreens corporate spokesperson Samantha Stansberry said in an email Tuesday.
“Our pharmacists are aware of the changes and can assist any patients who have questions,” Stansberry said. “Walgreens remains committed to driving equitable and convenient access to life-saving vaccines. We will continue to work with patients eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine to determine the best and most cost-efficient way to receive one.”
In some states, there might still be free shots available to some people. The CDC announced last month that it is distributing $62 million to state and local health departments to provide free Covid-19 vaccines to adults who wouldn’t otherwise be able to afford them.
CNN Medical Correspondent Meg Tirrell explains what you need to know about the latest round of Covid vaccinations, just approved by the FDA.

States can order Covid-19 vaccines now, a CDC spokesperson said in an email Thursday. The program will provide vaccines through the 2024-2025 fall and winter respiratory season.
“We expect the supply in states to continue to increase,” the spokesperson said. “These funds will enhance immunization programs through support to state and local health departments, which will work with vaccine providers in their states to make them available.”
Once a health department receives the vaccines, some may decide to host public vaccination clinics or events, Freeman said.
Even with the end of the Bridge Access Program, Freeman said that many state and local health departments still would like to be involved in making updated Covid-19 vaccinations accessible to the public.
“We want the local health department to be a primary provider with the state and to have that continuous public health program,” Freeman said. “There has to be a way to both leverage the need to get vaccines safely in the hands of public, but also recognize the permanent role of the health department as a provider.”
Covid-19 levels in the US are very high and rising, according to wastewater surveillance data from the CDC. Levels have been rising since May and are already as high as they were in December of last year. Hospitalization rates related to Covid-19 also remain elevated, particularly among adults 65 and older and children under 2 years, according to the CDC.
Last season, an estimated 22.5% of adults and 14.4% of children were fully vaccinated against Covid-19 with updated shots.
People still should make a commitment to get vaccinated against Covid-19 with the updated shots this fall, said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association.
“If you’re insured, you ought to check with your insurance company to find out what the parameters are around getting vaccinated. Your vaccination should be free under the Affordable Care Act,” Benjamin said.
“If you are uninsured or underinsured, then you should check with your state or local health department and see what provisions they’re making for uninsured and underinsured people. Some of the state and local health departments, understanding this is a problem, are working with their governor’s office or mayor’s office to find funding to provide access to vaccine. In most cases, if the vaccine is available and if they have vaccine, they’ll be able to provide it for you at either no cost or reduced cost,” he said. “And there are some pharmacy assistance programs that should be available for Pfizer and Moderna.”

RGB4PQO9HP_B675VVAPY218XSP,The Iberian lynx is back from the brink. Now virtual fences could save it from becoming roadkill,"By Victoria Barauna, CNN","5 minute read Updated 6:23 AM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,http://edition.cnn.com/science/spain-iberian-lynx-virtual-fence-spc-c2e/,"At the start of the 21st century, Spain’s once-abundant lynx population was on the verge of extinction, decimated by a combination of habitat loss, a decline in its main prey, hunting, and road accidents.
After decades of conservation work, the Iberian lynx has made a remarkable recovery, and a new initiative is using a high-tech system to protect the wild cat from one of its deadliest enemies: road traffic.
“In 2001, there were less than 50 mature individuals in the wild, distributed over two populations,” explains Dr Urs Breitenmoser, a carnivore ecologist and former senior scientist at the University of Bern, who co-chairs the Cat Specialist Group at the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).
By 2022, that number soared to 648, according to IUCN and it estimates the population of young and mature lynx to now be more than 2,000.
The turnaround is the result of a €100M ($112 million) conservation project — funded by the EU and the Spanish government — that has involved conservationist groups, as well as national and regional authorities across southern Spain.
Conservation strategies such as restocking populations of its main prey, rabbits, and restoring habitats, for example by converting pine plantations back to their original scrubland, have paid off and in June this year, the IUCN upgraded the status of the Iberian lynx from endangered to vulnerable. “For a relatively large carnivore, it is an incredible speed of recovery,” says Breitenmoser.
Yet, the IUCN acknowledges that the Iberian lynx remains threatened. It’s highly dependent on wild rabbits for food, which are particularly vulnerable to viruses. Poaching continues to be a threat, as does climate change, which is affecting lynx habitats, and road safety still is an issue.
To help with dispersion, lynx have territories of up to 20 square kilometers — although it can vary greatly — which Breitenmoser describes as “clever trick of nature to avoid inbreeding.” But being able to range freely throughout often requires crossing busy roads.
In the 1980s, roadkill played a key role in lynx mortality in the Doñana area (a prominent spot for the Iberian lynx) accounting for almost 17% of deaths. To tackle this issue, in the early 2000s, conservation programs introduced safety measures, installing fencing and underpasses that provide a safe way for lynx to walk between habitats without having to cross any roads.
Between 2006 and 2011, roadkill, accounted for 6.6% of the deaths in Sierra Morena and 8.6% in Doñana.  That may not sound like much, but Breitenmoser explains that given that lynx populations were critically endangered at the time, the impact was significant.
“Twenty years ago, each roadkill was a real catastrophe. Even if you were to say that one lynx or two lynx are not important, in this situation, each individual was important,” Breitenmoser says.
Even as the species recovers, preventing roadkill is a priority and a project run by the regional government of Andalusia is using “virtual fences” to protect lynx from traffic. Sensors are placed 50 meters apart at the side of key roads, detecting when an animal is in the vicinity and warning them away when cars approach, explains Francisco Javier Salcedo Ortiz, coordinator of the LIFE Lynx-Connect project. “The sensors also activate once they detect the cars’ headlights, warning the animals with sound and light signals to not to cross,” he says.
In Jaén, Andalusia, 4.5 kilometers of virtual fences were installed along a main road in 2022 and in Granada, both physical and virtual fences are being installed on a 20-kilometer stretch.
The project is also having an impact on drivers, who often slow down when the sound and light alarms are triggered. “We have definitely noticed that there has been a reduction in the speed of drivers when the device is activated,” says Marcos López-Parra, who works as a lynx recovery plan technician for the regional government in Andalusia. “We are reducing the risk of collision.”
Similar technology has been used in central Italy to protect the Marsican Brown bear from road traffic, with the addition of infrared sensors and thermic cameras to detect animals’ presence beside roads, before sending an audible alert to drivers to slow down. The organization behind the initiative claims that it was nearly 100% effective.
Ortiz says that in a five-year timeframe, almost €4.5 million ($5 million) will be spent on improving habitats and nearly €2.9 million ($3.2 million) on boosting connectivity, including virtual fences.
The hope is that helping lynx to safely cross roads will increase encounters between different populations, which could benefit the cats in Andalusia, nearby Extremadura and even neighboring Portugal. Breitenmoser says connectivity between neighboring populations is essential for maintaining “the genetic and demographic health of a large population.”
There are some even more inventive technologies in development. Scientists from Spain’s University of Córdoba are leveraging the chemical signals used by lynx during breeding season to create artificial scent trails that could connect different populations via underpasses.
The first year of the project focused on completing analyses at a molecular level and the researchers are now experimenting in the field. The final task will be creating a scent corridor and checking if the cats follow it. The study is planned to be completed by September 2025.
“It’s still in an initial stage, but it’s an interesting alternative as it can be cheaper than what has been typically done on highways and can help lynx cross safely underneath roads,” says Ortiz.
Conservationists say that efforts to help the lynx will benefit other wildlife in the region. “It (the lynx) plays a very important ecological role by influencing a lot of other species, not only the rabbit population that it eats from, but also meso-predators like foxes,” Breitenmoser explains. “It may provide some services to other large carnivores like the imperial eagle,” which also relies on wild rabbit populations to survive, he adds.
Innovation aside, for Ortiz the future of the Iberian lynx depends on co-operation. “The success of a project is defined by the ability to build something through the sum of many parts,” he says. “We must involve all sorts of sectors, including hunters, landowners, conservationists and more.”"

The diplomat had reached the end of their regularly scheduled rotation and left at the end of August, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Wednesday at a briefing.
However, a spokesperson for the Chinese Consulate General in New York said diplomat Huang Ping is “performing his duties as usual,” according to a statement to CNN Wednesday, seemingly conflicting with the comments made by Hochul and the State Department.
At a news conference earlier Wednesday, Hochul said she was on the phone with a high-ranking State Department official at the request of Antony Blinken about Huang Ping’s status. Hochul spoke with Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell, Miller said.
Hochul said during the phone call she “conveyed my desire to have the consul general from the People’s Republic of China at the New York Mission expelled, and I’ve been informed that the consul general is no longer in the New York Mission.”
When asked to clarify if the consul general was expelled, Hochul responded, “I know that they’re no longer in their position. That’s all I know.”
Miller said there was no expulsion action: “The consul general was not expelled. Our understanding is that the consul general reached the end of a regularly scheduled rotation in August, and so rotated out of the position, but was not expelled.”
“But, of course, when it comes to the status of particular employees of a foreign mission, I would refer you to the foreign country to speak to it, but there was no expulsion action,” Miller said.
“That said, foreign interference, including attempts to influence through covert activities that should be registered under the Foreign Agents Registration Act and are not registered, are things that we take very seriously, as you saw by the action the Department of Justice took yesterday,” Miller added.
When asked about the consul general’s involvement, Hochul said, “I believe that the Chinese government, with their behavior, in doing this and working with Linda Sun, is not acceptable – it is a statement by us that we’re not tolerating this. Anybody representing that government needs to move on. That was what we made clear.”
Hochul’s comments came after Sun, a former deputy chief of staff to Hochul and an aide to then-Gov. Andrew Cuomo, was charged with violating and conspiring to violate the Foreign Agents Registrations Act, visa fraud, alien smuggling and money laundering conspiracy, according to an unsealed copy of the indictment.

Her husband and co-defendant, Chris Hu, was also charged with money laundering conspiracy and conspiracy to commit bank fraud as well as misusing means of identification, federal prosecutors said Tuesday.
Sun and Hu both pleaded not guilty to all charges in federal court Tuesday afternoon. Sun’s bond is set at $1.5 million and her husband’s is set at $500,000.
Hochul said Wednesday she’s been helping the Department of Justice for months and will continue to work with them.
She called Sun’s actions an “absolute betrayal of the trust of two administrations in state government,” and went as far as “even forging my signature on documents.”
Hochul said the FBI “asked her one question” – to verify whether something was her signature.
Hochul said Sun was a “mid-level aide” and said she didn’t have contact with her “very often” and had “no real role in my policies” as governor.
The governor said she feels “confident in our vetting process right now.”
“We have very high levels of background checks,” Hochul said.
The governor cautioned she wasn’t able to provide detailed information about the investigation into Sun: “There’s an ongoing investigation, there’ll be court proceedings, maybe a trial – all this will be revealed but it’s not information I can divulge at this time,” she said.
Sun acted as “an undisclosed agent of the Chinese government while her husband, Hu, facilitated the transfer of millions of dollars in kickbacks for personal gain,” prosecutors said in a news release.
While working for state government, Sun influenced the messaging of high-level state officials regarding issues of importance to China, blocked Taiwanese government representatives from access to the officials, and obtained official New York State proclamations for Chinese government representatives without authorization, prosecutors alleged in the indictment.
The couple’s arrest comes at a time when US-China relations remain fraught over a host of frictions including Beijing’s aggressions in the South China Sea and toward Taiwan, and US trade controls targeting China.
CNN has reached out to the US State Department and the Chinese Embassy in Washington for comment.

An attorney for Sun, Jarrod Schaeffer, told CNN the charges “are inflammatory and appear to be the product of an overly aggressive prosecution.”
“We are also troubled by aspects of the government’s investigation. As we said today in court, our client is eager … to defend against these accusations in the proper forum – a court of law,” Schaeffer said.
A defense attorney for Hu, Seth DuCharme addressed reporters outside court Tuesday, saying, “We have a lot of confidence in our case.”
“A lot of the allegations in this indictment are frankly perplexing, overly inflammatory,” he said. “As you heard in court today, we are looking forward to our day in court. The defendants are exercising their right to a speedy trial as soon as they can; we have a lot of confidence in Chris and in Linda.”
China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was unaware of the aide accused of working for China.
“I am not aware of the situation you mentioned,” spokesperson Mao Ning said, adding, “I will not comment on the domestic cases in the United States, but we oppose malicious associations and slander against China.”

RJGG9F828M_TBGN8IMD1M4GGNI,Dress Codes: How did plaid become popular for school uniforms?,"By Jacqui Palumbo, CNN","6 minute read Updated 6:01 AM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/05/style/plaid-school-uniforms-dress-codes/,"Editor’s Note: Examining clothes through the ages, Dress Codes is a new series investigating how the rules of fashion have influenced different cultural arenas — and your closet.
As students return to school, one patterned textile now synonymous with uniforms will make its seasonal reappearance on pleated skirts, jumpers and ties: plaid. The design has long been a mainstay in both classrooms and in pop culture, bringing to mind the hilarious Irish teens of “Derry Girls,” the bold ‘90s fashion of “Clueless” or the provocative outfits of the early 2000s pop duo t.A.T.u.
Plaid has become a catch-all term in the US, but includes patterns with distinct histories, including tartan, from Scotland, which is more associated with Catholic school uniforms, and madras, from India, which became a staple of American collegiate prep looks popularized by the likes of Ralph Lauren and Brooks Brothers in the latter half of the 20th century. It’s a family of textiles with broad scholarly appeal, with both religious and secular schools worldwide incorporating plaid into uniforms, from Mexico to Japan to Australia.
But how did a cloth like tartan, once the symbol of Scottish Highlander identity and rebellion, wind up on the fictional American teen Cher Horowitz as the ultimate twist on schoolgirl fashion? The reasons for the wool textile’s success as both a national identity marker and school dress code are one and the same.
“It really communicates a sense of belonging,” said Mhairi Maxwell, co-curator of the exhibition “Tartan,” which showed at the V&A museum in Dundee, Scotland, last year. “Any club, any society, any school, can design their own tartan. You’re part of this larger club, but you’re also your own little clique within it.”
Thousands of variations have been officially added to the Scottish Register of Tartans, making it a pattern that both follows strict rules and allows for “infinite possibilities” in design, Maxwell explained. There’s the highly recognizable red, blue, green, white and yellow weaves of the Royal Stewart (or Stuart) tartan — both the official tartan of the British monarchy and one of the most popular variations adopted by the punk movement — the blues and pinks of Vivienne Westwood’s MacAndreas tartan, worn by Naomi Campbell in the 1990s; and the crimson, white and black pattern made official by the University of Alabama in 2011.
Possibly the earliest existing scrap of tartan known today is a 16th-century piece found in a bog in Glen Affric, Scotland, which the V&A Dundee studied before the exhibition. The Scottish Tartans Authority commissioned dye analysis and radiocarbon testing on the textile, which has now been dated to between 1500 and 1600. It’s known that tartan existed for centuries before, though how long is often contested.
“Tartan’s origins are so elusive — it’s really hard to pinpoint (their) origin story,” Maxwell said in a phone interview, noting that many cultures around the world have grid-patterned textiles in their histories, leading to the differing claims of where and when tartan was first woven. The pattern has specific rules, however, that distinguish it from check or gingham patterns as well as madras.
Tartan’s history within Scotland has been debated as well. Centuries of romanticizing Highlander clanship and identity has likely influenced our contemporary understanding of the textile, Maxwell noted. The popular idea that tartan designs, dyes or techniques were rigid identifiers of a particular community is dubious, she pointed out — the clans weren’t siloed off, but imported and exported their materials.
However, it was the Jacobite military leader Charles Edward Stuart — known as Bonnie Prince Charlie — who made tartan a powerful symbol, leading his tartan-clad forces during an unsuccessful uprising in 1745 to restore his family’s Catholic leadership to the British throne.
“(He) made tartan the plaid of the people, and used it to create a movement to fight for his cause,” Maxwell said. “He was already capitalizing on that idea that it was a cloth of allegiance that bound people together to fight for something they believed in.”

After Stuart’s defeat, tartan was restricted in its use for decades in Scotland through Great Britain’s Dress Act, but it had a fashionable revival in the early 19th century that received royal support, particularly from Queen Victoria. The era saw an “elite appropriation” of Highland craft and lifestyle, Maxwell explained. Previously a formidable sight to encounter on the battlefield, it now represented a different kind of pride in the form of status and wealth, making it an ideal textile to use in schools promoting prestige and heritage.
“I can’t really think of another textile which has all this baggage with it,” Maxwell said. “It’s a traditional cloth, but it’s super rebellious at the same time.” It also became a fabric with imperial implications, as it made its way around the world through the uniforms of Scottish Highland regiments at war, British colonial exports and the transatlantic slave trade.
In the US, tartan was first introduced when the states were still British colonies. But the textile didn’t become a fixture of school uniforms until the 1960s, according to historian and educator Sally Dwyer-McNulty, who authored “Common Threads: A Cultural History of Clothing in American Catholicism” in 2014. That decade saw the textile “explode” in popularity, she explained in a phone interview, brought to market by major Catholic school uniform suppliers at the time, including Bendinger Brothers and Eisenberg and O’Hara (now Flynn O’Hara), who often had contracts with entire networks of diocesan schools.
“It’s like virtuous consumption, where Catholics, like lots of other post-war families, had a little bit more money to spend,” she explained in a phone interview. “The companies that had exclusive contracts wanted to tap into the resources that families had and make the (uniforms) attractive.”
Plaid already had ties to Catholicism, and it also visually stood out, she said. And, like across the pond, it allowed schools to brand themselves through their uniforms with a textile that allowed for a lot of variance without any external adornments.
“It creates this collective identity that’s important. It gives students this kind of embodied pride that they have regarding their school — or they can also express their rejection of that uniformity by letting their socks fall down to their ankles,” she joked. (Dwyer-McNulty herself attended two different Catholic schools in Philadelphia, wearing plaid uniforms through high school).
Uniforms were only associated with parochial and private schools until the late 1980s, but public schools began piloting them as well, allowing plaid’s influence in American classrooms to spread. (President Bill Clinton was a particular proponent of them during his administration the following decade, believing they would help reduce student crime). By the 1990s, the styles were no longer just available by contracted uniform companies, either, Maxwell noted, as stores like Gap and The Children’s Place stocked up on plaid skirts and jumpers.
Globally, plaid has been revived, remixed and deconstructed any number of ways today, as designers, subcultures and television and film continue to play on the trope. For Maxwell, 1995’s “Clueless” remains a favorite interpretation. It’s also one that keeps giving, as the bright yellow plaid skirt-suit set worn by Alicia Silverstone is continually replicated, last year by Kim Kardashian for Halloween, and redesigned by Christian Siriano (and worn by Silverstone) for a Superbowl ad.
“That Valley Girl appropriation of tartan is really cool,” Maxwell said. “It’s playing off that heritage of preppy Ivy League, but flipping it on its head and making quite a feminist statement about what it is to be educated, young and aspirational.”"
RQVLON82W0_9N4DF4BPZ32AHOE,China kicks off major African summit as it seeks to woo leaders amid pressure from the West,"By Simone McCarthy, CNN","6 minute read Published 7:50 PM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/03/china/china-africa-summit-intl-hnk/,"Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.
Delegations from dozens of African countries are gathering in Beijing for a three-day summit set to see China showcase itself as a lead partner for the continent, despite slowing lending for its development – and as it faces rising frictions with the West.
A procession of African leaders have arrived in the Chinese capital in recent days, greeted at the airport by honor guards and dance troupes with images flashed across state media, while Chinese officials have touted the gathering as the largest diplomatic event they’ve hosted in recent years.
The fanfare comes as Chinese leader Xi Jinping has much to signal to his visiting counterparts, and the world, as the summit gets underway Wednesday.
It is the first such gathering between Chinese and African leaders in the capital since 2018 and arrives at a critical juncture in ties between Beijing and a continent that’s home to its only overseas military base and where it has been the driving economic foreign power.
In recent decades, free flowing Chinese funding has driven the construction of highways, rail lines and power plants across Africa. The financing has filled funding gaps and expanded China’s political influence, but also generated criticism it was saddling countries with unsustainable debt.
Now, in the face of these concerns and its own economic slowdown, Xi and his officials will be likely pitching a new tune – what they posit as sustainable “small yet beautiful” investments and more collaboration on the green technologies in which China leads the world in producing.
This week will be Beijing’s most high-profile chance to telegraph that vision, as it seeks to point the direction forward for ties with a continent whose political backing is only growing more important amid Beijing’s rising frictions with Washington – and for Xi’s aim to position China as a champion of the Global South and alternative leader to the US.
How these changes play out for African leaders remains another question. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa bluntly called on China to “narrow the trade deficit and address the structure of our trade” during a bilateral meeting with Xi on Monday.
A number of leaders attending the three-yearly Forum on China and Africa Cooperation are from countries grappling with heavy international debt, including from Chinese loans, and seek more investment and trade to boost their economies.
They will likely probe whether a 2021 pledge from Xi to import products worth $300 billion from Africa by next year will be achieved. They’re also likely to press for ways to ensure growing trade is not merely an exchange of African raw materials for Chinese manufactured goods.
“Critical questions are going to be asked –  and so African countries and their Chinese partners are going to be hard pressed to provide answers,” said Paul Nantulya, a senior China specialist at the Africa Center for Strategic Studies in Washington.
When it comes to investment, even before the pandemic, China had already been reducing funding for the big-scale infrastructure projects that saw the world’s second largest economy become Africa’s largest bilateral creditor over recent decades.
Chinese lending to African government or state-linked borrowers cratered during the pandemic, reaching a low of roughly $1 billion in 2022, according to Boston University’s Global Development Policy Center. The data showed a modest recovery to $4.6 billion in 2023, a far cry from a peak of more than $28.8 billion in 2016.
Some African leaders holding talks in Beijing are facing steep challenges repaying debt from China and other lenders.
Kenya, whose president, William Ruto, is in Beijing this week, was rocked by protests earlier this summer over a finance bill introduced by the government to rein in public debt. That debt includes nearly $6 billion owed to China and more than $20 billion payable to multilateral banks, according to an April government statement.
Analysts say China is not the main cause of African debt distress in most cases, making up a comparatively small portion of the continent’s overall public debt. But the influx of Chinese loans increased the debt burden, and observers suggest China has moved too slowly or been inflexible in cases when it comes to helping countries that are heavily indebted to it get relief.
Beijing has defended its lending practices and its efforts to ease debt repayment but is unlikely to make debt relief a major theme of the multilateral summit, where it will focus on trade measures and promoting what it says is a shift to “small yet beautiful” investments.
The term, referring to projects with smaller budgets and environmental or social impact, has emerged as a key buzzword as Xi’s flagship Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). That’s as the infrastructure drive for the developing world transitions to a new phase following a decade of growth – that saw some projects slammed for environmental costs or poor labor standards and others stalled.
“There will be fewer projects but a greater spotlight on them. In an ironic way, I think this will lead to a more sustainable path,” said Bhaso Ndzendze, an associate professor of politics and international relations at the University of Johannesburg in South Africa.
But “the African side is keen to accept almost anything that China has to offer,” he continued, pointing to limited alternative avenues of support.
Beijing is also expected to push to make Africa’s market a destination for its prolific production of green tech like solar panels and electric vehicles.
The move may be welcomed by African nations grappling with power shortages and climate threat, but also comes as such Chinese goods face hefty tariffs in the US, Europe and Canada, as those markets move to block what they see as a flood of unfairly subsidized products.
Past gatherings of the twenty-four-year-old forum have included big promises of financing and boosting bilateral trade. Beijing will now be keenly aware that its commitments face competition.
In recent years, the US and its European partners have launched their own efforts to fund infrastructure in Africa, widely seen to be driven by their concern over China’s expansive footprint in the region – and its access to African critical minerals key for the fabrication of green tech.

“Now (China) has competition on the street … so that also might trigger them to keep the momentum going on infrastructure, because they don’t want to cede that space to the US,” said Ammar A. Malik, a faculty affiliate in public policy at William & Mary, who monitors China’s overseas spending.
Xi is also expected to use the gathering to project to the rest of the world the idea of solidarity between China’s view on the world and that of countries across Africa – a sign to Washington that despite pressure from the US and its allies, Beijing has numerous friends.
Visiting leaders are likely to continue to endorse Xi’s cornerstone rhetoric around building a global “community with a shared future,” a vision he sees as unlike the one that’s been unfairly dominated by the West. Attendees could also express a unified opinion on global issues like the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.
The forum has, in recent years, expanded beyond economic cooperation into areas like peace and security, alongside China’s own growing security interests in the region, where its companies’ sprawling mining operations have been subject to criminal attacks.
“China-Africa relations is going back to the basics in the sense that it started as a political relationship,” said Ovigwe Eguegu, a Nigeria-based policy analyst at the consultancy Development Reimagined.
Eguegu pointed to current Chinese Communist Party-funded initiatives to fund training for African political parties as well as African port calls from the People’s Liberation Army navy and joint military drills as part of a “ramping up of engagement in the political-security dimension.”
“China is preparing its diplomatic relationships across the world at a time of increasing geopolitical tensions,” he said."
RS0AAWB608_752TXMWKMRI80UY,Workers in Japan can’t quit their jobs. They hire resignation experts to help,"By Samra Zulfaqar, Nodoka Katsura and Rinka Tonsho, CNN","6 minute read Published 8:30 PM EDT, Sat August 31, 2024",20240901,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/31/business/japan-workers-resignation-agencies-intl-hnk/,"Yuki Watanabe used to spend 12 hours every day toiling away in the office. And that’s considered a short day.
A typical 9-to-9 workday is the bare minimum. “The latest I would leave [the office] would be 11 p.m.,” said the 24-year-old, who used to work for some of Japan’s largest telecoms and e-payment companies.
So intense were the demands that Watanabe - who used an alias to speak to CNN, for fear of jeopardizing future job prospects - began to develop health problems. She had “shaky legs and stomach issues.”
She knew she had to quit, but there was one thing in the way: Japan’s notoriously top-down work culture.
Asking to leave work on time or taking some time off can be tricky enough. Even trickier is tendering a resignation, which can be seen as the ultimate form of disrespect in the world’s fourth-biggest economy, where workers traditionally stick with one employer for decades, if not for a lifetime.
In the most extreme cases, grumpy bosses rip up resignation letters and harass employees to force them to stay.
Watanabe was unhappy at her previous job, saying her former supervisor often ignored her, making her feel bad. But she didn’t dare resign.
“I didn’t want my ex-employer to deny my resignation and keep me working for longer,” she told CNN during a recent interview.
But she found a way to end the impasse. She turned to Momuri, a resignation agency that helps timid employees leave their intimidating bosses.
For the price of a fancy dinner, many Japanese workers hire these proxy firms to help them resign stress-free.
The industry existed before Covid. But its popularity grew after the pandemic, after years of working from home pushed even some of Japan’s most loyal workers to reflect upon their careers, according to human resources experts.
There is no official count on the number of resignation agencies that have sprung up across the country, but those running them can testify to the surge in demand.
Shiori Kawamata, operations manager of Momuri, said that in the past year alone they received up to 11,000 enquiries from clients.
Located in Minato, one of Tokyo’s busiest business districts, the firm launched in 2022 with a name that seeks to resonate with their helpless clientele – “Momuri” means “I can’t do this anymore” in Japanese.
At a cost of 22,000 yen (about $150) – or 12,000 yen for those who work part time – it pledges to help employees tender their resignations, negotiate with their companies and provide recommendations for lawyers if legal disputes arise.
“Some people come to us after having their resignation letter ripped three times and employers not letting them quit even when they kneel down to the ground to bow,” she said, in another illustration of the deferential workplace culture embedded in Japan.
“We sometimes get calls from people crying, asking us if they can quit their job based on XYZ. We tell them that it is okay, and that quitting their job is a labor right,” Kawamata added.
Some workers complain that bosses harass them if they try to resign, she said, including stopping by their apartments to ring their doorbell repeatedly, refusing to leave.
For another quitter, what would have been a straightforward business took a bizarre turn. The person was dragged to a temple in Kyoto by their boss. “[The worker] was told to go to Onmyoji temple because ‘they were cursed,’” she said.
Kawamata said people who reach out often work for small to medium-sized businesses, with those in the food industry most vulnerable, followed by healthcare and welfare.
Japan has long had an overwork culture. Employees across various sectors report punishing hours, high pressure from supervisors and deference to the company. These employers are widely known as “black firms.”
Human resources professor Hiroshi Ono, from Hitotsubashi University Business School in Tokyo, said the situation had become so pressing that the government had begun publishing a list of unethical employers to hamper their ability to hire, and warn job seekers of the dangers of working for them.
“There are some issues with… black firms, where working conditions are so bad, there’s no psychological safety, and some employees might feel threatened,” he said.
More than 370 companies have been blacklisted by labor bureaus across the country since the list was published in 2017.
The stress has proven fatal for decades, as exemplified by a phenomenon called “karoshi,” or “death by overwork.”

According to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, 54 people died from work-induced brain and heart conditions and were granted compensation in 2022, which is actually a major decline from the 160 recorded two decades ago.
But the number of people filing claims over mental stress at work is on the rise, shooting up to 2,683 from 341 over the same period of time.
A 31-year-old political reporter from national broadcaster NHK died in 2017 after suffering heart failure caused by spending long hours on the job. She worked 159 hours of overtime in the month before her death.
Five years later, a 26-year-old doctor from a hospital in Kobe died by suicide after working more than 200 hours of overtime in a single month.
Hisakazu Kato, an economics professor at Meiji University in Tokyo, said the country has labor laws in place to protect workers and make sure they are free to resign.
“But sometimes the atmosphere in the workplace makes it difficult to say so,” he said.
So why did these resignation agents only emerge in recent years? That, experts say, is down to young people’s changing approach to work.
“When one party is unhappy, you could end up in a divorce. But like a divorce, nobody is 100% faultless, right?” Ono, from Hitotsubashi University, said.
As the country grapples with a labor shortage fueled by a rapidly aging population and declining birth rates, young people now have more say in the market than their predecessors.
Many of them no longer subscribe to older generations’ thinking that one should do whatever they are told regardless of the job’s nature, Ono said, adding that when there is a mismatch of expectation, they won’t hesitate to quit.
But that doesn’t mean they want to march into their boss’s office and quit in a blaze of glory – preferring to let a third party handle it.
“I think that younger people these days are more non-confrontational,” the expert said, noting that many have been deprived of social interactions at work due to Covid. As a result, young workers prefer to quit without having direct contact with their bosses.
But Ono suggested that it’s always good to have a discussion and not to burn bridges with employers, so he would recommend against accessing such services.
Kawamata, from Momuri, somewhat agreed.
“We honestly think that our resignation agency service should disappear from society and we hope for that. We think it’s best if people can tell their bosses themselves, but hearing the horror stories of our clients, I don’t think that our business will disappear anytime soon,” she said.
For now, Momuri offers a 50% discount for those who seek their service to resign the second time.

RS75G4YZY7_GNRADHEZMNAJU0S,Trial date set for doctor and ‘ketamine queen’ connected to Matthew Perry case,"By Alli Rosenbloom, CNN","4 minute read Updated 4:57 PM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/03/entertainment/matthew-perry-doctor-ketamine-queen/,"A trial date has been set for two of five people charged in connection with the death of beloved “Friends” actor Matthew Perry.
Dr. Salvador Plasencia and alleged drug dealer Jasveen Sangha, who prosecutors have also refer to as the “Ketamine Queen,” will be tried together.
The trial is scheduled to begin on March 4, 2025. A pretrial hearing is scheduled for February 19.
Plasencia and Sangha were arrested on August 15 and indicted on respective charges that include falsifying medical records and conspiracy to distribute, among others, according to the US Attorneys office.
Both Sangha and Plasencia, who prosecutors say are responsible for contributing to Perry’s death by distributing ketamine to the actor during the final weeks of his life, have pleaded not guilty to the charges.
The three other individuals charged in connection with Perry’s death – Dr. Mark Chavez, Perry’s personal assistant Kenneth Iwamasa and an acquaintance to Perry, Erik Fleming – are cooperating with prosecutors and have reached plea agreements. Fleming and Iwamasa have sentencing dates set for October and November, respectively.
Sangha remains in federal custody and Plasencia is free on bond, according to the Department of Justice.
Perry died in October 2023 at age 54 because of “acute effects” of ketamine and subsequent drowning, according to the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner’s Office autopsy report. His body was found floating face down in a hot tub at his Pacific Palisades home.
Plasencia was charged with one count of conspiracy to distribute ketamine, seven counts of distribution of ketamine and two counts of altering and falsifying documents or records related to the federal investigation, according to the US Attorney’s office.
Plasencia allegedly sold vials of ketamine that he obtained from Chavez to Perry and Iwamasa “outside the usual course of professional practice and without a legitimate medical purpose” in the weeks leading up to his death.
He is also accused of teaching Iwamasa how to inject Perry with the drug and personally injecting Perry on one occasion, despite being informed that the actor’s ketamine addiction “was spiraling out of control.”
If convicted, Plasencia faces up to 10 years in federal prison for each ketamine-related count and up to 20 years for each falsification count.
In addition to having legitimate medical uses, ketamine is increasingly popular as a party drug.
“In Hollywood, you have parties you have after parties and people like to feel altered… it’s become popular in that circle,” said Dr. David Mahjoubi, who runs one of the hundreds of ketamine clinics that have proliferated in recent years.
Clinics like Mahjoubi’s use forms of the drug in controlled doses and controlled environments as therapy for mental health conditions like depression, anxiety and PTSD. Doctors are given discretion to use medications for so-called “off-label” uses “as long as it’s within acceptable guidelines” and “not causing harm,” according to Mahjoubi.
“If somebody wanted to get high off ketamine, they’re gonna go buy it from the street,” Mahjoubi added. “It’s gonna be a lot cheaper than coming to see a physician getting an infusion.”
When the Ketamine clinic that was treating Perry declined to increase his dose, prosecutors say, he went first to Plasencia, and then due to the cost, to Sangha.
Sangha, whom authorities call the “Ketamine Queen” of North Hollywood, ran what amounted to “a drug selling emporium” in her home and had sold vials of ketamine to Fleming on Perry’s behalf, according to Fleming’s plea agreement.
Prosecutors also claim that Sangha was “aware of the danger of ketamine” and continued to sell it even after she was made aware that the ketamine she sold to aspiring personal trainer Cody McLaury in August 2019 contributed to his overdose death.
Federal agents and LAPD detectives found over 70 vials of ketamine, among other “fraudulently obtained” and illegal drugs, after executing search warrants at Sangha’s residence, according to a press release from the US attorney’s office.

RT02EZ8DKZ_XBBAD6NKDREMNY6,A man accused of killing his girlfriend and leaving her body at Boston’s airport has been extradited to the US,"By Faith Karimi and Larry Madowo, CNN","3 minute read Published 10:14 AM EDT, Mon September 2, 2024",20240902,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/02/world/mbitu-killing-suspect-extradited-kenya-boston-cec/,"A man accused of killing his girlfriend in Boston and fleeing to Kenya has been extradited back to the United States — the latest twist in an international case that saw his arrest at a Nairobi nightclub and his escape from jail.
Kevin Kangethe, 42, is accused of killing nurse Margaret “Maggie” Mbitu, whose body was found in a parked car last November at Boston’s Logan International Airport, two days after she was reported missing. Authorities say he then immediately boarded a flight and fled the country.
For months, the suspect eluded authorities after he arrived in Kenya. In January, investigators spotted Kangethe at a nightclub in Nairobi and arrested him. He escaped from jail days later and was on the run for a week before he was rearrested in Nairobi in early February.
Kenya has an extradition treaty with the United States.
Kangethe’s extradition Sunday returns him to the jurisdiction of his alleged crime, some 7,000 miles away. He is expected to face a murder charge at Suffolk Superior Court on Tuesday, said Renson Ingonga, Kenya’s director of public prosecutions.
“I wish to reiterate my commitment and support, whenever needed, to the United States of America, and in particular the prosecution team as they proceed with the next phase of the case,” Ingonga said in a statement Monday.
Mbitu, 31, lived in Whitman, a Boston suburb, and was the youngest in a family of health care workers. Her two older sisters and her mother are all nurses.
She was reported missing in late October after she didn’t show up for work, which was uncommon for her.
Her family notified the police and called nearby hospitals to check if she was a patient. Investigators believed her boyfriend was a suspect, according to a criminal complaint from the state police.
With the help of surveillance cameras, police tracked his Toyota SUV to the airport and found it in a parking garage. Inside they found Mbitu’s bloodied body with slash wounds on her face and neck, Massachusetts State Police said in an affidavit.
The day before her body was found, Kangethe boarded flights from Boston to Kenya. Surveillance footage showed him leaving the parking garage and entering an airport terminal, police said.
Investigators learned he had bought a plane ticket the previous morning, state police said.
“Why her?” her sister, Ann Mbitu, told CNN in November. “Nobody’s daughter deserves this, but why my sister? Why Maggie?” “I’m so angry, I’m still trying to process everything. At 31, we’re not supposed to be planning her funeral. We’re supposed to be planning celebrations, birthdays, weddings, travel.”
Kangethe has been arrested twice with the help of tipsters.
After he arrived in Kenya, he eluded authorities for three months. Then in late January, someone alerted police that a man at a nightclub in Nairobi resembled images of the suspect they’d seen on social media, Kenyan authorities said.
An undercover officer tracked him down and struck up a conversation with him, a police official told CNN. Within hours, authorities identified the man as Kangethe, whom authorities in Massachusetts had obtained an arrest warrant on a murder charge.
A week later, a man claiming to be his lawyer appeared at the police station where he was being held and asked to speak with him. Officers released the suspect from his cell and left them alone in an office. The suspected escaped on foot and evaded authorities for days, police said.
He was re-arrested a week later at a relative’s house in a suburb of Nairobi after another tip-off, Kenyan police said.
Kevin Hayden, District Attorney of Suffolk County in suburban Boston, thanked the US State Department, the FBI, the state police, the Kenyan government and Kenyan law enforcement agencies for facilitating the arrest.
“Their tremendous and untiring efforts will provide Margaret’s family and friends the opportunity to see Kevin Kangethe face justice for this terrible crime,” Hayden said in a statement in February.
Investigators have not revealed a motive in the killing."

Grayson, 30, is now charged with murder in the July 6 death of Sonya Massey; he has pleaded not guilty. Massey, a mother of two, joined Breonna Taylor and Atatiana Jefferson on a list of Black women killed in their own homes by law enforcement – whose deadly use of force came under scrutiny.
Massey’s death has led to renewed calls for a national, comprehensive database for tracking officers’ disciplinary issues or criminal offenses.
“Sonya Massey lost her life due to an unjustifiable and reckless decision by former Deputy Sean Grayson,” the Sangamon County sheriff said in a statement after firing Grayson.
An attorney representing Grayson, Daniel Fultz, declined to comment to CNN for this story.
Now, more details are emerging about Grayson’s alleged misconduct prior to killing Massey. Here’s a timeline of some of Grayson’s issues with the law, the military and his work in policing – which spanned six agencies in four years:"
RW6EP57P45_YR13YHVPB4WX5S2,Police kill armed man near Israeli consulate in Munich terror attack,"By Claudia Otto, Stephanie Halasz and Matthies Otto, CNN","4 minute read Updated 2:21 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/05/europe/munich-police-shoot-armed-suspect-intl/,"German police shot dead an armed man after a terror attack near the Israeli consulate in central Munich on Thursday, officers said, prompting an investigation by state prosecutors.
The suspect – an 18-year-old Austrian citizen – was armed with an older rifle with a mounted bayonet when he was shot on Karolinenplatz, a square near the Israeli consulate and a Nazi documentation center, according to police in Munich.
The suspect was fatally injured after shots were exchanged, Munich police said in a post on X. Five officers were involved in the shootout, according to Andreas Franken, a police spokesperson.

At least 500 personnel were called to the scene in Munich’s city center, Bavarian Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann said. A helicopter was deployed to provide a more detailed assessment of the incident, according to Reuters.
There is no indication other suspects may be involved, police added. Authorities assume the attack was planned, Herrmann told reporters on Tuesday. The teenager had parked a car near the scene of the shooting.
One unnamed eyewitness told German media that he heard several bullets fired, before police shot the suspect to the ground.
“I heard several shots and, as a member of a shooting club, I knew immediately that they were firing,” the 65-year-old man told Bild newspaper. “It took several minutes for the first police officers to come up behind him. They then shot him at least 30 to 40 times. After that, I just heard them shouting: ‘He’s lying on the ground, he’s not moving.’”
The suspect may have been influenced by religious extremism, the Bavarian attorney general’s office said on Tuesday, after launching an investigation into the shooting.
“There are indications that the perpetrator was known in the Islamist environment. The investigation is ongoing, so nothing concrete can be said at this stage,” chief public prosecutor Florian Weinzierl, said on Thursday. Officials will investigate whether other people knew about the crime.
The suspect was already known to police in February 2023, after making a dangerous threat against pupils and causing bodily harm, according to the Austrian police department in Salzburg.
He was also accused of participating in a terrorist organization, and was active online. The teenager was also interested in explosives and weapons, the police department added. In April 2023, the Salzburg public prosecutor’s office dropped all charges, following an investigation.
Authorities confirmed a weapons ban against the then 17-year-old, which was scheduled to remain in place until at least the beginning of 2028. He had not been reported to officers since then, the police department added.
The incident took place on the anniversary of the 1972 Munich Olympics terror attack – when a Palestinian militant group entered the quarters of Israel’s national team. Eleven Israeli athletes were killed in the ensuing standoff.
It is not clear if Thursday’s incident is at connected to the 1972 event, but the Israeli consulate nearby was closed for a commemoration.
Bavarian Minister President Markus Soeder cautioned there is a “terrible suspicion” that the shooting was linked to the anniversary, but said more clarification was needed to determine the motive.
“The protection of Jewish institutions is of central importance to us,” he said in a press conference on Tuesday. “The motives and backgrounds of the perpetrators will certainly have to be determined in the coming hours, but one thing is clear, there is a serious suspicion, because today is the anniversary of the attack in Munich in 1972, there may be a connection.”
On Facebook, Talya Lador-Fresher, the Israeli consul general in Munich said, “We are very grateful to the police in Munich for their actions and cooperation. This event shows how dangerous the rise of Antisemitism is. It is important that the general public speaks against this. Our Consulate General was closed today to commemorate 52 years since the terrorist attack at the Olympics.”
Chancellor Olaf Scholz condemned the terror attack on Thursday.
“Let me be clear: anti-Semitism and Islamism have no place in our country,” he said in a post on X. “The quick reaction of the emergency services in Munich today may have prevented something terrible from happening. I am very grateful to them for that.”
The incident came on the heels of a divisive round of regional elections in Germany – after the Alternative for Germany (AfD) became the first far-right party to win a state election in the country since the Nazi era, on Sunday.

There were some interesting and off-brand pledges on the environment from Kamala Harris and on abortion policy from Donald Trump to close out the week.
The vice president and Democratic presidential nominee made very clear during an exclusive interview with CNN that she now supports fracking, the oil and gas extraction process that climate and environmental activists largely oppose.
“I cast the tie-breaking vote that actually increased leases for fracking, as vice president. So I’m very clear about where I stand,” she said, arguing the US can have a clean-energy economy and still embrace fracking.
The former president and Republican nominee floated making either the US government or insurance companies pay for expensive in vitro fertilization treatments, crossing both abortion activists and small-government conservatives.

“I kept hearing that I’m against it, and I’m actually very much for it,” Trump said at a town hall in Wisconsin. It’s not clear how he would square an expensive government mandate with his longtime opposition to the Affordable Care Act, which also required insurance companies to cover certain services.
Trump also had to clarify his position about a six-week abortion ban in Florida. Trump told NBC News he thinks the six-week ban is “too short” for women. “It has to be more time,” he said.
But he later told Fox News he would oppose a Florida ballot initiative that would reverse the current six-week policy put in place by Republicans who run the state government.
Trump’s rhetoric against a six-week ban but effective support for it in his home state is contradictory, at best, but also speaks to the difficulty of his position.
On the one hand, Harris acknowledges the threat of the climate crisis and brags about the administration’s record on climate policy.
On the other, she is also hoping to hold on to Pennsylvania and Michigan, “blue wall” states won by Joe Biden in 2020. Fracking is big business in both places.
Meanwhile, recent polling has shown a strong advantage for Harris with women voters, although the race remains close overall.
On the one hand, Trump wants credit with conservatives for appointing the US Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade, which allowed some states to severely limit or end access to abortion.
On the other, a more moderate position on abortion and support for more affordable IVF could appeal to women.
“Yes, I would,” Harris said simply in the CNN interview, when asked if she’d put a Republican in her Cabinet. “Of course,” said Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance when asked by Fox News if a second Trump administration would put a Democrat at the table.
There’s a long history of cross-party Cabinet officials in the US, but neither Trump’s first administration nor the Biden administration brought in a voice from the other party when they had the opportunity.
For reference, then-President Barack Obama’s secretary of transportation was Republican Ray LaHood, and then-President George W. Bush’s secretary of transportation was Democrat Norman Mineta.
At the Democrats’ convention this month, Republicans were featured as speakers every night. Former Rep. Adam Kinzinger and former Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan were both given prime spots to raise the alarm about Trump.
Kinzinger, a longtime Trump critic, has the kind of foreign policy views that would be welcomed in the old-school GOP of Sens. Mitt Romney or Mitch McConnell, both of whom have acknowledged the Republican Party has moved away from them. Former Rep. Liz Cheney, another hawk who says Trump should not be elected, has not endorsed Harris, but she has said she won’t vote for Trump.
On the other side, Trump got the endorsement of former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, an Iraq War veteran and a former Democrat who made her name as an anti-war activist.
The parties have drifted on foreign policy. Following Trump’s cue, many Republicans now question giving Ukraine additional aid to stand up to Russia’s aggression, for instance.
Along with Gabbard, Trump named another former Democrat, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to his transition team. Kennedy’s unique brand of vaccine skepticism, opposition to processed food and environmental activism might appeal to some on the far left. But Kennedy drew the ire of his family members and Democrats by endorsing Trump.
Conservatives have focused on fighting diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in the government and in corporations, and Trump has tried to question both Harris’ identity and her qualifications. Harris, on the other hand, has noticeably avoided overt appeals to minority groups.
When CNN’s Dana Bash asked Harris about Trump’s ridiculous insult that Harris recently “turned Black” for political reasons, Harris did not engage. “Same old, tired playbook,” she said. “Next question, please.”
Later, Bash noted that Harris did not mention gender or race in her speech accepting the nomination, and she asked the vice president about an inspiring photo of Harris’ young grandniece looking up at her at the DNC, wondering how Harris feels about the fact that her candidacy means a lot to a lot of people.
Before saying she was humbled, Harris first stepped back from the historic nature of her candidacy.
“I am running because I believe that I am the best person to do this job at this moment – for all Americans, regardless of race and gender,” she said.
Even Trump has heard from advisers, according to a recent report from CNN’s Kristen Holmes and Steve Contorno, that he should steer clear of the insults that are in his DNA and focus on policy contrasts with Harris.
Some of the policies he’s pushing sound like they could come from Democrats: appealing to wage earners by calling to exempt tipped earnings from taxes, and now an IVF proposal aimed at anyone struggling to pay for infertility treatments.
None of this means the country is not divided – and you can bet that when Trump and Harris meet for their first debate on September 10 hosted by ABC News, they will each try to paint the other as extreme. Plus, Trump can be told to avoid insults and focus on policy, but he has so far been unable or unwilling to do so.
These larger appeals on specific, across-the-aisle policies from both sides, however, do show that the presidential campaigns see value in toning down their rhetoric and moderating their positions as they try to win the White House."
S6OZJMLB8U_SQTLB77LT9SFBKC,Netanyahu is unequivocal about ceasefire and hostage agreement with Hamas: ‘There’s not a deal in the making’,"By Mick Krever, Jennifer Hansler and Alex Marquardt, CNN","6 minute read Updated 11:22 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/05/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-hamas-agreement-intl/,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday was as clear as he has ever been that he does not believe a ceasefire and hostage deal is likely in Gaza in a sharp rebuke to the Biden administration’s insistence it’s close at hand.
“There’s not a deal in the making,” Netanyahu told Fox News. “Unfortunately, it’s not close.”
His comments stand in stark contrast to the relentlessly hopeful messaging from the Biden administration over the past months. On Sunday, President Joe Biden claimed that the parties were on the verge of a deal, and on Wednesday, a senior administration official claimed 90% of the agreement had been completed.
That, Netanyahu said, is “exactly inaccurate.”
Netanyahu’s rebuff of the US’ assessment of a prospective deal is the latest instance in a string of public comments this week from the Israeli prime minister casting doubt on the potential agreement months in the making.
US officials have been reticent to directly criticize Netanyahu – even as he has repeatedly broken with the administration’s position and cast doubt on his adherence to a potential deal – although a National Security Council official on Thursday acknowledged “frustrations” in the process while still continuing to insist a deal is close.
“It’s exactly inaccurate. There’s a story, a narrative out there, that there’s a deal out there,” the Israeli Prime Minister said of the statement from the American official the day prior that “basically, 90 percent of this deal has been agreed.”
On Sunday, when Israel announced that the bodies of six hostages has been found executed by Hamas, Biden still argued that negotiators were on the “verge of having an agreement.”
US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby doubled down on those assessments in comments to the press Thursday, saying, “90% – verge of a deal. You call that optimistic, I call that accurate.”
Asked about Netanyahu’s comments, Kirby said, “I’m just not going to get into a public back and forth through all of you in the press with Prime Minister Netanyahu.”
“I will just say that this process has at times been cumbersome. We have faced setbacks and setbacks and more setbacks, and without question, we here in the administration are frustrated that we still haven’t been able to conclude this deal,” he said.
“There’s lots of reasons for that, but I’m not going to lie to you and say that that we haven’t been frustrated. Of course we have. We want to see the hostages home as soon as possible. But I would also say that as frustrating as it has been at times, and as unhelpful as – not just public comments, but even private machinations in the negotiation process – have been to closure of the deal, it has not dimmed one bit President Biden’s commitment to trying to see this through,” Kirby said.
Kirby also dismissed the idea that the administration was overly optimistic about the prospects of a deal, saying that “we do believe that we have made an immense amount of progress in the last few months in terms of getting the structure of the deal in place, but nothing is negotiated until everything is negotiated.”
The senior Biden administration official on Wednesday said that the majority of the details of the first phase of the agreement had been worked out. The remaining sticking points, they said, are related to the withdrawal of Israeli forces within Gaza away from populated areas and the exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners.
“Other than that, that’s about it,” the senior official said.
On the prisoner exchange, the official accused Hamas of adding new “non-starters” for the prisoners they want to see released.
“What Hamas has been demanding here, the Israelis have come forward to meet the terms as best they can,” the official said. “And Hamas, frankly, on this issue, we’ve had a pretty frustrating process.”
The official said Hamas’s recent killing of six hostages had “colored” the ongoing negotiations and thrown into question Hamas’s willingness to reach a deal.
On where Israel Defense Forces troops move to during the first phase of a deal, the agreement under discussion makes no mention of the length of the Egypt-Gaza border known as the Philadelphi Corridor, the official told reporters Wednesday. Instead, it says in the first phase that the IDF is supposed to withdraw from “densely populated areas,” the official said. Israel argues that the border isn’t one and is vital to preventing weapons from being smuggled into Gaza.
Netanyahu has held two news conferences this week to argue that maintaining permanent control of the Philadelphi Corridor is vital to Israeli security.
“The first war goal was to destroy Hamas’ military and governing capabilities. The second was to free our hostages, and the third was to ensure that Gaza never again poses a threat to Israel. And all three of those goals – all three of them – go through Israel’s control of the Philadelphi corridor,” Netanyahu said Wednesday at a news conference for foreign press.
That emphasis on Philadelphi in Netanyahu’s recent public statements hasn’t been constructive, the official said.
On Thursday, Netanyahu claimed Hamas “don’t agree to anything. Not to the Philadelphi Corridor, not to the keys of exchanging hostages for jailed terrorists, not to anything. So that’s just a false narrative.”
Hamas on Thursday said that Netanyahu has used “evasions and deceptive maneuvers” to avoid reaching an agreement on a ceasefire in Gaza.
The head of the organization’s negotiating team, Khalil Al-Hayya, said in a speech released on Telegram that the “series of evasions and deceptive maneuvers practiced by Netanyahu to evade the obligation to reach an agreement on a ceasefire is now fully exposed to the mediators, the American administration, global public opinion, and even the (Israeli) public.”
Netanyahu is facing mounting accusations that he has purposefully blocked a deal with Hamas. The Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth, citing a document it obtained, reported that Netanyahu in July effectively spiked a draft of a hostage and ceasefire deal by introducing a raft of new, eleventh-hour demands.
Several news outlets, including CNN, have reported on the late July demands made by Netanyahu, but this is the first time the Israeli document has been obtained in full.
In the Fox News interview, Netanyahu rejected allegations that he has obstructed a deal.
“The obstacle to the end of this war is Hamas. The obstacle to the release of hostages is Hamas. The ones who butchered in a sling, murdering six people in cold blood, riddling them with bullets and then firing bullets into their heads is Hamas. It’s not Israel. It’s not me.”
Netanyahu was also questioned about reports that the families of American hostages still held by Hamas are lobbying the US Administration to unilaterally seek their loved ones’ release.
“I don’t know,” he said. “You know, I don’t judge the families. They’re going through enormous anguish.”
In an interview with CNN’s Kaitlin Collins on Thursday evening, Israeli ambassador Danny Danon was asked why Netanyahu’s latest comments contrast with more optimistic pronouncements from the White House.
“We want to lower expectations,” he said.
“In May the US proposed a deal, we said yes, Hamas said no,” Danin said, adding the same happened in August, contradicting the reporting Yedioth Ahronoth and others.
Israel was continuing to send its intelligence head and other officials to negotiations, Danon argued, and he reiterated blame on Hamas for the lack of progress in talks. “Every time we get closer to reach an agreement Hamas will come up with another excuse why not to sign an agreement,” he said.
Meanwhile, a Biden administration official told CNN Thursday the US has made no offer to Hamas in an attempt the secure the release of American hostages held captive in Gaza, noting that the US does not have the leverage for a unilateral deal with the group.
“Because of Hamas’ demands, there has not been a formal offer for a side deal made because no such deal is possible,” the official said.

S7RE14DWG3_MS3GKBWFY4E4PYH,Pennsylvania and Georgia may choose America’s next president,"Analysis by Stephen Collinson, CNN","8 minute read Published 7:00 AM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/04/politics/harris-trump-battleground-states-analysis/,"The destiny of the White House may hang on a deadlocked fight between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris for Georgia and Pennsylvania, two battlegrounds that have been decisive in crowning the last two presidents.
The evolving electoral map is revealed in new CNN/SSRS polls out Wednesday of six swing states that captured the transformation in the race since the vice president replaced President Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee.
The surveys show Harris has vastly improved her party’s chances in November and could open several paths to the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win. But they suggest any stalling of her momentum could be disastrous to her hopes.
Trump, despite weeks of failing to find a coherent anti-Harris message, still has a serious chance nine weeks out of pulling off one of the most stunning political comebacks in US history. Strong showings in a few key states could land him back in the Oval Office.
More broadly, the new polls show that Harris has at least made a strong start on her extraordinary task of turning around an election that looked lost within the space of a few months. But they also reflect Trump’s stunning and enduring strength among millions of Americans in his third presidential election — eight years after he won his first.
In Wisconsin, likely voters back Harris by 50% to 44% for Trump. In Michigan, the vice president is up 48% to 43%. In Arizona, the former president is ahead 49% to 44%. There’s no clear leader in Georgia and Nevada, where it’s 48% Harris to 47% Trump or in Pennsylvania, where they are even at 47%.
The polls represent a snapshot of the current moment after a tumultuous political summer and shouldn’t be seen as a prediction of what will happen in November. But they help explain how the fight for the White House could unfold in the next two months, underscore the strategic decisions facing both campaigns and pinpoint the current strengths and weakness of each candidate. For instance, across six states, Harris now trails Trump by only eight points on average on who is most trusted on the economy — a significantly lower deficit on the issue that matters most to voters than the one suffered by Biden in earlier polls.
The picture of a finely balanced contest is also a reminder of the critical nature of next week’s debate between Harris and Trump, one of the few scheduled events in the final months to November that could again turn the race upside down.
The polling data suggests that Harris is two-thirds of the way to consolidating, at least for now, the critical midwestern “Blue Wall” states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania that have long been the most credible route back to the White House for a Democratic nominee. But the tied race at this point in Pennsylvania suggests that Harris still faces a massive task in putting away a state that Biden won by only 1.2% of the vote four years ago.
Many Democrats had privately conceded that Georgia, a longtime conservative bastion that has been competitive since 2020, was probably lost when Biden was the presumptive nominee. But the arrival of Harris has thrust the Peach State back into the decisive sprint to the White House.
Both candidates have already made multiple visits to Pennsylvania and Georgia especially. Harris and Walz took a two-day bus tour through rural, southern parts of Georgia last week. And Harris was in Pittsburgh on Monday and will return to the Steel City for debate prep later this week.
Trump recently took steps to repair his ties to Georgia’s popular Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, whom he faults for not aiding his attempt to overturn Biden’s win in the state in 2020, and last week was in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, for a rally that exemplified his attraction to voters in former industrial powerhouses hurt by the flight of blue-collar jobs overseas.
The centrality of Pennsylvania and Georgia to the race can be seen when various scenarios are played out across the electoral map. There are tantalizing possibilities for Harris. Assuming each candidate holds all states solidly in their columns, Harris could win the presidency by pairing Wisconsin and Michigan with a Pennsylvania victory and one electoral vote from anywhere else.
But Trump also has a simple route-map back to power. If he wins North Carolina, another swing state not included in these surveys that has gone Republican ever since 2012, he could win a second term just by taking Pennsylvania and Georgia. In this case, it wouldn’t matter how he performs in Wisconsin, Michigan, Nevada or Arizona.
Pennsylvania and Georgia have been critical bellwethers in recent years. In 2020, Biden captured each battleground and won the White House. In 2016, Trump beat Democrat Hillary Clinton in each state on the way to his shock election victory.
This year, Harris needs to drive out strong turnout in the cities like Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Atlanta and Augusta, especially among minority voters. She is also targeting a strong performance among voters in the suburbs of these and other cities. The CNN/SSRS polls show the vice president already has double digit leads among female likely voters in both states, no doubt helped by being a stronger messenger on abortion than Biden, which the data also shows.
Trump is always strong among White male, White non-college educated and rural voters. One of the obvious goals of the Harris campaign — as can be seen by her trips with vice presidential nominee Tim Walz to rural areas — is to try to trim some of the Republican nominee’s margins in districts where he runs most strongly.
One of the most interesting questions at this stage of the race — that is also impossible to answer – is whether Harris’ rise still has some way to go and whether she has not just unified the Democratic base but is also making new inroads among moderate Republicans and independent voters. Another development to watch in coming weeks is whether her apparent strength in Wisconsin and Michigan in the new CNN polls is a harbinger of similar strength to come in Pennsylvania.
But if Harris’ ascent has already peaked, these polls underscore just how close Trump may still be to a second term. A narrow loss by Harris in Pennsylvania that hands the ex-president the White House would cause second guessing among Democrats at her decision to pass on the state’s governor – Josh Shapiro, who won it by nearly 15 percentage points in 2022 – as a running mate.
The polls were conducted between August 23-29, following the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, and are being published at the beginning of an intense two-month derby to Election Day. They represent some of the most comprehensive overviews of the race in the swing states that will decide the election that have yet emerged.
And their publication follows a stunning presidential race that saw Biden fold his reelection campaign less than four months before Election Day and his rival, Trump, who is vying to become only the second president to win non-consecutive White House terms, escape an assassination attempt in one of those vital states: Pennsylvania.
The campaign has moved up several notches in intensity even since Labor Day on Monday, and a key focus of both sides in the coming weeks will be identifying and turning out voters who are not yet committed to their choice.
Across the states surveyed by CNN, an average of 15% of likely voters say they have not firmly decided who they will vote for. This means that if either Harris or Trump can close strongly and carve out a significant advantage among this group, they could lock down the race.
There are some warning signs for both the vice president and the former president in the data.
Harris polls at 85% among Black likely voters in Georgia and at 84% in Pennsylvania. These findings may support claims by the Trump campaign that it has made inroads into a constituency that forms a bedrock of the Democratic coalition. According to exit polls in the 2020 election, Biden won 92% of Black voters in Pennsylvania and 88% in Georgia. One key focus of the Harris campaign and grass roots organizing groups will be to try to elevate those numbers in the next eight weeks and to make sure Black voters get to the polls in big numbers. In both states however, Black registered voters express less motivation to vote than White voters do.
Trump, meanwhile, has spent recent days oscillating in his position on reproductive rights and IVF fertility treatments, keenly aware that his most significant domestic political achievement – the construction of a conservative Supreme Court majority that overturned the nationwide constitutional right to an abortion – has turned into a massive electoral liability. The CNN/SSRS polling bears this out. It finds that Harris has increased Biden’s lead on abortion and reproductive rights across the six states surveyed and that it now stands at an average of 27 percentage points among women.
The current messaging from each side underscores this fraught moment in a bitter race.
Trump’s team put out a memo on Tuesday that pulsated with frustration that Harris’ policy reversals and ties to Biden, an unpopular president, were not already decisive in Trump’s favor. His top advisers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita wrote that their candidate had the true momentum. “Do the Democrats and voters realize this? Or does the mainstream media, in its attempt to manage public opinion and continue the ‘Harris Honeymoon,’ report a version of reality that is at odds with the facts?” they said.
The Harris campaign released its own memo over the weekend seeking to temper euphoria that lifted the vice president at her Chicago convention. Democratic leaders, after all, need their voters to fear a close race and see a Trump return as a realistic probability in order to boost turnout.
“Make no mistake: we head into the final stretch of this race as the clear underdogs,” Harris Campaign Manager Jennifer O’Malley Dillon warned."
S961TCMJDF_VVL20FJY4SZYDWV,New Zealand is tripling its tourist tax,"By Lilit Marcus, CNN","3 minute read Published 1:01 AM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240903,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/new-zealand-tripling-its-tourist-tax-intl-hnk/,"It will now be more expensive to visit New Zealand’s lakes, mountains, bike trails and wineries as the country is increasing its International Visitor Conservation and Tourism Levy (IVL) from NZ$35 ($22) to NZ$100 ($62) from October 1.
“International tourism also comes with costs to local communities, including additional pressure on regional infrastructure and higher upkeep and maintenance costs across our conservation estate,” Matt Doocey, New Zealand’s Minister for Hospitality and Tourism, said in a statement announcing the news.
The IVL, which was originally introduced in 2019, is intended to help cover the costs of environmental protection around the country. According to Doocey, international tourists spent more than $11 billion in New Zealand between March 2023 and March 2024.
But not everyone is happy with the price hike.
Tourism Industry Aotearoa (TIA), a consortium of travel industry professionals from across the country, criticized the decision.
“New Zealand’s tourism recovery is falling behind the rest of the world, and this will further dent our global competitiveness,” the group said in a statement. The group believes that New Zealand will lose tourists to Canada and the UK, where flights are more plentiful and entry fees less prohibitive.

The IVL is not the only added cost that will hit tourists visiting New Zealand.
Higher prices for tourist visas kick in on October 1, going from $131 to $211.
Citizens of 60 countries and territories, including the United States, Canada, Singapore, Japan and Mexico, can enter New Zealand are eligible for a visa waiver that will allow them to stay up to three months in the country for tourism purposes. Travelers holding these passports are still required to get an e-visa and pay the IVL.
Due to the new rules, the government expects that it will take longer for visas to be processed this year. Immigration New Zealand announced that people hoping to visit during the Christmas holiday period should apply for tourist visas no later than October 15 and those planning to come for Lunar New Year should get their applications in by November 15.
Whether they’re called an IVL, an access fee, or a travel incentive, “tourist taxes” are one of the hottest conversations in the travel industry right now.
Some 60 destinations around the world, from Venice to Bhutan, charge some kind of fee for travelers simply to enter and visit – not including the costs of meals, hotels, or admission tickets. Nearly all of the places with these tourist taxes say that the fee is necessary to offset the congestion, environmental damage and other side effects of overtourism.
And it doesn’t look like these fees are going away any time soon. Edinburgh, Scotland and Zermatt, Switzerland are among the places considering charging fees in the future.
According to a study from Bangor University in Wales, “there is little evidence of tourists being put off from visiting” destinations that have tourist taxes."
SE7XCUZORJ_MXNDTLC8D9K9EHM,Takeaways from Donald Trump’s election interference court hearing,"By Tierney Sneed and Jeremy Herb, CNN","7 minute read Updated 6:02 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/05/politics/takeaways-trump-jan-6-election-hearing/,"It didn’t take long after Thursday’s hearing in the federal election subversion case against Donald Trump – the first proceeding before Judge Tanya Chutkan since the Supreme Court granted the former president some immunity in the prosecution – for the trial judge to decide a schedule for the next steps in the case that lets prosecutors make public new evidence before the 2024 election.
Chutkan made clear that a potential trial date is far off, but she issued a scheduling order Thursday afternoon to push the case forward and tackle the question of presidential immunity following the Supreme Court’s July ruling — allowing prosecutors to issue a filing later this month, with supporting evidence, to defend special counsel Jack Smith’s reworked indictment that was handed up last week.
During the hearing, Chutkan previewed her thinking on how the case should advance. She was skeptical of the Trump team’s request that she first decide whether the then-Vice President Mike Pence-related allegations in the indictment were immune, and Chutkan repeatedly stressed the discretion she believes she has for how she structures the proceedings in her courtroom.
Though Thursday’s one-hour-and-15-minute hearing was mainly about process, a sharp back-and-forth she had with a Trump attorney brought attention to how the 2024 election is looming over the case.
Here are takeaways from the hearing:
The judge did not issue a ruling from the bench on the schedule, but she issued an order with her schedule to deal with several pretrial motions – including immunity – on Thursday afternoon.
During Thursday’s hearing, prosecutors explained why they want the chance to file an opening brief that would argue why they believe their new indictment complies with the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling. Trump’s attorneys argued against that and proposed a longer schedule.
Chutkan’s scheduling order called for the first brief to be filed by prosecutors on September 26, after Chutkan pushed prosecutor Thomas Windom for dates on how quickly the special counsel’s office could file the brief they proposed defending the new indictment.
Windom deferred to the judge – not putting on the record a date itself – while telling the judge they would need two to three weeks, meaning the end of this month.
“We do actually have to write this thing,” Windom said, prompting Chutkan to joke that maybe Windom had it in his binder.
“I would be surprised by that,” Windom responded.
At the same time, he emphasized that prosecutors would leave the exact timing “to the court’s discretion.”
Chutkan’s scheduling order included deadlines for a reply brief from Trump’s lawyers on October 17 and a reply from the special counsel on October 29 – meaning the filings will come in the final weeks of the campaign, and Chutkan could decide the issue more quickly than what Trump’s lawyers proposed. There is no hearing scheduled on the immunity question in her new order, but she could request oral arguments on the matter later on.
The evidence the special counsel’s office will reveal in its late September filing may not be immediately public, and Chutkan will be able to control its release. It is likely it would become available, though, potentially with redactions.
As the judge debated with Trump attorney John Lauro over how quickly she should move to allow the prosecution to file a brief defending their indictment on immunity, they eventually addressed the political elephant in the courtroom: the looming presidential election.
After a back and forth with the judge over what the process should be for deciding the immunity issues in the case, Lauro acknowledged that among his team’s concerns about the prosecutors’ proposed approach is what would be aired on the court’s public record at a “sensitive time.”
The crux of the process disagreement comes down to who gets to file their immunity brief first and when that brief gets filed.
“This court is not concerned with the electoral schedule,” Chutkan pushed back.
“We are talking about the presidency of the United States,” Lauro said.
“I am not talking about the presidency,” Chutkan said. “I am talking about a four-count indictment.”
“The subtext of your argument here about these sensitive times … it strikes me that what you’re trying to do is affect the presentation of this case so as not to impinge on an election,” she added.
Lauro denied that his arguments were connected to the presidential campaign.
“The decisions here will not just affect this case, it will affect the republic going forward,” Lauro said.
Trump has repeatedly complained that the new indictment filed last week was an attempt to interfere with the campaign – just as he complained about his New York trial in the spring – but Chutkan’s comments signaled she isn’t going to wait until after November 5 before moving forward on the issues that have to be dealt with in the case following the Supreme Court’s immunity decision.
At the end of Thursday’s hearing, Chutkan acknowledged the elephant in the room: There were still too many issues to resolve to set a trial date in the case.
“It’s sort of an exercise in futility at this point,” she said, noting that whatever decision she makes on immunity will be appealed, which means the trial will pause once again while the appellate process plays out.
Both Trump’s lawyers and prosecutors agreed that it was too soon to set a trial date.
While Chutkan’s schedule on the next steps in the case does get the immunity issue moving, all sides in the case – prosecutors, Trump’s attorneys and the judge – acknowledged Thursday that her ruling on immunity would almost certainly be appealed.
Of course, it’s not just the appeals process that makes a future trial so murky. If Trump wins the 2024 election, he is poised to toss out the special counsel and the case against him altogether once he returns to office.
Chutkan did not seem particularly convinced that, when deciding the immunity issues in the case, she should deal specifically with the Pence-related claims first.
Trump’s attorneys made the aggressive argument, first laid out in their filings late last week, that the whole case must fall if Trump’s interactions with his vice president are deemed immune from prosecution.
In Thursday’s hearing, Lauro was particularly focused on that argument and tried to persuade the judge that dealing with the Pence conduct as a standalone issue would be a more efficient way of doing things.
He contended that it would save the court from doing lengthy briefings on other the allegations in the indictment if she decides the whole case must be dismissed on the Pence issue alone. He also insisted that the Supreme Court viewed a finding that the Pence conduct was immune as fatal to the indictment, a claim Chutkan shot down.
“The ruling is clear, crystal clear,” Lauro said, prompting a chuckle from Chutkan.
Chutkan hinted that she was dubious of Trump’s coming attempt to get the DC case dismissed on the grounds that Smith was supposedly illegally appointed, even as Chutkan has said she’d let the former president file that motion to dismiss.
She took a swipe at the ruling that Judge Aileen Cannon handed down this summer dismissing the classified documents case on that basis, calling that ruling not particularly “persuasive.”
She also emphasized that a concurrence by Justice Clarence Thomas – which Cannon’s ruling cited – that laid out those constitutional concerns was “dicta,” meaning non-binding language. And she noted that there is already DC Circuit precedent on the books upholding the constitutionality of special counsels, which would be binding on her as a trial judge in Washington, DC.
Nevertheless, she is letting the Trump team take a shot. However, when his lawyers file the motion that asks for permission to formally make those arguments, they must elaborate on why they should be allowed to do so, Chutkan said.
Chutkan requested in Thursday afternoon’s order that Trump file his challenge to the legality of Smith’s appointment and for the special counsel to respond in late October, with the final brief from Trump on that issue due on November 7, two days after the election.

SEK2OOXVBY_57WSY5WD2SHH8AI,New York Times publisher sounds the alarm on Trump employing authoritarian anti-press ‘playbook’,"By Liam Reilly and Brian Stelter, CNN","3 minute read Published 2:20 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/05/media/new-york-times-a-g-sulzberger-authoritarian-playbook-trump/,"A.G. Sulzberger, the New York Times publisher, sounded the alarm Thursday on the “quiet war” against press freedoms unleashed by authoritarians around the world and said Americans should understand the anti-media “playbook” that Donald Trump might employ in a second term.
In an op-ed published by one of the Times’ main rivals, The Washington Post, Sulzberger warned that Trump and his allies have repeatedly threatened the press and said he wanted the Times “to ensure we are prepared for whatever is to come.”
“My colleagues and I have spent months studying how press freedom has been attacked in Hungary — as well as in other democracies such as India and Brazil,” he wrote.
The techniques include “sowing public distrust in independent journalism and normalizing the harassment” of journalists to create a “climate hospitable to crackdowns on the media;” using government authorities, like taxation, “to punish offending journalists and news organizations” while rewarding “those who demonstrate fealty to their leadership;” and filing meritless lawsuits and exploiting the courts to make it more costly to report the news.

“The effectiveness of this playbook should not be underestimated,” Sulzberger wrote.
The Times publisher said he didn’t wish to wade into politics, but Trump’s anti-press words and actions – declaring media outlets the “enemy of the people” and suggesting the use of government to quash dissent – must be taken seriously.
“I believe the risk is shared by our entire profession, as well as all who depend on it,” he wrote.
In championing the need for trustworthy news and information, Sulzberger called on his peers to bolster protections, which includes teaching staffers how to protect themselves and their sources, preparing for legal fights and harassment, and pushing back against campaigns that seek to unjustly undermine trust in news media.
Sulzberger occasionally writes essays to prompt journalism industry dialogue about key issues. Last year, he wrote for the Columbia Journalism Review about the debate around objectivity in journalism. This year, with Trump’s anti-media rhetoric again front and center, he wanted to write about what an escalating campaign against the American press could look like.
Sulzberger approached it as a summer project of sorts.
“To ensure we are prepared for whatever is to come, my colleagues and I have spent months studying how press freedom has been attacked in Hungary — as well as in other democracies such as India and Brazil,” he wrote in the essay. “The political and media environments in each country are different, and the campaigns have seen varying tactics and levels of success, but the pattern of anti-press action reveals common threads.”
Sulzberger thought extensively about the best way to publish the essay — whether in the pages of The Times or elsewhere. He wound up placing it with the Post, an unorthodox move given the long history of competition between the two publications. The collaboration makes a clear statement about the importance of solidarity in the face of existential threats to press freedom.
“I’m grateful to The Post for running the piece, especially given the length (and the suspect institutional affiliations of its author,” he wrote in an email to associates on Thursday. “They’ve been a great partner on the cause of press freedom over many decades and it’s great to see that tradition continue.”"
SER7A73C3G_Y5M0T8KJ39MYOT7,CNN polls across six battlegrounds find Georgia and Pennsylvania are key toss-ups,"By Jennifer Agiesta, Ariel Edwards-Levy and Edward Wu, CNN","11 minute read Updated 8:42 AM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/04/politics/cnn-polls-battleground-states/,"The 2024 presidential campaign’s home stretch kicks off with a mixed outlook across six key battlegrounds, according to new CNN polls conducted by SSRS in each state. Vice President Kamala Harris holds an advantage over former President Donald Trump among likely voters in Wisconsin and Michigan, while Trump has the edge in Arizona. The two split likely voters almost evenly in Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania, the state with the largest electoral vote prize that’s widely seen as up for grabs.
Across each of them, an average of 15% of likely voters say they have not yet firmly decided their choice, suggesting a sizable share of voters could shift their views on the race as attention to the campaign rises and campaign activity, especially in these states, hits a fever pitch in the final nine weeks before Election Day.
Likely voters in Wisconsin break 50% for Harris to 44% for Trump, and in Michigan, it’s 48% Harris to 43% Trump. In Arizona, Trump lands at 49% to Harris’ 44%. In Georgia and Nevada, 48% back Harris to 47% for Trump, and in Pennsylvania, the candidates are tied at 47%.
The polls, conducted after the Democratic National Convention in August, reflect results among likely voters determined through a combination of past vote behavior and current intention to vote.

The findings suggest an Electoral College landscape where Pennsylvania and Georgia are central to each candidate’s path to the White House. President Joe Biden carried all six of these states in 2020, winning Georgia by just under 12,000 votes and Arizona by a little over 10,000 votes. Were Harris to hold Biden’s 2020 wins outside of these six states and carry Wisconsin and Michigan, a win in Pennsylvania plus a single electoral vote from anywhere else would give her the presidency. Should Trump hold North Carolina – a state he carried in 2020 and that is widely considered a battleground in this year’s contest – wins in Georgia and Pennsylvania would put him over the top regardless of what happens in Wisconsin, Michigan or Nevada. In that scenario, even Arizona, where he currently holds a narrow lead, would not be necessary for Trump to win another term as president.
Harris’ emergence as the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee, replacing Biden atop the party’s ticket this summer, has altered some dynamics in the race but left others intact. Economic issues, which posed a notable weak point for Biden, remain the topic most often chosen by voters when asked what matters to their choice for president; an average of 39% of likely voters across states choose the economy as their top issue, with protecting democracy next at an average of 25%. But Harris now trails Trump on trust to handle the economy by relatively smaller margins than Biden did; across the current polls, Trump is more trusted than Harris on the economy by 8 points on average. (In New York Times/Siena College polls of the same six states this spring, the same calculation yielded a 20-point Trump advantage over Biden.) Trump maintains a broad advantage as more trusted to handle immigration, while Harris has built on Biden’s lead as more trusted to handle abortion and reproductive rights, with women across these six states preferring her by an average of 27 percentage points on the issue.
Across nearly all of these states, likely voters are more apt to describe Trump than Harris as having clear policy plans to solve the country’s problems (voters split about evenly on this question in Wisconsin and Michigan), but voters in these swing states largely describe Harris’ views and policies as mainstream and Trump’s as too extreme. About half in each state (between 46% and 51%) say Trump’s views and policies are so extreme that they pose a threat to the country, while around 4 in 10 (between 37% and 42%) say the same about Harris’ positions.
Harris tops Trump across these states in being seen by voters as more apt to care about “people like you” – narrowly so in Arizona and Pennsylvania – and as someone they would be proud to have as president. Voters’ views on who would bring the kind of change the country needs vary state-to-state and are generally closely divided.
Independent voters, whose preferences in the presidential race vary widely state-to-state, are notably likely to say that they could change their minds about the race; roughly a quarter of independent likely voters or more feel that way across states. And they also are more likely than other respondents to say they think neither Harris nor Trump will unite the country rather than divide it (33% on average across states say so), that neither has clear policy plans to solve the country’s problems (31% on average) and that neither cares about people like them (26% on average).
As the sitting vice president, Harris is tied to an unpopular White House: Biden’s approval rating stands in negative territory with likely voters across all six states, with approval around 40% in all but Wisconsin, where it stands at 44%.
Still, Harris currently holds an average of 16% support among likely voters who disapprove of Biden’s job as president. The last time a sitting vice president ran for the White House, in 2000, Al Gore captured just 9% of those who disapproved of President Bill Clinton’s job performance nationwide, according to exit polls.
Both Georgia and Pennsylvania remain thoroughly up for grabs, according to the polls, with tight margins overall and double-digit shares of likely voters – 12% in Georgia and 16% in Pennsylvania – saying they haven’t yet decided on a candidate, or that they might change their minds.
Black voters are a key bloc in both states, particularly in Georgia, and according to these polls, Harris stands at 85% among Black likely voters in Georgia and at 84% in Pennsylvania. In both states, though, Black registered voters express less motivation to vote in this year’s election than White voters do. In Georgia, 61% of Black registered voters say they are extremely motivated to vote compared with 70% among White voters, and in Pennsylvania, just 56% of Black voters say they are deeply motivated to vote compared with 72% of White voters.
Both states see significant gender gaps in presidential preference, with Harris ahead by double-digits among female likely voters in both states while Trump has similarly large leads among male likely voters. Harris widens her margin slightly in both states among suburban women, topping Trump by 16 points with that group in Georgia and 18 points in Pennsylvania.
Harris carries a majority of likely voters younger than 35 in both states, leading 59% to 36% in Pennsylvania, and 54% to 41% in Georgia.
White likely voters without college degrees in both states break broadly for Trump, particularly in Georgia, where roughly 7 in 10 support him. White likely voters who do have four-year college degrees, though, split in opposite directions across the two states. In Pennsylvania, they broadly favor Harris, 59% to 37%, while in Georgia, they are solidly in Trump’s camp, 65% to 32%. That dynamic is similar to the divide seen in 2020 exit polling.
Harris’ narrow leads in Wisconsin and Michigan are largely driven by consolidation of the Democratic base, as well as increased motivation among Democratic and Democratic-leaning likely voters, who are broadly aligned behind Harris now (96% in Michigan and 95% in Wisconsin support her).
CNN’s March 2024 poll in Michigan, fielded after Trump and Biden had secured enough delegates to win their parties’ nominations, found only 75% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning registered voters expressed support for Biden.
In both states, Harris’ support among some key demographics of the Democratic Party’s base resembles that of Biden’s 2020 win. Harris leads Trump among female likely voters (55% to 38% in Wisconsin, 54% to 38% in Michigan), White voters with college degrees (62% to 31% in Wisconsin, 52% to 41% in Michigan), and by 86% to 11% among Black likely voters in Michigan (the sample size for Black likely voters is not large enough to report in Wisconsin).
Younger voters here are less broadly in Harris’ camp than in Georgia, Pennsylvania or Nevada. In Michigan, voters younger than 35 split 43% for Harris and 42% for Trump. In Wisconsin, they break 49% Harris and 42% Trump. Both states were central to the uncommitted movement’s efforts to log protest votes against Biden during the Democratic presidential primary, an effort focused at least in part on younger voters.
The polls suggest enthusiasm among the Democratic base may be a factor in both states. In Michigan, 72% of Democratic-aligned registered voters say they are extremely motivated to vote, up from 58% in March, while the numbers among GOP-aligned voters remained effectively unchanged at about 7 in 10. And among registered voters in Wisconsin, 81% of Democratic-aligned voters and 70% of Republican-aligned voters say they are extremely motivated to vote.
Arizona, where Trump holds a narrow lead overall, stands out in these polls as the one state where Harris appears not to have restored support among several key Democratic groups, notably Latino voters, younger voters and White voters with college degrees. The contrast with Nevada demonstrates the difference.
In Nevada, Latino likely voters break broadly toward Harris, 57% to 37%, while they are more evenly divided in Arizona, 49% Harris to 43% Trump. White voters in both states break toward Trump by double-digit margins (56% to 39% in Arizona, 55% to 41% in Nevada). Harris carries White voters with college degrees in Nevada, 56% to 41%, while that group splits evenly, 47% each, in Arizona.
Younger voters in Arizona break narrowly in Trump’s favor: 48% of likely voters younger than 35 say they support Trump, compared with 42% behind Harris, a result within the margin of sampling error for that subset. In Nevada, though, likely voters in that age group divide 54% to Harris to 39% Trump.
And the gender gap in Arizona appears smaller than in other states, with women splitting 48% Harris to 45% Trump while men divide 55% Trump to 41% Harris. In Nevada, Harris holds a 16-point lead among female likely voters. (Among male likely voters in Nevada, Trump has an 18-point lead, 57% to 39%)
These results – a narrow Trump edge in Arizona and an even race in Nevada – come even as downballot races in the two states suggest a more favorable climate for Democrats. Arizona’s closely contested Senate race stands at 47% for Democrat Ruben Gallego with Republican Kari Lake at 44%, and a ballot measure designed to create a fundamental right to abortion in the state’s constitution holds overwhelming support – 62% say they’d vote in favor of it while 35% say they would oppose it. And in Nevada, incumbent Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen stands at 50% support to Republican Sam Brown’s 40%.
The findings suggest Trump may hold broader appeal in these states than elsewhere in the battlegrounds. He racks up some of his largest advantages as more trusted on handling the economy (up 16 points over Harris in Nevada and 15 points in Arizona, compared with an average 5 point lead across the other four states), immigration (up 17 points in Arizona and 12 points in Nevada, up by an average of 9 points in other states) and crime and safety (up 10 points in Nevada and 9 in Arizona, up by an average of 3 points in other states) in these two states, and is narrowly more likely to be seen as having generally mainstream views and policies here than elsewhere (50% in Arizona and 47% in Nevada see him that way, compared with 45% or less in the other four states).
The surveys show slim support for third-party and independent candidates, but in a close race, even small levels of support for such candidates can be meaningful. Voters were asked to choose among the candidates who were most likely to be included in each state’s ballot at the time the poll began based on candidate filings and existing rulings for who would be named on each ballot.
Independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was included in Michigan where there was no clear path for his name to be removed from the ballot even after he suspended his campaign, and received 4% support among likely voters, but he was not listed in the other states. The Wisconsin Elections Commission rejected a request from Kennedy to remove his name from the ballot while the poll was in the field.
Green Party candidate Jill Stein received 2% support in Arizona, but 1% or less elsewhere, and Libertarian Chase Oliver held 2% support in Wisconsin, but 1% or less in all other states. Independent Cornel West held 1% support in Georgia, but less than that in Wisconsin and was not included in the poll for other states.
Results on Senate races across the five states that have them here show a more favorable climate for Democrats downballot in some key states, but suggest little ticket splitting in others, with the surveys finding some closer contests than other recent public polling. Democrats currently hold the Senate seats up for election this year in Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and retiring independent incumbent Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona caucuses with the Democratic Party.
Democratic incumbents lead in Nevada (Rosen 50% to Brown 40%) and Wisconsin (Sen. Tammy Baldwin at 51% to Republican Eric Hovde’s 45%), and in the open Michigan Senate race, Democrat Elissa Slotkin tops Republican Mike Rogers 47% to 41% in the poll. But the survey finds closer races with no clear leader in Arizona (Gallego 47% to Lake 44%) and Pennsylvania (Sen. Bob Casey and Republican David McCormick each at 46%).
Interviews conducted August 23-29, 2024, online and by telephone with registered voters, including 682 voters in Arizona, 617 in Georgia, 708 in Michigan, 626 in Nevada, 789 in Pennsylvania, and 976 in Wisconsin. Likely voters include all registered voters in the poll weighted for their predicted likelihood of voting in this year’s election."
SJOM20OXF8_SA4O1E06A0MLO4K,Winona Ryder and Keanu Reeves call each other husband and wife on their text chain,"By Lisa Respers France, CNN","2 minute read Published 9:45 AM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/04/entertainment/winona-ryder-keanu-reeves-husband-wife/,"Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder are really taking that “married under the eyes of God” thing seriously.
During an episode of the “Happy Sad Confused” podcast, Ryder revealed that she and her former costar still text regularly and “we always say who it is, even though it says it on the text.”
“So like on his birthday I go, ‘Happy birthday, my husband’ and then he’s like, ‘Hey, my wife, I love you KR 57,’” Ryder said. “Like on each birthday he’s like KR 57 or whatever his age is. He’s always done that.”
The pair costarred in the 1992 Francis Ford Coppola directed drama “Bram Stoker’s Dracula” in which their characters had a wedding scene.
In a 2018 interview to promote their rom-com “Destination Wedding,”  Ryder said she believed she and Reeves had actually wed.
“In that scene, Francis [Ford Coppola] used a real Romanian priest,” she explained. “We shot the master and he did the whole thing. So I think we’re married.”
Three years later, Reeves talked about it during a video he shot for Esquire.
“We did a whole take of a marriage ceremony with real priests,” he said. “Winona says we are [married]. Coppola says we are. So I guess we’re married… under the eyes of God.”
During the recent podcast, Ryder raved about working with Reeves. However, the “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice” star demurred on possibly doing a “John Wick” action film because “involves a lot of stunt” and she’s “thinking of my bones.”
“I would literally do anything though with him,” she said about costarring with Reeves. “He is so special.”"
SL0DJ20QM5_GR89ILTB0BBUDY5,China-Africa ties ‘best in history’ claims Xi as Beijing pushes back on Western debt trap criticism,"By Simone McCarthy, CNN","6 minute read Updated 8:28 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/05/china/china-africa-forum-xi-speech-aid-pledge-intl-hnk/,"Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.
China is enjoying its “best in history” ties with African nations, leader Xi Jinping said on Thursday, as he pledged $50 billion in financial support for the continent in addition to military aid.
China and Africa should rally their populations together to become a “powerful force” and write a “new chapter in peace, prosperity and progress,” Xi said in a sweeping speech to delegates from more than 50 African nations as he sought to bolster relationships seen as key to Beijing’s position as a rising global power.
Flanked by African dignitaries seated on stage in the cavernous Great Hall of the People in Beijing, Xi said “China-Africa relations are at their best in history,” and vowed to elevate China’s bilateral relations with all African countries with which it has formal ties to the level of “strategic relations.”
Xi separately pledged another $280 million in aid to African countries, split evenly between military and food assistance. The announcements are a sign Beijing wants to demonstrate its commitment to the continent, despite a recent slowdown in its overseas development lending and as Africa struggles with its foreign debt, including those owed to China.
The pledge of $140 million in military aid is the largest amount that China has earmarked for this purpose at the three-yearly Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, signaling the increasing importance of security in the relationship between Beijing and its partners in Africa. In 2018, China said it would provide $100 million to support the African Standby Force and African Capacity for Immediate Response to Crisis.
Leaders including South Africa’s Cyril Ramaphosa, Kenya’s William Ruto and Nigeria’s Bola Tinubu assembled in the Chinese capital this week for the three-day forum that Beijing has hailed as its largest diplomatic gathering in years.
This year’s event comes amid questions about the direction of those relations as Beijing, long the driving foreign economic power in Africa, has been recalibrating its extensive economic ties to the continent, while other major powers are ramping up their own efforts to engage Africa.
China has been pulling back on big-ticket spending under Xi’s signature Belt and Road Initiative. That infrastructure drive saw it fund projects like railways, roads and power plants and expand its influence on the continent. However, it also faced criticism that unsustainable lending contributed to heavy international debt loads now shouldered by many African countries.
Xi did not mention these debt challenges in his address but did make broad pledges for China to deepen cooperation with Africa in industry, agriculture, infrastructure, trade and investment.
Xi’s pledge of $50 billion to the continent over the next three years — a mix of credit funds, assistance and private investment from Chinese firms — outstrips a previous pledge made three years ago of around $30 billion during a prior iteration of the forum in Dakar, Senegal.
While lower than the $60 billion pledged in 2015 and 2018 respectively, it appears to be aimed at sending a strong signal to visiting leaders about China’s commitment to the continent.
In his 10-minute speech, Xi outlined 10 action areas for cooperation over the coming three years, including infrastructure connectivity, trade, security and green development – an area where Beijing is widely seen as pushing to enhance its exports of green technology.
He also pledged to create at least 1 million jobs for Africa.
It’s unclear how Xi’s pledges would align in practice with the expectations from visiting African leaders, analysts say. Fulfillment of past pledges has also been difficult to track, they say.

Leaders in Beijing are seeking investment, trade, and support to industrialize and create jobs. That includes a push for China to import more processed goods from Africa, rather than simply exporting and processing raw materials – like Africa’s highly sought after critical minerals.
Following Xi’s speech, African leaders also gave remarks, with South Africa’s Ramaphosa praising China’s “solidarity” with the continent. He pointed to global challenges including conflict, climate change and a “global contestation for critical minerals” that is fueling geopolitical rivalry.
“These challenges affect all nations but are more often severely felt on the African continent, yet amid these challenges there is hope and opportunity,” he said.
Speaking later on the sidelines of the summit, Senegal’s Foreign Minister Yassine Fall told reporters that there would always be global competition but observers should look to evidence of the “quality of partnership between Africa and China.”
“You see how Africans today are saying that China is on our side,” Fall said.
This year’s gathering comes as China’s longstanding relations with Africa appear even more critical for Beijing amid rising frictions with Washington.
The US and Europe have also been ramping up their own efforts to engage Africa and access its critical minerals, widely seen as a bid to counter inroads that China has made both politically and in the continent’s resources sector.
In his address, Xi played up what Beijing hopes is a kindred political stance with the continent, hailing a joint vision for “shared future,” a key buzzword he uses to denote alignment with China’s vision for a world order that provides an alternative to the one championed by the US.
He also pointed to what he described as the “great suffering” of developing countries under the West’s historical process of modernization.
Observers say Beijing is even more keen to use this year’s gathering to signal its ongoing commitment, given concerns about its role in high levels of debt among African nations.
China is not seen by analysts to be the main cause of African debt distress in most cases, as countries also owe huge sums to multilateral banks and private lenders. But its hefty loans have upped debt burdens and Beijing has been criticized for not moving quickly enough or being flexible in helping distressed or at-risk countries.
“With the intensification of this great power competition with the United States, China is coming to the realization that it has to rely on the Global South as the foundation for its diplomacy,” said Yun Sun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center think tank in Washington.
“The choice of African countries in this great power competition is becoming more important than ever, because Africa is such a big block in the Global South,” she said.
In a press conference later Thursday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi acknowledged other countries were turning their attention toward Africa.
“As Africa’s good friend, China is happy for that, we also welcome more countries for their support and assistance to Africa,” he said, adding that any “condescending approach” must be rejected.
Xi’s push to bolster security is also a sign of how Beijing is looking to expand its strategic partnership with a region that has emerged as a key node in China’s military ambitions.
The People’s Liberation Army opened its first and only overseas military base in Djibouti in 2017, and its navy has made regular port calls in different African countries amid concern in Washington that Beijing could seek to open an Atlantic base.
In addition to the $140 million in military assistance announced Thursday, Xi pledged to train 6,000 military personnel and 1,000 law enforcement officers and establish a “partnership with Africa to implement the Global Security Initiative,” referring to his broader vision to reshape global security architecture away from the US alliance-based security system.
Security cooperation also has a pragmatic angle for Beijing, whose companies’ mining operations in Africa have been subject to criminal attacks.
Xi alluded to this in his comments, calling for China and Africa to “jointly maintain the safety of personnel and projects.”
However, analysts note that while China plays a substantial role in United Nations peacekeeping efforts, it’s seen as less likely to want to get involved directly in regional conflicts, even as it continues to push for other collaborations in the security realm.
China “is very proactive in understanding the mindset of the region,” said Ovigwe Eguegu, a Nigeria-based policy analyst at the consultancy Development Reimagined, and now it sees “there is a lot of dissatisfaction with the current global security order.”

The decision came after the estate of the late R&B artist and songwriter Isaac Hayes sought an emergency injunction to stop the Trump campaign from using the song at campaign events, alleging the campaign does not have approval.
Judge Thomas Thrash Jr. made the ruling from the bench in court in Atlanta, Georgia.
“I do order Trump and his campaign to not use the song without proper license,” he said.
The judge denied a motion by the Hayes estate to force the Trump campaign to take down any previously recorded uses of the song.
Ronald Coleman, an attorney for Trump, told members of the media after the hearing that “the campaign has no interest in annoying or hurting anyone. And if the Hayes family feels it hurts or annoys them, that’s fine, we’re not going to force the issue.”
Coleman said they were pleased the judge didn’t order the campaign to take down any previous uses of the song.
Hayes died in 2008 after suffering a stroke. He was 65.
The 1966 song, co-written by Hayes and David Porter, was performed by Sam Moore and Dave Prater, who were professionally known as the duo Sam & Dave. Prater died in 1988.
CNN has reached out to a representative for Moore for comment.
According to court documents obtained by CNN, attorneys for the Hayes estate claim that the campaign has not “obtained a valid public performance license” and are requesting “compensatory damages for the unauthorized use” of Hayes’ music.
The Hayes estate alleges that Trump began using Hayes’ material as “outro” music at campaign events in 2020 and have continued to use his music in 2024, as seen in one of Trump’s recent posts on Truth Social in which “Hold On, I’m Comin’” can be heard playing at a rally.
“We are very grateful and happy for the decision by Judge Thrash,” Isaac Hayes III said after the hearing. “I want this to serve as an opportunity for other artists to come forward that don’t want their music used by Donald Trump or other political entities.”

In their response to the lawsuit, attorneys for the Republican National Committee and the Trump campaign claim the Hayes estate is not the license holder for the song.
On Monday, Hayes III posted a letter dated June 5, 2024, that he said was from BMI, an organization that collects license fees from businesses for the use of music.
“Donald Trump for President has been claiming they had a valid @BMI license to play “Hold On, I’m Coming” for weeks. FALSE,” the post on X reads. “Donald Trump for President has not had valid license for nealy 100 days, and @realDonaldTrump has NEVER had a license. Not to mention the numerous uses before Nov. 30th, 2022.”
The estate is the first to end up in court over complaints of Trump and his campaign allegedly using music they had not properly licensed, but other artists have complained.
Beyoncé, Bruce Springsteen, Celine Dion, Prince’s estate and Foo Fighters have publicly complained and/or disavowed Trump using their music.

ST0MLY0OHH_ZHMZZMXQC13N4P9,Exclusive: Ukraine army chief reveals the strategy behind Kursk incursion,"By Ivana Kottasová, Madalena Araujo and Victoria Butenko, CNN","5 minute read Published 1:00 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/05/europe/ukraine-army-chief-kursk-incursion-exclusive-intl/,"Russia had been planning to launch a new attack on Ukraine from the Kursk region before Kyiv’s surprise cross-border incursion, Ukraine’s Commander-in-Chief Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi told CNN in an exclusive interview Thursday.
In his first television interview since becoming military chief in February, the general told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour that he believed the Kursk operation had been a success.
“It reduced the threat of an enemy offensive. We prevented them from acting. We moved the fighting to the enemy’s territory so that [the enemy] could feel what we feel every day,” Syrskyi said, in a rare interview that offered a candid assessment of the war.
Last month, Ukrainian forces stormed into Kursk in a cross-border incursion that caught even American officials by surprise. It signaled that, despite Russia’s advantage in terms of men and armor, its military has vulnerabilities.
Related article Ukraine’s Zelensky says Russia incursion is part of victory plan he intends to show Biden
In what is the most detailed explanation of the rationale behind the incursion, Syrskyi outlined the key objectives of the operation: to stop Russia from using Kursk as a launchpad for a new offensive, to divert Moscow’s forces from other areas, to create a security zone and prevent cross-border shelling of civilian objects, to take prisoners of war and to boost the morale of the Ukrainian troops and the nation overall.
Speaking to Amanpour at an undisclosed location near the frontline, the general, who took over as army chief in February, said Moscow moved tens of thousands of troops to Kursk, including some of its best airborne assault troops.
And while admitting that Ukraine was under immense pressure in the area around Pokrovsk, the strategic city that has for weeks been the epicenter of war in eastern Ukraine, Syrskyi said his troops have now managed to stall the Russian advances there.
“Over the last six days the enemy hasn’t advanced a single meter in the Pokrovsk direction. In other words, our strategy is working.” he said.
“We’ve taken away their ability to maneuver and to deploy their reinforcement forces from other directions … and this weakening has definitely been felt in other areas. We note the amount of artillery shelling as well as the intensity of the offensive have decreased,” he said.
Speaking to Amanpour just after inspecting the frontlines on Thursday, Syrskyi said that there’s no doubt that Ukraine is outgunned and outmanned as it tries to defend itself against the Russian aggression.
“The enemy does have an advantage in aviation, in missiles, in artillery, in the amount of ammunition they use, of course, in personnel, tanks, infantry fighting vehicles,” he said.
But Syrskyi also said the fact that Russia has such a material advantage has forced Ukraine to become smarter and more efficient in the way it’s fighting the war.
“We cannot fight in the same way as they do, so we must use, first of all, the most effective approach, use our forces and means with maximum use of terrain features, engineering structures and also, to use technical superiority,” he said, highlighting Ukraine’s advanced drone program and other home-grown high-tech weaponry.
Syrskyi was named Ukraine’s commander in chief in February, after President Volodymyr Zelensky fired Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyi. He took over at a particularly difficult time for Ukraine.
The months-long delays in the delivery of US military assistance caused critical ammunition shortages.
At the same time, Ukraine was struggling to replenish its troops, exhausted and diminished after fighting Russia’s relentless offensive for two years.
Syrskyi said recruiting more soldiers was a priority. The Ukrainian government then passed a controversial mobilization law, requiring all men between 18 and 60 to register with Ukraine’s military and to carry their registration documents on them at all times – an effort to make the recruitment process more transparent and fair.
Seven months later, the new recruits are arriving to the frontlines. But several commanders have told CNN that not all of the new soldiers are ready to fight and are routinely abandoning their positions.
Syrskyi admitted his troops are heading to the battlefield after receiving less training than he’d like them to.
“Of course, everyone wants the level of training to be the best, so we train highly qualified professional military personnel,” he said. “At the same time, the dynamics at the front require us to put conscripted servicemen into service as soon as possible,” he added, explaining that new recruits get one month of basic military training followed by half a month to a full month of more specialized training before they are sent to fight.
Syrskyi told Amanpour that the delays in US military assistance did cause major setbacks on the battlefield and led to a slump in morale – something he admitted was still an issue.
He said he takes frequent trips to the frontlines and makes sure he spends time with his troops.
“We speak the same language … we understand each other no matter who I am talking to – whether this is an ordinary soldier, a rifleman, for example, or a brigade commander, or a battalion commander,” he said.
“I have been in this war since 2014,” he said, referring to Russia’s incursion into the Donbas 10 years ago. “In other words, the frontline is my life. We understand each other, I know all the problems that our servicemen, soldiers, and officers experience,” he added.
Syrskyi ended the candid interview by thanking Ukraine’s Western allies for their support. Switching from Ukrainian to English, he said: “Together we are stronger. Together we can win.”"

The source said that the writings were discovered in the bedroom of suspect Colt Gray, and included references to the 2018 massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida.
Live updates: The latest on the Georgia high school shooting
The discovery, which could shed more light on a motive for the shooting, comes amid an emerging portrait of Gray’s tumultuous family life in the years leading up to the deadly attack, revealed in a CNN review of court and law enforcement records, social media posts, and an interview with his grandfather.
As that portrait has emerged, so have details about the investigation and authorities’ pursuit of those they allege bear responsibility in the shooting. Gray told investigators, “I did it” while being questioned, Barrow County Sheriff Jud Smith told CNN on Thursday.
And while Gray faces four counts of felony murder, Gray’s father, Colin, also has been arrested in connection with the shooting, accused of “knowingly allowing his son … to possess a weapon,” Georgia Bureau of Investigation Director Chris Hosey said Thursday. Colin Gray was charged with four counts of involuntary manslaughter; two counts of second degree murder; and eight counts of cruelty to children, the GBI said.
As for Colt Gray’s family situation: His parents went through a bitter separation and custody dispute in recent years. They called law enforcement on each other, the family was evicted from at least one home, and Gray’s mother was arrested on suspicion of keying her husband’s car and drug possession, law enforcement records show.

At the same time, Gray’s mother and maternal grandfather have accused Gray’s father of being verbally abusive toward his family for years.
“He was just a good kid, but he lived in an environment that was hostile,” Charles Polhamus said of Colt Gray, his grandson, in an interview with CNN. “His dad beat up on him, I mean, I’m not talking about physical, but screaming and hollering, and he did the same thing to my daughter.”
The grandfather said he had never seen Colt Gray show any kind of anger problems, but that the turbulent family life had affected the teenager.
Now, investigators seeking to understand the suspect’s motive are looking into his family’s previous contacts with the state’s child protective services agency, the GBI director said Wednesday.
The suspect’s father told investigators this week he had purchased the gun used in the killings as a holiday present for his son in December 2023, according to two law enforcement sources with direct knowledge of the investigation. One source told CNN the AR-15-style rifle was purchased at a local gun store as a Christmas present. The other source described the gift as a holiday present.
Attempts to reach both of the suspect’s parents for comment on Wednesday and Thursday were unsuccessful. CNN was working to determine whether Colt Gray and Colin Gray have legal representation.
Colt Gray’s parents’ relationship started out with promise. In July 2011, shortly after he was born, his parents bought a small farm in Barrow County, Georgia, outside of the college town of Athens. They planned to “create a non-profit, therapeutic riding school for local, under-privileged children,” his mother, Marcee Gray, who worked in industrial engineering, later wrote in a LinkedIn post.
But those plans were derailed in part because her husband, Colin Gray, had at least three “major” back surgeries, she wrote. The couple, who had three children, later sold the farm in 2019, according to property records.
After they moved, the family faced lawsuits from multiple landlords, and were evicted from one home by a county sheriff’s deputy in July 2022 for failing to pay rent, according to court records. As part of the eviction, sheriff’s records show, deputies collected three firearms, including an AR-15, and at least one hunting bow, and kept them for safekeeping. The weapons were later “released to owner,” the documents say.
Later that year, Marcee Gray wrote on social media that she had left her husband.
“Finally separated from my abusive husband of almost 14yrs,” she wrote in one LinkedIn comment on a post from December 2022. “Hardest shit I’ve ever done but we’re in good hands.”
“I packed myself and my babies up and relocated to my hometown in south GA,” Gray added in another post in May 2023. “We are all good and my kids are thriving.”
The same month, however, law enforcement agents were investigating 13-year-old Colt Gray in connection with a school shooting threat. Investigators with the Jackson County Sheriff’s Office interviewed Colt and his father about a threat on the online chat platform Discord to commit a school shooting, documents obtained through a public records request show.
Colt Gray denied making the threat, an investigation report said. A Discord spokesperson told CNN on Wednesday that the platform removed an account “believed to be associated with” Gray in May 2023 for violating Discord’s policy against extremism.
Colin Gray told investigators he had hunting rifles in the house, and that “Colt is allowed to use them when supervised but does not have unfettered access to them,” the report said. The case was later cleared because the tip could not be substantiated.
Transcripts from the interview and a subsequent phone call show that Colin Gray said his son was “getting picked on at school,” with other students “pinching him and touching him… just ridiculed him day after day after day.” He also that that he was “trying to teach him about firearms and safety and how to do it all and get him… interested in the outdoors,” in part to get him away from video games.
“He knows the seriousness of weapons and what they can do and how to use them and not use them,” Colin Gray said.

In his interview, Colin Gray told investigators that he had separated from his wife, who took their two younger children with her. The suspect’s father said that Colt – the oldest of three siblings – had “had some problems” at a middle school in Jackson County but had since moved to another school and “it has gotten a lot better,” one of the investigators wrote.
Gray was only enrolled in the Jackson County school district between February and August 2022, said Edward Hooper, the spokesperson for the district. Jackson County is next to Barrow County, where Colt Gray is accused of killing two fellow students and two teachers at Apalachee High School.
In October 2023, Barrow County Sheriff’s deputies responded to a wellness check on the Gray family after Marcee Gray reported that she hadn’t heard from her husband or their children in two weeks. Colin Gray, who was at their residence, said all of their children were with him, a sheriff’s deputy wrote in a report.
Colin Gray gave the deputy a paper from the Georgia Division of Family and Children Services that showed “a safety plan was put in place for him to have the children with him” and Marcee Gray “could not see them without supervision,” the deputy wrote.
A spokesperson from the Georgia Department of Human Services said Thursday she could not comment on the case due to confidentiality laws. But Georgia Bureau of Investigation Director Chris Hosey said at a press conference Wednesday that the bureau was aware that the division had previously had “some previous contacts” with the Gray family, and “we are pursuing that avenue as well too to see if that has any connection with today’s incident.”
In November 2023, Colin Gray called law enforcement and accused his wife of keying a truck he drove for his work at a construction company, writing “abuse” and “liar” on it, according to a sheriff’s report.
Two days later, police arrested Marcee Gray at a Walmart in Winder due to an active warrant from another county. Police found methamphetamine, fentanyl, pain pills, and a glass pipe in her car, and she and another man who was in the vehicle were arrested, another sheriff’s report said.
After being arrested, Marcee Gray admitted keying her husband’s truck, saying she “lost it” after he refused to let her see her kids, the report said.

Marcee Gray pleaded guilty the following month to criminal damage to property, “criminal trespass - family violence,” and use of a license plate to conceal identity, and was sentenced to a total of five months’ probation after serving more than a month in custody. As part of her guilty plea, she was barred from contacting her husband except through a third party for divorce negotiations and custody discussions.
A friend of Marcee Gray, who asked not to be named for privacy, told CNN that the legal trouble she faced was “not the Marcee we know,” calling her a “sweet, caring, and smart woman” who had changed.
“Something happened in that relationship that went wrong,” the friend said.
According to Polhamus, Marcee Gray’s father, she lost custody of her children after failing a drug test, moved back in with her parents in south Georgia and is going through rehab.
Polhamus said he had never thought his grandson would be capable of such a deadly attack.
“I understand that Colt chose to do what he did, and I understand he has to pay for it,” he said. “But I’m telling you, the environment that he lived in… you put somebody in a situation like that for 10 or 11 years, guess what’s gonna happen? Nothing good.”
The Discord account that the FBI had linked to Colt Gray last year referenced plans for a future mass shooting and shared screenshots of firearms, according to documents obtained by CNN.
“im committing a mass shooting and im waiting a good 2-3 years,” stated the account user, according to screenshots included in an FBI incident report from May 2023 obtained by CNN. “I cant kill myself yet, cause I’m not contributing anything to culture I need to go out knowing I did.”
The account referenced Adam Lanza, the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooter, and in separate posts shared a desire to target an elementary school and expressed frustration that transgender people were being accepted in society.
Above a photograph of two firearms, the account posted, “I’m ready.”
The FBI tip was shared with the Jackson County Sheriff’s Office, which closed the investigation after finding that “the user behind the Discord account that made the threat cannot be substantiated.”
A Discord spokesperson told CNN on Wednesday the platform removed an account “believed to be associated with” Gray in May 2023 for violating Discord’s policy against extremism.

The Venezuela Prosecutor’s Office requested the warrant Monday, accusing Gonzalez of “crimes associated with terrorism.” Gonzalez has failed to respond to three summons regarding its investigation into an opposition website that posted results from the contested vote, it said.
Maduro claims to have won the July 28 vote, but the official results have attracted widespread skepticism from abroad and the opposition has insisted that it won. Shortly after the vote, the opposition published tally sheets on a website indicating their candidate – Gonzalez – had won by a landslide.
CNN has not independently confirmed the data published by the opposition, but experts consulted by CNNE say the data appears to show an opposition win.
In a letter posted on X on Monday, the Prosecutor’s Office said Gonzalez is suspected of “crimes associated with terrorism” including “usurpation of functions, forging a public document, instigation to disobedience of the laws (and) association to commit a crime and conspiracy.”

Gonzalez has denied the accusations against him. The Prosecutor’s Office has previously said it is also investigating opposition leader Maria Corina Machado for the same alleged crimes.
Machado said Monday that the threat of arrest would only help to unite the opposition.
“(The government) have lost all notion of reality. By threatening the president-elect they only manage to unite us more and increase the support of Venezuelans and the world for Edmundo González.”
“Serenity, courage and firmness. We move forward,” she added.
Venezuela’s electoral body, long stacked with regime allies, declared the strongman leader Maduro the winner of the election, but has yet to provide tallies proving his win.
Venezuela’s opposition and several other nations have refused to recognize Maduro’s victory until the release of the full vote tally."
TGUO6GLI6M_BGQGZMXDVRTNC0P,Pennsylvania and Georgia may choose America’s next president,"Analysis by Stephen Collinson, CNN","8 minute read Published 7:00 AM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/04/politics/harris-trump-battleground-states-analysis/,"The destiny of the White House may hang on a deadlocked fight between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris for Georgia and Pennsylvania, two battlegrounds that have been decisive in crowning the last two presidents.
The evolving electoral map is revealed in new CNN/SSRS polls out Wednesday of six swing states that captured the transformation in the race since the vice president replaced President Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee.
The surveys show Harris has vastly improved her party’s chances in November and could open several paths to the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win. But they suggest any stalling of her momentum could be disastrous to her hopes.
Trump, despite weeks of failing to find a coherent anti-Harris message, still has a serious chance nine weeks out of pulling off one of the most stunning political comebacks in US history. Strong showings in a few key states could land him back in the Oval Office.
More broadly, the new polls show that Harris has at least made a strong start on her extraordinary task of turning around an election that looked lost within the space of a few months. But they also reflect Trump’s stunning and enduring strength among millions of Americans in his third presidential election — eight years after he won his first.
In Wisconsin, likely voters back Harris by 50% to 44% for Trump. In Michigan, the vice president is up 48% to 43%. In Arizona, the former president is ahead 49% to 44%. There’s no clear leader in Georgia and Nevada, where it’s 48% Harris to 47% Trump or in Pennsylvania, where they are even at 47%.
The polls represent a snapshot of the current moment after a tumultuous political summer and shouldn’t be seen as a prediction of what will happen in November. But they help explain how the fight for the White House could unfold in the next two months, underscore the strategic decisions facing both campaigns and pinpoint the current strengths and weakness of each candidate. For instance, across six states, Harris now trails Trump by only eight points on average on who is most trusted on the economy — a significantly lower deficit on the issue that matters most to voters than the one suffered by Biden in earlier polls.
The picture of a finely balanced contest is also a reminder of the critical nature of next week’s debate between Harris and Trump, one of the few scheduled events in the final months to November that could again turn the race upside down.
The polling data suggests that Harris is two-thirds of the way to consolidating, at least for now, the critical midwestern “Blue Wall” states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania that have long been the most credible route back to the White House for a Democratic nominee. But the tied race at this point in Pennsylvania suggests that Harris still faces a massive task in putting away a state that Biden won by only 1.2% of the vote four years ago.
Many Democrats had privately conceded that Georgia, a longtime conservative bastion that has been competitive since 2020, was probably lost when Biden was the presumptive nominee. But the arrival of Harris has thrust the Peach State back into the decisive sprint to the White House.
Both candidates have already made multiple visits to Pennsylvania and Georgia especially. Harris and Walz took a two-day bus tour through rural, southern parts of Georgia last week. And Harris was in Pittsburgh on Monday and will return to the Steel City for debate prep later this week.
Trump recently took steps to repair his ties to Georgia’s popular Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, whom he faults for not aiding his attempt to overturn Biden’s win in the state in 2020, and last week was in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, for a rally that exemplified his attraction to voters in former industrial powerhouses hurt by the flight of blue-collar jobs overseas.
The centrality of Pennsylvania and Georgia to the race can be seen when various scenarios are played out across the electoral map. There are tantalizing possibilities for Harris. Assuming each candidate holds all states solidly in their columns, Harris could win the presidency by pairing Wisconsin and Michigan with a Pennsylvania victory and one electoral vote from anywhere else.
But Trump also has a simple route-map back to power. If he wins North Carolina, another swing state not included in these surveys that has gone Republican ever since 2012, he could win a second term just by taking Pennsylvania and Georgia. In this case, it wouldn’t matter how he performs in Wisconsin, Michigan, Nevada or Arizona.
Pennsylvania and Georgia have been critical bellwethers in recent years. In 2020, Biden captured each battleground and won the White House. In 2016, Trump beat Democrat Hillary Clinton in each state on the way to his shock election victory.
This year, Harris needs to drive out strong turnout in the cities like Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Atlanta and Augusta, especially among minority voters. She is also targeting a strong performance among voters in the suburbs of these and other cities. The CNN/SSRS polls show the vice president already has double digit leads among female likely voters in both states, no doubt helped by being a stronger messenger on abortion than Biden, which the data also shows.
Trump is always strong among White male, White non-college educated and rural voters. One of the obvious goals of the Harris campaign — as can be seen by her trips with vice presidential nominee Tim Walz to rural areas — is to try to trim some of the Republican nominee’s margins in districts where he runs most strongly.
One of the most interesting questions at this stage of the race — that is also impossible to answer – is whether Harris’ rise still has some way to go and whether she has not just unified the Democratic base but is also making new inroads among moderate Republicans and independent voters. Another development to watch in coming weeks is whether her apparent strength in Wisconsin and Michigan in the new CNN polls is a harbinger of similar strength to come in Pennsylvania.
But if Harris’ ascent has already peaked, these polls underscore just how close Trump may still be to a second term. A narrow loss by Harris in Pennsylvania that hands the ex-president the White House would cause second guessing among Democrats at her decision to pass on the state’s governor – Josh Shapiro, who won it by nearly 15 percentage points in 2022 – as a running mate.
The polls were conducted between August 23-29, following the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, and are being published at the beginning of an intense two-month derby to Election Day. They represent some of the most comprehensive overviews of the race in the swing states that will decide the election that have yet emerged.
And their publication follows a stunning presidential race that saw Biden fold his reelection campaign less than four months before Election Day and his rival, Trump, who is vying to become only the second president to win non-consecutive White House terms, escape an assassination attempt in one of those vital states: Pennsylvania.
The campaign has moved up several notches in intensity even since Labor Day on Monday, and a key focus of both sides in the coming weeks will be identifying and turning out voters who are not yet committed to their choice.
Across the states surveyed by CNN, an average of 15% of likely voters say they have not firmly decided who they will vote for. This means that if either Harris or Trump can close strongly and carve out a significant advantage among this group, they could lock down the race.
There are some warning signs for both the vice president and the former president in the data.
Harris polls at 85% among Black likely voters in Georgia and at 84% in Pennsylvania. These findings may support claims by the Trump campaign that it has made inroads into a constituency that forms a bedrock of the Democratic coalition. According to exit polls in the 2020 election, Biden won 92% of Black voters in Pennsylvania and 88% in Georgia. One key focus of the Harris campaign and grass roots organizing groups will be to try to elevate those numbers in the next eight weeks and to make sure Black voters get to the polls in big numbers. In both states however, Black registered voters express less motivation to vote than White voters do.
Trump, meanwhile, has spent recent days oscillating in his position on reproductive rights and IVF fertility treatments, keenly aware that his most significant domestic political achievement – the construction of a conservative Supreme Court majority that overturned the nationwide constitutional right to an abortion – has turned into a massive electoral liability. The CNN/SSRS polling bears this out. It finds that Harris has increased Biden’s lead on abortion and reproductive rights across the six states surveyed and that it now stands at an average of 27 percentage points among women.
The current messaging from each side underscores this fraught moment in a bitter race.
Trump’s team put out a memo on Tuesday that pulsated with frustration that Harris’ policy reversals and ties to Biden, an unpopular president, were not already decisive in Trump’s favor. His top advisers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita wrote that their candidate had the true momentum. “Do the Democrats and voters realize this? Or does the mainstream media, in its attempt to manage public opinion and continue the ‘Harris Honeymoon,’ report a version of reality that is at odds with the facts?” they said.
The Harris campaign released its own memo over the weekend seeking to temper euphoria that lifted the vice president at her Chicago convention. Democratic leaders, after all, need their voters to fear a close race and see a Trump return as a realistic probability in order to boost turnout.
“Make no mistake: we head into the final stretch of this race as the clear underdogs,” Harris Campaign Manager Jennifer O’Malley Dillon warned."
TI7H4NG6IZ_DN233ARV7F90F2Y,Retired federal judge and ethics experts want Judge Cannon taken off Trump documents case,"By Tierney Sneed, CNN","3 minute read Updated 8:25 AM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/03/politics/retired-judge-wants-cannon-removed-trump-documents/,"A former federal judge along with a government watchdog group and two top scholars on judicial ethics want an appeals court to reassign the classified documents case against former President Donald Trump to a new judge.
The group is seeking to file an amicus brief with the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals, criticizing the way Judge Aileen Cannon, who dismissed the classified documents prosecution earlier this summer, has handled the criminal case.
They also took issue with Cannon allowing Trump to slow down the federal investigation in 2022 by appointing a special master to review evidence and blocking investigators’ access to documents seized at his Mar-a-Lago estate. The 11th Circuit reversed Cannon’s decisions on this matter.
Retired Judge Nancy Gertner, who was a federal trial judge in Massachusetts; legal ethics scholars Stephen Gillers and James J. Sample, and the government watchdog group known as Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington are seeking to file the brief with the Atlanta-based appeals court that is considering whether Cannon’s dismissal decision should be reversed. Cannon had said in her ruling that the appointment of special counsel Jack Smith violated the Constitution.
It is very rare for appeals courts to reassign a trial judge on a case. Smith notably did not request for Cannon to recuse herself or for the case to be reassigned in his filings. An amicus brief, or “friend of the court” brief, is from someone who is not a party to the case and is merely meant to provide information to the court. It is up to the court how much legal weight — if any at all – is given to an amicus brief.

“Even before she dismissed the case on novel grounds that ignored both statutory authority and Supreme Court precedent, Judge Cannon’s other extraordinary rulings and sluggish case administration had provoked well-founded concerns that she might be biased against the Government’s case and unable to manage that case impartially,” they wrote in the proposed brief, which would need permission from the court to be allowed into the record.
They pointed to Cannon’s slowness to resolve issues in the criminal case that has been mired in delay, as well as her controversial request for lawyers on both sides to file briefs on a hypothetical jury instruction that would seem to virtually guarantee Trump’s acquittal.
“Judge Cannon’s conduct — including her solicitation of legally baseless jury instructions — has repeatedly appeared to cross the line from mere legal error to active judicial intervention and advocacy on behalf of the former president,” the proposed brief says.
Cannon’s critics argued in their proposed amicus brief that “rulings and other conduct create the appearance of an unshakeable conviction that subjecting a former president to ordinary criminal procedures represents an intolerable affront to his dignity.”

The pleading came in a Tuesday court filing, which also indicated he wished to be excused from appearing in person at an upcoming court hearing in the case.

“I, President Donald J. Trump, the above-named defendant … do hereby waive my right to be present at Arraignment and I authorize my attorneys to enter a plea of not guilty on my behalf to each and every count of the superseding indictment,” Trump told the court in a one-page filing that included his bold, black signature. “I further state that I have received a copy of the superseding indictment and reviewed it with my counsel.”
Thursday will mark the first court hearing before Judge Tanya Chutkan since the case was paused for the US Supreme Court to determine the extent of presidential immunity to which Trump is entitled.
Chutkan said later Tuesday that Trump does not have to appear at the hearing Thursday – when the former president’s formal arraignment will occur.
Trump’s attorneys plan to attend the hearing.
Chutkan, of the DC District Court, will have to decide how to proceed with the criminal case over efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, including setting a schedule. She must also decide whether prosecutors can take Trump to trial and be able to call certain witnesses, such as former Vice President Mike Pence.
The new indictment, approved by a grand jury last week, requires Trump to enter a new pleading. While prosecutors cut back some of the allegations against the former president in light of the Supreme Court ruling, Trump faces the same four criminal charges as before.

TPV1FSQJSG_F415HRDJECMI6K0,Another plane linked to Venezuela’s Maduro is under investigation in the Dominican Republic,"By Jessica Hasbun, CNNE","3 minute read Updated 8:31 PM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/04/americas/venezuela-nicolas-maduro-plane-dominican-republic-intl-latam/,"A second plane linked to Venezuelan strongman President Nicolas Maduro is being investigated in the Dominican Republic, a source with knowledge of the situation told CNN.
This second plane, a Dassault Falcon 2000 registration number YV3360, is similar to the aircraft seized by authorities in the United States on Monday, and it appears on a US Treasury list of sanctioned goods belonging to Maduro.
Both planes were sent to Santo Domingo for maintenance in recent months, the source told CNN.
The plane seized by US authorities on Monday had been described by officials as Venezuela’s equivalent to Air Force One and was pictured in previous state visits by Maduro around the world.
It was seized after determining that its acquisition was in violation of US sanctions, among other criminal issues. The US flew the aircraft to Florida on Monday, according to two US officials.
US Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement that “the Justice Department seized an aircraft we allege was illegally purchased for $13 million through a shell company and smuggled out of the United States for use by Nicolás Maduro and his cronies.”
The Venezuelan government described the first Falcon’s seizure as “piracy” in a statement on Monday, and accused Washington of escalating “aggression” toward Maduro’s government following a contested presidential election this July.

The Dominican Republic’s President, Luis Abinader, said the plane seized Monday was not registered under the name of the Venezuelan government but rather under “the name of an individual.”
The country’s Attorney General’s Office received an order last May from a national court to “immobilize” the plane, according to the Dominican Republic’s foreign minister, Roberto Álvarez. The US had requested it be immobilized so they could search it for “evidence and objects linked to fraud activities, smuggling of goods for illicit activities and money laundering,” he said.
Monday’s seizure in the Dominican Republic marked an escalation as the US continues to investigate what it regards as corrupt practices by Venezuela’s government.
“This sends a message all the way up to the top,” one of the US officials told CNN. “Seizing the foreign head of state’s plane is unheard-of for criminal matters. We’re sending a clear message here that no one is above the law, no one is above the reach of US sanctions.”
It also comes as the US recently placed pressure on the Venezuelan government to “immediately” release specific data regarding its presidential election, citing concerns about the credibility of Maduro’s claimed victory in the recent presidential election.
Venezuela’s opposition has published more than 80% of tallies printed and collected from voting machines across the country. Though partial, the documentation appears to show that the opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia actually won the vote, several experts told CNN.

TPVWHUUYXR_J4Q0SKG7EMESCL2,CNN polls across six battlegrounds find Georgia and Pennsylvania are key toss-ups,"By Jennifer Agiesta, Ariel Edwards-Levy and Edward Wu, CNN","11 minute read Updated 8:42 AM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/04/politics/cnn-polls-battleground-states/,"The 2024 presidential campaign’s home stretch kicks off with a mixed outlook across six key battlegrounds, according to new CNN polls conducted by SSRS in each state. Vice President Kamala Harris holds an advantage over former President Donald Trump among likely voters in Wisconsin and Michigan, while Trump has the edge in Arizona. The two split likely voters almost evenly in Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania, the state with the largest electoral vote prize that’s widely seen as up for grabs.
Across each of them, an average of 15% of likely voters say they have not yet firmly decided their choice, suggesting a sizable share of voters could shift their views on the race as attention to the campaign rises and campaign activity, especially in these states, hits a fever pitch in the final nine weeks before Election Day.
Likely voters in Wisconsin break 50% for Harris to 44% for Trump, and in Michigan, it’s 48% Harris to 43% Trump. In Arizona, Trump lands at 49% to Harris’ 44%. In Georgia and Nevada, 48% back Harris to 47% for Trump, and in Pennsylvania, the candidates are tied at 47%.
The polls, conducted after the Democratic National Convention in August, reflect results among likely voters determined through a combination of past vote behavior and current intention to vote.

The findings suggest an Electoral College landscape where Pennsylvania and Georgia are central to each candidate’s path to the White House. President Joe Biden carried all six of these states in 2020, winning Georgia by just under 12,000 votes and Arizona by a little over 10,000 votes. Were Harris to hold Biden’s 2020 wins outside of these six states and carry Wisconsin and Michigan, a win in Pennsylvania plus a single electoral vote from anywhere else would give her the presidency. Should Trump hold North Carolina – a state he carried in 2020 and that is widely considered a battleground in this year’s contest – wins in Georgia and Pennsylvania would put him over the top regardless of what happens in Wisconsin, Michigan or Nevada. In that scenario, even Arizona, where he currently holds a narrow lead, would not be necessary for Trump to win another term as president.
Harris’ emergence as the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee, replacing Biden atop the party’s ticket this summer, has altered some dynamics in the race but left others intact. Economic issues, which posed a notable weak point for Biden, remain the topic most often chosen by voters when asked what matters to their choice for president; an average of 39% of likely voters across states choose the economy as their top issue, with protecting democracy next at an average of 25%. But Harris now trails Trump on trust to handle the economy by relatively smaller margins than Biden did; across the current polls, Trump is more trusted than Harris on the economy by 8 points on average. (In New York Times/Siena College polls of the same six states this spring, the same calculation yielded a 20-point Trump advantage over Biden.) Trump maintains a broad advantage as more trusted to handle immigration, while Harris has built on Biden’s lead as more trusted to handle abortion and reproductive rights, with women across these six states preferring her by an average of 27 percentage points on the issue.
Across nearly all of these states, likely voters are more apt to describe Trump than Harris as having clear policy plans to solve the country’s problems (voters split about evenly on this question in Wisconsin and Michigan), but voters in these swing states largely describe Harris’ views and policies as mainstream and Trump’s as too extreme. About half in each state (between 46% and 51%) say Trump’s views and policies are so extreme that they pose a threat to the country, while around 4 in 10 (between 37% and 42%) say the same about Harris’ positions.
Harris tops Trump across these states in being seen by voters as more apt to care about “people like you” – narrowly so in Arizona and Pennsylvania – and as someone they would be proud to have as president. Voters’ views on who would bring the kind of change the country needs vary state-to-state and are generally closely divided.
Independent voters, whose preferences in the presidential race vary widely state-to-state, are notably likely to say that they could change their minds about the race; roughly a quarter of independent likely voters or more feel that way across states. And they also are more likely than other respondents to say they think neither Harris nor Trump will unite the country rather than divide it (33% on average across states say so), that neither has clear policy plans to solve the country’s problems (31% on average) and that neither cares about people like them (26% on average).
As the sitting vice president, Harris is tied to an unpopular White House: Biden’s approval rating stands in negative territory with likely voters across all six states, with approval around 40% in all but Wisconsin, where it stands at 44%.
Still, Harris currently holds an average of 16% support among likely voters who disapprove of Biden’s job as president. The last time a sitting vice president ran for the White House, in 2000, Al Gore captured just 9% of those who disapproved of President Bill Clinton’s job performance nationwide, according to exit polls.
Both Georgia and Pennsylvania remain thoroughly up for grabs, according to the polls, with tight margins overall and double-digit shares of likely voters – 12% in Georgia and 16% in Pennsylvania – saying they haven’t yet decided on a candidate, or that they might change their minds.
Black voters are a key bloc in both states, particularly in Georgia, and according to these polls, Harris stands at 85% among Black likely voters in Georgia and at 84% in Pennsylvania. In both states, though, Black registered voters express less motivation to vote in this year’s election than White voters do. In Georgia, 61% of Black registered voters say they are extremely motivated to vote compared with 70% among White voters, and in Pennsylvania, just 56% of Black voters say they are deeply motivated to vote compared with 72% of White voters.
Both states see significant gender gaps in presidential preference, with Harris ahead by double-digits among female likely voters in both states while Trump has similarly large leads among male likely voters. Harris widens her margin slightly in both states among suburban women, topping Trump by 16 points with that group in Georgia and 18 points in Pennsylvania.
Harris carries a majority of likely voters younger than 35 in both states, leading 59% to 36% in Pennsylvania, and 54% to 41% in Georgia.
White likely voters without college degrees in both states break broadly for Trump, particularly in Georgia, where roughly 7 in 10 support him. White likely voters who do have four-year college degrees, though, split in opposite directions across the two states. In Pennsylvania, they broadly favor Harris, 59% to 37%, while in Georgia, they are solidly in Trump’s camp, 65% to 32%. That dynamic is similar to the divide seen in 2020 exit polling.
Harris’ narrow leads in Wisconsin and Michigan are largely driven by consolidation of the Democratic base, as well as increased motivation among Democratic and Democratic-leaning likely voters, who are broadly aligned behind Harris now (96% in Michigan and 95% in Wisconsin support her).
CNN’s March 2024 poll in Michigan, fielded after Trump and Biden had secured enough delegates to win their parties’ nominations, found only 75% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning registered voters expressed support for Biden.
In both states, Harris’ support among some key demographics of the Democratic Party’s base resembles that of Biden’s 2020 win. Harris leads Trump among female likely voters (55% to 38% in Wisconsin, 54% to 38% in Michigan), White voters with college degrees (62% to 31% in Wisconsin, 52% to 41% in Michigan), and by 86% to 11% among Black likely voters in Michigan (the sample size for Black likely voters is not large enough to report in Wisconsin).
Younger voters here are less broadly in Harris’ camp than in Georgia, Pennsylvania or Nevada. In Michigan, voters younger than 35 split 43% for Harris and 42% for Trump. In Wisconsin, they break 49% Harris and 42% Trump. Both states were central to the uncommitted movement’s efforts to log protest votes against Biden during the Democratic presidential primary, an effort focused at least in part on younger voters.
The polls suggest enthusiasm among the Democratic base may be a factor in both states. In Michigan, 72% of Democratic-aligned registered voters say they are extremely motivated to vote, up from 58% in March, while the numbers among GOP-aligned voters remained effectively unchanged at about 7 in 10. And among registered voters in Wisconsin, 81% of Democratic-aligned voters and 70% of Republican-aligned voters say they are extremely motivated to vote.
Arizona, where Trump holds a narrow lead overall, stands out in these polls as the one state where Harris appears not to have restored support among several key Democratic groups, notably Latino voters, younger voters and White voters with college degrees. The contrast with Nevada demonstrates the difference.
In Nevada, Latino likely voters break broadly toward Harris, 57% to 37%, while they are more evenly divided in Arizona, 49% Harris to 43% Trump. White voters in both states break toward Trump by double-digit margins (56% to 39% in Arizona, 55% to 41% in Nevada). Harris carries White voters with college degrees in Nevada, 56% to 41%, while that group splits evenly, 47% each, in Arizona.
Younger voters in Arizona break narrowly in Trump’s favor: 48% of likely voters younger than 35 say they support Trump, compared with 42% behind Harris, a result within the margin of sampling error for that subset. In Nevada, though, likely voters in that age group divide 54% to Harris to 39% Trump.
And the gender gap in Arizona appears smaller than in other states, with women splitting 48% Harris to 45% Trump while men divide 55% Trump to 41% Harris. In Nevada, Harris holds a 16-point lead among female likely voters. (Among male likely voters in Nevada, Trump has an 18-point lead, 57% to 39%)
These results – a narrow Trump edge in Arizona and an even race in Nevada – come even as downballot races in the two states suggest a more favorable climate for Democrats. Arizona’s closely contested Senate race stands at 47% for Democrat Ruben Gallego with Republican Kari Lake at 44%, and a ballot measure designed to create a fundamental right to abortion in the state’s constitution holds overwhelming support – 62% say they’d vote in favor of it while 35% say they would oppose it. And in Nevada, incumbent Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen stands at 50% support to Republican Sam Brown’s 40%.
The findings suggest Trump may hold broader appeal in these states than elsewhere in the battlegrounds. He racks up some of his largest advantages as more trusted on handling the economy (up 16 points over Harris in Nevada and 15 points in Arizona, compared with an average 5 point lead across the other four states), immigration (up 17 points in Arizona and 12 points in Nevada, up by an average of 9 points in other states) and crime and safety (up 10 points in Nevada and 9 in Arizona, up by an average of 3 points in other states) in these two states, and is narrowly more likely to be seen as having generally mainstream views and policies here than elsewhere (50% in Arizona and 47% in Nevada see him that way, compared with 45% or less in the other four states).
The surveys show slim support for third-party and independent candidates, but in a close race, even small levels of support for such candidates can be meaningful. Voters were asked to choose among the candidates who were most likely to be included in each state’s ballot at the time the poll began based on candidate filings and existing rulings for who would be named on each ballot.
Independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was included in Michigan where there was no clear path for his name to be removed from the ballot even after he suspended his campaign, and received 4% support among likely voters, but he was not listed in the other states. The Wisconsin Elections Commission rejected a request from Kennedy to remove his name from the ballot while the poll was in the field.
Green Party candidate Jill Stein received 2% support in Arizona, but 1% or less elsewhere, and Libertarian Chase Oliver held 2% support in Wisconsin, but 1% or less in all other states. Independent Cornel West held 1% support in Georgia, but less than that in Wisconsin and was not included in the poll for other states.
Results on Senate races across the five states that have them here show a more favorable climate for Democrats downballot in some key states, but suggest little ticket splitting in others, with the surveys finding some closer contests than other recent public polling. Democrats currently hold the Senate seats up for election this year in Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and retiring independent incumbent Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona caucuses with the Democratic Party.
Democratic incumbents lead in Nevada (Rosen 50% to Brown 40%) and Wisconsin (Sen. Tammy Baldwin at 51% to Republican Eric Hovde’s 45%), and in the open Michigan Senate race, Democrat Elissa Slotkin tops Republican Mike Rogers 47% to 41% in the poll. But the survey finds closer races with no clear leader in Arizona (Gallego 47% to Lake 44%) and Pennsylvania (Sen. Bob Casey and Republican David McCormick each at 46%).
Interviews conducted August 23-29, 2024, online and by telephone with registered voters, including 682 voters in Arizona, 617 in Georgia, 708 in Michigan, 626 in Nevada, 789 in Pennsylvania, and 976 in Wisconsin. Likely voters include all registered voters in the poll weighted for their predicted likelihood of voting in this year’s election."
TT5WDN34H7_KHEGEL01FTSZF05,Biden and Netanyahu at odds again after US president says Israeli PM not doing enough in ceasefire-hostage release talks,"By Kevin Liptak, Nikki Carvajal and Alex Marquardt, CNN","5 minute read Updated 9:17 PM EDT, Mon September 2, 2024",20240902,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/02/politics/biden-netanyahu-ceasefire-hostage-deal/,"President Joe Biden said Monday that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is not doing enough to secure the release of hostages held by Hamas and added he is “close” to presenting a final deal to negotiators working to strike a hostage and ceasefire agreement in Gaza.
The president’s comments came as he was returning to the White House to huddle with American officials who have been working to secure a deal that would pair a release of hostages held in Gaza with a pause in the fighting. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee for president, also attended the meeting before joining Biden for a campaign event in Pittsburgh.
The hostage release efforts gained new urgency over the weekend with the discovery of the bodies of six hostages in a tunnel beneath the southern Gaza city of Rafah, including the Israeli-American citizen Hersh Goldberg-Polin.
The deaths have sparked outrage inside Israel, leading to enormous protests and a nationwide strike Monday. Demonstrators have called on Netanyahu to put aside political ambitions to strike an agreement that would allow hostages to be released.
Asked Monday whether Netanyahu was doing enough to reach an agreement, Biden said simply: “No.”
His one-word answer kept with Biden’s reluctance to criticize Netanyahu in public, but nonetheless reflected deep frustrations inside the White House at how the Israeli leader has handled the conflict and the hostage talks.
A senior Israeli source criticized Biden’s statement, saying: “It is remarkable that President Biden is trying to pressure Prime Minister Netanyahu, who agreed to both the president’s proposal on May 31 and to the American bridging proposal on August 16, and not Hamas’ leader Sinwar, who continues to oppose any deal.”
“The president’s statement is also dangerous because it comes days after Hamas executed 6 hostages, including an American citizen.”
A US official responded to that criticism by saying, “The president has been clear that Hamas is responsible for killing Hersh and the others and Hamas leaders will pay for their crimes. He is also calling for urgency from the Israeli government in securing the release of the missing remaining hostages.”
It’s the latest sign of discord between the two leaders who have a long relationship that at times is contentious and has been worn thin over the last year during Israel’s war in Gaza in response to the October 7 attacks by Hamas.
Biden later deflected questions about the Israeli response to his statement. As the president left for Pittsburgh, CNN’s Arlette Saenz asked him what more he wanted Netanyahu to do.
“We’re in the middle of negotiations,” Biden said.
Asked about Netanyahu’s comments about him, Biden responded: “We’re still in negotiations – not with him, but my colleagues from Qatar and Egypt.”
American officials said the deaths of the six hostages over the weekend would likely apply new pressure on Netanyahu to reach an agreement, though the officials also said it raised questions about how serious Hamas is toward striking a deal.
“We’re very close to that,” Biden said when asked by CNN if he was planning to present a final proposal.
Asked Monday how the new deal being finalized would be different than other failed proposals, Biden responded: “Hope springs eternal.”
As he was arriving back at the White House after the Pittsburgh rally, Biden was asked whether he had plans to speak to the prime minister.
“Eventually,” he responded.
Netanyahu was more vociferous in his complaints about how Hamas is treating the ceasefire talks. He said in a news conference Monday that Israel has already shown “seriousness in the negotiations” and now “Hamas has to make the concessions.”
“On August 19, Secretary (Antony) Blinken said, Israel accepted the US proposal. Now Hamas must do the same. On August 28 – that’s five days ago, five days ago – the deputy CIA director said that ‘Israel shows seriousness in the negotiations. Now, Hamas must show the same seriousness,’” he said. “I want to ask you, what has changed in the last five days? What has changed? One thing – these murderers executed six of our hostages. They shot them in the back of the head. That’s what’s changed.”
“Now, after this, we’re asked to show seriousness? We’re asked to make concessions? What message does this send Hamas? It says, kill more hostages. Murder more hostages. You get more concessions,” Netanyahu argued, adding that international pressure should be directed at Hamas.
“I don’t believe that either President Biden or anyone serious about achieving peace and achieving the release would seriously ask Israel, Israel, to make these concessions. We’ve already made them. Hamas has to make the concessions,” Netanyahu said.
Following the news of the killing of the six hostages in Gaza, officials involved in the mediation of the ceasefire talks have been on the phone discussing ways to push the ceasefire and hostage deal forward, a source familiar with the discussions told CNN.
But then Netanyahu gave his press conference Monday evening, arguing that Israel will never leave the Philadelphi corridor, “and this guy torpedoed everything in one speech,” the source said in an initial reaction.
Mossad director David Barnea also traveled to Doha and met with Qatari Prime Minister Mohammad Abudlrahman Al Thani on Monday.
Lead Hamas negotiator Khalil Al-Hayya told Al Jazeera on Sunday there would be no deal without the Israel Defense Forces withdrawing from the Philadelphi corridor, which runs along the Egypt-Gaza border. Between the hostages and the Israeli military presence in the corridor, the “Philadelphi was more important,” Hayya alleged.
Netanyahu’s recent insistence on staying in Philadelphi represents a change in position, sources familiar with the negotiations said. When Biden announced the framework on May 31 – which he said Israel had agreed to – it envisioned an IDF withdrawal eastward from populated areas. According to a draft published in Israeli media, there was no mention of Philadelphi.
In the weeks that followed, Israel then added remaining in Philadelphi as a condition, and the recent negotiations have discussed what the IDF presence along the border would look like.
A permanent IDF presence in the Philadelphi corridor would also contradict the US position on the future of Gaza. On Blinken’s most recent trip to Israel in August he told reporters that the US will not accept “any long-term occupation of Gaza by Israel.” Administration officials have made clear they expect a full withdrawal by Israel from Gaza as the result of any permanent ceasefire agreement.

TY2OU4BARZ_O08SLHMQCRTYJLP,Suspected Boko Haram militants kill at least 37 in Nigeria attack,Story by Reuters,"2 minute read Published 6:09 AM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/04/africa/boko-haram-nigeria-attack-intl/,"Suspected Boko Haram Islamist militants roared into a northeastern Nigerian village on motorcycles, opened fire on a market and set shops and homes ablaze, killing at least 37 people, according to a military official.
Residents said the death toll could be even higher, with villagers still missing and feared dead after fighters chased them into the bush.
The attack took place on Sunday afternoon in Yobe, one of three states at the frontline of an insurgency that has lasted 15 years. Thousands of Nigerians have been killed and more than 2 million displaced.
Yobe police spokesperson Dungus Abdulkarim said the attack in Yobe’s Mafa village was apparent retaliation for the killing of two suspected Boko Haram fighters by local vigilantes.

After shooting at the market and torching buildings, the militants chased other residents into the bush and shot them, Abdulkarim added.
“The terrorists killed many people, but we are yet to ascertain the actual number of casualties,” Abdulkarim said.
A military official who accompanied the army’s commanding officer for Yobe to Mafa on Monday evening said the route to the village had been rigged with explosives, which troops managed to defuse.
“We recovered 37 corpses and brought them to Babangida General Hospital,” said the official, who declined to be identified because he is not authorized to speak to the media.
Modu Mohammed, a resident, said several more residents were missing and estimated the death toll at over 100. He said some corpses were still in the bush."

Demonstrations could be seen in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Caesarea and other sites across the country, fueled by the killing in Gaza of six hostages, whose bodies were retrieved by Israeli soldiers this weekend.
Several gatherings targeted the homes of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, with protesters lighting fires and chanting: “You are the leader - you are guilty!” near one of Netanyahu’s private residences in Caesarea. In Tel Aviv, protesters outside the US Embassy chanted “Shame!” late into the evening, video showed.

Netanyahu has been accused of stalling efforts for a deal by some hostage families and their supporters. More than 100 hostages, including 35 believed to be dead, are still being held in Gaza – the vast majority of them taken during Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel, when some 1,200 people were killed and more than 200 taken captive
The scenes outside the Israeli leader’s homes culminated a day of anger that brought much of the country to a halt, following a call by the country’s largest labor union, known as Histadrut, to shut down the “entire” economy. Flights in and out of Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion International Airport were also stopped for two hours.
But in a press conference Monday evening, the Israeli leader struck a note of defiance, batting away criticisms – including from US President Joe Biden – that he is not doing enough to secure a deal. He asked for “forgiveness” from the families of the six hostages for failing to bring them back alive, but insisted it should be Hamas that “has to make the concessions.”
He also vowed to retaliate and extract a “heavy price” from the militant group that controls Gaza, for the killing of the six hostages, whose autopsies showed they were shot at short range on Thursday or Friday morning.
Hamas meanwhile escalated its own threats on Monday, with a public warning that more hostages held in Gaza would return “inside coffins” if Israel attempts to free them militarily.
A statement released by the militant group said that its fighters guarding prisoners held in the Palestinian enclave had received “new instructions” on how to deal with hostages if Israeli forces get close, and released an illustrated poster apparently showing hostages threatened with a gun.
Monday saw the largest general strike to have taken place in Israel since March 2023, when there was a similar mass walkout over Netanyahu’s controversial attempts to overhaul the country’s judiciary.
According to union Histadrut, hundreds of thousands of Israelis joined the protests Monday, just a day after half a million took to the streets on Sunday for what protest organizers said was one of the biggest nationwide protests since the outbreak of Israel’s war on Hamas. Israeli police said they had seven demonstrators in Tel Aviv for “violating public order and disrupting traffic.”
Netanyahu’s defiant stance following the discovery of the six hostage bodies has thrown further doubt on the negotiations for a ceasefire-for-hostages deal.
Even before the killing of the six hostages, the talks had become bogged down, with one key disagreement centering on control of a border area known as the Philadelphi corridor.
Netanyahu says control of the 14-kilometer (8.7-mile) strip of land along Gaza’s border with Egypt is needed to prevent Hamas from resuming arms smuggling through tunnels underneath it. However, the deployment of Israeli troops along the corridor has been a major point of contention between Israel and Hamas in the ceasefire talks, with Hamas saying Israeli troops must withdraw from the border zone.
“Hamas doesn’t want us to be there and that’s why I insist on being there,” the Israeli leader said on Monday.
During a cabinet meeting over the weekend, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant had lambasted the Israeli government for what he said was prioritizing control of the corridor over a deal to free hostages, calling it a “moral disgrace.”
The relative of one of the hostages who was shot dead in southern Gaza also blamed Netanyahu and his stance on the corridor for their deaths. Gil Dickmann, the cousin of Carmel Gat, told CNN that the Israeli government “cold-bloodedly” crossed a “red line” by prioritizing the corridor over the lives of the hostages.
“We know that Hamas has agreed to a deal at some point, and Israel was the one putting on more and more terms and actually postponing the deal,” Dickmann said on Monday. “Right now, we know the decisions that our Prime Minister Netanyahu has made it impossible for Carmel and other hostages to return and put their lives in great danger, and that’s what killed them.”
But on Monday, even as he acknowledged dissent within his cabinet, Netanyahu doubled down.
“We’re not going to withdraw from the Philadelphi corridor,” Netanyahu told a press conference on Monday evening. “The axis of evil needs the Philadelphi corridor. We need to have it under our control,” he said.
Disagreements over the corridor are only one of the splits within the cabinet over the conduct of the war that have become increasingly public and rancorous in recent months, reflecting deep divisions at the top of Israel’s government.
Just on Monday, Israel’s far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said he was using his power to prevent a “reckless deal” and ensure “that there will be no negotiations at all.”
He was speaking to members of Gvura, a right-wing organization representing the families of Israeli soldiers killed in Gaza.
But American officials described new urgency in reaching a ceasefire-for-hostages deal. US national security adviser Jake Sullivan said while meeting the families of Americans held hostage that “the next few days will be critical” in the push to free those still held by Hamas.
Alongside the strikes, the funeral of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, one of the six hostages found dead, was held in Jerusalem on Monday. Speaking at the ceremony, Jon Goldberg-Polin said he hoped his son’s death would be “the fuel that will bring home the remaining 101 hostages.”
“Hersh, we failed you. We all failed you. You would not have failed you. You would have pushed harder for justice,” he said. “You would have worked to understand the other, to bridge differences.”
“The 23 years of life that we had with you were a blessing. We now will work to make your legacy a similar blessing,” Goldberg-Polin said. “You were a really great guy. I love you.”
As well as an impact on flights, some Israeli municipalities said they joined the strike, including Tel Aviv and Haifa, according to a list from the Histadrut outlining who joined the action as well as statements from some of the cities.
The list also includes government ministries that impact a wide range of public services, the document shows, including parts of the Prime Minister’s Office, the Interior Ministry, and others. CNN has reached out to the Prime Minister’s Office for comment.
Hospitals and healthcare facilities worked on a weekend schedule and on an emergency basis, according to the statement.
The country’s teachers’ union said it would not join the strike, according to a statement from the union, though support staff at schools did.
However, Israel’s biggest universities joined the strike, including the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv University.

The students were waiting to enter the gate of a middle school in Tai’an city in Shandong province when the bus slammed into them after 7 a.m., state news agency Xinhua reported.
The bus, specially customized for transporting students, “lost control” when it drove into an intersection, the public security bureau in Dongping county said in a statement.
Five students and six parents were killed, it said. One of the injured was in critical condition while the others were stable, according to police.
The bus driver has been placed in police custody and the cause of the accident is being investigated, the statement said.
China has faced a spate of car-ramming and stabbing attacks targeting schoolchildren in recent years, as well as deadly road traffic accidents involving school buses.
In March, a car careened into a group of pupils in Dezhou, another city in Shandong, killing two people and leaving six others severely injured, state media reported at the time.
Later in the month, a bus carrying students collided with a dump truck in the city of Nantong in the eastern province of Jiangsu, killing one person and injuring eight others.
Last year, six people were killed and one injured in an early morning stabbing incident outside a kindergarten in southern Guangdong province. And a 2022 stabbing, also at a kindergarten, killed three and injured six in eastern Jiangxi province."
UBSH20VKJH_VKAZ8H2SW87UADL,"US official lays out new details on Gaza ceasefire talks, says Netanyahu comments on Philadelphi Corridor not constructive","By Kevin Liptak, Alex Marquardt and Jennifer Hansler, CNN","5 minute read Updated 7:18 AM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/04/politics/gaza-ceasefire-talks-netanyahu-philadelphi-corridor/,"A prospective hostage and ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas is 90% completed, but disputes remain over the exchange of prisoners for hostages and the redeployment of Israeli forces in Gaza, according to a senior US administration official and others familiar with the matter.
American officials, with Qatar and Egypt, have for months worked to broker a deal to bring an end to the nearly year-long conflict. Those negotiations have taken on new urgency following the killings of six hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, and American officials have said they are preparing to present a “final” offer to the parties soon.
It’s not the first time over the past several months that US negotiators have described the talks as entering their end stage, only for hopes to be dashed. That’s a reality US officials have acknowledged in recent days.
The painstaking negotiations have prompted the families of the remaining Americans held by Hamas to press the White House to explore a separate agreement with Hamas that would secure the release of their relatives. So far, US officials have said they are focused only on the larger deal.
A senior Biden administration on Wednesday offered one of the most detailed looks yet at key elements of the negotiations, which spokespeople for the US government said they would not negotiate in public. The official offered the previously unreported details after repeated public statements by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu casting doubt on his potential willingness to accept a deal, despite claims by the US that he had agreed to a “bridging proposal.”
The agreement itself makes no mention of the length of the Egypt-Gaza border known as the Philadelphi Corridor, the official told reporters on a call on Wednesday. Netanyahu has held two news conferences this week to argue that maintaining permanent control of the corridor is vital to Israeli security.
“The first war goal was to destroy Hamas’ military and governing capabilities. The second was to free our hostages, and the third was to ensure that Gaza never again poses a threat to Israel. And all three of those goals – all three of them – go through Israel’s control of the Philadelphi corridor,” Netanyahu said Wednesday at a news conference for foreign press.
That emphasis on Philadelphi in Netanyahu’s recent public statements hasn’t been constructive, the official said.
“In my view, the less that’s said about particular issues, the better,” the official said, adding: “Staking out concrete positions in the middle of a negotiation isn’t always particularly helpful.”
In the agreement being discussed for the first phase of a deal, Israel Defense Forces are supposed to withdraw from “densely populated areas,” the official said. Israel argues that the border isn’t one and is vital to preventing weapons smuggling into Gaza.
In the second phase, the IDF is supposed to withdraw entirely from Gaza.
The official said Hamas’s recent killing of six hostages had “colored” the ongoing negotiations and thrown into question Hamas’s willingness to reach a deal.
Hamas said this week that militants guarding Israeli hostages in the buildings and tunnels of Gaza had “new instructions” to kill them if Israeli troops closed in.
Still, the talks remain ongoing on finalizing the 18-paragraph proposal that American officials believe is the best chance of securing the hostages’ release.
Of the 18 paragraphs, all but four are finished and agreed to, the official said.
“We still see this deal, this very complex but necessary arrangement, as really the most viable, perhaps the only viable, option for saving the lives of the hostages, stopping the war, bringing immediate release to Gazans, and also making sure we fully account for Israel’s security,” the official said.
It’s essentially down to the prisoner exchange and the deployment of Israeli forces, the official said.
The deal on the table currently includes the release in the first phase of some 800 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, including some serving life sentences, the official said. They would be released for the remaining female, elderly and wounded or sick hostages, which was believed to be around 30.
Yet Hamas has proved to be a frustrating negotiating partner of this issue, the official said.
“There was some progress on last week but is difficult and requires Hamas to engage on it. Otherwise you just can’t move forward,” the official said.
Frustrated by the progress of the talks, some families of Americans still held hostage by Hamas have asked the Biden administration to look into a deal that would go around Israel to secure their loved ones’ release. US national security adviser Jake Sullivan met with the families virtually over the weekend.
While not ruling out such a possibility, US officials have stressed this week that the broader deal is the best, and potentially only, viable option to secure the hostages’ release.
“We are working on a proposal that would release all the hostages, including the American hostages, and that is the proposal that we’ve been talking about in the region last week, and it was the same proposal that the president met with his team over the weekend to discuss. That is what we’re working on,” White House national security spokesman John Kirby said on Tuesday.
The broader deal being discussed carries a significant aid component that would be launched immediately once the first phase goes into effect.
As part of the deal, 600 aid trucks a day would be allowed into Gaza, including 50 trucks of fuel. Equipment to clear rubble, supplies to support internally displaced Gazans and provisions for rehabilitating infrastructure would also be included in the first phase of the three-phase agreement.
Although the negotiators are working to close the remaining gaps, it is unclear when the in-person negotiations will resume. The latest round wrapped up last week. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said earlier Wednesday, “We want to get this proposal developed as soon as possible and get it over to Israel and Hamas and then try to get a final agreement.”

UJMJS3R9HM_5T5BLTTHOFJEAKW,SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket cleared to fly again with two high-profile missions ahead,"By Jackie Wattles, CNN","3 minute read Updated 2:14 PM EDT, Sat August 31, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/08/30/science/space-x-falcon-9-rocket-faa-clearance/,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.
The world’s most frequently launched rocket — the SpaceX Falcon 9 — is cleared to fly again, federal regulators announced Friday evening, putting the vehicle back on track for two high-profile human spaceflight missions.
The Federal Aviation Administration, which licenses commercial rocket launches, grounded SpaceX’s rocket on August 28, after part of a Falcon 9 rocket booster exploded while attempting to land. Just two days later, the agency said it has cleared the rocket to return to flight.
“The SpaceX Falcon 9 vehicle may return to flight operations while the overall investigation of the anomaly during (Wednesday’s) mission remains open, provided all other license requirements are met,” the agency said in an emailed statement. “SpaceX made the return to flight request on Aug. 29 and the FAA gave approval on Aug. 30.”
Falcon 9’s clearance comes as SpaceX has two pivotal missions on its manifest. The company is slated to launch a mission called Polaris Dawn that will carry a crew of civilian space travelers on an ambitious journey to attempt the first commercial spacewalk. The launch has already been delayed due to a ground systems issue and forecasts of inclement weather.
And as soon as late September, SpaceX is set to launch two NASA astronauts to the International Space Station on Crew-9, a mission that — after a monthslong rotation — aims to ultimately bring home Boeing Starliner’s test flight crew in 2025.
NASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore have been in limbo on the orbiting laboratory since their Starliner flight in early June.
Failed Falcon 9 booster landing attempts — such as the one that occurred on Wednesday — do not affect the overall success of a SpaceX mission. The company attempts the maneuver solely so it can refurbish and reuse the rocket boosters, a practice that brings down the cost of each flight, according to SpaceX.
About a decade ago, SpaceX routinely tried and failed to land its boosters after flight. The company even shared a gag reel of the explosions in 2017.
In recent years, however, Falcon 9 boosters routinely have found their footing upon return to Earth.
The Falcon 9 booster that exploded August 28 had been refurbished and flown 22 times before it crash-landed. The mission it launched the day of the mishap, however, was ultimately successful, delivering a batch of internet-beaming Starlink satellites into orbit.
But that explosion marked the second time in two months that an anomaly prompted the FAA to open an investigation into the Falcon 9, which also has a history of hundreds of flights that have gone off entirely without issue.
In July, however, as a Falcon 9 was delivering another set of Starlink satellites into orbit, the upper stage of the rocket — which is distinct from the bottommost booster — failed abruptly mid-flight.
The satellites did not enter their intended orbit, and the overall mission was a failure.
SpaceX later revealed that an oxygen leak occurred while the second stage of the rocket was in flight. (Liquid oxygen, or LOX, is a commonly used as an oxidizer or propellant for rockets.) The leak led to what SpaceX CEO Elon Musk described at one point as an “RUD” — or “rapid unscheduled disassembly,” a phrase the company typically uses to refer to an explosion.
Within about two weeks of that explosion, the FAA determined there were “no public safety issues” involved and permitted SpaceX’s Falcon 9 to return to flight. Nevertheless, the FAA’s investigation into the mishap is still ongoing, the agency told CNN on Friday. That review is not related to the probe into the failed August 28 booster landing, meaning two investigations into separate Falcon 9 incidents are underway."
UPYF2YDL5L_NM2SRLEBQA21IXJ,Michel Barnier named as new French prime minister,"By Dalal Mawad, Stephanie Halasz, Sophie Tanno and Emmanuel Miculita, CNN","4 minute read Updated 2:29 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/05/europe/france-prime-minister-michel-barnier-intl/,"Michel Barnier, the EU’s former chief Brexit negotiator, has become France’s new prime minister, the French president’s office says, ending two months of stalemate following inconclusive parliamentary elections.
In a statement on Thursday, the Élysée Palace said: “The President of the Republic has appointed Michel Barnier as Prime Minister. He has to form a united government to serve the country and the French people.”
The statement added that Barnier’s appointment comes after “an unprecedented cycle of consultations” in order to ensure a stable government.
Barnier, 73, a staunch Europhile, is a member of the Republicans party which represents the traditional right. He is best known on the international stage for his role in mediating the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union.
A 40-year veteran of French and European politics, Barnier has held various ministerial positions in France, including roles as foreign, agriculture and environment ministers. He served twice as a European commissioner as well as an adviser to President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen. In 2021, Barnier announced his bid for presidential elections but failed to garner enough support within his party.
Macron accepted the resignation of former Prime Minister Gabriel Attal and his government in July, after his centrist Ensemble alliance was defeated in the second round of France’s snap parliamentary election. The president has since faced calls from across the political divide to name a new PM. Last week, Macron told journalists during a trip to Serbia he was “making all the necessary efforts” to finalize a name.
“I will have the opportunity in a few days, in just a few weeks, to state the major legislative priorities and proposals on behalf of the new government before parliament. It will be a question of responding, as much as we can, to the challenges, to the anger, as you mentioned, to the suffering, to the feeling of abandonment, of injustice that runs through our cities, our neighborhoods and our countryside far too much,” Barnier said, speaking alongside Attal during the transfer of power at Hotel Matignon, the prime minister’s office in Paris.
Surrounded by his family, staff members and several lawmakers, Attal congratulated Barnier.
“The French know you. They know that you are a great local elected official,” said Attal, praising Barnier’s “almost unmatched experience of serving the state in various international and European functions.”
But he did not hide his frustration that his tenure came to such an abrupt end.
“Eight months is too short,” Attal said, warning that the country’s politics is suffering, “but recovery is possible.”
Barnier’s prospects for forming a stable government are unclear. Currently, France’s far-right National Rally (RN) is one of the largest parties in parliament following the election in early July. It has previously suggested it could be open to working with Barnier and would not immediately veto him.
Still, RN politician Laurent Jacobelli spoke disparagingly of Barnier, telling French television network TF1: “They are taking out of mothballs those who have governed France for 40 years.”
The leaders of France’s main far-right and far-left political parties reacted to the appointment of Barnier following Thursday’s announcement, with the far left condemning the decision.
Jordan Bardella, president of the far-right National Rally party, said on social media that his party will “judge” Barnier based on his inaugural “general policy speech, his budgetary decisions and his actions.”
Bardella’s party colleague Marine Le Pen also stressed in televised remarks that the party “will not participate in any government whatsoever” until after they have heard Barnier’s speech laying out his policy plans.
Le Pen did go on to commend Barnier on one level, describing the veteran politician as “someone who is respectful of the different political forces” and “capable” of addressing her party.
Meanwhile, Jean-Luc Melenchon of the far-left France Unbowed party delivered a stinging rebuke of President Macron, accusing him of “stealing” the parliamentary elections held in July.
“The president has just officially denied the results of the legislative elections that he himself had called for. He (Barnier) is a member, among others, of a party which was last in the legislative election. The election was therefore stolen from the French people,” Melenchon remarked in a televised speech.
The left-wing leader called on French people to protests against Barnier’s appointment from this Saturday.
Barnier served as the chief negotiator during the UK’s exit from the European Union. The lengthy talks between London and Brussels ran from 2016 to 2021 and he is known among Brexiteers in the UK for driving a hard bargain.
Born in January 1951 in a suburb of the Alpine city of Grenoble, Barnier was first elected to parliament at the age of 27."
UXL6OKGCOP_FKGFGLFVF4UHF48,White House condemns Tucker Carlson’s ‘Nazi propaganda’ interview as ‘disgusting and sadistic insult’,"By Brian Stelter, CNN","4 minute read Updated 5:54 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/05/media/white-house-condemns-tucker-carlson-nazi-propaganda-interview/,"The Biden administration is denouncing Tucker Carlson after the far-right personality hosted a guest on his show this week who suggested the Holocaust happened by accident, calling the interview “a disgusting and sadistic insult to all Americans.”
During Carlson’s two-hour sit-down with Darryl Cooper, a podcaster whom he said “may be the best and most honest popular historian in the United States,” Cooper claimed that Nazi Germany’s mass murder of Jews was an unintended consequence – something akin to poor planning instead of the methodical extermination that it actually was.
British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, Cooper claimed, was the “chief villain of the Second World War” and “primarily responsible for that war becoming what it did, becoming something other than an invasion of Poland.”
Related video Tucker Carlson says women fighting wars is a kind of ‘slavery’. Keilar rolls the tape
Carlson’s platforming of Cooper has been widely criticized in recent days, including by some right-wing figures who have defended Carlson in the past. Elon Musk, who promoted the interview on his social media platform, X, calling it “Very interesting. Worth watching,” later deleted his post.
On Thursday the White House added its weight to the matter.
In a statement first shared with CNN, senior deputy press secretary Andrew Bates said “giving a microphone to a Holocaust denier who spreads Nazi propaganda is a disgusting and sadistic insult to all Americans, to the memory of the over 6 million Jews who were genocidally murdered by Adolf Hitler, to the service of the millions of Americans who fought to defeat Nazism, and to every subsequent victim of Antisemitism.”
The administration’s statement specifically refuted Cooper’s claim to Carlson that Churchill was the “chief villain” of World War II.
“Hitler was one of the most evil figures in human history and the ‘chief villain’ of World War II, full stop,” Bates wrote. “The Biden-Harris Administration believes that trafficking in this moral rot is unacceptable at any time, let alone less than one year after the deadliest massacre perpetrated against the Jewish people since the Holocaust and at a time when the cancer of Antisemitism is growing all over the world.”
Reached for comment on Thursday, Carlson sharply criticized the White House.
“The fact that these lunatics have used the Churchill myth to bring our country closer to nuclear war than at any moment in history disgusts me, and should terrify every American,” he said in a text message to CNN. “They’re warmonger freaks. They don’t get the moral high ground.”
But numerous columnists have pointed out inaccuracies in Cooper’s remarks, including his assertion that the Nazis “went in with no plan” for housing millions of prisoners of war “and just threw these people into camps, and millions of people ended up dead there.”

Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, denounced Carlson’s interview with Cooper as “truly revolting.”
“The Nazis’ extensive network of concentration, forced labor, and death camps was part of Hitler’s deliberate plan to exterminate the Jewish people. Inmates didn’t just ‘end up dead’ and they did not ‘surrender,’” he said Wednesday.
In the year and a half since Carlson was fired by Fox News, the former primetime host turned internet vlogger has stoked controversy and garnered embarrassment through his web videos and speaking appearances. On Musk’s X and on his subscription video website, Carlson has interviewed radical figures including Alex Jones and others, offering a big platform to fringe voices and seemingly delighting in the outrage that ensues.
Despite the condemnation, Carlson has continued to be embraced by the Republican Party, which gave him a prime time speaking slot at last month’s party convention in Milwaukee.
Carlson is also undertaking a live speaking tour this fall with events across the country. Donald Trump’s vice presidential nominee, JD Vance, is scheduled to appear with Carlson at a Sept. 21 event in Hershey, Pennsylvania, a person familiar with the plans told CNN.
Several conservative columnists have raised questions about whether Vance will move forward with the appearance in light of the Cooper controversy. In a statement, the Vance campaign sought to distance the candidate from the interview.
“Senator Vance doesn’t believe in guilt-by-association cancel culture but he obviously does not share the views of the guest interviewed by Tucker Carlson,” Vance campaign spokesperson William Martin told CNN in a statement.

UYEDBSFTPB_FZ3EX4PEWJV40GX,The Murdoch family is secretly battling over succession. News outlets are asking a court to make it public,"By Hadas Gold, CNN","2 minute read Published 9:45 PM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/04/media/rupert-murdoch-lachlan-succession-court-news-outlets/,"A coalition of media organizations, including CNN, has petitioned a Nevada court to open up the secret proceedings surrounding a legal battle over the future of billionaire Rupert Murdoch’s media empire.
The New York Times, Associated Press, National Public Radio, The Washington Post, Reuters and CNN filed a motion Wednesday in the Second Judicial District Court in Nevada to make public the proceedings, objecting to the case being so extensively sealed that it doesn’t even appear on any court schedule or docket.
The Murdoch family, famous for helming one of the world’s most influential media empires that includes Fox News, The Wall Street Journal and outlets in Australia and the UK, is locked in a secret court battle over succession and control of the future of the family business, according to a New York Times report published in July citing sealed court documents.
According to the report, Murdoch, the 93-year-old patriarch, filed a petition late last year to amend the irrevocable family trust that would have given equal voting shares to Murdoch’s eldest four children. Instead, Murdoch wanted to grant exclusive control to his eldest son and chosen successor Lachlan, according to The Times.
Lachlan, who is more politically aligned with his father’s conservative views than his siblings, took over as chairman of Fox Corporation and News Corporation last September. Citing the court documents, which CNN has not independently seen, the Times reported that Murdoch felt handing Lachlan control of the media businesses he founded would better protect their value following his death by maintaining its right-wing editorial bent.
But the entire process has been completely sealed in Nevada, with even the existence of the proceedings kept in secret.
“Nevada’s courts are accountable to the public, and the public is entitled to know whether the trust at issue is being administered in accordance with the law,” the filing stated. “Certainly, an entire matter cannot be sealed such that its very existence is not a public record, even if all parties to the litigation agree. Rather, the court must apply the presumption of access and make specific findings to underpin any sealing.”
The filing argued that completely sealing the proceedings “meets neither the substantive nor procedural requirements imposed by the constitutional right of access,” and any concerns over privacy could be met with redactions.
According to the Times, the trust only allows changes that are done in good faith with the purpose of benefiting all heirs. A trial to decide whether Murdoch is acting in good faith is expected to begin in September."
V7I9ILXF6M_3BX3S7LSQGF5TD7,Mystery of ‘Pinnacle Man’ found frozen in a cave solved after nearly five decades,"By Graham Hurley, CNN","2 minute read Published 9:07 AM EDT, Sun September 1, 2024",20240901,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/01/us/pinnacle-man-identified-five-decades/,"A man found frozen in a Pennsylvania cave in 1977 has finally been identified, closing the book on a nearly 50-year-long mystery.
The Berks County Coroner’s Office identified the remains of the missing man as Nicholas Paul Grubb, 27, from Fort Washington, Pennsylvania.
Surprisingly, advanced technology played no role in identifying the “Pinnacle Man,” a moniker inspired by the peak in the Appalachian Mountains near where Grubb was found.
Instead, Berks County Coroner John Fielding told reporters at a Tuesday news conference that a Pennsylvania State Police detective discovered the missing link to the cold case the old-fashioned way, by digging through files.
On January 16, 1977, hikers found a man’s frozen body in a cave just below the Pinnacle, in Albany Township, the Berks County Coroner said at the news conference.

During the autopsy he was unable to be identified based on his appearance, clothing or belongings, according to George Holmes, chief deputy coroner of Berks County. The cause of death, according to Holmes, was determined to be a drug-induced overdose. There were no signs of trauma to Grubb’s body suggesting foul play, the coroner’s office said.
Dental records and fingerprints were collected from the man’s body during his autopsy, according to Holmes, who added that the fingerprints were misplaced.
More than 42 years passed before authorities revisited the cold case, according to CNN affiliate WFMZ, which reported Grubb’s body was exhumed in 2019 after dental records linked him to two missing person cases in Florida and Illinois.
Berks County forensic experts performed an exam in 2019, and DNA samples were taken to update his record in the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System, or NamUs. But they did not match the two missing person cases, the coroner’s office said.

Fast-forward to early August, when there was a major break in the cold case. Ian Keck of the Pennsylvania State Police found the lost fingerprint card from Grubb’s 1977 autopsy.
Keck submitted the fingerprint card to NamUs on August 12, according to Holmes, and within an hour an FBI fingerprint expert matched the Pinnacle Man’s fingerprints to Grubb’s.
One of Grubb’s family members was notified by the Berks County Coroner’s Office, who confirmed Grubb’s identity. The family member asked the office to place his remains in the family plot.
“This identification brings a long awaited resolution to his family, who have been notified and expressed their deep appreciation for the collective efforts that made it possible. It is moments like these that remind us of the importance of our work to provide answers, to bring closure and to give the unidentified a name and a story,” Fielding said."
VASTT0J7R3_N99IHV3GPHS3HIN,What we know about the couple killed at a nudist ranch in California,"By Nicole Chavez, CNN","4 minute read Updated 4:57 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/05/us/what-we-know-nudist-ranch-missing-couple/,"A husband and wife who settled at a nudist ranch nestled in a remote California canyon had been missing for days when a 911 call steered police to the house next door.
Their neighbor, Michael Royce Sparks, 62, has been charged with two counts of murder after police said he admitted to killing two people and human remains were found at his home. Authorities have confirmed the victims were the missing couple – Daniel Menard, 79, and his wife, Stephanie Menard, 73.
Since his arrest, Sparks has remained in custody and is expected to appear in court later this week. CNN has been unable to identify an attorney for Sparks or locate family members.
Redlands Police Chief Rachel Tolber said Tuesday she had never seen “this type of case” and it was “certainly concerning.”
As authorities search for a motive, here’s what we know about their deaths and the investigation so far:
The Menards lived in the Olive Dell Ranch resort in Southern California’s San Bernardino County, about 65 miles east of Los Angeles near the cities of Redlands and Colton. The 100-acre property has RVs and mobile homes where residents have lived for years. Others have visited for short-term stays, including during the resort’s annual 5k run.
Irene Engkraf, a neighbor of the Menards, told reporters the couple enjoyed playing poker, gathering with friends for karaoke and attending Bible study and church service on weekends.

“It felt so odd not having Stephanie sitting right next to me (at church) but I know God is with them, he’s with them wherever they are, and I can see them holding each other’s hands,” Engkraf said.
The couple was last seen at the home on August 24. The next day, Engkraf said she became worried when the Menards didn’t attend Sunday church service as usual. Their dog, a white Shih Tzu named Cuddles, was also missing.
She first saw the Menards’ car sitting “abandoned” down the road from their home, and later entered the couple’s home using a spare key but found no signs of them. Stephanie’s purse and both of the Menards’ phones were there and their bed was empty, Engkraf said.
Neighbor Tammie Wilkerson told CNN affiliate KCAL the Menards were a loving couple who took care of each other.
“Stephanie was a bit of a spit fire. She told you what she thought. She didn’t have any problem doing that and she took care of Dan so well,” Wilkerson said.
It wasn’t until several days had passed following the Menards’ disappearance that police received a tip from Sparks’ family, which prompted his arrest and a days-long search for evidence at his home.
A family member called 911 saying Sparks was involved in the Menards’ disappearance, adding he “had admitted to killing two people and was threatening suicide,” Tolber, the police chief, said Tuesday.

“I believe that there may have been other people that were texted, but the initial call that started our focus on him was from the family,” Tolber said.
Officers arrived at Sparks’ mobile home and found him hiding inside a 5-foot-deep concrete space under the home. San Bernardino County District Attorney Jason Anderson described the space as similar to a “homemade basement” underneath the home.
Before police could arrest Spar﻿ks, they had “lengthy negotiations” with him because he was armed and barricaded, Redlands Police Department spokesperson Carl Baker said Friday. Sparks attempted to shoot himself but his weapon misfired, police said.
Engkraf, the neighbor who reported the Menards as missing, described Sparks as a “loner” who “didn’t socialize so much.”
After Sparks’ arrest last week, authorities searched his home and found human remains, police said. The San Bernardino County Sheriff-Coroner Department confirmed Thursday the remains were those of the Menards.
Their cause and manner of death has not been determined, a spokesperson for the coroner’s office told CNN.
Police do not have a reason to believe there are other victims, Tolber said on Tuesday.
The search took days because of the state of the property, its potential collapse and the need to remove debris with heavy equipment, police said.
The Menards’ dog was not found during the search, police said.
Wilkerson, their neighbor, called the Menards “very sweet people” and said “there’s no way” they could have walked away from their car.
“There’s not a mean bone in their body at all, which makes this very confusing,” Wilkerson said.
While authorities have not shared details about a potential motive – other than that it did not appear to be planned – neighbors discussed with reporters an ongoing feud between Sparks and the Menards.
Wilkerson told CNN affiliate KABC she was aware there was tension.
“When I first moved here, he told me how much he hated them, and he hated Dan specifically because Dan would cut the tree … trim the tree down,” she said."
VBPM5NQZN5_32L6SXP85EGC16I,"Grief and fury on Israel’s streets, as hostage killings pile pressure on Netanyahu to secure ceasefire deal","By Lauren Izso, Tamar Michaelis, Tara John, Michael Rios and Eugenia Yosef, CNN","6 minute read Updated 2:39 AM EDT, Mon September 2, 2024",20240902,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/01/middleeast/israel-hostage-protests-strike-netanyahu-intl-latam/,"From bustling Tel Aviv to the southern Israeli city of Eilat, tens of thousands of Israelis took to the streets in one of the biggest nationwide protests since the outbreak of Israel’s war on Hamas as they called on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to secure a ceasefire-for-hostages deal.
Anger at Netanyahu – who has been accused of stalling efforts for a deal by some hostage families and their supporters – reached a boiling point Sunday as protesters responded in fury to the news that another six captives had been found killed in Gaza. Israel’s largest labor union called for a general strike on Monday and threatened to shut down the “entire Israeli economy.”
The extent of the strike early Monday was not yet clear but supporters have vowed a national response.
Three of the six hostages found dead, including Israeli-American Hersh Goldberg-Polin, had been expected to be released in an eventual ceasefire, Israeli officials told CNN. Autopsies showed they were shot at short range on Thursday or Friday morning; Israeli forces announced the recovery of their bodies from an underground tunnel in Rafah on Saturday.
The details of their deaths fueled anger that was palpable across the country as protesters blocked highways, waved Israeli flags, and chanted, “we won’t abandon them” in reference to the more than 100 hostages, including 35 believed to be dead, being held in Gaza, according to data from Israeli Prime Minister’s Office. The vast majority of those hostages were taken during Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel, when some 1,200 people were killed and more than 200 taken captive.
In Tel Aviv, a group of protesters stood behind a mock cemetery while holding signs saying “named after Benjamin Netanyahu,” as they cast blame on the prime minister for the  deaths of the hostages.
Later in the evening, police threw stun grenades at protesters blocking the Ayalon highway in the city, according to video verified by CNN. Naama Lazimi, a member of Israel’s parliament who was present at the demonstration, said on X that stun grenades “were thrown toward both sides where the demonstrators were standing in complete surprise and without any advance warning.”
Israeli police also fired foam from a water cannon at protesters on the highway – prompting demonstrators to chant, “Officer, who are you keeping safe?”
Police arrested 29 people in the city, accusing them of vandalism, disorderly conduct and attacking officers.
The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said at least 700,000 people took part in protests across Israel, with an estimated 550,000 of them in Tel Aviv. CNN cannot independently verify the figures and has asked Israeli police to provide an estimation of the crowd size.
In Tel Aviv, crowds were visibly emotional; many shouted “sorry” as the names of the six hostages were recited on a loudspeaker during the protest, which organizers said was the biggest since the start of the war.
One protester told CNN said she was there to show support for her cousin, whose body was repatriated by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) overnight. “I’m here every week, I wanted to show her father and other parents that we are here for them,” she said. “And on the other side, we’re incredibly angry at the government. What they’ve been doing is unforgivable.”
In Jerusalem, protesters called for Netanyahu to resign as the government held a cabinet meeting. Eden Kramer, who attended the rally with a toddler in a stroller, said she was also demonstrating for the child’s future. “We hope everyone will come out today to bring a message to the government: We can’t keep up like this anymore,” she said.
The discovery of the six hostage bodies has thrown negotiations for a deal into question.
Skepticism has mounted over Netanyahu’s willingness to strike one given fierce opposition from far-right ministers in his coalition. The Israeli prime minister’s political future largely depends on his far-right coalition partners – several of whom have already threatened to leave the government and cause its collapse if he agrees to the deal.
During a cabinet meeting on Sunday, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant lambasted the Israeli government for what he said was prioritizing control of a key border area known as the Philadelphi corridor over a deal to free hostages, calling it a “moral disgrace.”
The Philadelphi corridor, a 14-kilometer (8.7 mile) stretch that runs along the border between Gaza and Egypt, is currently controlled by the IDF. The deployment of Israeli troops along the corridor during the first phase of a ceasefire agreement has been a major point of contention between Israel and Hamas, with Hamas saying Israeli troops must withdraw from the border zone. Netanyahu says control of the corridor is needed to prevent Hamas from resuming arms smuggling through tunnels underneath it.
Gallant, who has increasingly found himself isolated within Netanyahu’s cabinet on the issue of a hostage deal, warned his colleagues Sunday that “if we continue on this path, we won’t manage to achieve the goals that we set for ourselves.”
He added, “If we want the hostages alive, we don’t have time.”
A senior US official said the killings of the hostages called into question how serious Hamas is about reaching a deal as three of them were set to be released as part of the ceasefire agreement.
“US officials had been working on a final package together with Qatar and Egypt. The package included Hersh (Goldberg-Polin) and a number of the hostages who were just executed,” the senior US official said Sunday.
“This calls into question Hamas’ seriousness about a deal, even as pressure also builds on Israel and Netanyahu personally.”
A source familiar with the ceasefire talks told CNN it wasn’t clear how the killings would affect the discussions, adding that the impact will likely be seen in the next day or two.
The “situation is complicated,” the source said. There are currently no in-person joint negotiations with the parties, but the source said discussions continue through the regular channels.
US President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris will meet in the Situation Room on Monday with the US team negotiating a deal, according to the White House.
Israel’s far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has asked the country’s attorney general to request urgent injunctions to prevent the planned nationwide strike on Monday.
In a letter addressed to Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara, Smotrich argued that a strike would hurt the economy during wartime and set a dangerous precedent. The attorney general’s office has not yet commented on the request.
He had earlier instructed the finance ministry’s salary department to pass on a directive that anyone who joins the strike on Monday will not be paid.
The chairman of Israel’s largest trade union, known as Histadrut, warned on Sunday that the country was “in a downward spiral, and we don’t stop receiving body bags.”
Arnon Bar-David, who called for the strike, told a press conference that “only a strike would shock, and that’s why I’ve decided that starting tomorrow at six in the morning, the entire Israeli economy will shut down.”
He added that the strike would include the shutdown of Ben-Gurion Airport. In a statement, Ben-Gurion Airport said it would be “open for flights and landings on Monday, September 2.”
The Hebrew University of Jerusalem said it would join the strike, which it described as a “response to the tragic news of the murder of our student Carmel Gat, along with five other Israeli hostages.”
Gat, a 40-year-old occupational therapist, was taken by Hamas from her parents’ home in the border kibbutz of Be’eri in southern Israel on October 7.
A spokesperson for the university said the shutdown would be more extensive than previous measures taken since the beginning of the war, such as a partial strike in June.

VE0Q8SBDPV_VZZ5213G2312HPN,Student leaders reveal prison ‘nightmare’ after Gen Z revolution sets them free,"By Rebecca Wright, Anna Coren, Salman Saeed and Mark Phillips, CNN","7 minute read Updated 11:54 PM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/03/asia/bangladesh-house-mirrors-detention-center-intl-hnk-dst/,"The banging on the door started just after sunrise, when law student Iftekhar Alam was still sleeping in his fifth-floor apartment.
Around half a dozen armed police officers pushed inside, shouting obscenities and telling him he had wronged the nation of Bangladesh.
“Where is your phone? Where is your laptop?” the officers shouted as they pointed their guns at him and searched his apartment, Alam said. “They were like crazy, really crazy.”
“They put me in the black glass car, and right away, they handcuffed me. They blindfolded me,” he said.
Alam believes he was taken to Aynaghor, known in Bangladesh as the “House of Mirrors” – a notorious detention center at the headquarters of the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI) in the capital Dhaka.
Human rights groups say hundreds of people were tortured there during the 15-year rule of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who resigned in August after weeks of protest.
After Hasina fled the country by helicopter, some of the political prisoners detained in Bangladesh’s shadowy prison system have been freed and have started to reveal what took place there.
Alam, 23, had been part of anti-government protests since they began in early July, and was close friends with one of the main protest leaders.
The protests started as student-led demonstrations against government job quotas, then later exploded into a nationwide movement to expel Hasina after she ordered a deadly crackdown, killing hundreds of people in Bangladesh’s worst political violence in decades.
During the interrogations, Alam said he was pressured to reveal the locations of the protest leaders. His captors threatened to “vanish” and kill him if he didn’t.
In detention, he says security personnel tortured him for hours – they beat him all over his body with metal pipes until they broke bones in his foot, then forced him to walk around in circles over and over, making him vomit from the pain.
They also extinguished cigarettes on his hands and feet, screaming at him that he would be punished further if he cried out in pain – calling it a “game,” he said.
Alam said his interrogators told him that the next phase was electric shocks and waterboarding – and gave him a “sample” of the electric shock on the back of his neck as a warning.
“There is no escaping from this, and my life will end here, and no one will know,” he said, reflecting on his mindset during those hours.
Rights groups say he’s far from the only victim.
During Hasina’s rule, detainees were subjected to torture at a network of other secret centres across the country, run by the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) and the Detective Branch of the police, according to Odhikar, a Bangladeshi human rights organization.
The RAB – a joint taskforce composed of the police, military and border guards – was sanctioned by the United States in 2021 for its alleged involvement in “serious human rights abuse.”
Odhikar estimates that 709 people were forcibly disappeared under Hasina’s rule. Some were later released, sentenced or found dead – 155 are still missing.
“Bangladeshi law enforcement agencies and security forces systematically committed enforced disappearances” mostly targeting “academics, journalists, dissenting voices, and political activists” which created a “climate of fear in the country,” Okhikar said in a statement on August 29.
International rights groups like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have also published multiple reports documenting disappearances and torture by police and other security forces during Hasina’s rule.
CNN can’t independently verify the testimonies of torture and has reached out to the new interim government in Bangladesh for comment on the allegations of abuses at Aynaghor and the number of people still missing.
Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Mohammed Yunus – who is leading the new interim government – has announced the creation of a commission to investigate the “disappeared” people, and has invited a UN fact-finding team to Bangladesh to independently probe alleged atrocities committed during the recent protests.
“The issue of enforced disappearances has a long and painful history in Bangladesh,” said Ravina Shamdasani, spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.
“The UN Human Rights Office looks forward to supporting the Interim Government and people of Bangladesh at this pivotal moment to revitalise democracy, seek accountability and reconciliation, and advance human rights for all the people in Bangladesh.”
Hours after Hasina fled and her government collapsed – and within 24 hours of his capture – Alam said he was released.
His captors dropped him on a quiet road before dawn, threatening to shoot him if he opened his eyes as they drove away.
Nearly one month after his release, Alam has had the plaster cast on his foot removed, and he is now moving around on crutches.
But he says the mental scars will take much longer to heal.
“It was like (a) nightmare,” he said.
Nusrat Tabassum – one of the most senior women coordinating the protest – was also pursued by the authorities.
“(It was a) very traumatic time for me,” Tabassum said. “They broke three doors. They took me with them, and oh my god, the physical torture, that was miserable.”
Tabassum says she was badly beaten during five days in detention from July 28 to August 1. She re-joined the protests the day after her release.
The 23-year-old political science student attends the prestigious Dhaka University, which became a central gathering point for the protests in July and early August.
On the university’s manicured campus sits Curzon Hall, a British colonial-era building surrounded by palm trees that offers an oasis away from the chaotic streets of the capital.
As Tabassum walks through the building’s historic arches, it’s clear that her bravery has turned her into a poster child for the movement.
Fellow female students occasionally stop her to take selfies and ask about her time in detention.
“Our reunion will be at Aynaghor,” one shouts at her as she walks past – a sign of how many of the students spent time at detention centers. “Aynaghor” or “House of Mirrors” has morphed into a catch-all term for the various places political prisoners were held.
Tabassum says she was beaten for more than four hours, covering her in bruises, filling her mouth with cuts, and bursting her ear drum.
“Without (a) hearing aid, I can’t listen in my right ear,” Tabassum said. “Two teeth (became) loose because of the beating.”
During her detention, she was forced to make a joint confession with five other student leaders which was broadcast on television.
“They forced us to make a video statement that we stopped our protest, and there will be no more movement,” she said.
Making that video was “more traumatic” than the beatings, she said, because she feared the people of Bangladesh would feel betrayed.
“That was the most sad thing,” she said.
Tabassum said that when word spread that Hasina had resigned her post, ending her authoritarian grip on the country, protesters felt their sacrifice had been worth it.
“I cried a lot after I heard the news,” she said. “It was like I lived for that moment my whole life.”
As she continues her recovery, Tabassum says she’s struggling with memory loss, and has trouble recalling events that occurred even before the beating.
But she is determined to help shape the new country – or “Bangladesh 2.0”, as people here call it.
Protest art and murals now line the streets of Dhaka with striking pop art-style designs and slogans such as “long live resistance,” “let your dreams fly,” and “this is new Bangladesh, made by Gen Z.”
The streets are alive with renewed optimism and civic pride – with micro-protests popping up across Bangladeshi cities, as interest groups try to make their voices heard during the reform process.
In late August, CNN witnessed half a dozen small peaceful protests in the capital Dhaka and south-eastern city of Cox’s Bazar – on niche issues such as doctors trying to prevent paramedics from gaining medical licenses, and rickshaw drivers campaigning against electric rickshaws.
Previously, many people were too afraid to protest on the streets for fear of arrest or being “disappeared” under the time of Hasina.
But now even families are on the street, campaigning for the release of victims caught in Bangladesh’s shadowy detention system.
There’s cautious optimism that the country will change under new leadership, but some remain wary, as instability pervades every sector of society.
Yunus, the interim leader, has asked the public for patience as his team tries to address “mountain-like challenges” after “15 years of fascist rule.”
The students who brought him to power believe that he will uphold the country’s best interests.
Yunus has “guardian vibes,” Tabassum said.
“He cares about us, he cares about my country,” she said. “We like to keep our trust in him.”
But she acknowledges that “post revolution reformation is very hard.”
“My country is sick,” she said. “But our people, we (will) stand together.”"
VFFLZSDDMK_HYHHKKB8D9O3E3O,DC’s streets are flooded with illegal firearms. Officials are suing three gun shops they say are a big part of the problem,"By Gabe Cohen, CNN","3 minute read Updated 9:40 PM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240903,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/03/politics/washington-dc-guns/,"Attorneys general in Washington, DC, and Maryland are suing three firearms dealers in Maryland, accusing the stores of knowingly selling dozens of guns to straw purchasers who illegally re-sold the weapons to criminals in DC and its surrounding Maryland suburbs.
In one case, the three stores located in Montgomery County — Engage Armament, United Gun Shop and Atlantic Guns — sold 34 guns in a six-month period to a Maryland resident named Demetrius Minor who then transferred the firearms to a convicted felon with a lengthy criminal history, according to the lawsuit. Minor was convicted for the purchases, the lawsuit states.
Nine of those guns have been recovered at crime scenes in the DC area. The rest, officials say, are most likely still on the street.
“There was no plausible lawful explanation for Mr. Minor’s excessive handgun purchases over such a short period,” the civil lawsuit reads. “He was obviously engaged in illegal straw purchasing—but the Defendants did not care. They kept taking his money and selling him more guns, putting the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area at risk.”
A representative of Atlantic Guns, Inc. told CNN in an email that “Atlantic Guns, Inc. has never and will never knowingly sell to someone who we have reason to believe is committing a straw purchase. Until we have received and reviewed the complaint, we are unable to comment further.”
CNN has reached out to Engage Armament and United Gun Shop for comment.
In 2023, violent crime exploded in DC, surging 40%. Since then, the numbers have declined but are still hovering above pre-pandemic levels.
Gun recoveries in DC have more than doubled over the past decade and are hitting record highs, and 95% of those illegal firearms come from outside the District, according to DC Attorney General Brian Schwalb.
“We need to get to the source,” Schwalb said at a news conference Tuesday. “We need to get to the suppliers. We need to stop guns from getting into the district in the first place. We can’t keep asking the back end to deal with gun violence when it’s people at the front end, the distributors who in pursuit of profits, are driving violence.”
The lawsuit will seek financial damages from the three gun stores. But beyond monetary penalties, officials say they’re hoping the lawsuit will disrupt the practice of selling guns to straw purchasers.
A report from Maryland’s attorney general’s office identified these three gun shops as the top three retailers of crime guns between August 2020 and July 2021, according to Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown.
“Many of us have watched the news, and we wonder, where are all these guns coming from? Well, today, we have part of the answer, and we’re taking serious action,” Brown said.

VHMZWVGOA3_FQ746XOCM6IAQW3,Ukraine’s foreign minister tenders resignation ahead of cabinet reshuffle as Russian missiles kill at least 7,"By Kosta Gak, Alex Stambaugh, Helen Regan and Ivana Kottasová, CNN","6 minute read Updated 11:33 AM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/04/europe/ukraine-foreign-minister-kuleba-resigns-intl-hnk/,"Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba became the latest top official to tender his resignation on Wednesday, ahead of a major government reshuffle, as yet another wave of Russian attacks overnight killed at least seven people, including a child.
As Ukraine’s top diplomat, Kuleba has been a prominent fixture in Zelensky’s administration and one of the most public-facing, especially dealing with overseas officials. He was seen as a capable politician and a safe pair of hands, one of the strongest members of Zelensky’s cabinet. His offer to resign comes ahead of an expected visit by the president to the United States this month.
Kuleba’s was the latest in a flurry of resignations. Two of Ukraine’s vice premiers, three ministers, the head of the State Property Fund and a top official in Zelensky’s Presidential Office have all quit within the last day or so.
The parliament approved Kuleba’s resignation on Thursday and Andrii Sybiha was sworn in as foreign minister to replace him. Sybiha has previously served as ambassador to Turkey and deputy head of the presidential office.
The resignations of the three other ministers and one of the vice premiers were approved on Wednesday.
Zelensky has not yet given any explanation for the reshuffle, but said in his nightly address on Tuesday that the coming fall will be “extremely important for Ukraine” and as such “our state institutions must be set up so that Ukraine achieves all the results we need.”
Kuleba and others who tendered their resignations are widely expected to be appointed into other roles in the Zelensky administration. The reshuffle comes at a precarious time for Ukraine. Its troops are under increasing pressure on the eastern frontlines, especially around the strategic city of Pokrovsk that is on the brink of falling to Russia.

It seems likely that Zelensky wants to have his new team in place for his trip to the US later this month, where he is expected to attend the United Nation General Assembly and meet the US President Joe Biden. Zelensky said last week that he intends to present Biden with a new four-part “victory plan” – without providing details.
The last major change Zelensky made to the top echelon of Ukraine’s leadership came in February, when he replaced the former Commander in Chief Valerii Zaluzhnyi with Oleksander Syrskyi. Zaluzhnyi currently serves as Ukraine’s ambassador to the United Kingdom.
Ukrainian political scientist Mykola Davydiuk said there were no major disagreements within the government. Instead, Zelensky is likely trying to send a signal that he is injecting new energy into his government.
“(The president’s office) wanted to do this last fall, then in December, then in May. They spoke about it so they need to do something, otherwise people will not believe them,” he said, adding that Zelensky likely sensed a window of opportunity for the reshuffle. “The West can’t criticize him now because they have a lot of domestic issues to deal with – the US election, election trouble in Germany and France,” he added.
Davyd Arakhamia, the majority leader of Ukraine’s parliament, said Tuesday that there would be major changes expected in the cabinet this week.
“As promised, a major government reset can be expected this week. More than 50% of the Cabinet of Ministers’ staff will be changed,” Arakhamia said on Telegram, adding that new members would be appointed imminently.
Among those who have resigned was the Minister for Strategic Industries Oleksandr Kamyshin, who was in charge of weapons production. He is expected to assume another defense role, Reuters reported.
The resignations also include the justice, environment and reintegration ministers.
“To do this, we need to strengthen some areas of the government… I am also counting on a slightly different weight for certain areas of our foreign and domestic policy,” Arakhamia said.
Speaking to CNN Chief International Anchor Christiane Amanpour Tuesday, Kuleba said he expects Putin to continue increasing air attacks on Ukraine before winter sets in.
“Putin still has the same purpose to freeze people, to destroy our economy and this is his strategy. So I’m afraid he will continue with his barrage of missile and drone attacks over the course of the autumn,” he said.
The attacks, Kuleba said, are “just another reason why delivery of air defense systems to Ukraine must be expedited.”
The expected reshuffle came as Russian missiles continued to rain down on Ukrainian cities. Just a day after two ballistic missiles hit an educational facility in Poltava in central Ukraine, a major attack struck Lviv, a city in western Ukraine that has long been considered a safe haven in the war-torn country.
Lviv’s mayor Andriy Sadovyi said seven people, including a 14-year-old girl, were killed and 25 were injured in the attacks.
A 15-month-old child suffered “moderate” injuries and four other children have minor injuries, according to the head of the city’s regional military administration Maksym Kozytskyi.

Lviv, in Ukraine’s far west, is generally far away from Russian borders, which means missiles and drones take longer to reach it – giving the Ukrainian military more time to shoot them down. Many people from eastern regions relocated there to seek safety.
Kozytskyi said that at least seven “architectural monuments of local importance,” including houses located in a historic part of the city and inside a UNESCO buffer zone, were also damaged in the attack.
On Tuesday, a Russian strike against a military educational facility in central Ukraine killed 54 people and injured nearly 300 others, according to the state emergency service of Ukraine. It was one of the deadliest single attacks since the start of Moscow’s full-scale invasion in February 2022.
Ukraine’s Air Force said Wednesday it shot down 22 attack drones and seven cruise missiles.
At the same time, Ukraine is still reeling from a massive wave of attacks against the energy infrastructure last week. Power cuts are still impacting lives across Ukraine, with millions suffering from power cuts every day.
At least five people were killed and more than 10 wounded in Russian attacks in the central city of Kryvyi Rih after a hotel building was destroyed, according to the head of the Dnipropetrovsk regional military administration Serhiy Lysak.
The strike on Kryvyi Rih appears to be part of a wave of Russian attacks targeting hotels. Facilities in Kramatorsk, Zaporizhzhia, and another one in Kryvyi Rih were all hit by strikes in the past week or so.
Speaking about the attacks, Zelensky again appealed for Kyiv’s allies to supply Ukraine with more air defenses and to lift restrictions on the use of western weapons on targets in Russia.
Meanwhile, the chief of the UN nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, visited the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in occupied southern Ukraine on Wednesday.
Grossi, who heads the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on Tuesday that the situation at the largest nuclear power plant in Europe was “very fragile.” The Ukrainian energy company Energoatom said one of two power supply lines to the plant was damaged on Monday following Russian strikes in the region.
“Today we have one of the two existing power lines down, which means that the station is again on the verge of being on a blackout,” Grossi told reporters in Kyiv on Tuesday, before heading to Zaporizhzhia.
Explaining why a power cut could cause a serious accident at the plant, Grossi said: “Blackout, no power… No power, no cooling… No cooling, maybe you have a disaster.”

Recent TV ads highlight her time as a “border state prosecutor” who aggressively targeted criminal cartels and drug smugglers, as well as her support for “the toughest border security bill in decades.”
That bill, which failed in the Senate in February and again in May, included $650 million for new border wall construction. Images of the border wall built during the Trump administration are featured in the Harris ads, yet Harris repeatedly criticized the wall over the years, describing it as an affront to both hers and America’s values.
In her 2019 book, “The Truths We Hold,” Harris called the wall “useless” and said it was “nothing more than a symbol, a monument standing in opposition to not just everything I value, but to the fundamental values upon which this country was built.”
A CNN KFile review of Harris’ social media posts found that she criticized the border wall more than 50 times during the Trump administration, calling it, among other things, “stupid,” “useless,” and a “medieval vanity project.”
As she tries to strengthen her image on the border, Harris will have to reckon with her years of opposing some of the very policies she now embraces. That includes building more border wall and also making it harder for migrants to come to the US seeking asylum.
Harris has tacked to the middle on other key issues, such as no longer banning fracking or supporting Medicare for All — positions she once supported before being picked as Joe Biden’s vice presidential nominee.
In an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash last Thursday, Harris said, despite her policy shifts, “my values have not changed.”
Immigration and the border remain significant vulnerabilities for Harris and the Democratic party, according to some national polls, although recent polling suggests Harris has managed to narrow the gap.
Not all border work stopped during the Biden administration.
In 2021 and 2022, the administration continued work near the border wall to prevent flooding, complete prior construction of access roads and close “small gaps that remain open from prior construction activities and remediating incomplete gates.”
In October 2023, the Biden administration allowed the additional building of border wall in Texas, with Biden saying he had to use money appropriated for the wall in 2019 and could not redirect it.
“I tried to get them to reappropriate it, to redirect that money. They didn’t, they wouldn’t. And in the meantime, there’s nothing under the law other than they have to use the money for what it was appropriated. I can’t stop that,” Biden told reporters in the Oval Office at the time.
In response to questions from CNN, a Harris campaign aide said in referencing the recent campaign ad that it was “inaccurate to imply a few images” are “somehow representative of the VP’s overall policy position on a complex issue when the entirety of the ad, the VP’s remarks as the nominee, and the governance of this Administration have been clear where she stands on border security - supporting the bipartisan border agreement.”
Along with extending funding for more border barriers and hiring more federal immigration authorities, the border security bill that Harris has vowed to sign as president would also largely bar migrants from seeking asylum if they crossed the border unlawfully. Many of the people who encounter Border Patrol agents at the southern border are migrants seeking asylum and claim to be fleeing conflict or persecution in their home country.
A CNN KFile review of Harris’ comments from 2017 through August 2020, before Biden picked her as his running mate, found that she repeatedly pledged to “honor the process” of asylum established decades ago and slammed policies that restricted asylum seekers.
Harris was one of seven US senators who signed onto an amicus brief in late 2018 supporting a lawsuit filed by asylum seekers challenging a Trump administration rule that effectively barred all asylum claims outside ports of entry.
“United States law is crystal clear that men, women, and children who arrive at any point on our borders may seek asylum,” read the brief. “In our democratic system, laws may not be overturned by Executive fiat.”
A judge struck down that rule in August 2019 and the Trump administration lost its appeals.
While running for president in 2019, Harris pledged to respect asylum law and called restricting asylum a “stain on our moral conscience.”
“Under a Harris administration, issues like asylum, for example, we are gonna honor the process and not try to circumvent the process and expedite the process for the sake of some political goal as opposed to the sake of justice and fairness,” Harris said on the “Pod Save America” podcast in 2019.
She reiterated the pledge in several tweets at that time, writing in July 2019, “As president, I will immediately put in place a meaningful process to review asylum cases. I will release children from cages. I will get rid of the private detention centers. It’s time we had a president whose actions reflected the values of our country.”
During a June 2019 interview with CBS News, she vowed that a Harris administration would honor established asylum procedures, stating, “If they are deserving of protection, we will give it to ‘em.”
A year later, in June 2020, Harris was one of 34 senators to sign a congressional letter criticizing the Covid-era Title 42 authority, which allowed the government to bar migrants from entering the country because of the public health crisis. The letter equated Trump’s asylum policies to the denial of safe passage to Jewish refugees fleeing the Holocaust.
Shortly after Biden and Harris took office in 2021, the mass influx of asylum seekers at the US-Mexico border significantly strained US immigration resources. The Biden-Harris administration initially kept Title 42 in place. In 2022, Republicans sued to keep the administration from ending Title 42, which it finally did in May 2023 when it announced the end of national Covid-era emergency restrictions.
As vice president, Harris was tasked with overseeing diplomatic efforts to address the root causes of migration.
Despite this role, Harris’ current stance on asylum marks a notable departure from her earlier promises to uphold the asylum process and protect vulnerable migrants.
After Senate Republicans abandoned the border bill at the behest of Trump, the Biden administration took executive actions to restrict asylum. In June, Biden signed an executive order largely barring migrants who cross the border illegally from seeking asylum once a daily threshold is reached, a departure from longstanding US asylum policy.
While Harris has yet to publicly comment on her plans for asylum, her campaign manager has signaled Harris would continue implementing Biden’s executive orders curbing asylum.
Throughout the Trump administration, Harris was a consistent critic of the border wall.
In April 2018, Harris signed onto a letter that urged the appropriations committee to reduce funding for the border wall and to halt hiring new Border Patrol agents.
CNN identified one of the border walls in her new campaign ads as constructed during Trump’s presidency in Sasabe, Arizona, in an area where there had not previously been border wall. The other walls feature signs that they were Trump-era walls, such as so-called anti-climbing plates that were built during the Trump years.
“It’s the president’s vanity project,” Harris said in June 2019 at an event promoting her book. “Let’s just point to the facts and the evidence and the data. And the fact is that we are not facing a crisis.”
“This president rode a wave into office of vilifying, a whole population of people,” she said at another event in 2019. “His multi-billion dollar vanity project called a wall is nothing more than a distraction from the fact that he actually hasn’t focused on working people in America. So instead of focusing on the needs of working families in America, he creates a scapegoat, a boogeyman.”

VKRRYLHUWT_O65S45KE9ACOVQV,Biden and Netanyahu at odds again after US president says Israeli PM not doing enough in ceasefire-hostage release talks,"By Kevin Liptak, Nikki Carvajal and Alex Marquardt, CNN","5 minute read Updated 9:17 PM EDT, Mon September 2, 2024",20240902,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/02/politics/biden-netanyahu-ceasefire-hostage-deal/,"President Joe Biden said Monday that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is not doing enough to secure the release of hostages held by Hamas and added he is “close” to presenting a final deal to negotiators working to strike a hostage and ceasefire agreement in Gaza.
The president’s comments came as he was returning to the White House to huddle with American officials who have been working to secure a deal that would pair a release of hostages held in Gaza with a pause in the fighting. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee for president, also attended the meeting before joining Biden for a campaign event in Pittsburgh.
The hostage release efforts gained new urgency over the weekend with the discovery of the bodies of six hostages in a tunnel beneath the southern Gaza city of Rafah, including the Israeli-American citizen Hersh Goldberg-Polin.
The deaths have sparked outrage inside Israel, leading to enormous protests and a nationwide strike Monday. Demonstrators have called on Netanyahu to put aside political ambitions to strike an agreement that would allow hostages to be released.
Asked Monday whether Netanyahu was doing enough to reach an agreement, Biden said simply: “No.”
His one-word answer kept with Biden’s reluctance to criticize Netanyahu in public, but nonetheless reflected deep frustrations inside the White House at how the Israeli leader has handled the conflict and the hostage talks.
A senior Israeli source criticized Biden’s statement, saying: “It is remarkable that President Biden is trying to pressure Prime Minister Netanyahu, who agreed to both the president’s proposal on May 31 and to the American bridging proposal on August 16, and not Hamas’ leader Sinwar, who continues to oppose any deal.”
“The president’s statement is also dangerous because it comes days after Hamas executed 6 hostages, including an American citizen.”
A US official responded to that criticism by saying, “The president has been clear that Hamas is responsible for killing Hersh and the others and Hamas leaders will pay for their crimes. He is also calling for urgency from the Israeli government in securing the release of the missing remaining hostages.”
It’s the latest sign of discord between the two leaders who have a long relationship that at times is contentious and has been worn thin over the last year during Israel’s war in Gaza in response to the October 7 attacks by Hamas.
Biden later deflected questions about the Israeli response to his statement. As the president left for Pittsburgh, CNN’s Arlette Saenz asked him what more he wanted Netanyahu to do.
“We’re in the middle of negotiations,” Biden said.
Asked about Netanyahu’s comments about him, Biden responded: “We’re still in negotiations – not with him, but my colleagues from Qatar and Egypt.”
American officials said the deaths of the six hostages over the weekend would likely apply new pressure on Netanyahu to reach an agreement, though the officials also said it raised questions about how serious Hamas is toward striking a deal.
“We’re very close to that,” Biden said when asked by CNN if he was planning to present a final proposal.
Asked Monday how the new deal being finalized would be different than other failed proposals, Biden responded: “Hope springs eternal.”
As he was arriving back at the White House after the Pittsburgh rally, Biden was asked whether he had plans to speak to the prime minister.
“Eventually,” he responded.
Netanyahu was more vociferous in his complaints about how Hamas is treating the ceasefire talks. He said in a news conference Monday that Israel has already shown “seriousness in the negotiations” and now “Hamas has to make the concessions.”
“On August 19, Secretary (Antony) Blinken said, Israel accepted the US proposal. Now Hamas must do the same. On August 28 – that’s five days ago, five days ago – the deputy CIA director said that ‘Israel shows seriousness in the negotiations. Now, Hamas must show the same seriousness,’” he said. “I want to ask you, what has changed in the last five days? What has changed? One thing – these murderers executed six of our hostages. They shot them in the back of the head. That’s what’s changed.”
“Now, after this, we’re asked to show seriousness? We’re asked to make concessions? What message does this send Hamas? It says, kill more hostages. Murder more hostages. You get more concessions,” Netanyahu argued, adding that international pressure should be directed at Hamas.
“I don’t believe that either President Biden or anyone serious about achieving peace and achieving the release would seriously ask Israel, Israel, to make these concessions. We’ve already made them. Hamas has to make the concessions,” Netanyahu said.
Following the news of the killing of the six hostages in Gaza, officials involved in the mediation of the ceasefire talks have been on the phone discussing ways to push the ceasefire and hostage deal forward, a source familiar with the discussions told CNN.
But then Netanyahu gave his press conference Monday evening, arguing that Israel will never leave the Philadelphi corridor, “and this guy torpedoed everything in one speech,” the source said in an initial reaction.
Mossad director David Barnea also traveled to Doha and met with Qatari Prime Minister Mohammad Abudlrahman Al Thani on Monday.
Lead Hamas negotiator Khalil Al-Hayya told Al Jazeera on Sunday there would be no deal without the Israel Defense Forces withdrawing from the Philadelphi corridor, which runs along the Egypt-Gaza border. Between the hostages and the Israeli military presence in the corridor, the “Philadelphi was more important,” Hayya alleged.
Netanyahu’s recent insistence on staying in Philadelphi represents a change in position, sources familiar with the negotiations said. When Biden announced the framework on May 31 – which he said Israel had agreed to – it envisioned an IDF withdrawal eastward from populated areas. According to a draft published in Israeli media, there was no mention of Philadelphi.
In the weeks that followed, Israel then added remaining in Philadelphi as a condition, and the recent negotiations have discussed what the IDF presence along the border would look like.
A permanent IDF presence in the Philadelphi corridor would also contradict the US position on the future of Gaza. On Blinken’s most recent trip to Israel in August he told reporters that the US will not accept “any long-term occupation of Gaza by Israel.” Administration officials have made clear they expect a full withdrawal by Israel from Gaza as the result of any permanent ceasefire agreement.

VLR1UM3GA8_D6E4DRGPIXXTY51,"In Ukraine’s supposed safe haven city, an entire family is wiped out by a Russian missile strike","By Ivana Kottasová and Svitlana Vlasova, CNN","2 minute read Published 11:22 AM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/04/europe/ukraine-safe-haven-city-family-killed-intl/,"Writing in her college application letter, Daryna Bazylevych described her family as “incredibly close knit and harmonious.” She spoke of her parents’ infinite support and the way they told stories about Ukraine’s history to her and her sisters. “They are the strongest pillar in my life and they help me overcome any obstacle,” she wrote.
Of the five members of her family, only Yaroslav, Daryna’s father, is now alive, a lone survivor of a Russian strike on their home in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv on Wednesday.
According to eyewitnesses, Daryna, 18, her sisters Yaryna, 21, and Emilia, 7, and their 43-year-old mother Yevhenia were killed while sheltering in the staircase of their residential building, the Ukrainian emergency services said.
It is likely that Yaroslav survived only because he was in the family apartment when the missile hit the building. He popped over to grab some water for the family — it was him who went because the staircase was meant to be the safe place.
The deaths of the three sisters and their mother caused a huge outpouring of grief among people in Lviv and across Ukraine.
Andriy Sadovyi, the mayor of Lviv, said the eldest girl, Yaryna, worked in the town hall as part of the “Lviv - Youth Capital of Europe 2025” initiative.
Daryna, the middle sister, was a scholarship student of Ukrainian culture at the Ukrainian Catholic University in Lviv. She had just began her second year.
“This is a great and irreparable loss. There are no words that can describe this grief. Let us pray for the souls of the innocent victims. Let us pray for Yaroslav, the father,” the university said in a statement.
Yevhenia, the mother, and the two older girls were members of the Ukrainian Scouts movement. In a statement, the Scouts described Yevhenia as a “creative, intelligent, positive and bright personality.”
The staircase where the Bazylevyches died was meant to be a safe place in a safe city.
Lviv lies in western Ukraine, near the border with Poland, and it has always been seen as one of the safest places in the country.
Tens of thousands of internally displaced people from eastern parts of Ukraine are living in Lviv. Russia is far away, which means missiles and drones take longer to reach the city – giving the Ukrainian military more time to shoot them down.
It has been an exceptionally deadly week for Ukraine — the four members of the Bazylevych family were among seven people killed in Lviv on Wednesday. On Tuesday, two Russian missiles hit a military educational facility in Poltava, killing 53 people and injuring more than 270 others."
VO5NXCSKNQ_S9BQSYHYMX1MH2M,US prosecutors charge Hamas leaders in October 7 attack,"By Hannah Rabinowitz, Holmes Lybrand and Evan Perez, CNN","5 minute read Updated 6:06 PM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/03/politics/justice-department-indicts-hamas-leaders/,"The US Department of Justice has charged several senior Hamas leaders over the October 7 terrorist attack, according to a criminal complaint unsealed Tuesday.
The indictment is the first criminal step by the Justice Department to hold people accountable for the attack in Israel.
The six defendants – Ismail Haniyeh, Yahya Sinwar, Mohammad Al-Masri, Marwan Issa, Khaled Meshaal and Ali Baraka – are facing seven charges, including terrorism charges, conspiracy to murder US nationals and conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction resulting in death.
The defendants are high-level Hamas officials, including Sinwar who is the terrorist organization’s leader in Gaza and one of the planners of the October 7 attack.
The complaint, which spans across several decades of alleged terrorist acts from Hamas, focuses in part on the October 7 attack against Israel.
Prosecutors detail how the brutal onslaught unfolded that day and the defendants’ involvement, one of whom is the alleged leader of Hamas’s militia group.
“On October 7, 2023, Hamas committed its most violent, large-scale terrorist attack to date,” the complaint says, detailing how “in the early morning hours … Hamas sent more than 2,000 armed fighters into farms and towns in southern Israel, where they carried out the massacres of over a thousand people and the kidnappings of more than 200 others.”
The complaint continued, saying that “during the October 7 Hamas Massacres, Hamas terrorists weaponized sexual violence against Israeli women, including rape and genital mutilation.”
“As of the date of this Complaint, at least 43 American citizens were among those murdered, and at least ten American citizens were taken hostage or remain unaccounted for,” prosecutors say.
Those senior members of Hamas charged called for mass terrorist attacks and celebrated the October 7 attack, prosecutors say.
The charges were originally filed on February 1, 2024, but kept under seal in case the Justice Department had the opportunity to arrest any of the defendants, a Justice Department official said Tuesday.
“Following Haniyah’s death and recent developments in the region, it was no longer necessary to keep those charges under seal,” the official said.
Three of the Hamas leaders charged are deceased.
Sinwar was named leader following the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July. Sinwar is widely believed to have planned or been the mastermind behind the October 7 Hamas massacre on Israel.
Sinwar was sentenced to four life sentences by Israel in 1989 for the abduction and killing of two Israeli soldiers and four Palestinians he believed were collaborators.
He served 22 years of that sentence.
In 2011, Sinwar was released with 1,026 other Palestinians prisoners in exchange for Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, who was held in Gaza by Palestinian militants from 2006-2011.
Mohammad al-Masri is better known as Mohammed Deif and is the head of the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, which is the military wing of Hamas.
Israel said al-Masri was killed in an Israeli airstrike on July 13, though Hamas has denied that that is the case.
Issa was one of Israel’s top targets and it is believed he was killed when his house in Gaza was targeted by an Israeli airstrike in July.
The announcement comes on the heels of the confirmed death of Israeli-American hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin in Gaza, which prompted President Joe Biden and other top US officials to vow that Hamas leaders would be held accountable.
“We’ll weigh other actions as appropriate,” a senior administration official said, but declined to elaborate.
Biden said over the weekend that Goldberg-Polin’s death was “as tragic as it is reprehensible.”
“Make no mistake, Hamas leaders will pay for these crimes,” Biden said.
In a recorded statement, Attorney General Merrick Garland said that the Justice Department is investigating Goldberg-Polin’s murder.
“We are investigating Hersh’s murder, and each and every one of the brutal murders of Americans, as acts of terrorism.  We will continue to support the whole of government effort to bring the Americans still being held hostage home,” Garland said.
Nearly 1,200 people were killed on October 7, including over 40 Americans. Hundreds of civilians were kidnapped.
The attorney general said that the Hamas leaders, who he said “led” the October 7 attack, are charged for “financing and directing a decades-long campaign to murder American citizens and endanger the security of the United States.”
“As outlined in our complaint, those defendants – armed with weapons, political support, and funding from the Government of Iran, and support from Hizballah – have led Hamas’s efforts to destroy the State of Israel and murder civilians in support of that aim,” Garland said.
The complaint detailed how Hamas and its leaders allegedly financed their terrorist operations through donations, “cryptocurrency, and transfers from the Government of Iran.”
“Hamas leaders, including the defendants, have played significant roles in the terrorist organization’s solicitation of funding contributions in support of Hamas’s violent objectives,” the complaint says, including using the October 7 attack on Israel to call for donations.
According to the complaint, in the wake of the attack Hamas’s armed wing, Al-Qassam, has “continued to solicit cryptocurrency and other financing after the October 7 Hamas Massacres on other social media platforms, specifically suggesting to followers methods to avoid interdiction by Israeli authorities, and has continued to receive contributions through at least one U.S.-based financial technology company.”
Iran, prosecutors say, has played “a critical and active role” in fundraising efforts for the militia, “through traditional cash exchanges, money transmitters … and cryptocurrency transactions.”
All of this, the complaint says, was to further Hamas’s shared goal with Iran “of annihilating Israel.”
In recent years, Iran also increased it’s funding to Hamas for intelligence over Israel’s missiles. This bump, prosecutors say, amounted to “roughly tens of millions of dollars a month.”

The decision came after the estate of the late R&B artist and songwriter Isaac Hayes sought an emergency injunction to stop the Trump campaign from using the song at campaign events, alleging the campaign does not have approval.
Judge Thomas Thrash Jr. made the ruling from the bench in court in Atlanta, Georgia.
“I do order Trump and his campaign to not use the song without proper license,” he said.
The judge denied a motion by the Hayes estate to force the Trump campaign to take down any previously recorded uses of the song.
Ronald Coleman, an attorney for Trump, told members of the media after the hearing that “the campaign has no interest in annoying or hurting anyone. And if the Hayes family feels it hurts or annoys them, that’s fine, we’re not going to force the issue.”
Coleman said they were pleased the judge didn’t order the campaign to take down any previous uses of the song.
Hayes died in 2008 after suffering a stroke. He was 65.
The 1966 song, co-written by Hayes and David Porter, was performed by Sam Moore and Dave Prater, who were professionally known as the duo Sam & Dave. Prater died in 1988.
CNN has reached out to a representative for Moore for comment.
According to court documents obtained by CNN, attorneys for the Hayes estate claim that the campaign has not “obtained a valid public performance license” and are requesting “compensatory damages for the unauthorized use” of Hayes’ music.
The Hayes estate alleges that Trump began using Hayes’ material as “outro” music at campaign events in 2020 and have continued to use his music in 2024, as seen in one of Trump’s recent posts on Truth Social in which “Hold On, I’m Comin’” can be heard playing at a rally.
“We are very grateful and happy for the decision by Judge Thrash,” Isaac Hayes III said after the hearing. “I want this to serve as an opportunity for other artists to come forward that don’t want their music used by Donald Trump or other political entities.”
Related article Can Beyoncé, Celine Dion and Foo Fighters stop Trump from using their music? It’s complicated
In their response to the lawsuit, attorneys for the Republican National Committee and the Trump campaign claim the Hayes estate is not the license holder for the song.
On Monday, Hayes III posted a letter dated June 5, 2024, that he said was from BMI, an organization that collects license fees from businesses for the use of music.
“Donald Trump for President has been claiming they had a valid @BMI license to play “Hold On, I’m Coming” for weeks. FALSE,” the post on X reads. “Donald Trump for President has not had valid license for nealy 100 days, and @realDonaldTrump has NEVER had a license. Not to mention the numerous uses before Nov. 30th, 2022.”
The estate is the first to end up in court over complaints of Trump and his campaign allegedly using music they had not properly licensed, but other artists have complained.
Beyoncé, Bruce Springsteen, Celine Dion, Prince’s estate and Foo Fighters have publicly complained and/or disavowed Trump using their music.

A suspect in the shooting later led authorities on a chase that ended about 60 miles away in the waters off Galveston, where the man tried swimming away to evade arrest before being captured with the help of a marine unit, according to the Port of Galveston Police Department.
The deputy was identified as Maher Husseini, who had worked as a Harris County constable since 2021. Investigators were still trying to determine a motive for the shooting and whether the deputy had been targeted, Houston Police Chief J. Noe Diaz said.
Police were investigating whether it might have been an instance of road rage, he said.
“It’s an awful thing for the community, for someone to lose their life, someone that’s dedicated their life to public service,” Diaz said. “It is absolutely tragic.”
According to preliminary information, Husseini was not in uniform when he was shot, Diaz said. Bullet holes could be seen through the passenger side window of an SUV at the scene.
Husseini was taken to a Houston hospital where he was pronounced dead, Harris County Precinct 4 Constable Mark Herman said.
Authorities did not immediately release the name of the suspect in custody Tuesday evening. In a statement, Port of Galveston police said the man had led police on a pursuit that ended in a crash, followed by him swimming away.
Officers later found the suspect in the water and took him into custody. He was taken to a hospital for evaluation, police said.
“The dangerous criminal who ambushed and murdered Deputy Constable Husseini will have the full weight of the law brought down upon him,” Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said in a statement."
VZYRL3S1VN_CX7PJUQIFVRFKO8,Vladimir Putin trolls US presidential race with ‘endorsement’ of Kamala Harris,"Analysis by Nathan Hodge, CNN","3 minute read Updated 4:09 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/05/europe/vladimir-putin-kamala-harris-endorsement-intl/,"Russian President Vladimir Putin raised eyebrows Thursday when he expressed his support for US Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential bid, flattering the Democratic nominee with some curiously timed remarks.
“Our ‘favorite,’ if you can call it that, was the current president, Mr. [Joe] Biden. But he was removed from the race, and he recommended all his supporters to support Ms. Harris. Well, we will do so – we will support her,” Putin said Thursday at the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok. “She laughs so expressively and infectiously that it means that she is doing well.”
Putin also criticized former president and current Republican nominee Donald Trump for placing “so many restrictions and sanctions against Russia like no other president has ever introduced before him.”
Putin’s comments come on the heels of sweeping sanctions announced by the Biden administration to combat a Russian government-backed disinformation effort to influence the 2024 elections and boost Trump’s candidacy.
And despite the Russian leader’s vocal support of the Democrats, US Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said on Wednesday that three Russian companies – at Putin’s direction – used fake profiles to promote false narratives on social media. Internal documents produced by one of those Russian companies show one of the goals of the propaganda effort was to support Trump’s candidacy or whoever emerged as the Republican nominee for president, according to an FBI affidavit.
So what is Putin trying to accomplish?
If the past is any guide, Putin is simply stirring the pot of US domestic politics. In December 2015, Putin praised Trump, calling him the front-runner months before the businessman secured the Republican nomination.
“He is a bright and talented person without any doubt,” Putin said, calling Trump “an outstanding and talented personality.”
Did Putin know something about the 2016 US presidential elections that the pollsters didn’t? No, but the Kremlin leader did little to conceal his dislike of Hillary Clinton, then the likely Democratic nominee.
And when purloined Democratic National Committee emails were leaked just ahead of the Democratic National Convention, Putin did not hide his glee.
While US officials pointed a firm finger of blame at Russia for the hack, Putin denied the Russian state had anything to do with it. And in remarks at the same forum in September 2016, he praised the leak as a sort of service to the voters, saying, “The important thing is the content that was given to the public.”
That content being the embarrassing revelation in the leaked emails that Democratic officials gave preferential treatment to Clinton.
In other words, the whole DNC hack episode supported the Kremlin’s view that American democracy is a sham: Nothing matters but power, everything is decided in smoke-filled rooms, and hectoring countries like Russia about adherence to democracy and human rights is hypocritical.
Putin’s view of the American political system makes even more sense when we are reminded of an insight from exiled Russian political journalist Mikhail Zygar, the author of “All the Kremlin’s Men.”
Zygar noted that Putin loved “House of Cards” – the darkly cynical television series about Washington politics – and even recommended it to his ministers.
“That’s his American politics textbook,” Zygar said in an interview.
It’s also possible that Putin was simply trolling Harris by winking at a consistent insult from Trump about the way she laughs.
So if Putin’s take on US election politics is seen through the lens of “House of Cards,” then, Putin’s support of Harris is a sort of Frank Underwood move: A kind of endorsement poisonous to its recipient.

W0RL9FNFIJ_3X50126GHUAEYPM,Cathay Pacific inspects entire A350 fleet after finding engine problems,"By Chris Lau and Juliana Liu, CNN","4 minute read Updated 3:42 AM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240903,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/02/business/hong-kong-cathay-pacific-a350-hnk-intl/,"Hong Kong’s flag carrier Cathay Pacific has canceled dozens of flights as it conducts an inspection of its entire Airbus A350 fleet after finding engine problems affecting the plane.
The airline, one of the world’s largest users of the long-haul jet, said it identified an engine component failure on flight CX383 from Hong Kong to Zurich on Monday. The plane later returned to Hong Kong.
“This component was the first of its type to suffer such failure on any A350 aircraft worldwide,” Cathay said in a statement sent to CNN. A thorough inspection of its 48-plane fleet revealed “a number of the same engine components that need to be replaced,” it added. It did not detail the nature of the engine issue.
By Tuesday afternoon, the company said it had identified 15 aircraft with affected engine parts that require replacement. Three had been fixed, it said, adding that all affected aircraft will resume operations by Saturday.
Cathay had earlier canceled 24 flights operating over Monday and Tuesday amid inspection and repair work. The carrier is expected to cancel 10 regional return flights on Wednesday, but long-haul services should not be affected, it said.
According to Reuters, which cited an unnamed source, the incident involved a problem with a fuel nozzle, a component that directs fuel inside the engine. CNN has reached out to Cathay for additional comment.
The issue affecting the A350 has emerged after rival Boeing (BA) suffered a number of serious and high-profile problems. The American plane maker has spent months embroiled in a safety crisis since the mid-air blowout of one of its door plugs on a 737 Max flight operated by Alaska Airlines earlier this year.
Cathay said it had contacted the aircraft manufacturer about the engine problem, as well as the engine maker, Rolls-Royce, and regulators. According to Airbus, the A350 family uses two Trent XWB turbofan engine models from Rolls-Royce. An Airbus spokesperson referred questions to Rolls-Royce.
The British aerospace company confirmed in a statement that flight CX383 was “powered by Trent XWB-97 engines,” adding it was “committed to working closely with the airline, aircraft manufacturer and the relevant authorities to support their investigation into this incident.” Its London-traded shares closed more than 6% lower on Monday.
Shukor Yusof, founder of Endau Analytics, a firm that tracks the aviation industry, said the A350 was “very safe,” but the problem appeared to be arising out of logistical delays involving components, parts and other engine materials.
“Other airlines are affected, too, albeit on different scales, but the problem isn’t going away anytime soon due to manpower shortages, among other things,” he added.
Air traffic tracking website Flightradar24 showed that CX383, normally a 13-hour flight, took off from Hong Kong International Airport on Monday at 4:24pm local time. The engine issue appears to have been spotted quickly.

Instead of going north, the A350-1000 flew south and made circles near Hong Kong before diverting back to the city. It landed safely about 75 minutes later.
The Trent engine in question was harshly criticized by Tim Clark, president of Emirates, at the Dubai Airshow in November, according to Reuters.
At the time, Clark reportedly dismissed a possible deal to buy A350-1000 jets, the larger of two models offered by Airbus, blaming a dispute with Rolls-Royce over the poorer-than-expected durability of its engines and pressure for higher servicing prices.
Rolls-Royce later said it was working on improving the Trent XWB-97 engines and denied that it was defective, according to Reuters. Months later, in August, engine problems — among other challenges — hit Boeing.
An issue affecting the plane maker’s long-delayed 777X aircraft dealt yet another blow to its reputation for quality. Boeing said it had paused testing after discovering problems in a structural component between the engine and the plane’s wings in a test flight.
Boeing said in a statement that it had identified a component that did not perform as designed and that it was replacing the part.
The 777X, billed by Boeing as the “world’s largest and most efficient twin-engine jet,” was supposed to enter service four years ago. It had been expected to have delivered several hundred of the planes by now. But it has been plagued by delays and cost overruns. It now has a revised launch date of 2025.

W2KXS0GZ0Q_DE7YFDVT7LNAC0X,Police kill armed man near Israeli consulate in Munich terror attack,"By Claudia Otto, Stephanie Halasz and Matthies Otto, CNN","4 minute read Updated 2:21 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/05/europe/munich-police-shoot-armed-suspect-intl/,"German police shot dead an armed man after a terror attack near the Israeli consulate in central Munich on Thursday, officers said, prompting an investigation by state prosecutors.
The suspect – an 18-year-old Austrian citizen – was armed with an older rifle with a mounted bayonet when he was shot on Karolinenplatz, a square near the Israeli consulate and a Nazi documentation center, according to police in Munich.
The suspect was fatally injured after shots were exchanged, Munich police said in a post on X. Five officers were involved in the shootout, according to Andreas Franken, a police spokesperson.

At least 500 personnel were called to the scene in Munich’s city center, Bavarian Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann said. A helicopter was deployed to provide a more detailed assessment of the incident, according to Reuters.
There is no indication other suspects may be involved, police added. Authorities assume the attack was planned, Herrmann told reporters on Tuesday. The teenager had parked a car near the scene of the shooting.
One unnamed eyewitness told German media that he heard several bullets fired, before police shot the suspect to the ground.
“I heard several shots and, as a member of a shooting club, I knew immediately that they were firing,” the 65-year-old man told Bild newspaper. “It took several minutes for the first police officers to come up behind him. They then shot him at least 30 to 40 times. After that, I just heard them shouting: ‘He’s lying on the ground, he’s not moving.’”
The suspect may have been influenced by religious extremism, the Bavarian attorney general’s office said on Tuesday, after launching an investigation into the shooting.
“There are indications that the perpetrator was known in the Islamist environment. The investigation is ongoing, so nothing concrete can be said at this stage,” chief public prosecutor Florian Weinzierl, said on Thursday. Officials will investigate whether other people knew about the crime.
The suspect was already known to police in February 2023, after making a dangerous threat against pupils and causing bodily harm, according to the Austrian police department in Salzburg.
He was also accused of participating in a terrorist organization, and was active online. The teenager was also interested in explosives and weapons, the police department added. In April 2023, the Salzburg public prosecutor’s office dropped all charges, following an investigation.
Authorities confirmed a weapons ban against the then 17-year-old, which was scheduled to remain in place until at least the beginning of 2028. He had not been reported to officers since then, the police department added.
The incident took place on the anniversary of the 1972 Munich Olympics terror attack – when a Palestinian militant group entered the quarters of Israel’s national team. Eleven Israeli athletes were killed in the ensuing standoff.
It is not clear if Thursday’s incident is at connected to the 1972 event, but the Israeli consulate nearby was closed for a commemoration.
Bavarian Minister President Markus Soeder cautioned there is a “terrible suspicion” that the shooting was linked to the anniversary, but said more clarification was needed to determine the motive.
“The protection of Jewish institutions is of central importance to us,” he said in a press conference on Tuesday. “The motives and backgrounds of the perpetrators will certainly have to be determined in the coming hours, but one thing is clear, there is a serious suspicion, because today is the anniversary of the attack in Munich in 1972, there may be a connection.”
On Facebook, Talya Lador-Fresher, the Israeli consul general in Munich said, “We are very grateful to the police in Munich for their actions and cooperation. This event shows how dangerous the rise of Antisemitism is. It is important that the general public speaks against this. Our Consulate General was closed today to commemorate 52 years since the terrorist attack at the Olympics.”
Chancellor Olaf Scholz condemned the terror attack on Thursday.
“Let me be clear: anti-Semitism and Islamism have no place in our country,” he said in a post on X. “The quick reaction of the emergency services in Munich today may have prevented something terrible from happening. I am very grateful to them for that.”
The incident came on the heels of a divisive round of regional elections in Germany – after the Alternative for Germany (AfD) became the first far-right party to win a state election in the country since the Nazi era, on Sunday.

He explained that he had suffered a “health hiccup,” since diagnosed as a “minor stroke,” and went “blue lights flashing” to the hospital when he couldn’t use his arm last week, but he reassured fans that he had since recovered enough to play his guitar.
Although May is most famous as a founding member of Queen and for writing some of the legendary rock band’s biggest hits, including “We Will Rock You” and “Who Wants to Live Forever,” he has also enjoyed a career as an astrophysicist and animal rights activist.
“Good news is that I can play guitar after the events of the last few days,” he said, adding that it “was a little scary” but that he “had the most fantastic care and attention from Frimley Hospital.”

He said he was “okay” and “just doing what I’m told, which is basically nothing,” listing the things he can’t do at the moment like drive, get on a plane or raise his heart rate too high.
As he spoke, a plane flew overhead and he joked that “I’m not allowed to have planes flying over, which will stress me.”
Later in the video, May also spoke about his recently released documentary detailing his decade-long campaign to stop Britain’s controversial badger cull.
The musician has suffered from a series of health issues in recent years.
In May 2020, he had a heart attack, after which he had three stents – short, wire-mesh tubes that act like a scaffold to help keep an artery open – put in to alleviate the danger of blood supply being blocked from the heart.
Afterward, May told the television show “Good Morning Britain” that he nearly died when he suffered a range of complications, including a stomach hemorrhage as a result of the medication he was taking for his heart.
In March last year, he was knighted by King Charles III for his services to music and charity.

WCJ7ZGQOM4_ORMHYFX1RIZXA3F,Ian McKellen says ‘Lord of the Rings’ filmmakers ‘better be quick’ if they want him back as Gandalf,"By Lisa Respers France, CNN","1 minute read Updated 3:50 PM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240902,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/02/entertainment/ian-mckellen-lord-rings-gandalf/,"Sir Ian McKellen is willing to reprise his role as Gandalf in the “Lord of the Rings” franchise, but it needs to happen soon.
“I’ve just been told there are going to be more films and Gandalf will be involved and they hope that I’ll be playing him,” the actor, 85, told Big Issue magazine. “When? I don’t know. What the script is? It’s not written yet. So they better be quick!”
McKellen fell in June during a performance of “Player Kings,” a new version of Shakespeare’s “Henry IV,” in London.
He told the publication he wonders if the fall happened because he is elderly.
“I’m just trying to convince myself it was an accident,” McKellen said.
“I’m left feeling weak physically, which I’m doing exercises for,” he added. “And, of course, it’s emotional. We all trip all our lives, it’s just when you get to my age you can’t always get up again.”
The legendary actor has appeared in multiple “Lord of the Rings” films and likes being busy.
“I’m usually working or preparing to work, I’ve been doing a little bit of that, wondering what might be the best plan,” he said. “I’m going to take the rest of the year off. Not because I need to, just because I want to.”"

The Chinese Coast Guard (CCG) said a Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) ship had “deliberately collided” with one of its vessels near the disputed Sabina Shoal, according to state broadcaster CCTV.
“At 12:06, the Philippine ship No. 9701 deliberately collided with the Chinese ship No. 5205, which was normally enforcing rights and law enforcement, in an unprofessional and dangerous manner, resulting in a collision. The responsibility lies entirely with the Philippines,” CCG spokesman Liu Dejun said on Saturday.
PCG spokesperson Jay Tarriela said the Chinese side had “deliberately rammed” a Philippines vessel.
“This afternoon, the Chinese Coast Guard vessel deliberately rammed and collided with the BRP Teresa Magbanua three times, despite no provocation from the Philippine Coast Guard,” he wrote in a post on X.

The dueling accounts come as Chinese and Philippine vessels have engaged in multiple collisions and face-offs over the past week near Sabina Shoal, also known as Xianbin Reef.
The disputed atoll lies just 86 miles from the Philippines’ west coast and 745 miles from China.
A spokesperson for the US State Department said it condemned China for “deliberately colliding three times” with the Philippine vessel.
“On multiple occasions throughout August 2024, (China) has aggressively disrupted lawful Philippine aerial and maritime operations in the South China Sea, including at Sabina Shoal,” said the spokesperson Matthew Miller said.
Miller added that the US called on China to comply with international law and “desist from dangerous and destabilizing conduct.”
China claims almost all of the South China Sea as its sovereign territory despite an international ruling to the contrary.
The escalation in tensions comes just weeks after Beijing and Manila struck a temporary deal to lower tensions that had been rising all summer at another nearby reef, where China’s increasingly aggressive tactics had raised alarm across the region as well as in Washington, a mutual defense ally of the Philippines.

WNCZH5WQCQ_WWY3KZTUTDYBSRZ,"Israel’s military says six hostages ‘brutally murdered’ in Gaza, including Israeli-American Goldberg-Polin","By Alex Stambaugh, Nectar Gan and Jeremy Diamond, CNN","8 minute read Updated 11:58 AM EDT, Sun September 1, 2024",20240901,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/08/31/middleeast/israeli-american-hostage-hersh-goldberg-polin-death-intl-hnk,"Israel’s military said it has recovered the bodies of six hostages killed by Hamas militants in Gaza – including an Israeli-American captive – dealing fresh heartbreak to relatives who fear time is running out for loved ones seized by the militants more than 10 months ago.
Israeli soldiers found the six bodies in tunnels under the enclave, according to the military. The hostages were “brutally murdered by Hamas terrorists, a short while before we reached them,” Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said in a briefing Sunday.
The development has sparked protests across Israel, with fresh public anger directed at Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his cabinet for failing to secure a hostage deal. Israel’s largest trade union has also called for a nationwide strike starting Monday.
Three of the six whose bodies were recovered had been expected to be released during the first phase of an eventual ceasefire agreement, two Israeli officials have told CNN.
Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Eden Yerushalmi and Carmel Gat were slated to be released as part of a “humanitarian category,” based on a framework agreed by Israel and Hamas in early July, the officials said.
“Our prime minister delayed it,” one of the Israeli officials said. “It’s way too late for the six who have been killed, but it’s time to reach an agreement.”
The ordeal of California native Goldberg-Polin, who was taken at gunpoint at the Nova music festival on October 7, led to him becoming one of the faces of the devastating international hostage crisis that has challenged Netanyahu’s leadership and triggered widespread destruction in Gaza.
The parents of 23-year-old Goldberg-Polin have been among the most vocal of the hostage families pushing Netanyahu to seek a deal securing their relatives’ return. Their tireless and high-profile campaigning saw them meet with world leaders, and earlier this month, give an emotional address at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago.

“With broken hearts, the Goldberg-Polin family is devastated to announce the death of their beloved son and brother, Hersh. The family thanks you all for your love and support and asks for privacy at this time,” the family said in a statement Sunday.
The Israeli military named the other three victims as Almog Sarusi, Alex Lobanov and Ori Danino. CNN is reaching out to their families.
In a taped message Sunday, Netanyahu said he had been shocked to the core by what he said was “the terrible cold-blooded murder of six of our hostages.” He also stressed that “those who murder hostages do not want a deal.”
He said Israel would continue to pursue Hamas, and accused it of not wanting to conduct genuine negotiations since December.
“Three months ago, on May 27, Israel agreed to a hostage release deal with the full backing of the United States. Hamas refused. Even after the United States updated the outline of the deal on August 16 – we agreed, and Hamas again refused.”
He added that the Israeli government and he, personally, are “committed to continue working towards a deal that will bring back all our hostages and guarantee our security and existence.”
In response, the Hostages Families Forum, a volunteer-based organization that represents relatives of those held captive, criticized the Prime Minister, calling on him to “stop blaming everyone” and to “take responsibility” for his alleged failures.
“Take responsibility for the thwarting (of a deal). Take responsibility for the neglect. Take responsibility for the hostages who were murdered in captivity,” the Forum demanded in a statement.
The Forum also said Netanyahu had ignored the views of the security establishment in insisting on conditions in the negotiations.
“Hamas is not the only one responsible for the thwarting of the deal. We do not expect the terrorist (Hamas leader Yahya) Sinwar to want to return the hostages, we expect the Prime Minister of Israel to do everything, everything, everything in order to return the hostages home.”
The Forum has called for demonstrations across Israel, while also announcing a vigil honoring the “hostages murdered in Gaza by Hamas” in Tel Aviv at 6 p.m. local time (11 a.m. ET).
US President Joe Biden said the bodies of the hostages were recovered under the city of Rafah in southern Gaza.
“I am devastated and outraged,” Biden said in a statement released by the White House that also paid tribute to Goldberg-Polin’s parents.
“They have been courageous, wise, and steadfast, even as they have endured the unimaginable,” Biden said. “They have been relentless and irrepressible champions of their son and of all the hostages held in unconscionable conditions.”
Goldberg-Polin’s death in particular will reverberate not just in Israel but in US political circles.
His parents Rachel and Jonathan have regularly met top US officials in Washington to press the case of the hostages, and their emotional address to top Democrats at the convention earlier this month inextricably tied the hostages’ fate to US policy over the war in Gaza.
Rachel Goldberg-Polin told CNN in January that she wears a piece of tape marking each day that has passed since her son was kidnapped.
At her convention speech, she described life since October 7 as like living on “another planet.”
“Anyone who is a parent or has had a parent can try to imagine the anguish and misery that Jon and I and all the hostage families are enduring,” she told delegates.
Some of those discovered dead in the tunnels under Gaza this weekend were, like Goldberg-Polin, captured at the Nova music festival. Lobanov, a 32-year-old father of two, and Yerushalmi, 24, were both tending bar at the gathering, according to the Hostages Families Forum. Danino, 25, and Sarusi, 27, were also at the festival.
Gat, 40, was taken from Kibbutz Be’eri. She had been visiting her parents when Hamas militants stormed the community close to Gaza’s border, killing and taking hostages as they went.
News of more hostage deaths piles pressure on Netanyahu as anger inside Israel swells over the failure to strike a ceasefire deal, and as stark disagreements between the prime minister and his military leaders increasingly spill out into the open.
A number of protests sparked across Israel on Sunday, with demonstrators’ anger directed at the government’s handling of the crisis.
Protests have occurred or are ongoing in Tel Aviv, Ra’anana, Rehovot and Be’er Sheva. In several instances, protesters have blocked roads – demanding an immediate agreement to secure the remaining hostages’ release. The banner at one protest read: “Look them in the eyes.”
The chairman of Israel’s General Federation of Labor (Histadrut) Arnon Bar-David has also called for a nationwide general strike to begin on Monday at 6 a.m. local time, after holding a “charged and difficult” meeting with representatives of hostage families in Tel Aviv.
“I will not tolerate the neglect,” Bar-David stated, emphasizing the urgency of the situation of the hostages in Gaza. Histadrut is the country’s biggest labor union.
“We are in a downward spiral, and we don’t stop receiving body bags. Only a strike would shock, and that’s why I’ve decided that starting tomorrow at six in the morning, the entire Israeli economy will shut down,” the labor leader said.
The hostage deaths up the stakes for Biden to push US ally Israel to find a way out of a devastating war in Gaza that has inflamed global public opinion and repeatedly threatened to spiral into an all-out regional conflict.
“Make no mistake, Hamas leaders will pay for these crimes. And we will keep working around the clock for a deal to secure the release of the remaining hostages,” Biden said in his statement on Goldberg-Polin’s death.
Israeli President Isaac Herzog said “the heart of an entire nation is shattered to pieces” by the news of the six dead.
“On behalf of the State of Israel, I embrace their families with all my heart, and apologize for failing to bring them home safely,” Herzog said in a statement.
“We will continue to fight relentlessly against the criminal, terrorist organization Hamas, which has once again proven there is no end to its willingness to commit murder and crimes against humanity.”
Israel launched its war against Hamas in Gaza after the militant group’s October 7 cross-border attacks, in which more than 1,200 Israelis were killed and 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli authorities.
More than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the war began, according to the health ministry in the enclave.
Anger has been growing inside Israel, led by many hostage families who believe Netanyahu and key far-right cabinet colleagues have been stalling on achieving a ceasefire resolution with Hamas that might bring those captured and killed home.
Netanyahu has been adamant that a deal can only be signed when Israel’s safety is assured.
But domestic pressure is building,  with the Hostages Families Forum being among the most critical of the Israeli prime minister.
“The delay in signing the deal has led to their deaths and those of many other hostages,” the forum said in a statement in English on Sunday.
“We call to Netanyahu: Stop hiding. Provide the public with a justification for this ongoing abandonment,” the forum added.
Biden said Saturday evening that his staff has been in touch with Israeli officials. Biden also called for an end to the war, expressing optimism that an agreement could be reached on a ceasefire-for-hostages deal and adding that parties involved in the negotiation have said they “agree on the principles.”
“It’s time this war ended,” Biden added. “I think we’re on the verge of having an agreement. It’s time to end it. It’s time to finish it.”
The US, Qatar and Egypt, who have acted as mediators, this month renewed a push to reach a hostage and ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas.
The mediators have proposed a three-phase approach: a first phase involving a six-week ceasefire; a second phase that would release all hostages and a withdrawal of all IDF presence from Gaza; and a third reconstruction phase.

WRORDM5818_H8A6NQNCTVZ68D0,2024 race hits critical stretch as debate approaches and first ballots are set to go out,"By Eric Bradner, CNN","9 minute read Updated 9:51 AM EDT, Sun September 1, 2024",20240901,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/01/politics/2024-debate-ballots-harris-trump/,"The 2024 presidential race is entering a critical stretch, with Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump set to debate and the first swing state ballots hitting mailboxes shortly after the Labor Day holiday weekend.
As the calendar turns to September, both campaigns are focusing on on key battleground states — with Harris eyeing an expanded map and Trump digging in across the Upper Midwestern states that delivered him the presidency in 2016 and ousted him from office in 2020.
Meanwhile, voting will begin this week. The first ballots of the 2024 election will go out Friday in North Carolina, one of a handful of potentially critical Sun Belt states. Then, two weeks later, early in-person voting starts in Minnesota, South Dakota and Virginia.
Harris last week focused on the Sun Belt, with a bus tour in Georgia and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, also visiting North Carolina.
“I think we know: Very difficult for a Republican presidential candidate to win the White House if they can’t win North Carolina,” Walz said Thursday during a stop at a campaign field office in Raleigh.
Harris’ campaign is pouring money into advertising in the Savannah media market as it seeks to broaden its appeal outside Atlanta. According to AdImpact data, Harris’ campaign has spent a total of about $1.7 million in advertising there over the last three weeks.
Harris’ top campaign adviser said in a memo Sunday the vice president remains the “clear underdog” in the race, setting expectations and looking to guard against complacency as the fall campaign season begins.
Jen O’Malley Dillon, the Harris campaign chair, wrote that Trump retains a “motivated base of support,” and predicted a close contest.
Pointing to the September 10 debate and an increased pace of travel, O’Malley Dillon said the weeks ahead will be critical in defining the Democratic ticket.
Trump, meanwhile, has turned his attention to the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, holding events in all three states late in the week and promising an economic revival.
“I’m here today with a simple message for the American autoworker and for the American worker: Your long economic nightmare will very soon be over,” the former president said at the start of his remarks at a steel distribution company in Potterville, Michigan.
The candidates are interspersing their campaigning with preparation for their September 10 debate, hosted by ABC. That debate — the first between Harris and Trump, and the only one both campaigns have agreed to so far — could prove the most pivotal moment in the 2024 race.
Trump has enlisted the help of former Hawaii Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, whose failed 2020 presidential bid featured several notable clashes on debate stages with Harris over foreign policy and Harris’ record on criminal justice. Harris, meanwhile, is working closely with Philippe Reines, a longtime aide to Hillary Clinton, who is reprising his role playing Trump at the request of the Harris campaign.
Polls show a tight race nationwide and in critical swing states. A Wall Street Journal survey released Thursday found no clear leader, with Harris at 48% to Trump’s 47% among registered voters. A Quinnipiac University poll out the same day similarly found Harris at 49% and Trump at 47% among likely voters.
Sun Belt states that once appeared to have slipped out of Democratic reach have reemerged on the battleground map since Harris became the party’s nominee. Fox News polls released Wednesday found no clear leader among registered voters in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and South Carolina. The polls found Harris at 50% to Trump’s 49% in Arizona; those numbers flipped, with Trump at 50% and Harris at 49%, in North Carolina. In both Georgia and Nevada, Harris was at 50% to Trump’s 48%.
More than a month after the Democratic change at the top of the ticket, with President Joe Biden dropping his reelection bid and Harris stepping in, Democrats believe they still have momentum.
Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz said in an interview that the race has shifted from one where Democrats were on track to lose and in need of a fundamental shake-up, to one where Republicans are “hoping that there’s some catastrophic moment” in which Harris blows it.
“They’re clearly taken aback by a change in the candidate. But it’s the candidacy that I think is throwing them off. They’ve never run with against someone with such an orientation towards the future,” Schatz said.
“It was always about how you felt about Donald Trump – you were either for Donald Trump or not for Donald Trump or ambivalent. And I think what’s happening is after more than eight years a lot of people would just like not to talk about that man anymore,” he said. “Lots of politicians have attempted to be the leader that could help us to turn the page as a nation and Kamala Harris is evidently the only one that is capable of doing that.”
Republicans, meanwhile, are arguing that Harris’ economic proposals, and her promises of a new era in American politics, are hollow, since she has been vice president for three and a half years and bears at least partial ownership of Biden’s record.
“If she wants to tackle the affordability crisis or close down the southern border, she should be doing it now,” Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance said Friday on “CNN News Central.” “And I think it takes a lot of shame — shamelessness, I should say — to be able to stare at the American people’s eyes and say, I’m going to fix your problems now, when I’ve already been in power for three and a half years.”
Polls have shown Trump with an advantage among men who are likely to vote, but Harris with a huge edge with women. That split is common in presidential elections, but Trump is attempting to chip away at Harris’ advantage with women in part through a focus on reproductive rights.
It’s a topic that has been a huge Democratic advantage since the Supreme Court, with a conservative majority that includes three members appointed by Trump, in 2022 overturned Roe v. Wade’s nationwide abortion rights protections — opening the door to a new patchwork of state-level restrictions.
Trump last week infuriated conservatives with his answer to a question about how he plans to vote on a referendum that will decide the future of abortion access in his home state of Florida.
Under current Florida law, abortion is illegal in most cases after six weeks. Voters this fall will decide on a ballot measure that would make abortion legal in the state up to the point of viability, which many experts believe is around 23 or 24 weeks of a pregnancy.
Trump had repeatedly declined to weigh in on the referendum, but on Thursday, he told NBC that Florida’s six-week ban was “too short” and said he would be “voting that we need more than six weeks.”
A day later, he said he was going to vote “no” on the referendum and, in explaining why he was doing so, repeated a false claim that Democratic states are passing laws that allow people to execute babies after birth.
Also on Thursday, while campaigning in Michigan and Wisconsin, he offered a new proposal aimed at women, pledging universal coverage of in vitro fertilization.
“Under the Trump administration, your government will pay for – or your insurance company will be mandated to pay for – all costs associated with IVF treatment,” Trump said during a campaign event in Michigan. “Because we want more babies, to put it nicely.”
However, senators in his own party, including his running mate, Vance, defeated a bill with a similar provision earlier this summer.
On a Harris campaign call with reporters on Friday, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren said Trump’s promise to have fertility treatments paid for is “just smoke and mirrors” without a commitment to protect the treatments from legal threats.
She pointed to the Alabama Supreme Court ruling earlier this year that deemed that frozen embryos are children, jeopardizing the legality of IVF treatments before Alabama’s Republican governor signed a law protecting IVF access in the state after Trump said he supports the treatment.
She also cited a Senate bill to codify access to IVF nationwide that was blocked by Republicans in June and a House GOP bill that seeks to legally define life as beginning at the moment of conception or fertilization to draw the contrast on protections for reproductive health care.
“Making vague promises about insurance coverage does not stop a single extremist judge or state legislature from banning IVF. Making vague promises about insurance coverage does not stop a single one of the 131 Republicans in Congress from advancing their fetal personhood bill that would ban IVF. Despite what Trump seems to think, American women are smart and we aren’t falling for his gaslighting,” Warren said.
Harris’ campaign on Friday also countered Trump by announcing a new bus tour aimed at advocating for women’s reproductive rights. The “Fighting for Reproductive Freedom” bus tour will kick off Tuesday in Palm Beach, Florida – Trump’s hometown – with Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Harris-Walz campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez, CNN senior political commentator Ana Navarro and reproductive rights storyteller Anya Cook.
It wasn’t just Trump’s pledge of universal coverage of IVF that lacked details.
Both Harris and Trump have discussed policy through the lens of details and aspirations, rather than addressing the difficult questions about the exact contours of their proposals, how they’d win approval on Capitol Hill and how they’d be funded — all of which would confront them in the Oval Office.
Harris has said she would aim to help the middle class by targeting price-gouging, making housing more affordable through $25,000 in down-payment support for first-time homebuyers, offering a child tax credit, lowering drug prices and creating new jobs.
Trump, meanwhile, has pledged the largest deportation effort in US history, and has said it would involve the National Guard and perhaps the military. But he has not addressed how he would solve the constitutional, logistical and manpower issues that such an undertaking would involve.
He has also ducked specific questions about abortion rights, claiming he could bring about a national consensus policy on an issue that has been a wedge in American politics for more than 50 years.
In fact, the most detailed policy blueprint in the 2024 race — “Project 2025,” a 920-page document organized by The Heritage Foundation think tank and developed in significant part by people who served in Trump’s administration — is one Harris’ campaign has used to attack Trump, while the former president distanced himself from it.
The missing details could be fleshed out when Harris and Trump meet for their first debate on September 10. Another key moment will come on October 1, when CBS hosts the vice presidential debate between Harris’ running mate, Walz, and Trump’s No. 2, Vance.

WUMDNOC3FY_IH7LFMUVPG8IUVS,Independent Russian watchmaker upends race to design world’s thinnest wristwatch,"By Oscar Holland, CNN","4 minute read Updated 12:19 AM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/05/style/konstantin-chaykin-thinking-worlds-thinnest-watch/,"In recent years, the giants of European horology have been locked in a heated battle to design the world’s thinnest mechanical watch.
Luxury brands Bulgari, Piaget and Richard Mille have all, since 2018, held the coveted record, which was most recently broken by Bulgari’s sleek 1.7-millimeter-thick Octo Finissimo Ultra Mark II, in April.
But now, an independent Russian watchmaker and inventor may have trumped them all.
Moscow-based Konstantin Chaykin says his new ThinKing prototype, which he debuted at the Geneva Watch Days fair in Switzerland last week, is just 1.65 millimeters (less than one-fifteenth of an inch) thick. He also believes it to be among the world’s lightest watches, weighing just 13.3 grams (less than 0.47 ounces), without its strap.
In an email to CNN, Chaykin said he has developed various innovations to make his design thinner “without compromising its functionality,” including a winding mechanism that is integrated into the barrel of the watch. The ThinKing also features a “double balance” wheel that allowed Chaykin to reduce the number of layers in the watch movement.
Mechanisms for winding the watch and adjusting its dials are, meanwhile, found in a separate 5.4-millimeter-thick carrier case, freeing up space (though the ThinKing can also be wound with a key). Chaykin said he has filed several patent applications, though none have yet been granted.
The watch is made using stainless steel and tungsten carbide, a light but exceptionally rigid compound. Chaykin, who is the only Russian member of the prestigious Académie Horlogère des Créateurs Indépendants, said he is also considering using sapphires or diamonds in future versions of the watch, according to his brand’s website.
With the hour and minute displays separate from one another, the design resembles a face — a hallmark of the watchmaker’s signature Wristmons collection. The dials are each protected by 0.35-millimeter-thick (0.014-inch) sapphire crystals.
Producing ultra-slim watches that are reliable, accurate and durable enough to wear has posed a major technical challenge to the world’s watchmakers. But the race to design ever-thinner watches appears to have accelerated in recent years.
Swiss brand Piaget debuted its 2-millimeter-thick Altiplano Ultimate Concept, then the world’s slimmest, in 2018, before putting it into production two years later. Luxury giant Bulgari then took the crown with the first iteration of its Octo Finissimo Ultra, which came in at just 1.8 millimeters.

Watchmaker Richard Mille soon went 0.05 millimeters thinner — a difference equivalent to a piece of printer paper — in 2022, with its RM UP-01 Ferrari. Bulgari then reclaimed the title this year with its aforementioned Octo Finissimo Ultra Mark II, a limited-edition model that was widely reported to cost over $500,000.
Whether Chaykin’s ThinKing can now be considered the record-holder, however, may be a matter of debate in horology circles. (Guinness World Records does not currently list an independently adjudicated record for thinnest watch.)
For one, the ThinKing is currently just a prototype — and its functionality and accuracy are yet to be independently assessed. Describing it as “more of a design and engineering study at this point,” James Stacey, lead editor of online watch magazine Hodinkee, wrote last week that he was “sure any sort of record-setting will be with (a) for-production (rather than) than non-production” timepiece.
The design is also so thin that it requires a special strap, featuring titanium supports and elastic inserts, to protect it from the shocks and stresses of everyday wear.
Chaykin nonetheless believes his prototype’s timekeeping accuracy and 32-hour power reserve qualify it as the new record-holder. He welcomed outside assessment, telling CNN that during the five-day Geneva Watch Days fair “hundreds of people” were able to inspect his creation.
“Visitors were able to hold the watch in their hands, check the time and test its functionality,” he said. “It is quite a bold step on our part to show the prototype in this way.  But the watch, to our delight, works perfectly, and to the delight of the visitors, it was possible to touch the watch… However, we are prepared to carry out all the necessary independent tests.”
The watchmaker said he will present a “final” version of his design at the Watches & Wonders trade show, also in Geneva, next April. By that time, the updated design should feature improved accuracy, power reserve and “tightness,” among other things, he told CNN. He added that the watch’s price “is not yet known.”

In a separate statement, Chaykin, who founded his eponymous watchmaking brand in 2003, said he became interested in slim timepieces after encountering an ultra-thin 19th-century Bagnolet pocket watch around 20 years ago.
He was inspired to make one after being challenged by a client to design an ultra-thin watch of his own. “I initially considered many possibilities and dedicated an entire Moleskine (notebook) to finding technical solutions,” he is quoted saying.
Chaykin’s statement also compared the process of configuring the watch’s inner workings to a puzzle. “As with any good puzzle, I had to tinker, look for non-trivial solutions, choose the best options and calculate the energy flows,” he added."
X0DFK7AUSY_P4CYSRYNKWCH2ZW,Another plane linked to Venezuela’s Maduro is under investigation in the Dominican Republic,"By Jessica Hasbun, CNNE","3 minute read Updated 8:31 PM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/04/americas/venezuela-nicolas-maduro-plane-dominican-republic-intl-latam/,"A second plane linked to Venezuelan strongman President Nicolas Maduro is being investigated in the Dominican Republic, a source with knowledge of the situation told CNN.
This second plane, a Dassault Falcon 2000 registration number YV3360, is similar to the aircraft seized by authorities in the United States on Monday, and it appears on a US Treasury list of sanctioned goods belonging to Maduro.
Both planes were sent to Santo Domingo for maintenance in recent months, the source told CNN.
The plane seized by US authorities on Monday had been described by officials as Venezuela’s equivalent to Air Force One and was pictured in previous state visits by Maduro around the world.
It was seized after determining that its acquisition was in violation of US sanctions, among other criminal issues. The US flew the aircraft to Florida on Monday, according to two US officials.
US Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement that “the Justice Department seized an aircraft we allege was illegally purchased for $13 million through a shell company and smuggled out of the United States for use by Nicolás Maduro and his cronies.”
The Venezuelan government described the first Falcon’s seizure as “piracy” in a statement on Monday, and accused Washington of escalating “aggression” toward Maduro’s government following a contested presidential election this July.
Related article Exclusive: US seizes Venezuela President Nicolas Maduro’s airplane in the Dominican Republic
The Dominican Republic’s President, Luis Abinader, said the plane seized Monday was not registered under the name of the Venezuelan government but rather under “the name of an individual.”
The country’s Attorney General’s Office received an order last May from a national court to “immobilize” the plane, according to the Dominican Republic’s foreign minister, Roberto Álvarez. The US had requested it be immobilized so they could search it for “evidence and objects linked to fraud activities, smuggling of goods for illicit activities and money laundering,” he said.
Monday’s seizure in the Dominican Republic marked an escalation as the US continues to investigate what it regards as corrupt practices by Venezuela’s government.
“This sends a message all the way up to the top,” one of the US officials told CNN. “Seizing the foreign head of state’s plane is unheard-of for criminal matters. We’re sending a clear message here that no one is above the law, no one is above the reach of US sanctions.”
It also comes as the US recently placed pressure on the Venezuelan government to “immediately” release specific data regarding its presidential election, citing concerns about the credibility of Maduro’s claimed victory in the recent presidential election.
Venezuela’s opposition has published more than 80% of tallies printed and collected from voting machines across the country. Though partial, the documentation appears to show that the opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia actually won the vote, several experts told CNN.

X2CKG4QOUD_D5JVPQ7E9H37UK8,Retired federal judge and ethics experts want Judge Cannon taken off Trump documents case,"By Tierney Sneed, CNN","3 minute read Updated 8:25 AM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/03/politics/retired-judge-wants-cannon-removed-trump-documents/,"A former federal judge along with a government watchdog group and two top scholars on judicial ethics want an appeals court to reassign the classified documents case against former President Donald Trump to a new judge.
The group is seeking to file an amicus brief with the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals, criticizing the way Judge Aileen Cannon, who dismissed the classified documents prosecution earlier this summer, has handled the criminal case.
They also took issue with Cannon allowing Trump to slow down the federal investigation in 2022 by appointing a special master to review evidence and blocking investigators’ access to documents seized at his Mar-a-Lago estate. The 11th Circuit reversed Cannon’s decisions on this matter.
Retired Judge Nancy Gertner, who was a federal trial judge in Massachusetts; legal ethics scholars Stephen Gillers and James J. Sample, and the government watchdog group known as Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington are seeking to file the brief with the Atlanta-based appeals court that is considering whether Cannon’s dismissal decision should be reversed. Cannon had said in her ruling that the appointment of special counsel Jack Smith violated the Constitution.
It is very rare for appeals courts to reassign a trial judge on a case. Smith notably did not request for Cannon to recuse herself or for the case to be reassigned in his filings. An amicus brief, or “friend of the court” brief, is from someone who is not a party to the case and is merely meant to provide information to the court. It is up to the court how much legal weight — if any at all – is given to an amicus brief.
Related article If the Trump classified documents case is reinstated, Judge Aileen Cannon would be difficult to remove
“Even before she dismissed the case on novel grounds that ignored both statutory authority and Supreme Court precedent, Judge Cannon’s other extraordinary rulings and sluggish case administration had provoked well-founded concerns that she might be biased against the Government’s case and unable to manage that case impartially,” they wrote in the proposed brief, which would need permission from the court to be allowed into the record.
They pointed to Cannon’s slowness to resolve issues in the criminal case that has been mired in delay, as well as her controversial request for lawyers on both sides to file briefs on a hypothetical jury instruction that would seem to virtually guarantee Trump’s acquittal.
“Judge Cannon’s conduct — including her solicitation of legally baseless jury instructions — has repeatedly appeared to cross the line from mere legal error to active judicial intervention and advocacy on behalf of the former president,” the proposed brief says.
Cannon’s critics argued in their proposed amicus brief that “rulings and other conduct create the appearance of an unshakeable conviction that subjecting a former president to ordinary criminal procedures represents an intolerable affront to his dignity.”

X3HP8CMZDV_AVHC9FDGR8SOV31,‘You can almost see the ground move’: State of emergency declared in California as land movement threatens power lines,"By Andy Rose, CNN","3 minute read Updated 10:28 PM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240826,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/02/us/rancho-palos-verdes-power-outages/,"California Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency Tuesday in the city of Rancho Palos Verdes as severe land shift in the area is threatening the community and disrupting power lines.
Emergency officials will be able to direct state resources toward responding to the threat of the land movement, the governor’s proclamation said.
More than 200 homes in the city, around 30 miles south of Los Angeles, had their power cut Monday as a long-running ground shift close to them is threatening utility lines.
“The city is located on four out of five sub-slides that comprise the Greater Portuguese Landslide Complex,” the governor’s office said. “Land movement at part of the Complex has significantly accelerated following severe storms in 2023 and 2024.”
“This is unprecedented,” Rancho Palos Verdes City Council member Barbara Ferraro said Sunday. “No one knows really, in a way, what to do.”
Southern California Edison cut off electricity Sunday to 140 homes in the Portuguese Bend community, an outage that it says is indefinite because the shifting ground threatens utility poles and raises the risk of fires in the city.
“There was a fire last week,” SoCal Edison spokesperson Kathleen Dunleavy told CNN affiliate KABC. “It was a small fire, but the fire was caused when one of our lines fell because of land movement, and that shows how dangerous this area is.”
An additional 105 customers lost power Monday evening as the company continues to monitor the threat from ground movement.
Rancho Palos Verdes is an oceanfront community in southwestern Los Angeles County, west of Long Beach. It was incorporated as an independent city in 1973.
Officials say the land there has been shifting slowly for decades, but the problem is worse than it used to be. “The movement has accelerated dramatically over the last 12 months, where some areas are moving up to 10 inches a week,” said City Council member David Bradley. “You can almost see the ground move.”

To encourage wary residents to heed evacuation warnings, Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said law enforcement is stepping up patrols in the community and launching drones to look for looting. “You’re going to jail if you come here to steal anything,” Luna said in a news conference on Sunday.
Rancho Palos Verdes has been under a local state of emergency since October 2023, and natural gas service was shut off in the Portuguese Bend neighborhood on July 29.
Fourth District Supervisor Janice Hahn said Sunday that Los Angeles County has set aside an additional $5 million to respond to the disaster.
“Yes, this landslide has been moving for decades, but the acceleration that’s happening currently is beyond what any of us could have foretold, and it demands more response from the state, more response from the federal government,” Hahn said.

X7XD1TAR03_31Q3QVHOMOXOGPT,A man accused of killing his girlfriend and leaving her body at Boston’s airport has been extradited to the US,"By Faith Karimi and Larry Madowo, CNN","3 minute read Published 10:14 AM EDT, Mon September 2, 2024",20240902,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/02/world/mbitu-killing-suspect-extradited-kenya-boston-cec/,"A man accused of killing his girlfriend in Boston and fleeing to Kenya has been extradited back to the United States — the latest twist in an international case that saw his arrest at a Nairobi nightclub and his escape from jail.
Kevin Kangethe, 42, is accused of killing nurse Margaret “Maggie” Mbitu, whose body was found in a parked car last November at Boston’s Logan International Airport, two days after she was reported missing. Authorities say he then immediately boarded a flight and fled the country.
For months, the suspect eluded authorities after he arrived in Kenya. In January, investigators spotted Kangethe at a nightclub in Nairobi and arrested him. He escaped from jail days later and was on the run for a week before he was rearrested in Nairobi in early February.
Kenya has an extradition treaty with the United States.
Kangethe’s extradition Sunday returns him to the jurisdiction of his alleged crime, some 7,000 miles away. He is expected to face a murder charge at Suffolk Superior Court on Tuesday, said Renson Ingonga, Kenya’s director of public prosecutions.
“I wish to reiterate my commitment and support, whenever needed, to the United States of America, and in particular the prosecution team as they proceed with the next phase of the case,” Ingonga said in a statement Monday.
Mbitu, 31, lived in Whitman, a Boston suburb, and was the youngest in a family of health care workers. Her two older sisters and her mother are all nurses.
She was reported missing in late October after she didn’t show up for work, which was uncommon for her.
Her family notified the police and called nearby hospitals to check if she was a patient. Investigators believed her boyfriend was a suspect, according to a criminal complaint from the state police.
With the help of surveillance cameras, police tracked his Toyota SUV to the airport and found it in a parking garage. Inside they found Mbitu’s bloodied body with slash wounds on her face and neck, Massachusetts State Police said in an affidavit.
The day before her body was found, Kangethe boarded flights from Boston to Kenya. Surveillance footage showed him leaving the parking garage and entering an airport terminal, police said.
Investigators learned he had bought a plane ticket the previous morning, state police said.
“Why her?” her sister, Ann Mbitu, told CNN in November. “Nobody’s daughter deserves this, but why my sister? Why Maggie?” “I’m so angry, I’m still trying to process everything. At 31, we’re not supposed to be planning her funeral. We’re supposed to be planning celebrations, birthdays, weddings, travel.”
Kangethe has been arrested twice with the help of tipsters.
After he arrived in Kenya, he eluded authorities for three months. Then in late January, someone alerted police that a man at a nightclub in Nairobi resembled images of the suspect they’d seen on social media, Kenyan authorities said.
An undercover officer tracked him down and struck up a conversation with him, a police official told CNN. Within hours, authorities identified the man as Kangethe, whom authorities in Massachusetts had obtained an arrest warrant on a murder charge.
A week later, a man claiming to be his lawyer appeared at the police station where he was being held and asked to speak with him. Officers released the suspect from his cell and left them alone in an office. The suspected escaped on foot and evaded authorities for days, police said.
He was re-arrested a week later at a relative’s house in a suburb of Nairobi after another tip-off, Kenyan police said.
Kevin Hayden, District Attorney of Suffolk County in suburban Boston, thanked the US State Department, the FBI, the state police, the Kenyan government and Kenyan law enforcement agencies for facilitating the arrest.
“Their tremendous and untiring efforts will provide Margaret’s family and friends the opportunity to see Kevin Kangethe face justice for this terrible crime,” Hayden said in a statement in February.
Investigators have not revealed a motive in the killing."
XBULDFMT0M_5NSKZUYLLY90CBX,Tim Walz’s brother stands by criticism of his policies but says Facebook ‘wasn’t the right platform’ to express views,"By Aaron Pellish, CNN","4 minute read Published 3:37 PM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/04/politics/jeff-walz-criticism-brother-policies/,"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s brother said Tuesday that he doesn’t agree with the Democrat’s policies but expressed some remorse for inserting himself into the spotlight after he posted on social media last week he is “100% opposed” to his brother’s political views and was considering officially endorsing former President Donald Trump.
Jeff Walz, the older brother of Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate, told NewsNation in an interview that he didn’t intend to “influence the general public” with social media posts that indicated his support for Trump over Harris’ and his brother’s campaign and said he has no plans to be campaigning “for him or against him” ahead of November’s election.
The Harris-Walz campaign declined to comment.
Jeff Walz’s comments come after he wrote on Facebook that he hasn’t spoken to his brother in eight years but is “100% opposed to all his ideology.”
In another comment on Friday, he responded to someone suggesting he “get on stage” with Trump and offer his official endorsement by saying he’s weighing his family’s privacy against his desire to keep his brother out of higher public office, indicating he knows “stories” about Gov. Walz that would reflect poorly on him.
“I’ve thought hard about doing something like that!” he wrote in response to the idea of formally endorsing Trump. “I’m torn between that and just keeping my family out of it. The stories I could tell. Not the type of character you want making decisions about your future.”
Jeff Walz said he regrets sharing his views on Facebook, and explained he made the posts to clarify his views to people in his life who thought he was aligned with Tim Walz politically.
“It was a post that – that I made because I was getting a lot of feedback from my friends, old acquaintances, thinking that I was feeling the same way that my brother did on the issues, and I was trying to clarify that just to friends,” he told NewsNation. “I used Facebook, which wasn’t the right platform to do that for.”
Jeff Walz lamented the distance between him and his brother, saying “it’s too bad” they’ve grown apart and expressing hope for the possibility they can “disagree and still be civil brothers.” He added that any “stories” he had to share about Tim Walz wouldn’t reveal anything “hidden” about him.
“My little brother, when we were younger, we would go on family trips and in a station wagon. And the thing was, nobody wanted to sit with him, because he had car sickness and would always throw up on us,” he said. “That sort of thing. There’s really nothing else hidden behind there. People are assuming something else.”
Jeff Walz declined to share with NewsNation who he would be voting for in November. But he has a history of supporting Trump dating back to 2016.
The Facebook comments he posted on Friday occurred underneath a post he originally wrote on March 30, 2023, the same day Trump was indicted by a grand jury in New York as part of the investigation into hush money payments made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election. Trump was eventually found guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records.
“We’ve just become a third world banana republic,” he wrote that day.
He previously donated $20 to Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, federal campaign finance records show. And on the day after Election Day in 2022, he appeared to react to stronger than expected performances by Democrats in races across the country except in his home state of Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis won reelection by 19 points.
“Sure glad to live in Florida today!,” he wrote at the time.
Jeff Walz is one of three of Tim Walz’s siblings. They have a sister, Sandy, who lives in Nebraska, and a brother, Craig, who died in 2016.
His brother’s apparent opposition to his campaign puts Tim Walz in company with Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who have both seen family members criticize their presidential bids. Trump has faced continued attacks from his niece, Mary Trump, and his nephew, Fred Trump, who have both published books about their uncle. Kennedy’s siblings condemned his campaign at various points over the past year, including after he dropped out of the race in August and endorsed Trump."
XCG54B7IJ2_7ZU50KMI0GEWFXN,These are the ‘gifts’ prosecutors say a former aide to New York’s governor received from the Chinese government,"By Emma Tucker, CNN","3 minute read Updated 5:43 AM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/03/us/new-york-linda-sun-china-gifts/,"US prosecutors say the Chinese government gave Linda Sun lavish, expensive gifts in return for violating internal rules and state government protocols while she served as an aide to two New York governors in a scheme that enriched her family by millions of dollars.
The former deputy chief of staff to New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and former aide to Gov. Andrew Cuomo acted as an undisclosed agent of the People’s Republic of China and the Chinese Communist Party, federal prosecutors say.

Sun was charged on Tuesday with violating and conspiring to violate the Foreign Agents Registrations Act, visa fraud, alien smuggling and money laundering conspiracy, according to an unsealed copy of the indictment. Her husband and co-defendant, Chris Hu, was also charged with money laundering conspiracy and conspiracy to commit bank fraud as well as misusing means of identification, prosecutors said.
The couple allegedly received “substantial economic and other benefits” from the Chinese government – including facilitating millions of dollars in business transactions – none of which were disclosed to New York state, according to the indictment. They were arrested at their Long Island residence Tuesday morning. Sun and Hu both pleaded not guilty to all charges in federal court Tuesday afternoon.
Here’s a rundown of the gifts prosecutors say the couple received from Chinese government officials and the leaders of US-based Chinese organizations:
• Sun and her family received at least four deliveries of “Nanjing-style salted ducks prepared by a PRC official’s personal chef” between 2021 and 2022. They were also invited to dinner at a PRC official’s house in 2023.
• An unnamed US permanent resident with business interests in China and who worked with “numerous US-based Chinese organizations” paid for Sun’s accommodation and travel to the PRC in 2019, along with event tickets in Beijing celebrating the 70th anniversary of the PRC’s founding.
• The millions of dollars in travel benefits Sun and her family received also included a presidential suite previously used by First Lady Michelle Obama in Beijing, where Sun stayed in 2018.
• After Sun was asked in 2017 by the president of an unnamed New York-based association of people from Henan province to speak at an event taking place in Zhengzhou, Henan, the association made travel arrangements, including hotel accommodations, for Hu, Sun and her parents, Hu’s PRC-based business partner and several representatives of carrier business whose services Sun frequently used. The Chinese government also partially funded the trip, the indictment says.
• The New York-based association also “agreed to make efforts to personally intervene as to PRC customs issues” to help her husband, a seafood exporter based in Queens, export “live lobsters” to Henan Province.
• While Sun traveled with a work colleague on official New York state business to Jiangsu Province, she received “undisclosed and unapproved” benefits from provincial officials, including a 10-year employment contract for Sun’s cousin in the PRC.
• A bank account held by Sun and Hu received a wire transfer in the amount of $47,895 from a PRC-based bank account in 2016, labeled “Payment for Traveling.”
• Tickets to various concerts and events, including the Chinese National Traditional Orchestra concert at Carnegie Hall in New York City in December 2015.

XHAD2B0DO7_3T2M7CJZN7GIU4S,‘A very serious situation’: Volkswagen could close plants in Germany for the first time in history,"By Hanna Ziady, CNN","2 minute read Updated 2:11 PM EDT, Mon September 2, 2024",20240902,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/02/investing/volkswagen-factory-closure-germany/,"Volkswagen is weighing whether to close factories in Germany for the first time in its 87-year history as it moves to deepen cost cuts amid rising competition from China’s electric vehicle makers.
In a statement Monday, the German automaker, one of the world’s biggest car companies, said that it could not rule out plant closures its home country. Other measures to “future-proof” the company include trying to terminate an employment protection agreement with labor unions, which has been in place since 1994.
“The European automotive industry is in a very demanding and serious situation,” said Volkswagen Group CEO Oliver Blume. “The economic environment became even tougher, and new competitors are entering the European market. Germany in particular as a manufacturing location is falling further behind in terms of competitiveness.
Volkswagen, which embarked on a €10 billion ($11.1 billion) cost-cutting effort late last year, is losing market share in China, its single biggest market. In the first half of the year, deliveries to customers in that country slipped 7% on the same period in 2023. Group operating profit tumbled 11.4% to €10.1 billion ($11.2 billion).
The lackluster performance in China comes as the company loses out to local EV brands, notably BYD, which also pose an increasing threat to its business in Europe.
“Our main area of action is cost cutting,” Blume told analysts on an earnings call last month, citing planned reductions to factory, supply chain and labor expenses. “We have done all the organizational steps needed. And now it is about costs, costs and costs,” he added.

Volkswagen’s cost-cutting plans will face heavy resistance from labor representatives, which hold almost half the seats on the company’s supervisory board, the body that appoints executive managers.
IG Metall, one of Germany’s most powerful unions, on Monday blamed mismanagement for the firm’s shortcomings and vowed to fight to protect jobs.
“Today, the board presented an irresponsible plan that shakes the very foundations of Volkswagen, massively threatening jobs and locations,” IG Metall lead negotiator Thorsten Groeger said in a statement.
“This approach is not only short-sighted but also highly dangerous — it risks destroying the heart of Volkswagen… We will not tolerate plans that the company makes at the expense of the workforce.”
Volkswagen employs almost 683,000 workers worldwide, including some 295,000 in Germany, according to its most recent earnings report.
Thomas Schaefer, the CEO of Volkswagen passenger cars, said the company remains committed to Germany “as a business location.” He added that VW would initiate talks with employee representatives urgently to explore possibilities for “sustainably restructuring the brand.”
“The situation is extremely tense and cannot be resolved through simple cost-cutting measures,” Volkswagen said."
XLME3S491N_JMI8BR8ZQIDVHQ4,Russian trolling 2.0: How the Kremlin shifted tactics from its 2016 election strategy,"By Sean Lyngaas, CNN","4 minute read Updated 6:31 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/05/politics/russian-trolling-2-0-how-the-kremlin-shifted-tactics-from-its-2016-election-strategy/,"The recent US indictment of two employees of Russian state-run media network RT underscores a significant shift in the Kremlin’s tactics to influence US elections since 2016, current and former US officials told CNN.
Rather than relying on fake accounts and bogus online personas, the current effort alleged in this week’s indictment involves coopting real American influencers to try to push Russian narratives to US audiences, particularly aimed at undermining support for Ukraine.
The indictment alleges that the RT employees secretly poured nearly $10 million into a Tennessee company that hired prominent right-wing commentators who produced content on hot-button political issues, including Russia’s war on Ukraine. The influencers say they were unaware of any Russian hand in the operations of the media company, which CNN has identified as Tenet Media, and that they controlled their own content.
“Buying authentic influencers is a far better use of funds than creating fake personas, because they bring their own trusting audiences and are actually, you know, real,” Renee DiResta, an expert on online influence operations, said in a social media post.
With its US offices forced to shut down in 2022 following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, RT has resorted to more covert operations to disseminate its message, prosecutors allege.
That shift shows that Russia’s best bet for undermining US support for Ukraine may lie in capitalizing on influential American voices that bypass the mainstream media and are critical of aid to Kyiv, the sources said.
“The Russians have diversified well beyond the 2016 model,” said Chris Krebs, former head of the federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. “It’s unclear what the real impact is, at least from a tactical perspective. My sense is that they’re not successful in changing specific behaviors or decisions, like the outcome of a single election,” Krebs said. “However, it’s much more likely that the Russians’ efforts are burning on a longer fuse, and we don’t quite understand the real damage done just yet.”
The shift in Russian tactics also shows a keen understanding of a fractured media environment in the US. Where in 2016, Russian intelligence prioritized leaking hacked information in order to reach mainstream news outlets, they’re now tapping directly into a disparate corner of conservative media, where individual podcasters reach an audience that rivals that of traditional newspapers.
As a result, Russia no longer needs to orchestrate the kind of hack-and-leak operation it used to great effect in 2016, when Russian intelligence officers stole a trove of emails from Democratic officials and leaked them to Wikileaks.

The Russians thought that American media outlets would see Wikileaks as a relatively credible source of information, according to Michael van Landingham, a former CIA official who assessed the 2016 Russian activity.
“But now, in the absence of a current hack-and-leak campaign, Russia has reverted to the age-old tactic of supporting public voices that express views aligned with Russian messaging,” van Landingham said.
Artificial intelligence has also made it much easier for Russian (or any other) intelligence agencies to pose as Americans online with fake photos and bios.
“It’s night and day,” said Emerson Brooking, a resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab. Compared to 2016, this time, “Russian actors showed a far more sophisticated understanding of the US information environment,” Brooking said.
It’s also unclear how useful hack-and-leak operations would be in 2024. Journalists are more attuned to foreign influence efforts, and at least one known operation aimed at influencing this year’s election has had questionable impact.
Iran conducted its own hack-and-leak this summer, stealing documents from the Trump campaign and sending them to multiple major news outlets, as CNN previously reported. But there was little news coverage of the content of the stolen documents, partly because they were unremarkable.
The Justice Department also on Wednesday seized dozens of fake news sites that other Russian companies used to closely mimic the appearance of Fox News and the Washington Post. The Russian companies used ChatGPT, the popular AI tool, to write some of their content, according to an FBI affidavit.
Internal project documents from one of the Russian companies propose targeting US voters in six swing states with disinformation, hitting on themes such as the “risk of job loss for white Americans” and the purported threat of crime from “Ukrainian immigrants,” according to the affidavit.
“They obsessed over impact and set clear targets,” Brooking said.
But measuring the impact and efficacy of Russian influence efforts is difficult. The influencers hired by Tenet Media, including Benny Johnson and Tim Pool, say they were victims of the alleged Russian scheme. They had millions of followers to whom they’ve been broadcasting their views long before, according to the indictment, RT employees invested in Tenet Media.
“I’m skeptical that this operation would have resulted in preaching to anyone who wasn’t already converted,” Gavin Wilde, a former National Security Council official focused on Russia, told CNN.
“It’s mostly a grift cycle,” said Jason Kikta, a former US Cyber Command official now with security firm Automox. “The Russian money lets them expand operations within the ideologically aligned population to further grift, while the Russians can claim fanciful success within their government for budget and career promotion.”"
XMP9C1H0ZU_VJ1NG7NRMRBT1SP,Analysis: Trump is still telling lies he told eight years ago,"By Daniel Dale, CNN","5 minute read Published 5:00 AM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240903,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/03/politics/trump-fact-checking-analysis/,"In a speech last week to the National Guard Association of the United States, former President Donald Trump claimed that he was the president who “created” the Veterans Choice health care program, and got it “passed in Congress,” after others had wanted to do so “for 57 years.”
In reality, President Barack Obama was the president who signed the program into law in 2014. The law Trump signed in 2018, the VA MISSION Act, expanded the Veterans Choice program but didn’t create it.
I could fact-check this Trump lie half-asleep – because he’s been telling it for more than six years.
Trump’s lying is most exceptional in its relentlessness, a never-ending avalanche of wrongness that can bury even the most devoted fact-checkers. But it’s also notable for its repetitiveness. He has found his hits, and he’ll keep playing them no matter how many times they are debunked.
As Trump enters the post-Labor Day sprint of his 2024 campaign for the presidency, his commentary is filled with many of the same false claims he made as president from 2017 to 2021. He’s even repeating some of the false claims he used during his 2016 presidential campaign.
As a fact-check reporter for CNN, I watch or read the transcript of every public appearance by Trump and his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris. While Harris’ campaign remarks to date have been heavy on thematic rhetoric and light on assertions of fact, with a smattering of false or misleading claims, Trump’s 2024 interviews and speeches are littered with old falsehoods I’ve come to call “the repeats” – assertions I have fact-checked as false over and over for years.
For example, Trump falsely claimed on a podcast last week that people are saying global warming will cause the oceans to rise just “an eighth of an inch in 355 years.” He was saying near-identical nonsense in 2019. (Sea levels are already rising more than an eighth of an inch per year.)
Trump falsely claimed at a rally last month that his tariffs on imported Chinese goods are paid by China, not Americans, and that no previous president had generated even “10 cents” from tariffs on Chinese goods. He was saying the same in 2018. (The tariff payments are made by US importers, not Chinese exporters, and the US government was already generating billions per year from such tariffs before Trump took office.)
Trump falsely claimed in a speech in mid-August that he had warned the US not to invade Iraq. That claim was a key part of his campaign pitch in 2015 and 2016. (Trump expressed tentative support for the 2003 invasion about six months before it occurred, did not express a firm opinion on an invasion about two months before it occurred, and only came out as an opponent of the war post-invasion.)
Trump’s false claims in the podcast interview last week that some NATO members were “delinquent” and “owed … huge amounts of money” before he took office were also staples of his 2016 run. (NATO members didn’t owe anybody money even if they were not meeting the alliance’s voluntary 2%-of-GDP guideline for their own defense spending.)
Trump’s regular false claims of a “rigged” 2020 election echo his language from both his 2016 campaign and 2020 campaign. (The claims were baseless then and are baseless now.)
And less importantly, when Trump declared in June, July and again on Thursday that he had been named “Man of the Year” in Michigan long before he entered politics, it was the third straight presidential election he had told this silly lie he debuted in 2016. (There is no evidence the award even exists, let alone that Trump, who has never lived in Michigan, received it.)
Nobody really knows how much of Trump’s deployment of old lies is strategic and how much is mere force of habit. Regardless, his persistence produces a clear benefit for him.
News outlets tend to focus on new material. While some outlets may be inclined to fact-check a false Trump claim the first, second, third or even 10th time he utters it, they are far less likely to devote precious resources to a claim on the 100th or 150th utterance – especially because he is constantly mixing in dozens of new lies that require time and resources to address. And so, by virtue of shameless perseverance, Trump often manages to outlast most of the media’s willingness to correct any particular falsehood, eventually getting that claim into news coverage and social media clips nearly uncorrected.
That’s not to say his lying is an unmitigated victory.
Numerous polls have found for years that a clear majority of voters do not see Trump as honest; from talking to Americans around the country since 2015, I know there are a lot of people who distrust almost anything he says. I have no doubt that his insistence on continuing to say dozens of things people have already learned are false is part of the reason why.
Still, I try to match Trump’s tirelessness in lying with my own tirelessness in challenging the lies. The separation of fact from fiction is central to journalists’ role in the democratic process, and there are always citizens out there who are hearing even the stalest of deceptions for the first time.
So as long as Trump or any other major political figure keeps reviving their past nonsense, we should keep debunking that nonsense. Even if we already did it eight years ago."
XN15EN6HTS_YRSL5OEJ4RDG01E,The Murdoch family is secretly battling over succession. News outlets are asking a court to make it public,"By Hadas Gold, CNN","2 minute read Published 9:45 PM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/04/media/rupert-murdoch-lachlan-succession-court-news-outlets/,"A coalition of media organizations, including CNN, has petitioned a Nevada court to open up the secret proceedings surrounding a legal battle over the future of billionaire Rupert Murdoch’s media empire.
The New York Times, Associated Press, National Public Radio, The Washington Post, Reuters and CNN filed a motion Wednesday in the Second Judicial District Court in Nevada to make public the proceedings, objecting to the case being so extensively sealed that it doesn’t even appear on any court schedule or docket.
The Murdoch family, famous for helming one of the world’s most influential media empires that includes Fox News, The Wall Street Journal and outlets in Australia and the UK, is locked in a secret court battle over succession and control of the future of the family business, according to a New York Times report published in July citing sealed court documents.
According to the report, Murdoch, the 93-year-old patriarch, filed a petition late last year to amend the irrevocable family trust that would have given equal voting shares to Murdoch’s eldest four children. Instead, Murdoch wanted to grant exclusive control to his eldest son and chosen successor Lachlan, according to The Times.
Lachlan, who is more politically aligned with his father’s conservative views than his siblings, took over as chairman of Fox Corporation and News Corporation last September. Citing the court documents, which CNN has not independently seen, the Times reported that Murdoch felt handing Lachlan control of the media businesses he founded would better protect their value following his death by maintaining its right-wing editorial bent.
But the entire process has been completely sealed in Nevada, with even the existence of the proceedings kept in secret.
“Nevada’s courts are accountable to the public, and the public is entitled to know whether the trust at issue is being administered in accordance with the law,” the filing stated. “Certainly, an entire matter cannot be sealed such that its very existence is not a public record, even if all parties to the litigation agree. Rather, the court must apply the presumption of access and make specific findings to underpin any sealing.”
The filing argued that completely sealing the proceedings “meets neither the substantive nor procedural requirements imposed by the constitutional right of access,” and any concerns over privacy could be met with redactions.
According to the Times, the trust only allows changes that are done in good faith with the purpose of benefiting all heirs. A trial to decide whether Murdoch is acting in good faith is expected to begin in September."

The group, known as FENAMAD, defends the rights of Peru’s Indigenous peoples. It says tensions between loggers and Indigenous tribes are on the rise and more government protective action is needed.
Two other loggers in the attack were missing and another was injured, FENAMAD said, and rescue efforts were underway.

The rights group, which represents 39 Indigenous communities in the Cusco and Madre de Dios regions in southeastern Peru, said the incident took place on August 29 in the Pariamanu river basin while loggers were expanding their passageways into the forest and came into contact with the reclusive and renowned territorial tribe.
“The Peruvian state has not taken preventive and protective measures to ensure the lives and integrity of the workers who have been gravely affected,” the group said in a statement Tuesday, adding authorities have yet to arrive in the area since the incident.
FENAMAD said the attack happened just 25 kilometers (15.5 miles) from a July incident, when the Mashco Piro again attacked loggers. The group said in their statement that even though they advised the government of the risk of a rise in violence, nothing has been done.
“It’s a heated and tense situation,” said Cesar Ipenza, an Amazon-based lawyer who specializes in environmental law in Peru. “Undoubtedly, every day there are more tensions between Indigenous peoples in isolation and the different activities that are within the territory that they ancestrally pass through.”
There have been several other previous reports of conflicts. In one incident in 2022, two loggers were shot with arrows while fishing, one fatally, in an encounter with tribal members.

In January, Peru loosened restrictions on deforestation, which critics dubbed the “anti-forest law.” Researchers have since warned of the rise in deforestation for agriculture and how it is making it easier for illicit logging and mining.
Ipenaza said some effort has been made by authorities in the area, like mobilizing a helicopter, but overall there has been “little commitment” by Peru’s Ministry of Culture, responsible for the protection of Indigenous peoples.
The Ministry of Culture did not immediately respond to a message Wednesday seeking comment on the attack and their protection efforts.
The attack took place a day before the Forest Stewardship Council suspended the sustainability certification of a logging company for eight months which rights groups and activists have accused of encroaching on the Indigenous group’s land.
“It’s absurd that certifiers like the FSC keep the certification of companies that clearly and openly violate basic human rights and Indigenous rights,” said Julia Urrunaga, director of the Peru program at the Environmental Investigation Agency. “How terrible that people have to keep dying and that it has to be an international scandal for action to be taken.”"
XPJTZFDNC1_4CHL8CDVTAKBOH1,"For people without insurance, updated Covid-19 shots are no longer free of charge at pharmacies","By Jacqueline Howard, CNN","4 minute read Published 12:47 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/05/health/covid-vaccine-cost-pharmacies/,"The rollout of updated Covid-19 vaccines has begun in the United States, but for the first time, the shots will no longer be free of charge for people without insurance at their local pharmacy.
Earlier in the pandemic, vaccines were purchased by the federal government and free for everyone. Last year, as the shots transitioned to the commercial market, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Bridge Access Program provided free Covid-19 vaccines to adults without insurance and those whose insurance didn’t cover all vaccine costs. The program ended last month due to lack of federal funding.
“This means that purely uninsured people do not have access to get free Covid shots and so if they went to their pharmacy to try to get one, they’d come with a cost,” said Lori Freeman, chief executive officer for the National Association of County and City Health Officials. About 26 million people in the United States are uninsured.

“We know that cost, at this moment in time with the economy, is even more of a burden than ever,” Freeman said.
Most people with private insurance, Medicare or Medicaid will still be able to get vaccinated at no out-of-pocket cost, but for adults without insurance or those whose insurance does not cover the vaccine, getting the updated shot at a pharmacy could cost $201.99.
The change may catch some people by surprise.
CVS Pharmacy has posted information on its website about how much the updated Covid-19 vaccines may cost without insurance, said CVS spokesperson Amy Thibault. On a Q&A page on its site, it urged people to check whether their insurance plan covers the vaccines and if CVS is in-network.
During the last several months, Walgreens has been educating its pharmacy team members on the discontinuation of the Bridge Access Program, Walgreens corporate spokesperson Samantha Stansberry said in an email Tuesday.
“Our pharmacists are aware of the changes and can assist any patients who have questions,” Stansberry said. “Walgreens remains committed to driving equitable and convenient access to life-saving vaccines. We will continue to work with patients eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine to determine the best and most cost-efficient way to receive one.”
In some states, there might still be free shots available to some people. The CDC announced last month that it is distributing $62 million to state and local health departments to provide free Covid-19 vaccines to adults who wouldn’t otherwise be able to afford them.

States can order Covid-19 vaccines now, a CDC spokesperson said in an email Thursday. The program will provide vaccines through the 2024-2025 fall and winter respiratory season.
“We expect the supply in states to continue to increase,” the spokesperson said. “These funds will enhance immunization programs through support to state and local health departments, which will work with vaccine providers in their states to make them available.”
Once a health department receives the vaccines, some may decide to host public vaccination clinics or events, Freeman said.
Even with the end of the Bridge Access Program, Freeman said that many state and local health departments still would like to be involved in making updated Covid-19 vaccinations accessible to the public.
“We want the local health department to be a primary provider with the state and to have that continuous public health program,” Freeman said. “There has to be a way to both leverage the need to get vaccines safely in the hands of public, but also recognize the permanent role of the health department as a provider.”
Covid-19 levels in the US are very high and rising, according to wastewater surveillance data from the CDC. Levels have been rising since May and are already as high as they were in December of last year. Hospitalization rates related to Covid-19 also remain elevated, particularly among adults 65 and older and children under 2 years, according to the CDC.
Last season, an estimated 22.5% of adults and 14.4% of children were fully vaccinated against Covid-19 with updated shots.
People still should make a commitment to get vaccinated against Covid-19 with the updated shots this fall, said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association.
“If you’re insured, you ought to check with your insurance company to find out what the parameters are around getting vaccinated. Your vaccination should be free under the Affordable Care Act,” Benjamin said.
“If you are uninsured or underinsured, then you should check with your state or local health department and see what provisions they’re making for uninsured and underinsured people. Some of the state and local health departments, understanding this is a problem, are working with their governor’s office or mayor’s office to find funding to provide access to vaccine. In most cases, if the vaccine is available and if they have vaccine, they’ll be able to provide it for you at either no cost or reduced cost,” he said. “And there are some pharmacy assistance programs that should be available for Pfizer and Moderna.”

The operation will now shift into a search and recovery phase, local media reported, citing Zaliha Mustafa, a minister in the Prime Minister’s Department in the Federal Territories.
Mustafa said several factors went into the decision, including concerns over the safety and health of the rescue personnel, Singaporean newspaper the Straits Times reported.
Vijaya Lakshmi Gali, an Indian national, fell into the sinkhole on the morning of Aug. 23, according to the High Commission of India in Kuala Lumpur.
Surveillance footage shows the woman walking on a pavement along a busy road when the sinkhole suddenly opened beneath her. She plunged into the eight-meter gap while people around her scrambled for safety.
Malaysian authorities mounted an extensive, multi-agency rescue effort involving the Royal Malaysian Police, the Fire and Rescue Department and the Civil Defense Force, among others.
They tried a variety of tools and techniques to locate her, including excavations, flushing portions of the drain system, sending divers to search the city’s sewage line, using high-pressure water jets to remove obstacles, and mapping inaccessible areas with remote cameras and ground-penetrating radar, according to the High Commission of India in Kuala Lumpur.
Authorities found no trace of her apart from a pair of slippers, the Associated Press reported.

XU4I3VWLJW_N9RQQDQG8Y345BG,"Murder suspect in Chicago train mass shooting is ordered held without bond. ‘This defendant defines violent,’ judge says","By Cheri Mossburg, Bill Kirkos, Lauren Mascarenhas, Brad Parks and Virginia Langmaid, CNN","5 minute read Updated 5:03 PM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240903,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/03/us/chicago-train-shooting-tuesday/,"The Chicago man who was charged with murder in the fatal shootings of four Chicago train riders earlier this week was ordered held without bond at his first court appearance Wednesday.
Rhanni S. Davis, 30, was charged Tuesday with four counts of first-degree murder, the Forest Park Police Department said in a news release.
He appeared in a Maywood court Wednesday wearing a tan Cook County jumpsuit with shackles around his hands and ankles.
Prosecutors told the court evidence will show Davis shot one victim twice in the head and back, shot a second person in the side of the face and the arm and then shot a third victim in the back of the head. Davis moved to the next train car and approached the fourth victim from behind. The victim raised his hands in a defensive posture before Davis fired, prosecutors said.
Prosecutors told the court Davis has a history of criminal activity, including a disorderly conduct offense in 2020, and two other prior arrests that were both dismissed. Davis’ attorney, Robert Fox, told the court he had a Firearm Owner’s Identification card, training in security and home health care, and no prior convictions. Davis recently worked at a local Taco Bell, the attorney added.
Cook County Circuit Court Judge Elizabeth Ciaccia-Lezza said the facts alleged by the state were “absolutely horrific and appalling.”
“This defendant defines violent,” Ciaccia-Lezza said. “The public would not be safe with any amount of movement by this defendant.”
Davis is due back in court on September 27.
The court hearing came two days after the mass shooting early Monday morning targeted four people who appeared to be sleeping on the train. Davis was detained about 90 minutes after the shooting was reported around 5:30 a.m. on the Blue Line train heading to the Forest Park suburb west of downtown.
The attack raised further concerns about the safety of public transit systems in American cities like Chicago and New York. Ridership levels plunged during the Covid pandemic and have had a muted recovery since, in part due to perceptions of disorder and crime.
Still, police emphasized Tuesday they believe this was an isolated and random attack. There is no identified motive at this time, Forest Park Police Department Det. Lt. Dan Pater said during the news conference.
“Allegedly, this man came onto a train while people were sleeping … and pumped bullets into their bodies,” Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx said Tuesday. “We want answers. Right now, we don’t have an answer as to why anyone would engage in such a heinous, heinous act. But as it stands … we have enough for the purposes of charging first-degree murder.”
The early morning shooting happened in two train cars, where three victims were shot in one car and the fourth in another, with a total of six rounds, police said.
Surveillance video was instrumental in identifying the suspect, police said.
Forest Park police released two surveillance videos Wednesday showing Davis casually walking in a train station.
The first video, from 5:04 a.m. CT Monday, shows a Blue Line train arriving at the Harlem station when a man in a gray outfit jumps out of the moving train, falls onto the platform, and then gets up and hustles away. After the train comes to a full stop, a person wearing a black shirt, black ski mask and black backpack then walks in the same direction.
The second video, taken at about 5:06 a.m. CT, shows the same man in the ski mask casually walking out of a train station.
Three of the victims were identified as 60-year-old Adrian Collins, 28-year-old Simeon Bihesi and 64-year-old Margaret A. Miller, the Cook County Medical Examiner’s office told CNN on Tuesday. The other victim was a man in his 50s, but no additional identifying information was available as police said they are still trying to reach the man’s family.
Police recovered a Glock 43 9mm pistol they confirmed Tuesday was the weapon used in the shooting.
CTA’s Blue Line spans 27 miles between O’Hare International Airport and Forest Park, passing through or near dozens of neighborhoods and downtown Chicago. Service on the line resumed Monday evening.

The victims may have been homeless, Forest Park Deputy Chief Chris Chin told CNN Monday, but Pater indicated Tuesday they “don’t have any information that proves or disproves otherwise.”
“Although this was an isolated incident, this heinous and egregious act of violence should never have occurred, nonetheless on a public transit train,” the transit authority said in a statement.
“This obviously is shocking, you know, it is uncommon to have a mass shooting like this,” said Chin. “This is an isolated incident, so it can happen anywhere. Obviously, there’s a little bit more concern because it is on a mass transit system,” he added. “For people to feel unsafe, it’s justified.”
CNN and the Gun Violence Archive define a mass shooting as a shooting that injured or killed four or more people, not including the shooter.
Forest Park Mayor Rory Hoskins said the shooting is an “outlier” for the city.
Hours after the shooting, another passenger was seriously injured in a stabbing on the Red Line, Chicago police said in a statement. The incident began as a verbal altercation between a 37-year-old victim and an unknown man, who at some point took out a “sharp object” and repeatedly stabbed the victim, police said.
“The victim fled from the train at the Wilson Red Line station, and relocated, on foot, to the 4700 block of N. Broadway. The victim was then transported to Illinois Masonic Hospital initially listed in critical condition,” police told CNN.
A suspect in the stabbing has yet to be found and detectives are investigating.

XW7FHPS350_OGT8JLMQ0P2WVVW,Takeaways from Donald Trump’s election interference court hearing,"By Tierney Sneed and Jeremy Herb, CNN","7 minute read Updated 6:02 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/05/politics/takeaways-trump-jan-6-election-hearing/,"It didn’t take long after Thursday’s hearing in the federal election subversion case against Donald Trump – the first proceeding before Judge Tanya Chutkan since the Supreme Court granted the former president some immunity in the prosecution – for the trial judge to decide a schedule for the next steps in the case that lets prosecutors make public new evidence before the 2024 election.
Chutkan made clear that a potential trial date is far off, but she issued a scheduling order Thursday afternoon to push the case forward and tackle the question of presidential immunity following the Supreme Court’s July ruling — allowing prosecutors to issue a filing later this month, with supporting evidence, to defend special counsel Jack Smith’s reworked indictment that was handed up last week.
During the hearing, Chutkan previewed her thinking on how the case should advance. She was skeptical of the Trump team’s request that she first decide whether the then-Vice President Mike Pence-related allegations in the indictment were immune, and Chutkan repeatedly stressed the discretion she believes she has for how she structures the proceedings in her courtroom.
Though Thursday’s one-hour-and-15-minute hearing was mainly about process, a sharp back-and-forth she had with a Trump attorney brought attention to how the 2024 election is looming over the case.
Here are takeaways from the hearing:
The judge did not issue a ruling from the bench on the schedule, but she issued an order with her schedule to deal with several pretrial motions – including immunity – on Thursday afternoon.
During Thursday’s hearing, prosecutors explained why they want the chance to file an opening brief that would argue why they believe their new indictment complies with the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling. Trump’s attorneys argued against that and proposed a longer schedule.
Chutkan’s scheduling order called for the first brief to be filed by prosecutors on September 26, after Chutkan pushed prosecutor Thomas Windom for dates on how quickly the special counsel’s office could file the brief they proposed defending the new indictment.
Windom deferred to the judge – not putting on the record a date itself – while telling the judge they would need two to three weeks, meaning the end of this month.
“We do actually have to write this thing,” Windom said, prompting Chutkan to joke that maybe Windom had it in his binder.
“I would be surprised by that,” Windom responded.
At the same time, he emphasized that prosecutors would leave the exact timing “to the court’s discretion.”
Chutkan’s scheduling order included deadlines for a reply brief from Trump’s lawyers on October 17 and a reply from the special counsel on October 29 – meaning the filings will come in the final weeks of the campaign, and Chutkan could decide the issue more quickly than what Trump’s lawyers proposed. There is no hearing scheduled on the immunity question in her new order, but she could request oral arguments on the matter later on.
The evidence the special counsel’s office will reveal in its late September filing may not be immediately public, and Chutkan will be able to control its release. It is likely it would become available, though, potentially with redactions.
As the judge debated with Trump attorney John Lauro over how quickly she should move to allow the prosecution to file a brief defending their indictment on immunity, they eventually addressed the political elephant in the courtroom: the looming presidential election.
After a back and forth with the judge over what the process should be for deciding the immunity issues in the case, Lauro acknowledged that among his team’s concerns about the prosecutors’ proposed approach is what would be aired on the court’s public record at a “sensitive time.”
The crux of the process disagreement comes down to who gets to file their immunity brief first and when that brief gets filed.
“This court is not concerned with the electoral schedule,” Chutkan pushed back.
“We are talking about the presidency of the United States,” Lauro said.
“I am not talking about the presidency,” Chutkan said. “I am talking about a four-count indictment.”
“The subtext of your argument here about these sensitive times … it strikes me that what you’re trying to do is affect the presentation of this case so as not to impinge on an election,” she added.
Lauro denied that his arguments were connected to the presidential campaign.
“The decisions here will not just affect this case, it will affect the republic going forward,” Lauro said.
Trump has repeatedly complained that the new indictment filed last week was an attempt to interfere with the campaign – just as he complained about his New York trial in the spring – but Chutkan’s comments signaled she isn’t going to wait until after November 5 before moving forward on the issues that have to be dealt with in the case following the Supreme Court’s immunity decision.
At the end of Thursday’s hearing, Chutkan acknowledged the elephant in the room: There were still too many issues to resolve to set a trial date in the case.
“It’s sort of an exercise in futility at this point,” she said, noting that whatever decision she makes on immunity will be appealed, which means the trial will pause once again while the appellate process plays out.
Both Trump’s lawyers and prosecutors agreed that it was too soon to set a trial date.
While Chutkan’s schedule on the next steps in the case does get the immunity issue moving, all sides in the case – prosecutors, Trump’s attorneys and the judge – acknowledged Thursday that her ruling on immunity would almost certainly be appealed.
Of course, it’s not just the appeals process that makes a future trial so murky. If Trump wins the 2024 election, he is poised to toss out the special counsel and the case against him altogether once he returns to office.
Chutkan did not seem particularly convinced that, when deciding the immunity issues in the case, she should deal specifically with the Pence-related claims first.
Trump’s attorneys made the aggressive argument, first laid out in their filings late last week, that the whole case must fall if Trump’s interactions with his vice president are deemed immune from prosecution.
In Thursday’s hearing, Lauro was particularly focused on that argument and tried to persuade the judge that dealing with the Pence conduct as a standalone issue would be a more efficient way of doing things.
He contended that it would save the court from doing lengthy briefings on other the allegations in the indictment if she decides the whole case must be dismissed on the Pence issue alone. He also insisted that the Supreme Court viewed a finding that the Pence conduct was immune as fatal to the indictment, a claim Chutkan shot down.
“The ruling is clear, crystal clear,” Lauro said, prompting a chuckle from Chutkan.
Chutkan hinted that she was dubious of Trump’s coming attempt to get the DC case dismissed on the grounds that Smith was supposedly illegally appointed, even as Chutkan has said she’d let the former president file that motion to dismiss.
She took a swipe at the ruling that Judge Aileen Cannon handed down this summer dismissing the classified documents case on that basis, calling that ruling not particularly “persuasive.”
She also emphasized that a concurrence by Justice Clarence Thomas – which Cannon’s ruling cited – that laid out those constitutional concerns was “dicta,” meaning non-binding language. And she noted that there is already DC Circuit precedent on the books upholding the constitutionality of special counsels, which would be binding on her as a trial judge in Washington, DC.
Nevertheless, she is letting the Trump team take a shot. However, when his lawyers file the motion that asks for permission to formally make those arguments, they must elaborate on why they should be allowed to do so, Chutkan said.
Chutkan requested in Thursday afternoon’s order that Trump file his challenge to the legality of Smith’s appointment and for the special counsel to respond in late October, with the final brief from Trump on that issue due on November 7, two days after the election.

XW7KTMYRJF_TZVKXRVFW9X1DBH,"Germany’s far-right party AfD set to win one state election, and is level in another, exit polls show","By Nadine Schmidt, Claudia Otto and Matthies Otto, CNN","2 minute read Updated 6:03 PM EDT, Sun September 1, 2024",20240901,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/01/europe/far-right-germany-regional-election-win-intl-latam/,"For the first time since 1945 a German far-right party is projected to win in regional elections, exit polls show.
Founded in 2013, far-right Alternative für Deutschland – or Alternative for Germany (AfD) - is on track to claim victory in state parliamentary elections in the country’s eastern region of Thuringia, initial exit polls by German state broadcaster ZDF show.
AfD is projected to get 33.5% of the vote, well ahead of the conservative party Christian Democrats (CDU) with 24.5%, according to ZDF.
In Saxony, which also held a regional election Sunday, the two parties are neck and neck, according to state broadcaster ZDF.
Newly founded left-wing party, the Sarah Wagenknecht alliance – or BSW – looks to be coming in third in both Thuringia and Saxony, where roughly 1.7 million people and 3.3 million were eligible to vote, respectively.
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s Social Democratic Party (SPD) is projected to get disappointing results in both states.
The local elections results in Thuringia and Saxony are seen by many as a litmus test for Scholz and his coalition partners ahead of next year’s general elections. While the AfD has put immigration front and center of its agenda, the coalition built by Scholz is creaking, with infighting, disagreements about policy and accusations that elected officials no longer represent the values they were initially elected for.
AfD co-chair Alice Weisel called the results in Thuringia a “historic success,” reflecting the people’s “rejection” of Scholz’s coalition government.
“This is an even stronger result than in the last elections and, accordingly, we will of course emerge stronger from the elections,” she said.

“It is a rejection of this coalition and they should ask themselves whether they can continue to govern at all. The question should be raised for new elections. Because it can’t go on like this,” she added.
AfD would very unlikely be able to form a regional government, struggling to find allies in other parties.
Branches of the AfD are classified as suspected right-wing extremist by Germany’s intelligence agency and the party’s top candidate in Thuringia, Björn Höcke has been fined twice for using a Nazi slogan.
Regional elections take place every five years in Germany and each state can have their election at various dates. The German state of Brandenburg is set to head to the polls on September 22."
Y1UX9O4726_GLXI7UQLYAY88DB,Why your next trip to the gyno might be different: There’s an alternative to Pap smears,"By Jacqueline Howard, CNN","7 minute read Updated 8:50 AM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/05/health/cervical-cancer-screening-self-collection-kits/,"The first shipments of some self-collection HPV tests for cervical cancer screening are currently on their way to doctors’ offices across the United States.
In May, the US Food and Drug Administration gave the greenlight for patients to have the option to collect their own vaginal samples for cervical cancer screenings instead of undergoing traditional HPV tests or Pap smears, which involve a speculum to screen for the disease. Similar to how they may collect their own urine samples, patients can now collect their own vaginal samples in a health-care setting, such as a doctor’s office, urgent care or pharmacy clinic.
Related article FDA greenlights self-collection of vaginal samples for cervical cancer screening
So far, two health care businesses – biotechnology company Roche and medical technology firm BD – already have HPV tests that can be used with self-collected samples. Most cervical cancer screenings involve testing for human papillomavirus or HPV, as most cervical cancers are caused by the virus.
Shipments of the BD self-collection HPV tests began Thursday, according to the company. And Roche anticipates that its HPV self-collection screening solution will be shipped sometime this fall.
The hope is that providing a self-collection method will make screening more accessible for patients, leading to more women being screened, said Dr. Jeff Andrews, board-certified gynecologist and vice president of Global Medical Affairs for Diagnostic Solutions at BD.
Each year in the United States, more than 11,000 new cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed and about 4,000 women die of the disease, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It’s estimated that about half of invasive cervical cancer cases are diagnosed in people who have never been screened and about 10% of diagnoses are in people who had not been screened in the five years prior.
“In other countries in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, we know that adding the option of self-collection has reached some of those women who were previously under screened. So that’s the main goal, is to develop a methodology that would appeal to persons with a cervix who would otherwise not be screened,” Andrews said.
“In the United States in particular, almost 30% of women are unscreened or under screened,” he said. “Those women are the ones most likely to have cervical cancer. About two-thirds of cervical cancers occur in women who are not screened within the interval,” as in the recommended time interval for which women are recommended to screen.
The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for cervical cancer with cervical cytology– also known as a Pap test or Pap smear –every three years for women ages 21 to 29. For women ages 30 to 65, the USPSTF recommends screening every three years with cervical cytology alone, every five years with high-risk HPV testing alone, or every five years with high-risk HPV testing in combination with cytology.
Typically, gynecologists collect samples for HPV testing, a cervical cytology or both – and any of those screening methods, in which samples are collected, can feel uncomfortable for some patients when they involve a speculum.
Cervical cytology involves examining cervical cells for changes to find precancerous or cancerous cells. The HPV test checks cells for infection with the high-risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer. An HPV and Pap co-test uses both tests together to check for both high-risk HPV and cervical cell changes.

It’s estimated that about 80% of people will get an HPV infection in their lifetime. HPV, a group of more than 150 viruses, is spread primarily through sexual contact and includes low-risk strains, which most often cause warts, and high-risk strains, which have been associated with an increased risk of certain cancers, such as cervical, anal, penile and oropharyngeal cancers. In most cases, HPV clears on its own within two years, but when the infection does not go away, health problems like cancer may occur.
“Almost all cervical cancers are caused by persistent infection with certain types of HPV,” Dr. Karen E. Knudsen, CEO of the American Cancer Society, said in a news release in May when the FDA approved HPV self-collection testing for cervical cancer screening. “Self-collection can expand access to screening and reduces barriers, which will give more people the opportunity to detect, treat, and ultimately survive cancer.”
For some patients, having a provider collect a vaginal sample for cervical cancer screening or HPV testing can be painful or awkward. The screening process involves a patient spreading their legs, with their feet held in stirrups, as their doctor vaginally inserts a cold, metal speculum so that they can then scrape cells from their cervix.
Many patients may skip recommended Pap exams to screen for cervical cancer because the process of a traditional Pap smear screening can be painful.

Research suggests that having the perception that a Pap test will be painful significantly reduces the likelihood of women setting the goal to schedule their first-ever Pap exam. But minimizing pain during a Pap test will likely increase acceptability of and adherence to cervical cancer screenings.
“If we can increase screening, we can reduce the incidence of this cancer. Having another modality or choice to make screening more accessible and available is important especially for our underinsured and underserved populations. Self-screening offers this extra choice for women,” Dr. John Vullo, chairman of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Catholic Health’s Good Samaritan University Hospital on Long Island and associate chair of Catholic Health Women’s Health Services, said in an email.
“Although I believe this new choice is important to offer our patients, I am glad the current recommendations are for it to be used under the supervision of a provider so that the patient can truly get and understand the benefits and limitations of this new testing,” Vullo said in part. “This will allow us to offer them another modality to screen for cervical cancer while still giving them the benefit of speaking with a provider to discuss other health issues that are part of the annual well woman exam.”
For the self-collection screening test, a clinician would have to order the test for a patient, and “that is to be sure that the person doing the test will get the results explained to them, so the person now would be in contact with their provider,” Andrews said.
That order would be directed to a lab. The lab would then create a self-collection kit, which would include instructions, a six-inch swab and the screening test itself. The kit would be shipped to the doctor’s office for the patient. The patient would use the swab to self-collect a vaginal sample, by inserting it three inches into the vagina – this could be done in the bathroom at the doctor’s office – and then the doctor’s office would ship the sample to the lab for processing. If a sample tests positive, the doctor would likely recommend further testing.
While the self-collection method is now available in health-care settings, companies are hoping the self-collection kits could eventually be cleared for use at home, too.
BD has been working closely with the FDA to provide data supporting the use of its self-collection tests within the home, Andrews said.
Another company, Teal Health, has developed an at-home cervical cancer screening device called the Teal Wand that was granted “breakthrough device” status in May by the FDA, which would allow the agency to review the device on a faster timeline.
“FDA’s recognition of the Teal Wand as a Breakthrough device acknowledges the important public health benefit that self-collection for cervical cancer screening can have on those who are rarely screened or who do not participate in clinician-based screening for cervical cancer,” Trena Depel, vice president of clinical and regulatory at Teal Health, said in a news release at the time.
Regardless of where it takes place, screening for cervical cancer remains important because early cases often may not have signs or symptoms. Advanced cases may cause abnormal vaginal bleeding or unusual discharge. Cervical cancer is treated in many ways, including surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy.
Some of the most important steps women can take to help prevent cervical cancer, according to the CDC, are to get vaccinated against HPV, not smoke, use condoms during sex, have regular screening tests and go back to see the doctor if screening test results are not normal."
Y639SSEEMF_08H8OMP241SQYVK,Police kill armed man near Israeli consulate in Munich terror attack,"By Claudia Otto, Stephanie Halasz and Matthies Otto, CNN","4 minute read Updated 2:21 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/05/europe/munich-police-shoot-armed-suspect-intl/,"German police shot dead an armed man after a terror attack near the Israeli consulate in central Munich on Thursday, officers said, prompting an investigation by state prosecutors.
The suspect – an 18-year-old Austrian citizen – was armed with an older rifle with a mounted bayonet when he was shot on Karolinenplatz, a square near the Israeli consulate and a Nazi documentation center, according to police in Munich.
The suspect was fatally injured after shots were exchanged, Munich police said in a post on X. Five officers were involved in the shootout, according to Andreas Franken, a police spokesperson.

At least 500 personnel were called to the scene in Munich’s city center, Bavarian Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann said. A helicopter was deployed to provide a more detailed assessment of the incident, according to Reuters.
There is no indication other suspects may be involved, police added. Authorities assume the attack was planned, Herrmann told reporters on Tuesday. The teenager had parked a car near the scene of the shooting.
One unnamed eyewitness told German media that he heard several bullets fired, before police shot the suspect to the ground.
“I heard several shots and, as a member of a shooting club, I knew immediately that they were firing,” the 65-year-old man told Bild newspaper. “It took several minutes for the first police officers to come up behind him. They then shot him at least 30 to 40 times. After that, I just heard them shouting: ‘He’s lying on the ground, he’s not moving.’”
The suspect may have been influenced by religious extremism, the Bavarian attorney general’s office said on Tuesday, after launching an investigation into the shooting.
“There are indications that the perpetrator was known in the Islamist environment. The investigation is ongoing, so nothing concrete can be said at this stage,” chief public prosecutor Florian Weinzierl, said on Thursday. Officials will investigate whether other people knew about the crime.
The suspect was already known to police in February 2023, after making a dangerous threat against pupils and causing bodily harm, according to the Austrian police department in Salzburg.
He was also accused of participating in a terrorist organization, and was active online. The teenager was also interested in explosives and weapons, the police department added. In April 2023, the Salzburg public prosecutor’s office dropped all charges, following an investigation.
Authorities confirmed a weapons ban against the then 17-year-old, which was scheduled to remain in place until at least the beginning of 2028. He had not been reported to officers since then, the police department added.
The incident took place on the anniversary of the 1972 Munich Olympics terror attack – when a Palestinian militant group entered the quarters of Israel’s national team. Eleven Israeli athletes were killed in the ensuing standoff.
It is not clear if Thursday’s incident is at connected to the 1972 event, but the Israeli consulate nearby was closed for a commemoration.
Bavarian Minister President Markus Soeder cautioned there is a “terrible suspicion” that the shooting was linked to the anniversary, but said more clarification was needed to determine the motive.
“The protection of Jewish institutions is of central importance to us,” he said in a press conference on Tuesday. “The motives and backgrounds of the perpetrators will certainly have to be determined in the coming hours, but one thing is clear, there is a serious suspicion, because today is the anniversary of the attack in Munich in 1972, there may be a connection.”
On Facebook, Talya Lador-Fresher, the Israeli consul general in Munich said, “We are very grateful to the police in Munich for their actions and cooperation. This event shows how dangerous the rise of Antisemitism is. It is important that the general public speaks against this. Our Consulate General was closed today to commemorate 52 years since the terrorist attack at the Olympics.”
Chancellor Olaf Scholz condemned the terror attack on Thursday.
“Let me be clear: anti-Semitism and Islamism have no place in our country,” he said in a post on X. “The quick reaction of the emergency services in Munich today may have prevented something terrible from happening. I am very grateful to them for that.”
The incident came on the heels of a divisive round of regional elections in Germany – after the Alternative for Germany (AfD) became the first far-right party to win a state election in the country since the Nazi era, on Sunday.

YCGO8P8TXJ_9KKYEC6MWN6QGJL,The company formerly known as Lumber Liquidators is going out of business,"By Jordan Valinsky, CNN","3 minute read Published 9:30 AM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/04/business/ll-flooring-liquidation/,"LL Flooring, formerly known as Lumber Liquidators, is going out of business after the bankrupt company failed to find a buyer to rescue the 30-year-old retailer.
As a result, LL Flooring will liquidate. Sales at its remaining 200 stores will begin on September 6, setting in motion an “orderly wind-down of operations” that will be completed in about 12 weeks. Roughly 2,000 workers will lose their jobs.
LL Flooring started out as Lumber Liquidators about three decades ago as a company that bought and sold excess inventory. The company expanded, and currently sells about 500 varieties of hard-surface floors. LL Flooring had more than 400 locations at its peak in 2018.
The company, which filed for Chapter 11 just three weeks ago, started closing 94 locations and began searching for a buyer. The retailer previously said it was in “active negotiations with multiple bidders.” However, in a new statement, the company said those “discussions have not resulted in an offer, with the necessary financing, that would maximize the value of LL Flooring.”
LL Flooring said instead that “a sale of the company’s individual assets, holding closing sales at our stores and winding down the business will deliver the most value to its creditors.”
“As a result, it is with a heavy heart that we must let you know that we are going to begin the process of winding down LL Flooring’s business and closing all of our stores,” the company said in a letter to customers. “This is not the outcome that any of us had hoped for.”
Customers’ flooring orders will be fulfilled within 30 days, the company said, but new installation appointments will stop after September 6.
LL Flooring changed its name from Lumber Liquidators in 2021 following a controversial few years.
In 2015, a “60 Minutes” investigation aired an undercover video showing the company’s suppliers saying that they provided the company products with formaldehyde that exceeded regulatory standards.
Three years later, Lumber Liquidators paid $36 million to settle class-action lawsuits brought by customers who bought the laminate between 2009 and 2015. The company did not admit wrongdoing in the settlement agreement.
In 2019, the company agreed to pay $33 million in penalties for misleading investors about the formaldehyde.
LL Flooring’s closure also adds to the growing list of well-known retailers disappearing because customers are cutting back spending on non-essential items.
That has resulted in furniture chains Z Gallerie and Mitchell Gold + Bob Williams filing for bankruptcy within the past year, and Wayfair drastically reducing its workforce.
Conn’s HomePlus, a 134-year-old furniture and electronics retailer, recently filed for bankruptcy and is in the process of closing all of its stores. Most recently, Big Lots said it plans to shutter a quarter of its stores."
YFW20DL5DT_5WB18M4F2N9WJEB,Former aide to New York governors charged with acting as an agent of the Chinese government,"By Gloria Pazmino and Mark Morales, CNN","8 minute read Updated 10:56 AM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240903,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/03/us/linda-sun-former-hochul-staff-arrest/,"A former aide to New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and former Gov. Andrew Cuomo was charged with acting as an agent for the Chinese government, US Attorney Breon Peace announced Tuesday.
Linda Sun, a former deputy chief of staff to Hochul and Cuomo aide, was charged with violating and conspiring to violate the Foreign Agents Registrations Act, visa fraud, alien smuggling and money laundering conspiracy, according to an unsealed copy of the indictment.
Her husband and co-defendant, Chris Hu, was also charged with money laundering conspiracy and conspiracy to commit bank fraud as well as misusing means of identification, prosecutors said.
Their home was raided by federal investigators in July, according to sources.
Sun acted as “an undisclosed agent of the Chinese government while her husband, Hu, facilitated the transfer of millions of dollars in kickbacks for personal gain,” prosecutors said in a news release.
While working for state government, Sun influenced the messaging of high-level state officials regarding issues of importance to China, blocked Taiwanese government representatives from access to the officials, and obtained official New York State proclamations for Chinese government representatives without authorization, prosecutors alleged in the indictment.
The couple’s arrest comes at a time when US-China relations remain fraught over a host of frictions including Beijing’s aggressions in the South China Sea and toward Taiwan, and US trade controls targeting China.
Sun and Hu were arrested at their Long Island residence Tuesday morning.
Sun and Hu both pleaded not guilty to all charges in federal court Tuesday afternoon. Sun’s bond is set at $1.5 million and her husband’s is set at $500,000. Both will have their travel limited to New York City, Long Island, Maine and New Hampshire. Their next court date was set for September 25.
During the hearing, prosecutors alleged the defendants used shell companies, iCloud accounts and WeChat messages – with everything in Mandarin – in their alleged crimes.
Defense attorney Seth DuCharme addressed reporters outside court Tuesday, saying “we have a lot of confidence in our case.”
“A lot of the allegations in this indictment are frankly perplexing, overly inflammatory,” he said. “As you heard in court today, we are looking forward to our day in court. The defendants are exercising their right to a speedy trial as soon as they can; we have a lot of confidence in Chris and in Linda.”
An attorney for Sun, Jarrod Schaeffer, told CNN the charges “are inflammatory and appear to be the product of an overly aggressive prosecution.”
“We are also troubled by aspects of the government’s investigation. As we said today in court, our client is eager … to defend against these accusations in the proper forum – a court of law,” Schaeffer said.
China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was unaware of the aide accused of working for China.
“I am not aware of the situation you mentioned,” spokesperson Mao Ning said, adding, “I will not comment on the domestic cases in the United States, but we oppose malicious associations and slander against China.”

Sun held several government titles for more than a decade. Public employment records and her LinkedIn profile show positions spanned across several agencies focused on New York’s economic development, labor and the executive chamber.
In 2009, Sun was hired as chief of staff in Rep. Grace Meng’s office when Meng was in the State Assembly. The administration of then-Gov. Andrew Cuomo then hired Sun in 2012, naming her director of Asian American affairs and Queens representative. Sun then became director of external affairs for Empire State Development, which handles economic development across the state. In 2018 the Cuomo administration re-hired her, naming her chief diversity officer; she later took a job in the state Department of Financial Services.
After Hochul ascended to the state’s top office in 2021, Sun was hired as deputy chief of staff, serving for about a year before heading for a post as deputy commissioner for strategic business at the Department of Labor, which terminated her employment in March 2023.
That 2023 firing happened after the governor’s office discovered “evidence of misconduct,” Hochul’s press secretary, Avi Small, said in a statement to CNN without elaborating about the misconduct.
“(We) immediately reported her actions to law enforcement and have assisted law enforcement throughout this process,” Small said.
Rich Azzopardi, a spokesperson for Cuomo, said in a statement that national security “must be free from foreign influence.”
“While Ms. Sun was promoted to deputy chief of staff in the subsequent administration, during our time she worked in a handful of agencies and was one of many community liaisons who had little to no interaction with the governor.”
Sun violated internal rules and state government protocols to benefit the Chinese government, according to court documents.
Among Sun’s activities, prosecutors say, she acted as an undisclosed agent of the People’s Republic of China and the Chinese Communist Party, acting at their request and engaging in political activities to further the interests of the CCP.
The indictment details an effort by Sun to secure “unauthorized invitation letters” from the office of the governor which were then used to facilitate travel by government officials with the People’s Republic of China into the United States for meetings with state officials in New York.
Sun’s unauthorized letters included false statements about immigration documents and “induced the foreign citizens into unlawfully entering the United States,” prosecutors wrote.
Prosecutors also allege she tried to “facilitate a trip” to China by a high-level, unnamed New York politician.
Sun and her husband received “substantial economic and other benefits” which included millions of dollars in transactions for PRC business activities of Hu, travel benefits, tickets to events, employment for Sun’s cousin in the PRC, a delivery of “Nanjing-style salted ducks prepared by a PRC official’s personal chef” that were then delivered to the residence of Sun’s parents, among others, according to the indictment.
They also laundered the monetary proceeds to buy real estate in New York and Hawaii and various luxury vehicles, according to the indictment.
Sun is accused of acting at the request of the Chinese government and the CCP to block representatives of the Taiwanese government from having access to state government officials because she knew CCP officials were “opposed to such diplomacy,” according to the court documents.
Prosecutors also said while the office of the governor did not have a position on recognizing Taiwan, Sun used her position to change both Cuomo’s and Hochul’s “messaging regarding issues of importance to the PRC and the CCP” and helped minimize interactions between the governor’s office and representatives from the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the US. Also known as TECO, the office serves as a de facto, yet unofficial, embassy to Taiwan. TECO maintains offices that provide consular and other services across various cities in the US, including New York.
Court documents show Sun used her position to block small shows of diplomacy. In January 2020, a TECO representative wrote a letter to Cuomo informing him of the latest presidential election results in Taiwan and requested a congratulatory message to be forwarded to Taipei. After an employee in the governor’s office flagged the request to Sun, she quickly blocked the effort, responding, “No letter; would set off political firestorm.”
By the time the pandemic arrived in New York, Sun was working behind the scenes to give Chinese officials access to New York government officials, prosecutors say. In one instance, prosecutors say Sun added a Chinese official to a “private New York State government conference call concerning the health response to the Covid-19 pandemic and the administration’s response to rising hate crimes against Asian Americans.” The call was not open to the public.
As the pandemic took hold, court documents say, Sun worked to ensure Cuomo was heaping public praise on Chinese officials for sending medical equipment to the city while simultaneously blocking Taiwan, which also sought public acknowledgment for providing 200,000 masks at the height of the pandemic that was ravaging New York.
In April 2020, a PRC official informed Sun that several Chinese foundations would donate 1,000 ventilators to the Greater New York Hospital Association, according to the indictment. In return, Sun told the official that Cuomo would call him to thank him for the donation. After waiting two hours for the call, the official complained that he had not yet heard from Cuomo. In turn, Sun apologized and indicated that Cuomo would thank him in public and on social media for facilitating the donation which was scheduled to arrive in New York the next day, according to the indictment.
Cuomo is not identified by name in the indictment, but his tenure as governor aligns with the timeline of the allegations.
An archived X post shows Cuomo posted a message of thanks from his government account the next day.
“We finally got some good news today. The Chinese government helped facilitate a donation of 1,000 ventilators that will arrive in JFK today. I thank the Chinese government, Jack Ma, Joe Tsai, the Jack Ma Foundation, the Tsai Foundation and Consul General Huang,” the post reads.
Hochul is furious, outraged and “absolutely shocked at how brazen” Sun’s behavior is alleged to have been, the governor said in an appearance Tuesday evening with WNYC radio.
“It was a betrayal of trust,” Hochul told WNYC about the allegations against Sun.
Hochul said her office fired Sun in 2023 “the second we discovered some levels of misconduct” and “alerted the authorities – and hence we ended up with what happened here today.”
When WNYC asked Hochul for details about why Sun was fired, the governor declined to give specifics, citing authorities’ investigation. The depth of the allegations against Sun were apparent to the governor and her staff only after reading details of the indictment, said Hochul, who emphasized to WNYC that Sun worked only 15 months for her administration and had initially been hired by the previous one.
New York State Senate Republican Leader Rob Ortt has called for an investigation into the alleged breach.
“The fact that a spy for a hostile nation was embedded at the highest levels of our state government under two administrations is an alarming security failure, jeopardizing both New York and the entire country,” Ortt said in a statement. “New York should be a beacon of freedom, a place where people flee from oppressive regimes, not a platform for spies to infiltrate our government and undermine our state and nation.”

YIV3X6PG5X_SO4IEYNOLPJF5TU,"‘Ferocious violence’ accompanied ‘shocking’ levels of abuse at Ireland’s religious-run schools, report finds","By Kara Fox, CNN","4 minute read Updated 9:09 AM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/04/europe/ireland-child-sex-abuse-schools-report-intl/,"Nearly 2,400 allegations of sexual abuse across hundreds of Ireland’s religious-run schools have been documented in a new report, marking the latest grim revelations to emerge from the country’s historic Church-State entanglement.
The report, released Tuesday, documented 2,395 allegations of historical child sexual abuse, involving 884 alleged abusers in 308 schools across the country.
Most of the allegations were reported from the records of 42 religious orders that currently run or previously ran schools in Ireland. The scope of the allegations ranges from 1927-2013. More than half the men accused – which include teachers and priests – have died, it said.
Ireland’s Minister for Education Norma Foley said Tuesday that the level of abuse detailed in the report was “truly shocking – and so is the number of alleged abusers.”
She called the report a “harrowing document, containing some of the most appalling accounts of sexual abuse.”
More than 140 survivors provided harrowing testimony for the report, describing being molested, stripped naked, raped and drugged in “an atmosphere of terror and silence.”
Their abuse was often “accompanied by ferocious violence,” the 700-page report said.
Most of the survivors interviewed for the report are men now in their 50s, 60s and 70s. Some said it was the first time they‘d spoken about the abuse and its impact on them, with many saying that their childhood “stopped the day the abuse started.”
Some survivors said the abuse was “so pervasive” that it could not have gone unnoticed by senior leadership within the religious orders that were running the schools. They added that they believed some of those leaders not only ignored the abuse but facilitated and participated in it.
Others said that they believed there had been a “cover-up” in the schools or by the religious order, and “collusion” between the State and Church.
“Many participants said that they felt that the power of the Catholic Church permeated their lives in every way and, for the majority, they felt there was no one they could tell, including their parents,” the report said.
The Catholic Church has been deeply entwined with the Irish state for much of its history. Although a referendum in the 1970s drastically reduced the Church’s political sway, it remained pervasive in many aspects of civil society. Today, nearly 90% of schools in Ireland remain Catholic, even though the percentage of the population that identifies as such is much lower.
As adults, survivors detailed a litany of difficulties stemming from the abuse, including failed relationships, mental and physical health problems and addiction issues. Some said that the abuse made them decide not to have children. Others who did said it impacted their parenting.
Many survivors said that they had moved away from family and friends to avoid memories of childhood trauma and described feeling alienated from religious services. Some avoided attending a parent’s funeral or other family event because they said they could not enter a church as a result of the abuse.
A government-mandated investigation into sexual abuse at religious-run boarding and day-schools was first launched after Ireland’s national broadcaster RTÉ aired a documentary in 2022 that highlighted systemic sexual abuse at Blackrock College, a prestigious private school in Dublin.

The report found that the abuse was spread across public and private schools, including 17 special education schools – which recorded 590 allegations involving 190 alleged abusers.
Foley said on Tuesday that the Irish government would begin a process of establishing a commission to further investigate the abuse and that a redress scheme would be established.
She said that religious orders have a “moral obligation” to contribute to any future redress scheme.
Meanwhile, those religious orders have not committed to contribute to the Mother and Baby Homes redress scheme, which opened for applications earlier this year.
The 2021 Mother and Baby Homes report found that 9,000 babies and children died in 18 of Ireland’s mother and baby homes – church-run institutions where unmarried women were sent to deliver their babies in secret, often against their will – over eight decades.
The religious congregations who ran Ireland’s Magdalene Laundries – workhouses where thousands of women and girls lived and worked without pay for years in “harsh and physically demanding” situations – have also declined to contribute to a State redress scheme set up in 2013 to compensate the survivors of those institutions."
YLMP8EO66P_6VE6CPRGL8RZTGR,"In Ukraine’s supposed safe haven city, an entire family is wiped out by a Russian missile strike","By Ivana Kottasová and Svitlana Vlasova, CNN","2 minute read Published 11:22 AM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/04/europe/ukraine-safe-haven-city-family-killed-intl/,"Writing in her college application letter, Daryna Bazylevych described her family as “incredibly close knit and harmonious.” She spoke of her parents’ infinite support and the way they told stories about Ukraine’s history to her and her sisters. “They are the strongest pillar in my life and they help me overcome any obstacle,” she wrote.
Of the five members of her family, only Yaroslav, Daryna’s father, is now alive, a lone survivor of a Russian strike on their home in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv on Wednesday.
According to eyewitnesses, Daryna, 18, her sisters Yaryna, 21, and Emilia, 7, and their 43-year-old mother Yevhenia were killed while sheltering in the staircase of their residential building, the Ukrainian emergency services said.
It is likely that Yaroslav survived only because he was in the family apartment when the missile hit the building. He popped over to grab some water for the family — it was him who went because the staircase was meant to be the safe place.
The deaths of the three sisters and their mother caused a huge outpouring of grief among people in Lviv and across Ukraine.
Andriy Sadovyi, the mayor of Lviv, said the eldest girl, Yaryna, worked in the town hall as part of the “Lviv - Youth Capital of Europe 2025” initiative.
Daryna, the middle sister, was a scholarship student of Ukrainian culture at the Ukrainian Catholic University in Lviv. She had just began her second year.
“This is a great and irreparable loss. There are no words that can describe this grief. Let us pray for the souls of the innocent victims. Let us pray for Yaroslav, the father,” the university said in a statement.
Yevhenia, the mother, and the two older girls were members of the Ukrainian Scouts movement. In a statement, the Scouts described Yevhenia as a “creative, intelligent, positive and bright personality.”
The staircase where the Bazylevyches died was meant to be a safe place in a safe city.
Lviv lies in western Ukraine, near the border with Poland, and it has always been seen as one of the safest places in the country.
Tens of thousands of internally displaced people from eastern parts of Ukraine are living in Lviv. Russia is far away, which means missiles and drones take longer to reach the city – giving the Ukrainian military more time to shoot them down.
It has been an exceptionally deadly week for Ukraine — the four members of the Bazylevych family were among seven people killed in Lviv on Wednesday. On Tuesday, two Russian missiles hit a military educational facility in Poltava, killing 53 people and injuring more than 270 others."
YLUIIZC7C6_T2HUFHNB36A07B2,Viral videos of people stealing money from Chase ATMs were just plain check fraud,"By Jordan Valinsky, CNN","2 minute read Updated 3:27 PM EDT, Fri September 6, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/03/business/chase-tiktok-trend/,"A number of viral TikTok videos had some people believing they could get “free” cash from Chase ATMs. But it was just a glitch – and those customers were actually committing fraud, according to the bank.
Over the weekend, videos appeared on the app showing people depositing checks for large sums of money at Chase ATMs and then making a withdrawal for a smaller yet substantial amount, leading them to believe they had discovered a bug and were hitting the jackpot.
The problem is that this is just a form of check fraud, a criminal offense. Chase said in a statement to CNN that the issue has “been addressed” and warned people not to try it.
JPMorgan, the bank’s parent company, is carefully reviewing the situation, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. The bank is still determining how many Chase customers and how much money was involved in the incident, the source said.
On Friday, a Chase representative said the bank is “investigating the incidents,” confirming a report from the Wall Street Journal. But the representative declined to share any information regarding the extent to which law enforcement agencies were involved.
The Federal Reserve declined to comment, and a spokesperson for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said the agency does not comment on specific banks or supervisory activities.
The ruse centers on a banking standard that enables check depositors to have access to a portion of their money before the full total of the check clears. In the case of the viral videos, participants wrote checks for obscene amounts of money and then withdrew as much as they could before the check could bounce.
“Regardless of what you see online, depositing a fraudulent check and withdrawing the funds from your account is fraud, plain and simple,” a Chase spokesperson said.
One video shows participants throwing dollar bills in the air with glee, while other posts showed negative balances in their Chase accounts after trying the “hack.” But that was the bank putting holds on their accounts or deducting the stolen cash from their accounts, according to Jim Wang, a financial educator.
“The people that were doing this were seeing big holes in their accounts or huge negative balances,” Wang said on Instagram. “Bank errors in your favor are almost never in your favor. In the case of this ‘glitch,’ it was just check fraud.”
His advice? “It’s not your money, and when they figure it out, they will want it back. Do not spend it, do not move it, just leave it alone and tell the bank,” Wang said.

YMFO7BQWF9_PJV0B6VGOS3C4SI,2024 race hits critical stretch as debate approaches and first ballots are set to go out,"By Eric Bradner, CNN","9 minute read Updated 9:51 AM EDT, Sun September 1, 2024",20240901,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/01/politics/2024-debate-ballots-harris-trump/,"The 2024 presidential race is entering a critical stretch, with Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump set to debate and the first swing state ballots hitting mailboxes shortly after the Labor Day holiday weekend.
As the calendar turns to September, both campaigns are focusing on on key battleground states — with Harris eyeing an expanded map and Trump digging in across the Upper Midwestern states that delivered him the presidency in 2016 and ousted him from office in 2020.
Meanwhile, voting will begin this week. The first ballots of the 2024 election will go out Friday in North Carolina, one of a handful of potentially critical Sun Belt states. Then, two weeks later, early in-person voting starts in Minnesota, South Dakota and Virginia.
Harris last week focused on the Sun Belt, with a bus tour in Georgia and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, also visiting North Carolina.
“I think we know: Very difficult for a Republican presidential candidate to win the White House if they can’t win North Carolina,” Walz said Thursday during a stop at a campaign field office in Raleigh.
Harris’ campaign is pouring money into advertising in the Savannah media market as it seeks to broaden its appeal outside Atlanta. According to AdImpact data, Harris’ campaign has spent a total of about $1.7 million in advertising there over the last three weeks.
Harris’ top campaign adviser said in a memo Sunday the vice president remains the “clear underdog” in the race, setting expectations and looking to guard against complacency as the fall campaign season begins.
Jen O’Malley Dillon, the Harris campaign chair, wrote that Trump retains a “motivated base of support,” and predicted a close contest.
Pointing to the September 10 debate and an increased pace of travel, O’Malley Dillon said the weeks ahead will be critical in defining the Democratic ticket.
Trump, meanwhile, has turned his attention to the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, holding events in all three states late in the week and promising an economic revival.
“I’m here today with a simple message for the American autoworker and for the American worker: Your long economic nightmare will very soon be over,” the former president said at the start of his remarks at a steel distribution company in Potterville, Michigan.
The candidates are interspersing their campaigning with preparation for their September 10 debate, hosted by ABC. That debate — the first between Harris and Trump, and the only one both campaigns have agreed to so far — could prove the most pivotal moment in the 2024 race.
Trump has enlisted the help of former Hawaii Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, whose failed 2020 presidential bid featured several notable clashes on debate stages with Harris over foreign policy and Harris’ record on criminal justice. Harris, meanwhile, is working closely with Philippe Reines, a longtime aide to Hillary Clinton, who is reprising his role playing Trump at the request of the Harris campaign.
Polls show a tight race nationwide and in critical swing states. A Wall Street Journal survey released Thursday found no clear leader, with Harris at 48% to Trump’s 47% among registered voters. A Quinnipiac University poll out the same day similarly found Harris at 49% and Trump at 47% among likely voters.
Sun Belt states that once appeared to have slipped out of Democratic reach have reemerged on the battleground map since Harris became the party’s nominee. Fox News polls released Wednesday found no clear leader among registered voters in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and South Carolina. The polls found Harris at 50% to Trump’s 49% in Arizona; those numbers flipped, with Trump at 50% and Harris at 49%, in North Carolina. In both Georgia and Nevada, Harris was at 50% to Trump’s 48%.
More than a month after the Democratic change at the top of the ticket, with President Joe Biden dropping his reelection bid and Harris stepping in, Democrats believe they still have momentum.
Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz said in an interview that the race has shifted from one where Democrats were on track to lose and in need of a fundamental shake-up, to one where Republicans are “hoping that there’s some catastrophic moment” in which Harris blows it.
“They’re clearly taken aback by a change in the candidate. But it’s the candidacy that I think is throwing them off. They’ve never run with against someone with such an orientation towards the future,” Schatz said.
“It was always about how you felt about Donald Trump – you were either for Donald Trump or not for Donald Trump or ambivalent. And I think what’s happening is after more than eight years a lot of people would just like not to talk about that man anymore,” he said. “Lots of politicians have attempted to be the leader that could help us to turn the page as a nation and Kamala Harris is evidently the only one that is capable of doing that.”
Republicans, meanwhile, are arguing that Harris’ economic proposals, and her promises of a new era in American politics, are hollow, since she has been vice president for three and a half years and bears at least partial ownership of Biden’s record.
“If she wants to tackle the affordability crisis or close down the southern border, she should be doing it now,” Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance said Friday on “CNN News Central.” “And I think it takes a lot of shame — shamelessness, I should say — to be able to stare at the American people’s eyes and say, I’m going to fix your problems now, when I’ve already been in power for three and a half years.”
Polls have shown Trump with an advantage among men who are likely to vote, but Harris with a huge edge with women. That split is common in presidential elections, but Trump is attempting to chip away at Harris’ advantage with women in part through a focus on reproductive rights.
It’s a topic that has been a huge Democratic advantage since the Supreme Court, with a conservative majority that includes three members appointed by Trump, in 2022 overturned Roe v. Wade’s nationwide abortion rights protections — opening the door to a new patchwork of state-level restrictions.
Trump last week infuriated conservatives with his answer to a question about how he plans to vote on a referendum that will decide the future of abortion access in his home state of Florida.
Under current Florida law, abortion is illegal in most cases after six weeks. Voters this fall will decide on a ballot measure that would make abortion legal in the state up to the point of viability, which many experts believe is around 23 or 24 weeks of a pregnancy.
Trump had repeatedly declined to weigh in on the referendum, but on Thursday, he told NBC that Florida’s six-week ban was “too short” and said he would be “voting that we need more than six weeks.”
A day later, he said he was going to vote “no” on the referendum and, in explaining why he was doing so, repeated a false claim that Democratic states are passing laws that allow people to execute babies after birth.
Also on Thursday, while campaigning in Michigan and Wisconsin, he offered a new proposal aimed at women, pledging universal coverage of in vitro fertilization.
“Under the Trump administration, your government will pay for – or your insurance company will be mandated to pay for – all costs associated with IVF treatment,” Trump said during a campaign event in Michigan. “Because we want more babies, to put it nicely.”
However, senators in his own party, including his running mate, Vance, defeated a bill with a similar provision earlier this summer.
On a Harris campaign call with reporters on Friday, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren said Trump’s promise to have fertility treatments paid for is “just smoke and mirrors” without a commitment to protect the treatments from legal threats.
She pointed to the Alabama Supreme Court ruling earlier this year that deemed that frozen embryos are children, jeopardizing the legality of IVF treatments before Alabama’s Republican governor signed a law protecting IVF access in the state after Trump said he supports the treatment.
She also cited a Senate bill to codify access to IVF nationwide that was blocked by Republicans in June and a House GOP bill that seeks to legally define life as beginning at the moment of conception or fertilization to draw the contrast on protections for reproductive health care.
“Making vague promises about insurance coverage does not stop a single extremist judge or state legislature from banning IVF. Making vague promises about insurance coverage does not stop a single one of the 131 Republicans in Congress from advancing their fetal personhood bill that would ban IVF. Despite what Trump seems to think, American women are smart and we aren’t falling for his gaslighting,” Warren said.
Harris’ campaign on Friday also countered Trump by announcing a new bus tour aimed at advocating for women’s reproductive rights. The “Fighting for Reproductive Freedom” bus tour will kick off Tuesday in Palm Beach, Florida – Trump’s hometown – with Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Harris-Walz campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez, CNN senior political commentator Ana Navarro and reproductive rights storyteller Anya Cook.
It wasn’t just Trump’s pledge of universal coverage of IVF that lacked details.
Both Harris and Trump have discussed policy through the lens of details and aspirations, rather than addressing the difficult questions about the exact contours of their proposals, how they’d win approval on Capitol Hill and how they’d be funded — all of which would confront them in the Oval Office.
Harris has said she would aim to help the middle class by targeting price-gouging, making housing more affordable through $25,000 in down-payment support for first-time homebuyers, offering a child tax credit, lowering drug prices and creating new jobs.
Trump, meanwhile, has pledged the largest deportation effort in US history, and has said it would involve the National Guard and perhaps the military. But he has not addressed how he would solve the constitutional, logistical and manpower issues that such an undertaking would involve.
He has also ducked specific questions about abortion rights, claiming he could bring about a national consensus policy on an issue that has been a wedge in American politics for more than 50 years.
In fact, the most detailed policy blueprint in the 2024 race — “Project 2025,” a 920-page document organized by The Heritage Foundation think tank and developed in significant part by people who served in Trump’s administration — is one Harris’ campaign has used to attack Trump, while the former president distanced himself from it.
The missing details could be fleshed out when Harris and Trump meet for their first debate on September 10. Another key moment will come on October 1, when CBS hosts the vice presidential debate between Harris’ running mate, Walz, and Trump’s No. 2, Vance.

YOC5CVIJ34_RYEQ2RJEYQVKCO9,Trump’s hardline new quest to destroy Harris’ momentum,"Analysis by Stephen Collinson, CNN","7 minute read Updated 9:57 AM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240903,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/03/politics/trump-quest-destroy-harris-momentum/,"Donald Trump is trying to crush Democratic nominee Kamala Harris’ persona as a force of change and to destroy her personal credibility as a potential president as their still-fresh competition careens into the final nine weeks before Election Day.
In recent days, the ex-president has unveiled a broad assault using the insult-driven politics with which he won power in 2016, even as his advisers have been pleading with him to focus his attention on top voter concerns including high prices and immigration.
He is seizing on foreign tragedies to accuse the vice president of responsibility for the deaths of US troops in Afghanistan and claiming she’s complicit in killings of hostages in Gaza. He and his running mate, JD Vance, implied her mixed race — heritage that millions of Americans share — is evidence of a sinister “chameleon”-like character that also explains policy reversals on energy and immigration. In an ugly moment, he amplified a sexually themed social media slander against her. And his dark campaign ads allege she will slash Social Security benefits by welcoming millions of undocumented migrants to the country.
And in a reprise of past GOP campaigns branding Democratic nominees as extreme liberals, Trump and his supporters are trying to frame Harris as a communist and a “Bolshevik.” South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem blasted Harris’ running mate, Tim Walz, as a “security risk” because he once taught in China. And Trump has also started to imply the coming election might not be “free and fair” and said in an interview that aired Sunday that it was ridiculous to indict him for “interfering” in the 2020 election. This and other recent comments raised the specter of another national nightmare if he loses in November and refuses to accept defeat.
Trump’s desperation to find traction has also seen him perform his own policy gyrations on reproductive rights as he seeks to narrow a huge gender gap in polling. But his credibility may already be shattered after he built the conservative Supreme Court majority that overturned the nationwide constitutional right to an abortion. Vance also seems to have a knack for alienating female voters — like when he compared Harris to a nerve-struck Miss Teen USA contestant.
Trump is not simply being true to his ill-disciplined self. He’s illustrating his struggle to respond to Harris’ transformation of the race. Increasingly brazen attempts to puncture Harris’ bubble of hope also betray frustration in the Trump camp that she’s managing to distinguish herself from her boss and is presenting a fresher option than her 78-year-old GOP rival. And Trump is showing that there’s almost nothing he won’t do to win.
Trump’s invective amounts to some of the most hardline political rhetoric in years, even by his own standards, and means the next two months are likely to be brutal.
The question is whether this barrage of negative attacks is merely successful in stoking feelings of existential anger Trump uses to drive his base the polls, or whether it begins to tarnish Harris at the margins in battleground states.
It may make some sense for Trump to throw everything he can think of at Harris. In two presidential elections, the ex-president has never risen above 49% of the vote in the so-called blue wall states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin or in the national popular count. So his chances in November may depend more on destroying the current feel-good factor around Harris and depressing her prospects among small groups of persuadable voters in swing states than on holding out hope of winning over new voters himself.
But Trump’s behavior brings its own risks. His antics last week, including a grinning, thumbs-up gravesite campaign photo-op in Arlington National Cemetery that may have broken the law, could bolster Harris’ warnings that Americans are pining for a chance to leave the bitterness and chaos of the Trump era behind.
Even though Harris has restored the contest to a neck-and-neck race, her campaign recognizes the still potent threat from Trump. “Make no mistake: the next 65 days will be very hard,” Harris campaign manager Jennifer O’Malley Dillion wrote in a weekend memo despite arguing the vice president has multiple paths to the White House. “This race will remain incredibly close, and the voters who will decide this election will require an extraordinary amount of work to win over.”
Harris campaigned in Detroit and with Biden in Pittsburgh to mark Labor Day on Monday, reflecting the importance of union members. Blue-collar workers traditionally voted Democrat, but Trump’s cultural transformation of the GOP now appeals to many workers, especially in rural areas. And Harris’ appearance with Biden in the Steel City previewed how the lame-duck president could help her campaign in a state and among a voting demographic where he remains popular.
The campaign swing comes a week before the critical meeting between Harris and Trump on a debate stage slated for September 10 in Philadelphia — one of the final foreseeable turning points of this campaign, with mail-in voting starting later this week.
Trump’s feral political offensive is a warning for Harris about what may lay ahead and underscores how hard it will be to prolong the smooth rollout of her sudden candidacy, her pick of Walz and her successful convention. But the ex-president’s intensity is also a sign — which is reflected in favorable public polling nationally and in swing states — that his early efforts to negatively define her have not worked.
Harris is being criticized by Republicans for a lack of policy specificity and reversing previous positions on fracking and immigration. But her adoption of centrist positions also appears to be squeezing Trump and frustrating his efforts to land a decisive political attack. Her decision to take on high grocery prices with a vow to clamp down on supermarket giants might explain how she’s narrowed the gap with Trump on who is most trusted on the economy.
The flap over Trump’s visit to Arlington National Cemetery last week also showed how the ex-president’s hardball tactics could hurt him as much as her.
Trump’s honoring of 13 US service members killed in a suicide bombing amid the chaotic US evacuation of Afghanistan in 2021 highlights one of the worst moments of the Biden-Harris administration. And while the vice president joined Situation Room meetings on the crisis, it’s not clear yet whether Trump can saddle her with personal responsibility for the deaths in the minds of voters since Biden was commander in chief at the time.
Harris took steps to counter Trump’s Afghan gambit when she wrote on social media that he had “disrespected sacred ground all for the sake of a political stunt” in filming campaign videos at gravesites and that this was part of a pattern of disparaging the sacrifices of American warriors. Trump responded by posting videos of some of the relatives of the fallen soldiers accusing Harris and Biden of complicity in the murder of their loved ones and supporting Trump.
The harrowing episode showed how Trump is willing to cross lines that more conventional politicians would consider off-limits. While some voters might consider he’s honoring slain troops, others might agree with Harris that he is seizing on the deaths of Americans in foreign wars for political gain.
On other issues, Harris is refusing to be drawn into gutter for political fights with Trump that might tarnish her image. For instance, the vice president was asked by CNN’s Dana Bash in an exclusive interview last week about Trump’s claim that she “happened to turn Black” for political reasons. “Same old tired playbook. Next question, please,” Harris said.
The Harris campaign did, however, jump on Trump’s argument that he did nothing wrong in 2020. The ex-president said in a Fox News interview that aired Sunday: “Whoever heard you get indicted for interfering with a presidential election, where you have every right to do it?”
Harris-Walz spokesperson Sarafina Chitika folded his comment into the campaign’s wider argument that it’s time to consign Trump’s dictatorial instincts to the past. “The American people are ready for a new way forward. They know Vice President Harris is the tough-as-nails prosecutor we need to turn the page on chaos, fear, and division, and uphold the rule of law,” Chitika said.
The exchange encapsulated the bets at the center of the campaign’s bitter endgame: Trump is putting his faith in a searing attempt to do anything it takes to bring Harris down; the vice president is wagering that his extreme attempts to do so will convince enough voters he’s unfit to return to the Oval Office."
YRZ1FQXFZQ_67ZACT23K0LGRMH,The company formerly known as Lumber Liquidators is going out of business,"By Jordan Valinsky, CNN","3 minute read Published 9:30 AM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/04/business/ll-flooring-liquidation/,"LL Flooring, formerly known as Lumber Liquidators, is going out of business after the bankrupt company failed to find a buyer to rescue the 30-year-old retailer.
As a result, LL Flooring will liquidate. Sales at its remaining 200 stores will begin on September 6, setting in motion an “orderly wind-down of operations” that will be completed in about 12 weeks. Roughly 2,000 workers will lose their jobs.
LL Flooring started out as Lumber Liquidators about three decades ago as a company that bought and sold excess inventory. The company expanded, and currently sells about 500 varieties of hard-surface floors. LL Flooring had more than 400 locations at its peak in 2018.
The company, which filed for Chapter 11 just three weeks ago, started closing 94 locations and began searching for a buyer. The retailer previously said it was in “active negotiations with multiple bidders.” However, in a new statement, the company said those “discussions have not resulted in an offer, with the necessary financing, that would maximize the value of LL Flooring.”
LL Flooring said instead that “a sale of the company’s individual assets, holding closing sales at our stores and winding down the business will deliver the most value to its creditors.”
“As a result, it is with a heavy heart that we must let you know that we are going to begin the process of winding down LL Flooring’s business and closing all of our stores,” the company said in a letter to customers. “This is not the outcome that any of us had hoped for.”
Customers’ flooring orders will be fulfilled within 30 days, the company said, but new installation appointments will stop after September 6.
LL Flooring changed its name from Lumber Liquidators in 2021 following a controversial few years.
In 2015, a “60 Minutes” investigation aired an undercover video showing the company’s suppliers saying that they provided the company products with formaldehyde that exceeded regulatory standards.
Three years later, Lumber Liquidators paid $36 million to settle class-action lawsuits brought by customers who bought the laminate between 2009 and 2015. The company did not admit wrongdoing in the settlement agreement.
In 2019, the company agreed to pay $33 million in penalties for misleading investors about the formaldehyde.
LL Flooring’s closure also adds to the growing list of well-known retailers disappearing because customers are cutting back spending on non-essential items.
That has resulted in furniture chains Z Gallerie and Mitchell Gold + Bob Williams filing for bankruptcy within the past year, and Wayfair drastically reducing its workforce.
Conn’s HomePlus, a 134-year-old furniture and electronics retailer, recently filed for bankruptcy and is in the process of closing all of its stores. Most recently, Big Lots said it plans to shutter a quarter of its stores."
YTMQX2EIP4_532F2MJRP103BTF,Exclusive: John McCain’s son decries Trump appearance at Arlington as a ‘violation’ that turned cemetery into campaign backdrop,"By Natasha Bertrand, CNN","5 minute read Updated 5:05 PM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240903,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/03/politics/jimmy-mccain-decries-trump-arlington-appearance/,"When former President Donald Trump held a campaign event at Arlington National Cemetery last week, 1st Lt. Jimmy McCain says he viewed it as a “violation.”
The youngest son of the late Sen. John McCain had already been moving away from the Republican Party — just weeks ago, he changed his voter registration to Democrat and plans to vote for Kamala Harris in November, he told CNN in an exclusive interview this week.
But he is speaking out now for the first time about Trump because of the former president’s conduct at the hallowed ground where several generations of McCain’s family, including his grandfather and great grandfather, are buried.
“It just blows me away,” McCain, who has served in the military for 17 years, told CNN. “These men and women that are laying in the ground there have no choice” of whether to be a backdrop for a political campaign, he said.
“I just think that for anyone who’s done a lot of time in their uniform, they just understand that inherently — that it’s not about you there. It’s about these people who gave the ultimate sacrifice in the name of their country.”
McCain’s decision to speak out now is part of his broader shift away from the Republican Party and his family’s famously conservative roots. After years as a registered independent, he says he registered as a Democrat several weeks ago and plans to vote for Kamala Harris in November, adding that he “would get involved in any way I could” to help her campaign.
It’s a significant move for the son of a former GOP presidential candidate and Arizona senator. While other members of the McCain family have distanced themselves from Trump — including Jimmy McCain’s mother Cindy, who endorsed then-candidate Joe Biden in 2020, and his sister Meghan — none except Jimmy have publicly abandoned the Republican Party.
Despite her harsh criticisms of Trump, Meghan McCain indicated last week that she would still not endorse Harris. “I’m a lifelong, generational conservative,” she tweeted.
Jimmy McCain, who enlisted in the Marine Corps at age 17 and now serves as an intelligence officer in the 158th Infantry Regiment, had until now deliberately sought to avoid entering the political fray. Trump’s attacks on his father — that he was “not a war hero” because he was captured in Vietnam, and his reported description of the elder McCain as a “loser” — were deeply hurtful on a personal level, but not out of bounds politically, Jimmy McCain believes.
“One thing about John McCain is that he chose a public life,” McCain said. “So to attack him is really not out of the realm of his job description.”
For the younger McCain, though, the Arlington episode and how the campaign has reacted to it represents a whole new level of what he perceives as Trump’s disrespect for the fallen. And he believes it stems from Trump’s own insecurities about not having served.
“Many of these men and women, who served their country, chose to do something greater than themselves,” McCain said. “They woke up one morning, they signed on the dotted line, they put their right hand up, and they chose to serve their country. And that’s an experience that Donald Trump has not had. And I think that might be something that he thinks about a lot.”
McCain emphasized that he is speaking on his own behalf and his views do not represent those of the US Army. McCain received his commission and became an officer in US Army intelligence in 2022.
McCain’s anger over the Arlington episode was also particularly acute because when it happened, he had just returned from a seven-month deployment to a small US base on the Jordan-Syria border known as Tower 22.
He arrived there just weeks after three US service members were killed on the base in a drone attack by Iran-backed militants, and he says he thought of them when he saw Trump posing last Monday in front of gravestones.
“It was a violation,” McCain said. “That mother, that sister, those families, see that — and it’s a painful experience.”
Trump visited the cemetery last Monday following a wreath laying ceremony honoring the 13 US military service members who were killed at Kabul airport’s Abbey Gate in Afghanistan in 2021. His campaign filmed the visit, leading to an altercation with a cemetery staffer who attempted to prevent Trump’s team from photographing and filming in the area where recent US casualties are buried. According to the Army, doing so violates federal law, Army regulations and Defense Department policies.
Trump is not the first politician to violate a ban on political activity at Arlington. In fact, more than 20 years ago, John McCain said he made “a very bad mistake” when he released a campaign ad that featured a clip of him walking through the cemetery.
Trump and his campaign, however, have not issued such a mea culpa. Instead, according to the US Army, they ignored and “abruptly pushed aside” a cemetery staffer who protested the activity and published footage of the event later anyway. One of Trump’s campaign managers, Chris LaCivita, called the Army “hacks” and said it was “100% a manufactured story.”
Over the weekend, Trump’s campaign released taped statements from family members of some of the service members who were killed at Abbey Gate, who said they invited Trump to their loved ones’ graves. But the campaign’s video of the event, which they put on TikTok, showed other gravestones, too — including that of an Army Special Forces soldier who died by suicide, and whose family said they did not give the campaign permission to film it.
McCain, for his part, is now bracing to get more involved in this election cycle. While he has been involved in veteran advocacy work for years, he acknowledges that his own recent political shift has been deeply personal.
“John McCain was my father, and a lot of people lose that in the minutia,” McCain said. “He wasn’t ‘John McCain’ the way he is to the world. He was the man who loved me. And the one thing I’ve known about my dad since the moment I could think, was that he was a good man and that he had done his part. And for me to be with him towards the end of his life, hearing things [from Trump] like, he was a loser because he was captured—I don’t think I could ever overlook that.”"

On Monday, Musk posted an AI-generated image on his social media platform that depicted Harris as a communist, wearing a red uniform complete with hammer and sickle emblazoned hat.
Musk, who has endorsed former President Donald Trump for president and poured millions into a super PAC supporting the Republican, captioned the image with the false assertion, “Kamala vows to be a communist dictator on day one. Can you believe she wears that outfit!?”
The image, which appeared to violate X’s policy on manipulated content, resembled an AI-generated image posted by Trump last month during the Democratic National Convention, envisioning Harris addressing a crowd under communist symbols.
Musk’s post came a day after he shared another post with a screenshot suggesting that only “high status males” should be able to participate in government because women (and men with “low testosterone”) are not capable of critical thought. Musk posted it to his 196 million followers with the comment, “interesting observation.”
The sexist screed appears to have originated on 4Chan, the notorious hate-filled website that has been linked to mass-shootings.
By choosing to amplify disinformation and misogynist views, Musk, a South African billionaire who is both the owner of X and the most-followed account on the platform, is promoting radical content to the masses that might otherwise languish in the darkest corners of the internet.
By Tuesday afternoon, less than 24 hours after Musk shared the fake image and false statement depicting Harris as a communist, the post had been viewed nearly 60 million times, according to data from X. Musk’s post suggesting women shouldn’t take part in democracy had been viewed more than 19 million times.
X did not respond to a CNN request for comment.
The posts come after Brazilian authorities blocked access to X in the country in a battle over the spread of misinformation and hate speech on the platform aimed at undermining the nation’s democracy.
Since taking over the platform, Musk has touted X’s “community notes” feature as a way of transparently allowing crowd-sourced fact-checking misinformation on his platform.
Related article ‘White Dudes for Harris’ said their account was targeted by X for the second time
Yet neither post was fact-checked through the community notes feature. Musk’s defenders, of which there are many who are vocal on X, have attempted to argue that some posts like these are satirical or are not meant to be taken seriously.
But Musk is taken seriously. He is one of the world’s most powerful people who controls one of the world’s most important online platforms on the precipice of an historic American presidential election where he is actively campaigning for a candidate.
When Musk took over Twitter in 2022 in a $44 billion acquisition, he claimed that the platform would remain impartial to avoid the perception of tilting the scales for a political party.
“For Twitter to deserve public trust, it must be politically neutral, which effectively means upsetting the far right and the far left equally,” he wrote.
But Musk’s posts, and the lack of scrutiny they receive from his company’s own fact-checking system, lay bare how Musk has turned X into a pro-Trump machine."

The pleading came in a Tuesday court filing, which also indicated he wished to be excused from appearing in person at an upcoming court hearing in the case.

“I, President Donald J. Trump, the above-named defendant … do hereby waive my right to be present at Arraignment and I authorize my attorneys to enter a plea of not guilty on my behalf to each and every count of the superseding indictment,” Trump told the court in a one-page filing that included his bold, black signature. “I further state that I have received a copy of the superseding indictment and reviewed it with my counsel.”
Thursday will mark the first court hearing before Judge Tanya Chutkan since the case was paused for the US Supreme Court to determine the extent of presidential immunity to which Trump is entitled.
Chutkan said later Tuesday that Trump does not have to appear at the hearing Thursday – when the former president’s formal arraignment will occur.
Trump’s attorneys plan to attend the hearing.
Chutkan, of the DC District Court, will have to decide how to proceed with the criminal case over efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, including setting a schedule. She must also decide whether prosecutors can take Trump to trial and be able to call certain witnesses, such as former Vice President Mike Pence.
The new indictment, approved by a grand jury last week, requires Trump to enter a new pleading. While prosecutors cut back some of the allegations against the former president in light of the Supreme Court ruling, Trump faces the same four criminal charges as before.

Adetshina, age 23, triumphed at the pageant held in Lagos on Saturday night. She will represent Nigeria in the Miss Universe competition in Mexico in November.
Last month, she quit the Miss South Africa contest after becoming the target of xenophobic online attacks and later accepted an invitation to compete in the Nigerian pageant.
Many South Africans had questioned her eligibility to participate in their country’s contest after reports emerged that she was born to a Nigerian father and a South African mother with Mozambican roots.
Organizers of Miss Universe Nigeria said at the time that Adetshina’s invitation was “an opportunity to represent her father’s native land on an international stage.” They added that her “journey in pageantry is far from over.”

Writing on Instagram after her victory, Adetshina said it was “a dream come true,” describing the crown as “not just a symbol of beauty” but “a call to action” for a united Africa.
“As I accept this honor, I want to share a vision that burns deeply within me, a vision of African unity and peaceful coexistence!” she wrote in a statement on her Instagram page.
“Let’s break down the barriers that divide us. Let’s foster a continent where every African can move freely without prejudice, pursue their dreams, and contribute to the growth and prosperity of our great continent,” the statement added.
South African authorities say they are working to clarify Adetshina’s citizenship status after the country’s Home Affairs department, which oversees immigration, said her mother may have committed identity fraud to obtain South African citizenship in 2001.
The department, however, exonerated Adetshina of any wrongdoing, saying she was just an infant at the time."
YXMS6Y8XSJ_NZVQXHIJXUO4K2Q,Australia’s Great Barrier Reef tries to make sustainability cool,"By Lilit Marcus, CNN","3 minute read Published 2:59 AM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/travel/australia-great-barrier-reef-ecotourism-discounts-intl-hnk/,"Editor’s Note: Call to Earth is a CNN editorial series committed to reporting on the environmental challenges facing our planet, together with the solutions. Rolex’s Perpetual Planet Initiative has partnered with CNN to drive awareness and education around key sustainability issues and to inspire positive action.
It’s a common quandary: a traveler planning a vacation wants to be responsible, stay at a locally-owned hotel instead of a big chain and hire local guides who can take them off the typical tourist trail. But how?
Mark Olsen, CEO of Tourism Tropical North Queensland, has a name for these kinds of travelers: “conservation-curious.” He describes them as “people who are interested in conservation but don’t know how their holiday and conservation can come together.”
Enter Guardian of the Reef, a website where people planning visits to the Great Barrier Reef can watch informative videos to unlock 10-20% discounts off of hotels or book custom experiences that aren’t available elsewhere. The platform, created with online booking company Expedia, is aimed at travelers who want to spend their money in productive ways but don’t want to spend weeks online researching every single hotel and tour operator.
According to data from Expedia, 90% of its users say they are interested in sustainable options when traveling.
Some of the bookable Guardian of the Reef experiences are traditional tourist activities like snorkeling trips and whale-watching cruises led by certified, licensed eco-guides. Others are specifically about conservation: visitors can help restore seagrass, an important habitat for sea turtles, or place “baby” corals on reefs where they can grow.
Still, there are limits on what the site can provide.
“It doesn’t book your flights,” says Olsen, who adds that travelers should also purchase carbon offsets.

Australia has long struggled to find a happy medium between supporting tourists who want to visit and spend money at the UNESCO World Heritage site and also caring for the reef, which has suffered mass coral bleaching events amid global climate change.
According to Statistics Australia, tourism brought in $57 billion AUD ($38 billion USD) in the 2022-2023 fiscal year, about 2.5% of the country’s total economy.
Many of the travelers who come to Australia head to the Great Barrier Reef, which at 133,000 square miles is about the size of California. It alone is responsible for about $6 billion AUD of the country’s total tourism revenue. An estimated 64,000 people have jobs that depend on reef tourism.
Guardian of the Reef addresses some of those environmental issues head on, acknowledging that climate change is the single biggest challenge to the Reef. However, Olsen believes that tourism is a pro, not a con.
“There’s so many things that consumers can do actively on the Great Barrier Reef, but we say the single most important thing you can do is see it. We know you’re going to fall in love with it, and you’re going to be a part of its conservation for the future,” says Olsen.
More and more destinations are asking – or, in some cases, requiring – travelers to follow certain environmental regulations during their visit.
One the most famous examples is the “Palau Pledge,” where the South Pacific nation asked all visitors to promise to the children of Palau, in writing, to “preserve and protect your beautiful island home.” The pledge is mandatory for visitors and those who break the rules can be fined. The pledge was launched in 2017."
YYAURUGE82_KWK0CWR1M6WFGMO,Federal judge denies Trump’s request to move hush money case to federal court,"By Kara Scannell, CNN","3 minute read Updated 6:18 PM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/03/politics/trump-hush-money-request-federal-court/,"A federal judge Tuesday denied Donald Trump’s request to move the New York hush money case to federal court, finding there is nothing in the Supreme Court’s presidential immunity ruling that alters his view of the fact that the payments were “private, unofficial acts.”
Last week, the former president’s attorneys sought to move the state case to federal court, an effort they previously lost, citing the Supreme Court’s decision this summer that granted immunity for some of Trump’s conduct that fell within his official powers. They also urged the judge to postpone Trump’s sentencing, currently set for September 18.
Judge Alvin Hellerstein rejected the long shot bid, saying no facts have changed since he rejected Trump’s attempt to move the case last year. At the time, the judge found that Trump’s reimbursement to Michael Cohen, who facilitated hush money payments to adult film actress Stormy Daniels, were not official acts he took as president.
“Nothing in the Supreme Court’s opinion affects my previous conclusion that the hush money payments were private, unofficial acts, outside the bounds of executive authority,” Hellerstein wrote in his decision Tuesday.
“Private schemes with private actors, unconnected to any statutory or constitutional authority or function of the executive, are considered unofficial acts,” he wrote.
Trump also claimed the case should be moved to federal court because he alleged Judge Juan Merchan, who presided over the trial, is biased against him.
Hellerstein said it was not his place to evaluate the New York trial.
“District Courts may not reverse or modify state judgments, even those containing constitutional infirmities because ‘to do so would be an exercise of appellate jurisdiction,’” Hellerstein wrote. He said the proper vehicle would be for Trump to appeal the conviction through the state courts. Trump has said he will appeal the decision, which in New York occurs after sentencing.
“It would be highly improper for this Court to evaluate the issues of bias, unfairness or error in the state trial,” Hellerstein wrote. The judge said for the same reasons, it would be improper for him to postpone Trump’s sentencing later this month.
Trump has separately asked Merchan to delay the sentencing until after the election. Prosecutors haven’t opposed that request, and the judge could issue a decision as soon as this week.
Trump has also argued in a motion to Merchan that his conviction should be overturned in light of the Supreme Court decision, which in part found that evidence of official acts can’t be used at trial. His attorneys said the jury should not have been allowed to hear the testimony of former White House aide Hope Hicks or see social media posts Trump made while in office.
Merchan said he will rule on that motion on September 16.
Trump could face as much as four years in prison when he is sentenced. He was convicted earlier this year of 34 counts of falsifying business records.

Z4WZDVH25U_ZRZ678ZNW3PA2PO,Ceasefire talks thrown into tumult after the discovery of six hostages slain in Gaza,"By Alex Marquardt and Lauren Izso, CNN","5 minute read Published 8:14 PM EDT, Sun September 1, 2024",20240902,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/01/politics/israel-hamas-ceasefire-talks-tumult-hostages/,"The Saturday discovery of the deaths of six hostages has thrown negotiations for a ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas into tumult, with the White House national security adviser saying that “the next few days will be critical” in the push to free those still held by Hamas.
National security adviser Jake Sullivan, in a virtual meeting Sunday, told the families of Americans held hostage that the administration will “work around the clock for a deal to secure the release of the remaining hostages,” according to a readout of the discussion released by the families.
American officials said the deaths of the hostages, who were seized by militants during Hamas’ October 7 attacks, would not cause the talks to be derailed. Instead, they described new urgency in coming to an agreement that would end the Israel-Hamas war and bring those remaining in captivity home.
Both the Israeli and American governments have scrambled to react after the Israeli military announced it had recovered the bodies of six slain hostages in Gaza. As protests against the Israeli government sweep across the country, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a statement accusing Hamas of killing the six individuals and saying the group is not serious about a ceasefire deal.
How the discussions will be affected will become apparent in the next day or two, a source with knowledge of the talks told CNN on Sunday.
The “situation is complicated,” the source said. Two weeks of in-person joint negotiations with the various parties in both Egypt and Qatar have ended, but the source said discussions continue through other channels.

In the meeting with hostage families, Sullivan discussed the “ongoing diplomatic push across the highest levels of the US government to drive toward a deal,” according to the White House.
Still, American officials acknowledged the deaths of the six hostages added a layer of complexity to an already difficult and painstaking process.
Hamas’ “seriousness” about a ceasefire deal must now be called into question, said a senior US official, who added that pressure is now also growing on Netanyahu.
US officials have voiced frustrated previously at what they regard as resistance on the part of Netanyahu in reaching a deal, leading to occasionally tense conversations between President Joe Biden and his Israeli counterpart.
Still, in their statements late Saturday, neither Biden nor Vice President Kamala Harris applied pressure — either explicit or implied — on Netanyahu to reach a deal. American officials were acutely aware that pressure would come from inside Israel itself.
Biden and Harris will meet in the Situation Room on Monday with the US team negotiating a deal, according to the White House.
At least three of the hostages killed — including Israeli-American Hersh Goldberg-Polin — had been expected to be released as part of the first part of a ceasefire agreement, Israeli officials and the senior US official told CNN. That means negotiators will now have to renegotiate the list of hostages who will be released in the first phase of the deal.
“US officials had been working on a final package together with Qatar and Egypt. The package included Hersh and a number of the hostages who were just executed. This calls into question Hamas’ seriousness about a deal, even as pressure also builds on Israel and Netanyahu personally,” the senior US official said Sunday.
After the bodies were discovered, Biden still expressed hopes for a ceasefire agreement, saying that negotiators were on the “verge of having an agreement” and that “it’s time this war ended.”
“We think we can close the deal, they’ve all said they agree on the principles,” he added.
But, in the aftermath of the discovery of the hostages, a potential path forward for the long-sought-after ceasefire agreement remains up in the air.
There was no breakthrough during recent in-person talks, the source familiar with the discussions said, but new ideas are going to be presented to Israel and Hamas.

The recent talks included senior-level meetings, as well as lower-level technical negotiations, in both Doha, Qatar, and Cairo, and CIA Director Bill Burns attended the discussions. The leaders of the mediating countries — the US, Qatar and Egypt — issued a joint statement on August 16, saying those talks were intended to “conclude” the following week.
Netanyahu, who faces increasing pressure from the Israeli public, met with the families of the hostages Sunday. He also released a tape message accusing Hamas of the “cold-blooded murder” of the six hostages and saying that “those who murder hostages do not want a deal.”
He added that the Israeli government and that he, personally, are “committed to continue working towards a deal that will bring back all our hostages and guarantee our security and existence.”
The prime minister said Israel would continue to pursue Hamas and accused it of not wanting to conduct genuine negotiations since December.
“Three months ago, on May 27, Israel agreed to a hostage release deal with the full backing of the United States. Hamas refused. Even after the United States updated the outline of the deal on August 16 — we agreed, and Hamas again refused.”
Anger is rising across Israel at Netanyahu specifically, and he is “worried” about the widespread protests sweeping the country, an Israeli official told CNN.
In what organizers later described as an “endless sea of protesters,” an outpouring of anger and grief swelled into mass demonstrations in Tel Aviv and beyond Sunday. While the protesters hold Hamas responsible for the death of hostages taken in the October 7 attacks, they also blame Netanyahu for his handling of the crisis, saying he has not done enough to secure a hostage-ceasefire deal.
The Hostages and Missing Families Forum has called for Israel to be brought to a “halt” over the news of the slain hostages and urged the country to pressure the government to sign a deal to free the remaining hostages before they are killed as well. The country’s largest labor union, meanwhile, has called for a nationwide strike, saying the “entire Israeli economy will shut down” Monday.

Z6D6J34HHX_9VHWVRQJ6MP9TRU,These are the ‘gifts’ prosecutors say a former aide to New York’s governor received from the Chinese government,"By Emma Tucker, CNN","3 minute read Updated 5:43 AM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/03/us/new-york-linda-sun-china-gifts/,"US prosecutors say the Chinese government gave Linda Sun lavish, expensive gifts in return for violating internal rules and state government protocols while she served as an aide to two New York governors in a scheme that enriched her family by millions of dollars.
The former deputy chief of staff to New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and former aide to Gov. Andrew Cuomo acted as an undisclosed agent of the People’s Republic of China and the Chinese Communist Party, federal prosecutors say.

Sun was charged on Tuesday with violating and conspiring to violate the Foreign Agents Registrations Act, visa fraud, alien smuggling and money laundering conspiracy, according to an unsealed copy of the indictment. Her husband and co-defendant, Chris Hu, was also charged with money laundering conspiracy and conspiracy to commit bank fraud as well as misusing means of identification, prosecutors said.
The couple allegedly received “substantial economic and other benefits” from the Chinese government – including facilitating millions of dollars in business transactions – none of which were disclosed to New York state, according to the indictment. They were arrested at their Long Island residence Tuesday morning. Sun and Hu both pleaded not guilty to all charges in federal court Tuesday afternoon.
Here’s a rundown of the gifts prosecutors say the couple received from Chinese government officials and the leaders of US-based Chinese organizations:
• Sun and her family received at least four deliveries of “Nanjing-style salted ducks prepared by a PRC official’s personal chef” between 2021 and 2022. They were also invited to dinner at a PRC official’s house in 2023.
• An unnamed US permanent resident with business interests in China and who worked with “numerous US-based Chinese organizations” paid for Sun’s accommodation and travel to the PRC in 2019, along with event tickets in Beijing celebrating the 70th anniversary of the PRC’s founding.
• The millions of dollars in travel benefits Sun and her family received also included a presidential suite previously used by First Lady Michelle Obama in Beijing, where Sun stayed in 2018.
• After Sun was asked in 2017 by the president of an unnamed New York-based association of people from Henan province to speak at an event taking place in Zhengzhou, Henan, the association made travel arrangements, including hotel accommodations, for Hu, Sun and her parents, Hu’s PRC-based business partner and several representatives of carrier business whose services Sun frequently used. The Chinese government also partially funded the trip, the indictment says.
• The New York-based association also “agreed to make efforts to personally intervene as to PRC customs issues” to help her husband, a seafood exporter based in Queens, export “live lobsters” to Henan Province.
• While Sun traveled with a work colleague on official New York state business to Jiangsu Province, she received “undisclosed and unapproved” benefits from provincial officials, including a 10-year employment contract for Sun’s cousin in the PRC.
• A bank account held by Sun and Hu received a wire transfer in the amount of $47,895 from a PRC-based bank account in 2016, labeled “Payment for Traveling.”
• Tickets to various concerts and events, including the Chinese National Traditional Orchestra concert at Carnegie Hall in New York City in December 2015.

Z6NWZ2H8T2_LR2W09Z7ZSB19JG,Maduro decrees Christmas will start in October as Venezuela cracks down on dissent,"By Stefano Pozzebon, CNN","3 minute read Updated 1:17 AM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/03/americas/christmas-venezuela-october-maduro-intl-latam/,"Christmas will start next month in Venezuela, authoritarian leader Nicolas Maduro has decreed – even as thousands of Venezuelans look set to pass the holidays behind bars amid his government’s crackdown on political unrest.
“September smells like Christmas!” Maduro said in his weekly television show on Monday, to the apparent delight of his audience.
“This year and to honor you all, to thank you all, I am going to decree the beginning of Christmas on October 1. Christmas arrived for everyone, in peace, joy and security!” he said.
Maduro’s decree – not the first of its kind, but the earliest – comes as Venezuela grapples with the fallout from July’s presidential election, which saw Maduro claim a third term despite global skepticism and outcry from the country’s opposition movement.
Just a few hours before Maduro’s announcement, Venezuelan authorities published an arrest warrant for his main rival, opposition leader Edmundo Gonzalez, accusing him of “crimes associated with terrorism.” Gonzalez has failed to respond to three summons regarding an investigation into an opposition website that posted results from the contested vote, the Venezuela Prosecutor’s Office said.
Maduro has been under pressure at home and abroad since claiming victory. The opposition coalition backing Gonzalez insists the presidential vote was stolen, publishing online vote tally sheets, which experts say indicate Maduro actually lost the presidency by a significant margin.
The US and other neighboring governments have demanded that Venezuelan authorities reveal granular voting data to verify the outcome. US authorities this week also announced that a Venezuelan plane used by Maduro for international travel was seized in the Dominican Republic.
A second plane linked to Maduro is under 24-hour surveillance by authorities in the Dominican Republic, a source with knowledge of the matter told CNN.
Protests over the vote in the streets of Venezuela have been fiercely repressed. Some 2,400 people have been arrested, and many others are now fleeing the country. Some are hiding in their homes, telling CNN they are afraid to step foot outside due to intimidation by government supporters.
The crackdown is the deadliest in years, according to a new analysis by Human Rights Watch, which says it has documented 11 killings that it says took place in the context of mass political protests over the July 28 vote.
“On average, [this year] is much more intense in terms of the amount of people that have died in the context of post-electoral violence and protest,” HRW Director for the Americas Juanita Goebertus told CNN.
Non-governmental organizations have reported 24 people killed.

“In terms of detention, more than 2400 [people arrested], that is way above the data we saw in 2014 and 2017,” Goebertus added, referring to previous cycles of protests in Venezuela that were also repressed in violence.
Maduro, despite his jollity on Monday, has been at the forefront of the crackdown, ordering the opening of two new prisons to accommodate detained protesters and openly calling for everyone in the streets to be imprisoned.
He has also endorsed what is informally referred to as “Operation Knock-Knock” – a play on the name of a popular Venezuelan Christmas song, repurposed to evoke the sound of government security services knocking on critics’ doors.
“Knock Knock! Don’t be a crybaby … You’re going to Tocorón (a jail)” Maduro shouted at a rally last month.
This is not the first time Maduro has extended the official national period of Christmas celebration, which in Venezuela often comes with extra bonuses for public employees and more lavish gifts in government handouts.
Last year, Maduro ordered Christmas to start on November 1, later expressing regret that he didn’t start it earlier. In 2021, with the country reeling from the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns, Maduro decreed that Christmas would start on October 4 as a tactic to boost the economy.
The Venezuelan Episcopal Conference on Tuesday protested the unilateral acceleration of Christmas, warning that the holiday “is not to be used for political or propaganda goals.”
“Christmas commences on December 25,” it said in a statement."
Z7JPV07BZF_S8NUMF51N3YPPEX,"An artist made scathing sculptures of Mao over a decade ago. Now, he’s detained for slandering China’s heroes, family says","By Nectar Gan, CNN","7 minute read Published 8:34 PM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/03/style/china-detains-artist-gao-brothers-mao-intl-hnk/,"A prominent Chinese artist known for his scathing political critiques of Mao Zedong and the Cultural Revolution has been detained in China, according to his brother and artistic partner.
Gao Zhen, 68, was detained last week in a police raid on his art studio on the outskirts of Beijing on suspicion of slandering China’s “heroes and martyrs,” his younger brother Gao Qiang told CNN Sunday in an email from New York. The criminal offense, introduced in 2021, is punishable by up to three years in prison.
The public security bureau that Gao Qiang said had detained his brother, in Hebei province’s Sanhe city, declined to comment.
At the height of their careers, the Gao Brothers created provocative sculptures of Mao in a country notoriously sensitive about its former ruler’s legacy. But that was well over a decade ago — during a relatively liberal era for artistic expression before China took an authoritarian turn under leader Xi Jinping.
Now, some of those older works have been seized by police as evidence against Gao Zhen, his brother said.
They include “Mao’s Guilt,” a life-size bronze cast created in 2009 that depicts the former Chinese Communist Party leader kneeling, hand on heart, in repentance; “The Execution of Christ,” created that same year, which features a firing squad of life-sized Chairman Maos pointing their bayoneted rifles at Jesus; and a collection of busts named “Miss Mao,” which come in various sizes and colors, sporting a Pinocchio-like nose and large, naked breasts.
The avant-garde artists’ latest works had not been as politically sensitive or explicitly critical of Chinese leaders, their friends say. Gao Zhen had lived a quiet life in China and spent most days in his studio prior to moving to the US, Du Yinghong, a fellow artist who has known the brothers for nearly two decades, told CNN in a phone call.
Due to the “deteriorating environment” in China, Gao Zhen relocated to New York two years ago when his son, an American citizen born in the US, reached school age, Gao Qiang said.
The artist returned to China in June with his wife and son to visit family. “Before he set off, his friends and family — myself included — had all reminded him to consider whether it was safe to go,” Gao Qiang said. “He himself also thought he might encounter problems, but still, as if driven by fate, he went back.”

At first, everything seemed fine. Gao Zhen kept in touch during his trip and regularly posted on the Chinese social messaging app WeChat. In July, he organized a birthday party for his son who had turned 6 years old.
But on August 26, just over a week before the family was scheduled to fly back to the US, about 30 police raided the Gao Brothers’ studio in Yanjiao, a town on the border of Beijing and neighboring Hebei province, to “search for evidence,” Gao Qiang said.
Police demanded the artist hand over his phone. Gao Zhen refused and was forcibly handcuffed and taken away, according to his brother.
Gao Zhen’s wife received his detention notice the following day from the public security bureau in Sanhe, Gao Qiang said, adding that she had been warned by police not to speak to the media about her husband’s detention.
The police returned to the studio on August 27 to search for more evidence, according to Gao Qiang.
“A few days before his arrest, Gao Zhen told me that he was organizing his Yanjiao studio and had destroyed some unfinished sculptures in stock, including those of ‘Miss Mao,’” Gao Qiang said in an email.
“He is nearly 70 years old and naturally prone to melancholy. I am very concerned about his physical and mental health.”
Under Xi, the ruling Communist Party has vowed to eradicate “historical nihilism” — or any views that question or challenge its official version of history, including glorified images of sanctified national heroes.
China passed a law in 2018 banning any insult or slander of national “heroes and martyrs,” including military personnel. The offense was added to the country’s criminal code three years later.
Since then, the law has been used to jail a popular blogger who doubted the official death toll of Chinese soldiers in a border clash with India, and a former investigative journalist who questioned China’s role in the Korean War, as depicted in a patriotic movie.
And last year, a stand-up comedian was investigated by police for the same offense after making a joke that referenced a military slogan at a show in Beijing. It cost him his job and his employer more than $2 million in fines, though police later dropped the case and did not press charges.
Around that time, another Chinese contemporary artist, Yue Minjun, faced the wrath of online nationalists for “uglifying” and “insulting” China’s military with his iconic grinning self-portraits, but the authorities did not act on those accusations.
That makes Gao Zhen the first Chinese artist known to be detained under the law.

His brother and friends wonder why authorities appear to be targeting the Gaos’ works retroactively, as they were created many years before the law came into force.
“The artworks collected as evidence by the police were all created more than a decade ago as part of an artistic reflection on Mao’s Cultural Revolution,” Gao Qiang said. “Imposing retroactive punishment for actions taken before the new law took effect goes against the widely accepted legal principle of non-retroactivity.”
The Gaos hail from a generation of Chinese artists who pushed the boundaries of creative expression by offering an unflinching glimpse into the dark chapters of their country’s past.
The upheaval of the Cultural Revolution, which roiled China in the 1960s and 1970s, inflicted indelible pain on the Gao family.
The brothers were just 6 and 12 years old when their father, a factory worker, was labeled a class enemy and thrown into detention at the height of the decade-long turmoil. Twenty-five days later, the family of six brothers was told that their father committed suicide “out of guilt for being a counter-revolutionary,” but they believed he was persecuted and killed.
“Our father’s death was a devastating disaster for our family.” Gao Zhen told the Southern People Weekly, a once-outspoken news outlet, in 2010. “We constantly worried that our mother would take her own life, but she raised us with an extraordinary resilience that few could compare to.” After the Cultural Revolution ended, Gao Zhen took the train to Beijing to petition his father’s death. The family was eventually given about 3,000 yuan (then equivalent to about $2,000) in compensation, the Gao brothers wrote in an article in 2004.
Friends who know the Gao Brothers say they used art to express their grief, with Mao being a recurring feature of their work in the late 1990s and 2000s.
“It was really an artistic phase; it’s not all their work. But this is why people remember them, because it was a very political, very direct critique,” said a friend who has known the brothers for over two decades.
In recent years, the brothers created works featuring world leaders including Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, as well as pieces showing support for Ukraine, according to the friend, who requested anonymity over safety concerns.
“There’s no logic to arrest (Gao Zhen) now,” she said. “They were not the only ones; many Chinese artists of that generation made very critical art back then… I guess they will be afraid now.”
Even during China’s more liberal years, however, the brothers had several run-ins with authorities over their controversial artworks. Police shut down their exhibitions, confiscated their politically sensitive works, and even intimidated visitors by stationing guards outside their old studio in Beijing’s 798 art district.
“But after we promised that our studio would not be open for public display, we hadn’t run into major problems,” Gao Qiang said.

The duo went on to attract international acclaim. They held exhibitions in Paris, New York, Moscow and Berlin, with some of their works collected by prestigious museums, from the Centre Pompidou in Paris to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.
The two brothers obtained permanent residency in the US in 2011 and traveled frequently between Beijing and New York. Gao Qiang moved to the US a few years before his brother and has not returned to China since.
Two years ago, their Beijing studio was forced to shut down, and Gao Zhen moved his studio to Yanjiao, about 40 kilometers (about 25 miles) away, his brother said.
Gao Zhen’s detention shows that freedom of expression in China has shrunk significantly compared to a decade ago, Gao Qiang said.
“A healthy society should move towards the broadening of thoughts and actions, instead of the other way around,” he added."
Z7P21E5KIU_1I46UTU7K6STUHN,Start of early voting in North Carolina could be delayed after ruling in RFK Jr. ballot challenge,"By Ethan Cohen, CNN","2 minute read Updated 6:13 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/05/politics/early-voting-north-carolina-kennedy/,"The first ballots in the nation are scheduled to start going out Friday in North Carolina, but that could be delayed after a judge ordered a temporary pause on ballot distribution.
The ruling came in response to a request from former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to remove his name from the ballot.
North Carolina’s Democratic-controlled State Board of Elections voted along party lines last week to reject Kennedy’s request, saying that it wouldn’t be practical to reprint ballots and delay the start of voting.
Kennedy, who dropped out of the race last month and endorsed former President Donald Trump, then challenged that decision in court.
Wake County Superior Court Judge Rebecca Holt denied the former candidate’s request Thursday but also ordered a pause to allow Kennedy to appeal.
In her written order, the judge ordered the state not to proceed with mailing absentee ballots before noon Friday.
Holt found that rejecting Kennedy’s request would lead to “minimal” harm to him but that removing his name would be a significant burden for elections officials.
“The court can find no practical, personal or pecuniary harm to the plaintiff should his name remain on the ballot,” Holt said from the bench “The defendant, however, would have to reprint the ballots at considerable cost and effort and will likely find themselves in violation of the state mandated deadline for distributing absentee ballots.”
After the hearing, Paul Cox, the general counsel for the state elections board, instructed counties to not send ballots out Friday morning.
However, Cox said ballots would need to be go out Friday afternoon, unless an appeals court ordered a further delay.
As CNN previously reported, since endorsing Trump, Kennedy has sought to withdraw his name from the ballot in competitive states in order to boost the former president’s chances of winning there. But he has encountered obstacles to those attempts beyond North Carolina.
On Tuesday, a Michigan judge ruled that he must remain on the ballot in the battleground state after Kennedy filed a lawsuit asking the court to remove him. The elections commission in Wisconsin – another Midwestern battleground also ruled last week that Kennedy will appear on the ballot despite a similar request to withdraw.

ZAKRIVUNEC_12KOJKV5TYH3ZMZ,New Maori Queen anointed following the death of her father,Story by Reuters,"3 minute read Published 5:49 AM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",20240905,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/05/world/new-maori-queen-anointed-intl-scli/,"A new Maori Queen was anointed Thursday, taking on the role at a time when New Zealand is facing some of the biggest challenges to race relations in two decades.
A statement released by representatives said Nga Wai Hono i te Po had been chosen by Maori elders to replace her father, King Tuheitia Pootatau Te Wherowhero VII, who died aged 69 last week following surgery.
“The new monarch was raised up in a ceremony known as Te Whakawahinga, in front of thousands of people gathered for the tangihanga (funeral and burial) of Kiingi Tuheitia,” a spokesperson for the Kiingitanga or royal family said.
The new queen is not crowned and instead a bible that has been used since 1858 was placed upon her head and Archbishop Don Tamihere used sacred oils to bestow prestige, sacredness, power and spiritual essence upon her.
Thousands gathered at Tuurangawaewae, the meeting place of the King movement, to farewell him in a traditional funeral.
Following the anointment of his daughter, the King’s coffin was taken to the Waikato River by hearse before being paddled in a flotilla of traditional Maori waka or canoe to Taupiri Mountain, where he was to be buried alongside other royals and high-profile Maori.
The Maori King or Queen is considered the paramount chief of several tribes, or iwi, but is not affiliated with all of them. The monarch’s role has no judicial or legal authority in New Zealand and is largely ceremonial.
The role is not necessarily hereditary but voted on by representatives from iwi across the country. The new queen, or Kuini, is the only daughter and youngest child of the former King and his wife Te Atawhai Makau Ariki and is aged 27.
Radio New Zealand says that the new monarch, who has two older brothers, was favored to ascend the throne, although it had not been a foregone conclusion.

The new queen holds a Master of Arts in Tikanga (societal lore of) Maori and has served on a number of boards include that of the Te Kohanga Reo National Trust, an organization charged with revitalizing Maori language, according to 1News.
New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said the government welcomed the new queen’s appointment as she carries forward the mantle of leadership left by her father.
Her anointment comes at a time when New Zealand is struggling with race relations.
New Zealand’s center-right coalition which took office last year has started undoing policies of previous governments, particularly those promoting the official use of the Maori language, the enhancement of Indigenous living standards and rights and efforts to repair some of the wrongs undertaken during colonization.
King Tuheitia held a gathering of tribes from across the country in January to discuss how to respond to government plans. As King Tuheitia told the thousands who attended that their voices matter, his daughter, the new queen stood beside him."
ZJ3L7ALXLU_OEUZJV88F3CA2Q2,Noncompete agreements aren’t going anywhere. What to know if you sign one,"By Jeanne Sahadi, CNN","5 minute read Published 6:00 AM EDT, Mon September 2, 2024",20240803,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/02/business/noncompete-agreements-what-to-know-now/,"A Texas judge late last month struck down a nationwide ban on noncompete agreements that was supposed to take effect this Wednesday.
Existing noncompete agreements will therefore now remain in place. And employers may still ask you to sign one as a condition of employment. That is, unless and until a higher court decides otherwise, or Congress passes a law prohibiting it. But, if that does happen, it could take years.
In the meantime, if you’re working under a noncompete agreement — or are considering signing one — here’s what you need to know and do, because in some cases the agreement may not be enforceable.
Generally speaking, noncompetes prohibit you from working for your employer’s competitors within a given geographic distance for a given period of time. For example, you may be prohibited from working for a competitor within 50 miles of your current job for a year after leaving.

So, understand exactly how you will be constrained when you leave your current job — whether you quit, get laid off or are fired for cause — and what, if anything, you are getting in exchange for signing away your right to work where you wish.
Also understand how the location of competitors is defined, because the agreement might preclude you from working at a company within a given distance not just from your own work site, but also that of your company’s satellite locations.
“Read your agreement. You’d be surprised how many people don’t,” said Michael Fiffik, managing partner of Pennsylvania-based Fiffik Law Group PC. His law firm also provides services through LegalShield, which connects people with lawyers in their state to advise them on their noncompete agreements and other matters at little to no charge when they sign up for a monthly plan that costs just under $30 and can be canceled at any time.
Also, when considering whether to sign a noncompete, “think about it in the context of your career path,” Fiffik suggested. By that he means if it’s typical in your line of work to move up by moving on every few years, signing a noncompete might be problematic.
And, in general, everyone should review the paperwork they signed when they took their job, because they may not even be aware they signed one, said Donna Ballman, an employee-side employment law attorney in Florida and author of “Stand Up For Yourself Without Getting Fired.”
“Some (noncompete provisions) are disguised as a ‘confidentiality agreement’ or ‘bonus agreement,’ or even (may appear) in job applications. Most people sign that giant stack of paperwork they get at the beginning of their employment without reading it carefully,” Ballman wrote in an email to CNN.
The state where you’re working may impose restrictions or outright bans, which may render your noncompete invalid. Start by checking online with your state’s labor department and the state’s attorney general. This interactive map, from the Economic Innovation Group, also provides a quick rundown of current state restrictions and bans.
For instance, in California, two new laws went into effect reiterating and making plain what has been true since the 1800s: Noncompetes are, with few exceptions, unlawful and unenforceable, according to Robert Ottinger, founder of Ottinger Employment Lawyers.
That includes anyone in California who is employed by a company headquartered elsewhere or whose job is relocated to California. “The minute you set foot in California, [the noncompete agreement] evaporates,” Ottinger said, even if it says it is subject to the laws of another state.
In New York, many agreements are unenforceable because they don’t meet the multipart test the state requires of such agreements to be valid, including not imposing undue hardship on an employee. In Ottinger’s experience, “there’s a 90% or higher chance of it being invalid. … If you take it before a judge, the judge will not enforce it,” he said. That is especially the case for low- and mid-level workers, he added. “We’ve had dog walkers and sandwich makers subject to them. We win almost every time.”
By contrast, many other states impose far fewer restrictions. And some, like Kansas and South Carolina, impose none at all, according to the Economic Innovation Group.
Even where workers are least protected by state law, you still may have recourse if you feel your noncompete agreement is egregious.
“Federal and state antitrust law still applies, so it’s still illegal to have a noncompete agreement for the purpose of preventing competition. Employers must have a legitimate interest to protect, such as protecting confidential information or trade secrets, customer goodwill, extraordinary or specialized training the employer provided, or special relationships with customers developed as a result of the employment,” Ballman said.
And the Federal Trade Commission, which created the now struck-down rule banning noncompetes, notes that it is not prevented from “addressing noncompetes through case-by-case enforcement actions.”
Ballman said that there are some defenses against a noncompete that most states will recognize. “These include where the employer breaches the agreement first, where there is no legitimate interest to protect other than preventing competition, where the length of time or the scope is overbroad, or where public health or safety would not be served.”
And there may be other ways to prove your noncompete is illegitimate, especially when the employer indicates that it is intended to protect confidential information. For instance, Ballman said, “many employers don’t actually take measures to protect that so-called confidential information. If it’s on the website, if they allow some employees to compete but not others, if they brag about customers on social media, then there’s a great argument that the information isn’t confidential after all.”
All that said, “there’s no magic wand to get out of these,” she added. So, knowing what you’re getting into before signing anything and consulting with a knowledgeable employee-side employment attorney in your state may save you a lot of time and stress when you do eventually move on to a new job."
ZLKGWAF4ZE_F5HRVXV54UOJZHT,A former New York official is accused of acting on behalf of the Chinese government. Here’s a timeline of her alleged actions,"By Elizabeth Wolfe, CNN","8 minute read Updated 11:06 AM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",20240904,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/04/us/timeline-linda-sun-kathy-hochul-aide/,"Allegations of money laundering, falsified signatures and surreptitious communications fill the federal indictment brought against Linda Sun, a longtime New York governors’ aide who was charged Tuesday with acting as an agent for the Chinese government.
Sun, a former deputy chief of staff to New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and aide to former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, faces 10 counts, including violating the Foreign Agents Registrations Act, visa fraud, alien smuggling and money laundering conspiracy, according to an unsealed copy of the indictment.
Federal prosecutors allege Sun has been operating for years as an undisclosed agent of the People’s Republic of China, using her high-ranking positions in New York government to fulfill the PRC’s requests and further the interests of the Chinese Communist Party.
In the indictment, prosecutors lay out Sun’s alleged efforts to allow the PRC access to private government communications, influence the governors’ public remarks on China and block the Taiwanese government from communicating with Cuomo and Hochul.
As Sun served in high-ranking positions in New York, her husband, Chris Hu, is accused of orchestrating the transfer of millions of dollars in “kickbacks” from the PRC, which the couple used to purchase expensive properties and luxury cars, prosecutors said. Hu was also charged with money laundering conspiracy and conspiracy to commit bank fraud as well as misusing means of identification.
During a federal court hearing Tuesday, prosecutors alleged the defendants used shell companies, iCloud accounts and WeChat messages – with everything in Mandarin – in their alleged crimes.
These are the ‘gifts’ prosecutors say ex-aide to two New York governors got from the Chinese government
Sun and Hu both pleaded not guilty to all charges Tuesday afternoon. Sun’s bond is set at $1.5 million and her husband’s is set at $500,000. Both will have their travel limited to New York City, Long Island, Maine and New Hampshire.
An attorney for Sun, Jarrod Schaeffer, told CNN the charges “are inflammatory and appear to be the product of an overly aggressive prosecution.”
“We are also troubled by aspects of the government’s investigation. As we said today in court, our client is eager … to defend against these accusations in the proper forum – a court of law,” Schaeffer said.
Here is a timeline of some of the key allegations against Sun as she moved through the New York State government:
August 2012: Sun is hired by then-Gov. Cuomo’s administration as director of Asian American affairs and Queens representative. She left the office in 2015 to be the director of external affairs for Empire State Development, which handles economic development across the state.
June 9, 2016: Sun messaged a PRC official to inform them the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office, which effectively serves as the island’s embassy in the US, had invited then-Lieutenant Gov. Hochul to appear at SelectUSA, an investment summit in Washington, DC, to be held later that month, according to the indictment.
“They sent the invitation to another colleague trying to bypass me. I am working on it right now to resolve the issue,” Sun wrote to the PRC official, according to the indictment. Later, Sun followed up to say, “It’s all been taken care of satisfactorily.”
Prosecutors note that on June 21, 2016, Hochul attended a SelectUSA reception hosted by the PRC Embassy and the China General Chamber of Commerce – USA, instead of an event held by Taiwan.
February 2018: Sun became Cuomo’s deputy chief diversity officer.
March 2018: Prosecutors accuse Sun of committing visa fraud by supplying unauthorized invitation letters on behalf of the governor’s office to a delegation of PRC representatives, which helped the delegation obtain visas to enter the US, according to the indictment.
The letters, which Sun was not authorized to issue or sign, bore falsified handwritten versions of Hochul’s signature, the indictment alleges.
The PRC delegation from the Henan Province arrived in the US in June 2018, where they met with Hochul to discuss economic cooperation between their province and New York, the document said.
January 2019: Sun wrote to a PRC official, “I very much value my relationship with the consulate and have done many things to make the relationship between the state and the consulate flourish during my tenure with (Politician-1),” according to the indictment. Though Politician 1 is unnamed, Sun was serving under Cuomo at the time.
“Certainly I have managed to stop all relationships between the TECO and the state. I have denied all (r)equests from their office,” Sun said, according to the indictment.
The PRC official responded, “I know and do appreciate your help” and referred to Sun as “the most important hub connecting us with (Politician-1) and his team,” the document said.

March 16, 2020: Sun gave an unnamed Chinese official access to a private conference call held by New York State government leaders discussing their response to the Covid-19 pandemic and rising hate crimes against Asian Americans, the indictment alleges.
Sun, who was then acting as deputy chief diversity officer under Cuomo, “surreptitiously added” the PRC official to the call, though the official was not on the invitation list, the indictment alleges.
“At the close of the call, PRC Official-4 commented that the call was ‘(v)ery useful,’” it adds.
Prosecutors listed the call as evidence Sun allegedly violated the Foreign Agents Registration Act.
July 2020: Sun moved to the New York State Department of Financial Services, where she worked as Superintendent for Intergovernmental Affairs and Chief Diversity Officer.
Sometime in 2021: In 2021, Sun and Hu purchased millions of dollars in real estate, which prosecutors said was possible due to hefty financial rewards from their alleged efforts to aid the PRC, according to the indictment.
Sometime that year, the couple purchased a $3.6 million parcel of real estate in Manhasset, New York, and a $1.9 million ocean-view condominium in Honolulu, Hawaii, the indictment said. The couple didn’t take out any mortgage loans to make the purchases, the document notes.
Prosecutors noted the couple’s spending far outpaced the income noted on their federal tax returns that year. But shortly before making the purchases, Hu received more than $2.1 million in wire transfers from a PRC-based account under the name of his business partner, the indictment alleges.
“Sun did not report the real estate acquisitions on her financial disclosure statements, as she was obligated to do,” the indictment reads.
January 2021: Sun worked to remove mention of China’s mass detention of Muslim Uyghurs from Hochul’s public remarks, according to the indictment.
On January 12, after receiving a request from a PRC official, Sun said she would ask Hochul to record a video in honor of Lunar New Year, the document said. She asked the officials, “Can you share with me some talking points of things you want her to mention(?) I can make sure to include it in her remarks.”
A few days later, Sun told the PRC official she had argued with Hochul’s speechwriter, who had insisted the then-lieutenant governor should mention “the ‘Uyghur situation,’” the indictment said. Sun said she would not allow Hochul to mention the Uyghurs, it added.
Ultimately, Hochul did not mention the Uyghurs in her public Lunar New Year message, the indictment said.
That same month, the US officially determined China was committing genocide and crimes against humanity against Uyghur Muslims and ethnic and religious minority groups in the northwestern region of Xinjiang. China strongly denied allegations of human rights abuses.
August 24, 2021: Hochul became governor of New York after Cuomo resigned amid a parade of scandals. The following month, Sun became Deputy Chief of Staff in the governor’s office and served as Hochul’s advisor.
September 2022: Sun transferred to the New York State Department of Labor as its Deputy Commissioner for Strategic Business Development.
January 2023: After receiving a request from PRC government representatives, Sun obtained an unauthorized proclamation from the New York Governor’s Office to be presented at an event celebrating the Lunar New Year, prosecutors said.
“Sun obtained this proclamation from an Office of Correspondence employee outside ordinary channels and did not follow protocol by seeking supervisory authorization to create such a proclamation,” the indictment reads.
The Office of Correspondence employee mailed the proclamation to Sun’s personal address, and Sun sent a gift basket to the home of a relative of the employee, the indictment said.
When questioned by the NYS Office of the Inspector General, Sun initially denied requesting any proclamations since moving to the Department of Labor, but later admitted to requesting the Lunar New Year proclamation for a PRC official, the document said.
March 2, 2023: Sun is terminated from her position with the Department of Labor. However, Sun reportedly continued to attend events held by Asian community members claiming to represent the Department of Labor, the indictment said.
August 10, 2023: Sun received a cease-and-desist letter from the Department of Labor, which said she “allegedly attended public and professional events purporting to represent [her]self as an agency official” after she was terminated, the indictment said.
July 2024: Federal investigators raided a home belonging to Sun and Hu.
Hochul called Sun’s alleged behavior “a betrayal of trust” that left the governor furious, outraged and “absolutely shocked,” she said during an appearance with WNYC radio.
Hochul said her office fired Sun in 2023 “the second we discovered some levels of misconduct” and “alerted the authorities – and hence we ended up with what happened here today.”
The depth of the allegations against Sun was apparent to the governor and her staff only after reading details of the indictment, said Hochul, who emphasized to WNYC that Sun worked less than two years for her administration and was initially hired by the previous one.
Rich Azzopardi, a spokesperson for Cuomo, said in a statement that national security “must be free from foreign influence.”
“While Ms. Sun was promoted to deputy chief of staff in the subsequent administration, during our time she worked in a handful of agencies and was one of many community liaisons who had little to no interaction with the governor,” the statement said.

ZRHC6CHI3T_INZ73WW6Y6XBDVO,"From ‘Mission: Impossible’ to ‘Slow Horses,’ here’s why we love watching spies","By Leah Asmelash, CNN","6 minute read Published 6:00 AM EDT, Mon September 2, 2024",20240902,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/02/entertainment/bond-slow-horses-spy-movies-cec/,"Is it the nonstop action, or the meshing of mystery and intrigue? Is it the Aston Martin car chases, always along some scenic route? The exotic locales? The beautiful love interests — culminating in a steamy rendezvous? Or, is it just the British accents?
Whatever it is, there’s something about spy flicks we can’t get enough of. Since the genre’s emergence, espionage has taken over both big and small screens, from long-standing franchises like James Bond, to newer efforts like the “Kingsman” series or the subversive “The 355.”
On TV, the success of shows like “Homeland,” “The Americans,” and the newer “Slow Horses” — which begins its fourth season Wednesday on Apple TV+ — highlight our collective fascination with spy narratives.
Even in a time where the genre movie has all but faded in favor of endless remakes and sequels, where television shows are often canceled shortly after they air, spy stories still grip our imaginations and studios’ pockets.
But the genre is more than just splashy gimmicks helmed by a suave protagonist. The ubiquity of these stories reveals something deeper, not just about our world, but about ourselves.
As a genre, espionage was first born from literature, where spy novels and spy fiction grew in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, alongside increasing globalization and imperial force, said film historian Samhita Sunya. An early example is Rudyard Kipling’s 1901 novel, “Kim,” which follows an Irish boy living in India during British rule, who eventually becomes a spy.
The book is an early indication of what spy novels, and later, the spy genre as a whole, grew to be: portrayals of larger, geopolitical fears. The genre then peaked during the Cold War era, Sunya said, amidst worries of nuclear catastrophe between the US and the former USSR.
As these tensions play out on the global stage, they also play out in popular media. “Dr. No,” the first James Bond movie, released in 1962, is a prime example. The titular Dr. No, who is part of the international terrorist group SPECTRE, is a half Chinese, half German nuclear scientist, eventually defeated by Bond.
“It was almost maintaining this balance of power, and this fear of third parties also going nuclear,” Sunya said. “And that included stateless organizations, as well as anxiety about China becoming a nuclear power.”
Now, we’re experiencing another peak in the espionage genre, Sunya said. In a world of artificial intelligence and the threat of disease following the global pandemic, similar anxieties are once again arising — and making their way into spy fiction.
Last year’s “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One” and “Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre” epitomize those modern fears. In both films, saving the world means defeating either a corrupt sentient AI or stopping an AI tool from being used for evil.
These movies were released during a year dominated by AI. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman appeared in front of a Senate panel calling for increased governmental regulation of the controversial technology, and the Biden administration launched an executive order aiming to address the associated risks.
These confounding anxieties, in real life and in the media, feed into each other. The lines between fiction and reality can start to blur.
“You’re seeing it in art forms like films and TV, or books. That’s making people more interested in these narratives. And then they’re hearing in the media, or from government sources, that there is a real risk as well,” said Julia Tatiana Bailey, an art historian and curator at the Rudolfinum Gallery in Prague. “It just feeds into this paranoia.”
Spy fiction isn’t all just sociopolitical underpinnings. These movies have become blockbusters for a reason. They are global escapades — see Italy’s grandiose Amalfi Coast and the bustle of Mumbai, India, in Christopher Nolan’s 2020 spy thriller “Tenet.”
Or let your eyes feast on the visual buffet that is Daniel Craig stalking the streets of Mexico City during a Day of the Dead parade in 2015’s “Spectre” — a 4-minute scene that alone has gathered almost 4 million views on YouTube. In 1996’s “Mission: Impossible,” some of the film’s most dramatic moments are backdropped by the cobblestone streets of the Czech Republic’s Prague.
Of course, there are also the gadgets, the cars, the sex, even the outfits — all of which lends a certain erotic thrill that has become synonymous with the genre, and contributed to its wide appeal.
In the 1960s, for example, Eurospy films — a genre of movies that emerged in Europe mimicking the Bond movies — became hugely popular in South Asia, Sunya said. Newspapers would advertise these movies as “adults only,” because of their association with this type of erotic spectacle. Still, these movies became so popular that other countries began developing their own spy films, too.
The genre, then, became its own universe, existing outside of the geopolitical context with which it plays. We romanticize spies and the glamor around them, enough to ignore the political tensions and nervous questions some stories raise.
Ultimately, most Americans don’t know much about what spies are actually doing, Bailey said. We know covert activity happens because, occasionally, it’s publicly revealed. Last year, for example, China claimed a CIA spy was embedded in the Chinese military. This activity could be all around us, existing beneath our everyday lives. That mystery is what makes espionage so appealing in fiction.
“We’re getting an insight through fiction into a world that we know is there, but we just have no other access to it,” Bailey said.
Spy fiction teeters along that line of knowing and unknowing. On one hand, those stories are made-up figments of the author’s imagination. On the other hand, there are clandestine activities happening behind the scenes — and that secrecy plays into our anxieties, too.
“There’s a lot of interesting questions to ask about what’s reality, and what’s our sense of reality, and who’s controlling us,” Bailey said. “And all these questions come through spy stories as well.”
Nowadays, the life of a spy is much less glamorous than what might be presented to us on our screens, Bailey said. Think less exciting car chases, more sitting at a desk looking up data.
But the image of spies running around chasing bad guys is a fun one. In espionage fiction, there’s a clear good guy and bad guy. The work itself is courageous and risky. Our protagonists become heroes, and we are their accomplices, trying to solve the problem of the day right alongside them.
Yet spy fiction and its ongoing popularity reveal how we use these stories to understand real-life issues, Sunya said.
“The forms and stories that that takes, even if extremely imaginative or exaggerated or spectacular, end up telling us something about how we’re trying to make sense of the real world in that moment,” she said.
Sure, there are sociopolitical reasons why certain spy movies and shows are made and popularized in specific moments. The genre can also expose our fears about our world, or our increasing distrust in governmental institutions.
Still, we’ll turn to espionage fiction and all its blockbuster charm. Who, after all, can resist a good story?"

The couple were caught having sex on August 22 while in the grounds of a shrine in Kesennuma –- a small coastal town about 500 kilometers (310 miles) north of Tokyo –- and faced charges of disrespecting a place of worship.
Police told CNN that they arrested the man, fearing he could be a flight risk, but did not arrest the woman after concluding there was no risk of her fleeing.

The man has since been released from custody, but the police said they could not disclose details of his punishment and did not clarify whether he was a tourist or a resident. These cases don’t always end in forced repatriation, the police added, and can result in a fine.
Although such a case is rare, there have been other instances of people being arrested for disrespecting Japanese shrines.
Last year, a 17-year-old Canadian was brought in for questioning for allegedly scratching the name “Julian” with his nail into a wooden pillar at a UNESCO-listed temple in the historic city of Nara, local police told CNN at the time.
“The boy admitted his act and says it was done not with the intent of harming Japanese culture,” a police official said.  “He is now with his parents, who were with him when the incident occurred.”
Meanwhile in 2010, famed photographer Kishin Shinoyama was charged with public indecency and disrespect for a religious site when he allegedly took nude photos at a public cemetery.

ZWJS8V8BHT_KOWQAKNQ7UE1LDM,"Hewlett Packard won’t drop its $4 billion UK claim against Mike Lynch, who died along with his daughter when his yacht sank",By The Associated Press,"2 minute read Published 9:28 AM EDT, Tue September 3, 2024",20240903,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/03/business/hewlett-packard-uk-claim-mike-lynch/,"London — Hewlett Packard Enterprise has said it won’t drop its UK claim for damages against the estate of British tech mogul Mike Lynch, who died when his superyacht sank last month.
Britain’s High Court in 2022 ruled mostly in favor of the US technology company, which accused Lynch and his former finance director of fraud over its $11 billion takeover of his software company Autonomy. Hewlett Packard is seeking up to $4 billion in damages and the judge is expected to issue a decision on the final sum soon.
Lynch’s widow, Angela Bacares, could now be liable for the damages. Lynch died when his yacht, the Bayesian, sank in a storm off Sicily on August 19.
Months before the sinking, Lynch was acquitted in a separate US criminal trial of fraud and conspiracy charges in the deal.
Hewlett Packard initially celebrated the costly acquisition of Lynch’s company in 2011 but quickly came to regret it. The company said in a statement Monday that it had “substantially succeeded” in its civil fraud claims against Lynch and Sushovan Hussain, the former finance director.

“It is HPE’s intention to follow the proceedings through to their conclusion.”
However, the judge in the UK civil case has already ruled that the amount payable in damages would be “substantially less” than the company is seeking.
A spokesperson for Lynch’s family declined to comment.
Lynch and his daughter Hannah were among six passengers who died when the 56-meter (184-foot) luxury yacht went down. One crew member, the boat’s chef, also died, while 15 people survived the disaster. They had gathered on the yacht to celebrate Lynch’s acquittal.
Officials initially said the yacht was struck by a tornado over the water, known as a waterspout, but the weather phenomenon was re-identified as a downburst. Prosecutors in Italy are investigating the captain on possible charges including manslaughter."
ZXWRTBC2AS_9BK960FVL8OGF1N,Ceasefire talks thrown into tumult after the discovery of six hostages slain in Gaza,"By Alex Marquardt and Lauren Izso, CNN","5 minute read Published 8:14 PM EDT, Sun September 1, 2024",20240902,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/09/01/politics/israel-hamas-ceasefire-talks-tumult-hostages/,"The Saturday discovery of the deaths of six hostages has thrown negotiations for a ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas into tumult, with the White House national security adviser saying that “the next few days will be critical” in the push to free those still held by Hamas.
National security adviser Jake Sullivan, in a virtual meeting Sunday, told the families of Americans held hostage that the administration will “work around the clock for a deal to secure the release of the remaining hostages,” according to a readout of the discussion released by the families.
American officials said the deaths of the hostages, who were seized by militants during Hamas’ October 7 attacks, would not cause the talks to be derailed. Instead, they described new urgency in coming to an agreement that would end the Israel-Hamas war and bring those remaining in captivity home.
Both the Israeli and American governments have scrambled to react after the Israeli military announced it had recovered the bodies of six slain hostages in Gaza. As protests against the Israeli government sweep across the country, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a statement accusing Hamas of killing the six individuals and saying the group is not serious about a ceasefire deal.
How the discussions will be affected will become apparent in the next day or two, a source with knowledge of the talks told CNN on Sunday.
The “situation is complicated,” the source said. Two weeks of in-person joint negotiations with the various parties in both Egypt and Qatar have ended, but the source said discussions continue through other channels.

In the meeting with hostage families, Sullivan discussed the “ongoing diplomatic push across the highest levels of the US government to drive toward a deal,” according to the White House.
Still, American officials acknowledged the deaths of the six hostages added a layer of complexity to an already difficult and painstaking process.
Hamas’ “seriousness” about a ceasefire deal must now be called into question, said a senior US official, who added that pressure is now also growing on Netanyahu.
US officials have voiced frustrated previously at what they regard as resistance on the part of Netanyahu in reaching a deal, leading to occasionally tense conversations between President Joe Biden and his Israeli counterpart.
Still, in their statements late Saturday, neither Biden nor Vice President Kamala Harris applied pressure — either explicit or implied — on Netanyahu to reach a deal. American officials were acutely aware that pressure would come from inside Israel itself.
Biden and Harris will meet in the Situation Room on Monday with the US team negotiating a deal, according to the White House.
At least three of the hostages killed — including Israeli-American Hersh Goldberg-Polin — had been expected to be released as part of the first part of a ceasefire agreement, Israeli officials and the senior US official told CNN. That means negotiators will now have to renegotiate the list of hostages who will be released in the first phase of the deal.
“US officials had been working on a final package together with Qatar and Egypt. The package included Hersh and a number of the hostages who were just executed. This calls into question Hamas’ seriousness about a deal, even as pressure also builds on Israel and Netanyahu personally,” the senior US official said Sunday.
After the bodies were discovered, Biden still expressed hopes for a ceasefire agreement, saying that negotiators were on the “verge of having an agreement” and that “it’s time this war ended.”
“We think we can close the deal, they’ve all said they agree on the principles,” he added.
But, in the aftermath of the discovery of the hostages, a potential path forward for the long-sought-after ceasefire agreement remains up in the air.
There was no breakthrough during recent in-person talks, the source familiar with the discussions said, but new ideas are going to be presented to Israel and Hamas.

The recent talks included senior-level meetings, as well as lower-level technical negotiations, in both Doha, Qatar, and Cairo, and CIA Director Bill Burns attended the discussions. The leaders of the mediating countries — the US, Qatar and Egypt — issued a joint statement on August 16, saying those talks were intended to “conclude” the following week.
Netanyahu, who faces increasing pressure from the Israeli public, met with the families of the hostages Sunday. He also released a tape message accusing Hamas of the “cold-blooded murder” of the six hostages and saying that “those who murder hostages do not want a deal.”
He added that the Israeli government and that he, personally, are “committed to continue working towards a deal that will bring back all our hostages and guarantee our security and existence.”
The prime minister said Israel would continue to pursue Hamas and accused it of not wanting to conduct genuine negotiations since December.
“Three months ago, on May 27, Israel agreed to a hostage release deal with the full backing of the United States. Hamas refused. Even after the United States updated the outline of the deal on August 16 — we agreed, and Hamas again refused.”
Anger is rising across Israel at Netanyahu specifically, and he is “worried” about the widespread protests sweeping the country, an Israeli official told CNN.
In what organizers later described as an “endless sea of protesters,” an outpouring of anger and grief swelled into mass demonstrations in Tel Aviv and beyond Sunday. While the protesters hold Hamas responsible for the death of hostages taken in the October 7 attacks, they also blame Netanyahu for his handling of the crisis, saying he has not done enough to secure a hostage-ceasefire deal.
The Hostages and Missing Families Forum has called for Israel to be brought to a “halt” over the news of the slain hostages and urged the country to pressure the government to sign a deal to free the remaining hostages before they are killed as well. The country’s largest labor union, meanwhile, has called for a nationwide strike, saying the “entire Israeli economy will shut down” Monday.
