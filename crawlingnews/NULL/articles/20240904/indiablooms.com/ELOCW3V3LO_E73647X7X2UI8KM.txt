A significant shift in sentiment is emerging as pro-India Sikhs, who form a substantial portion of the diaspora, push back against the divisive and disruptive activities of Khalistani elements, particularly those associated with the controversial group, Sikhs for Justice (SFJ).
The most recent flashpoint in this escalating tension occurred in Italy, where two prominent Gurudwara Committees—Gurudwara Singh Sabha (GSS) in Flero, Brescia, and Gurudwara Sri Kalgidhar Sahib (GSKS) in Torre de’ Picenardi, Cremona—found themselves at the center of a disturbing incident involving SFJ activists.
The committees had come under fire from SFJ for attending the Indian Independence Day celebrations at the Consulate General of India in Milan, an act seen by the radical group as a betrayal of the Khalistani cause.
SFJ activists Ranjit Singh aka Jitu Bhagat, and his brother Jaswant Singh, both based in the Cremona area, allegedly orchestrated a smear campaign against the committee members.
By circulating a video taken from the Consulate’s webpage and posting it online with derogatory comments, the SFJ aimed to intimidate and shame the Gurudwara officials who had participated in the Independence Day event. They asked a US national of Indian origin (https://www.tiktok.com/@bajwasingh3600) to post the video with nasty comments. However, the attempt backfired spectacularly.
Rather than cower under pressure, the Gurudwara Committees and the broader Sikh Sangat (community) responded with a unified and decisive stance. During a gathering on August 18, 2024, the Sangat condemned the actions of SFJ and the two brothers, and in a symbolic act of defiance, removed all furniture belonging to the brothers from the Gurudwara Sahib.
They went further, destroying all Khalistani banners and flags that had been placed in the Gurudwara by the SFJ sympathizers. This act was not merely a rejection of the SFJ’s ideology but a powerful assertion of the Sikh community’s alignment with a united India.
The incident in Italy is not isolated. Across the United States, Canada, and other parts of Europe, similar patterns are emerging. Pro-Khalistani rallies, which were once met with either apathy or muted resistance, are now encountering organized opposition from within the Sikh community.
During the August 15 Independence Day celebrations, pro-India Sikhs in several cities confronted and disrupted pro-Khalistan protests, signaling a growing weariness with the separatist rhetoric and a desire for harmony and stability.
This shift has profound implications. It underscores the growing disillusionment with SFJ’s methods, which often involve online harassment, intimidation, and the exploitation of Sikh religious sentiments for political ends.
The international Sikh community, deeply rooted in values of justice, peace, and mutual respect, is increasingly rejecting the divisive narratives propagated by Khalistani elements.
Moreover, the backlash against SFJ and other pro-Khalistani groups highlights the broader diaspora’s connection to India.
Many Sikhs abroad maintain strong ties to their homeland, where they have witnessed firsthand the economic growth, social progress, and efforts at reconciliation that have marked India’s recent history.
The idea of a Khalistan, once a rallying cry for a beleaguered minority, now seems out of step with the realities of a globally connected world where identity and allegiance are far more complex and intertwined.
The actions of the Gurudwara Committees in Italy serve as a potent reminder that the Sikh diaspora is not monolithic. While there will always be diverse perspectives within any community, the increasing resistance to Khalistani extremism signals a pivotal moment. Sikhs across the globe are asserting their identity not as pawns in a separatist agenda, but as proud members of a global community committed to peace, unity, and the betterment of all.
As the world watches, the message is clear: the days of Khalistani extremism dominating the discourse among the Sikh diaspora are waning. The growing chorus of voices opposing these radical elements, as seen in Italy, marks the beginning of a new chapter—one where the Sikh community can focus on building bridges, not walls, and where the true spirit of Sikhi can flourish unencumbered by the divisive politics of a select few.
